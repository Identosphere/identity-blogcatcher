I love API services. It still feels magical each time I query an endpoint and get back some interesting data or cause some complicated functionality to occur.

I&rsquo;ve built my entire career (and hobbies) around API services. I&rsquo;ve only ever had one job (which only lasted several months) that wasn&rsquo;t focused on building or working with API services for other developers. To say I am heavily invested in developer services would be an understatement; it&rsquo;s essentially all I do.'>The Only Type of API Services I'll Use</a>

A consequence of the time I spend in the world of electrons - motionless, more or less, except for my fingers and my eyes - is that protons tend to congregate around my waist.&nbsp; I try to fight this with exercise, but it's clear that I've got to cut down on the supply of these protons, too.

It has, as usual, been hot and cold here in Texas between the third Sunday of Advent and Epiphany.  You could literally have given yourself a heatstroke while jogging at noon on December 17 and frozen your tongue to a metal pole at noon the next day, if you didn't have much sense in any kind of weather.

To introduce the theme, I’ll point you to this recent bit of reporting by Amelia Tate of the New Statesman. Go ahead: click the link and read it. I’ll wait.

OK, you’re back?  That was pretty interesting, right?  What really caught my attention in Amelia’s story was this sentence:
