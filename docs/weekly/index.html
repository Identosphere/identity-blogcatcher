<p>SBI Sumishin Net Bank is an Internet-focused bank jointly established in 2007 by SBI Holdings and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. In keeping with their aim to be recognized for innovation, the bank deployed FIDO Authentication in July 2020. We had an interview with the bank about the details of their deployment.</p>



<p>Q. Describe your service and how it’s using FIDO Authentication.</p>



<p>We have incorporated&nbsp; FIDO-compliant authentication into our&nbsp; existing “SBI Sumishin Net Bank” mobile application. Now, a single application is available to provide both banking and authentication functions to our customers. This eliminates the need for our customers to enter passwords and verification codes for each transaction. Instead, they can simply log in to the SBI Sumishin Net Bank App with biometric authentication. Even when transactions are made from a PC or other non-mobile application environments, the application will confirm and approve the transaction details before they are executed, preventing unauthorized transfers. Furthermore, when using the login approval function, only the registered smartphone can remove any control, which prevents unauthorized logins.</p>



<p>Q. What FIDO specification(s) did you implement?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have deployed a solution based on FIDO UAF, which uses biometrics (fingerprint and facial recognition) and PIN as the authentication methods.</p>



<p>Q. What other approaches did you consider before choosing FIDO?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We looked at continuing with the existing smartphone application “Smart Authentication,” which is a separate application the customer would have to authenticate logins and bank transactions. However, we saw it as difficult to operate two applications separately and saw it as a burden for our customers to have to use two separate applications just to bank with us.</p>



<p>Q. Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>Although there are various types of authentication methods available, the fact that FIDO Authentication is a global standard developed by a global consortium FIDO Alliance, and that we have seen is increasingly being deployed in Japan and globally – were two factors that made it very appealing to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q. Why did you decide on a standards-based approach?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two main reasons why we chose to take a FIDO standards-based approach.</p>



<p>First, FIDO Authentication provides stronger security. FIDO Authentication enables safe exchange of authentication results over the network, and the credential is stored only on the device that performs the authentication (in our case, the smartphone) and does not need to be transmitted over the network or stored on the server side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, FIDO improves convenience for our customers. By incorporating authentication into our existing banking app, we are making it possible to complete both banking and authentication functions in a single app, enabling smooth transactions without having to enter passwords or other information.</p>



<p>Q. What steps were involved in your roll out of FIDO Authentication? Did you work with a partner?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We implemented the FIDO-compliant “SaAT Pokepass Authentication Service” provided by Net Move Corporation (“Net Move”), a wholly owned subsidiary of SBI Sumishin Net Bank. The new authentication function “Smart Authentication NEO” was deployed by incorporating the client SDK for this service into the bank application.</p>



<p>Q. What other data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



<p>On July 31, 2020, we launched a new authentication feature, “Smart Authentication NEO.” On the quantitative side, the number of new registered customers has reached approximately 100,000 in just three weeks since its launch, and we expect this number to increase further in the future.</p>



<p>On the qualitative side, many customers have commented on the convenience of being able to use a single app for both banking and authentication functions.</p>



<p>Q. What advice would you give to other organizations considering rolling out FIDO authentication?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, our company’s FIDO authentication uses Net Move’s “SaAT Pokepass Authentication Service.” By collaborating with Net Move, we were able to deployed the new authentication function “Smart Authentication NEO” in a short period of time.</p>



<p>In addition to FIDO authentication, Net Move already has an installed at more than 100 financial institutions, including “SaAT Netizen,” an anti-fraudulent remittance service, and we believe that Net Move can help to solve these issues.</p>



<p>Q. What role do you see FIDO Authentication playing for your company in the future?</p>



<p>The “Smart Authentication” service will be discontinued after January 2021, and we will move exclusively to the FIDO-enabled “Smart Authentication Neo” app. We see moving to the FIDO-enabled app&nbsp; as the key authentication function will further allow us to provide secure and convenient experiences for our customers.</p>



<p>Q. If you are able, please provide a quote from an executive regarding this deployment and the impact FIDO has had for your organization.</p>



<p>Quote from the project manager of SBI Sumishin Net Bank:</p>



<p>“Our goal is to revolutionize financial services and make society more comfortable and convenient by utilizing the most advanced technology with a customer-centric approach. Security is an extremely important factor in achieving this goal, and we believe that the introduction of FIDO will make a significant contribution.”</p>

<p>When teachers and students use Hypothesis annotation to explore course readings, certain benefits are immediately obvious. When students find one another in the margins of documents they tell us that the experience of reading is less lonely, which matters now more than ever. When teachers and students discuss key passages, their conversation — linked directly to highlights, displayed in the margin — is more focused than in conventional forums.<br><br>This experience of social reading can be delivered as an assignment in a learning management system (LMS). Students are expected to read a chapter of a book and make a prescribed number of substantive annotations; teachers grade the exercise. </p>



<p>Or it can happen less formally. A teacher, who may or may not operate in the context of an LMS, can use annotation to open a window into students’ minds, whether or not their annotations influence their grades.</p>



<p>All these scenarios produce data. The annotated corpus has, at its core, a set of documents. Annotation data explicitly records highlighted passages in documents along with the notes linked to those highlights. It also records conversations that flow from those annotated highlights<br><br>Teachers and students, as well as authors and publishers of course readings, can all learn useful things from this data. Teachers and students may want to know who has participated and how often, which are the most highlighted passages across all documents in the course, or which highlights have attracted the longest conversation threads. Authors and publishers will also want to know which passages have attracted the most highlights and discussion.</p>



<p> The annotation data can also support deeper analysis. How often do teachers or students ask questions? How often are questions answered, or not? How often do teachers ask questions answered by students, students ask questions answered by teachers, or students ask questions answered by students?</p>



<a href="https://jonudell.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/questions_and_answers_01-3.jpg"></a>Analysis of questions and answers



<p>We are providing these views now, on an experimental basis, in order to explore what learning analytics can become in the realm of annotated course reading. Surfacing questions asked by students and answered by students, for example, could be a way to measure the sort of peer interaction that research suggests can improve engagement and outcomes.<br><br>Of course the devil is always in the details. Our initial naive approach looks for question marks in annotations, then correlates responses to those annotations. This is convenient because it works with natural discourse, but imprecise because questions are often rhetorical. <br><br>A less convenient but more precise approach would require participants to signal intent using an inline hashtag, or a formal tag on the annotation. <br><br>A convenient and precise approach would bake affordances into the annotation tool. For example, there might be reaction icons to say things like:<br><br>– I’m asking a question that expects an answer<br><br>– I’m confused on this point<br><br>– I’m highlighting an example of a rhetorical device<br><br>In my view we can’t know, a priori, what those baked-in affordances should be. We’ll need to discover them in collaboration with teachers who are using Hypothesis in their courses, and who are willing and able to explore these ideas before they can be fully codified in software. <br><br>If you’re a teacher using Hypothesis actively this term, and you’d like to participate in this research, please <a href="mailto:judell@hypothes.is">let us know</a>. We’ll invite you to try our prototype analytics system and help us evolve it. </p>

<p>This week we welcomed the September campaign for special NFT medals, where users can bring home the corresponding Wing NFT medal or Flamingo NFT medal. Furthermore, Ontology continued performance tests with bloXroute, reaping achievements that include the case study on bloXroute’s value for DeFi applications such as Uniswap.

Wing had a promising start with a high TVL and APY, but the value of the WING token will be more visible to community members as it grows as a governance token. The Wing team will continue to take into account the community’s feedback to further improve the governance rules, simplify the process for member governance participation, perfect the governance protocol and enable the protocol to be applied to more scenarios.</p><p>- Ontology continued performance tests with bloXroute.

For DeFi to grow out of the current swamp, more types of assets need to be introduced to DeFi platforms, and the credit mechanism needs to be incorporated into the DeFi field to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and traditional finance.”</p><p>- On September 26 and 28 respectively, Jun LI was invited by Suanli Think-tank, a platform dedicated to the digital economy, on two occasions to elaborate on how to design an innovative DeFi platform based on credit and to brief the audience about “Super Oracle” and how oracles, as bridges in the data world, would connect on-chain assets with the real&nbsp;world.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-october-1-8-c21989f916e4">Ontology Weekly Report (October 1–8)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Our new Rad Mini got delivered today! It looks cute and small compared to my Rad Runner, plus a few upgrades: it has gears and a bike computer screen, and an improved front light vs the Run 

 This will primarily be Rachael’s bike, but I’ll borrow it on occasion ;)

<p>Webinar: Optimizing supplier onboarding assessment processes through SSI</p>



<p>In this presentation, Luigi Riva, head of product for Swisscom Blockchain, will show a solution for supplier assessment and onboarding. This process can be optimized using Self-Sovereign Identity capabilities. In the course of supplier assessment processes, suppliers need to disclose their audits, policies and operative processes, so that their customers are capable to analyze and assess the supplier risk through a validation of the supplier compliance data. Through the standardization of supplier onboarding processes and using SSI, the Swisscom solution allows suppliers to transport data and their customers can easily validate and trust the authenticity of it.</p>



<p>Tune on Wednesday, October 14, at 10:00 am EDT. For more information and to register, go <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-member-webinar-optimizing-supplier-onboarding-assessment-processes-through-ssi-swisscom">here</a>.</p>

   I released Datasette 0.50 this morning, with a new user-facing column actions menu feature and a way for plugins to make internal HTTP requests to consume the JSON API of their parent Datasette instance.

  <p>I released <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50">Datasette 0.50</a> this morning, with a new user-facing column actions menu feature and a way for plugins to make internal HTTP requests to consume the JSON API of their parent Datasette instance.</p>
 The column actions menu 
<blockquote cite="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50"><p>The key new feature in this release is the column actions menu on the table page (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/891">#891</a>). This can be used to sort a column in ascending or descending order, facet data by that column or filter the table to just rows that have a value for that column.</p></blockquote>
<p>The table page is the most important page within Datasette: it's where users interact with database tables.</p>
<p>Prior to 0.50 users could sort those tables by clicking on the column header. If they wanted to sort in descending order they had to click it, wait for the table to reload and then click it a second time.</p>
<p>In 0.50 I've introduced a new UI element which I'm calling the column actions menu. Here's an animation showing it in action on the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable">facetable</a> demo table:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Right now the menu can be used to sort ascending, sort descending or add the column to the current set of select facets. If a column has any blank values on the current page a menu option to "Show not-blank rows" appears too - you can try that out on the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/sortable">sortable</a> table.</p>
<p>I plan to extend this with more options in the future. I'd also like to make it a documented plugin extension point, so plugins can add their own column-specific actions. I need to figure out a JavaScript equivalent of the Python pluggy plugins mechanism first though, see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/983">issue 983</a>.</p>
 datasette.client 
<blockquote cite="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50"><p>Plugin authors can use the new <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/internals.html#internals-datasette-client">datasette.client</a> object to make internal HTTP requests from their plugins, allowing them to make use of Datasette's JSON API. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/943">#943</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>In building the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-graphql">datasette-graphql</a> plugin I ran into an interesting requirement. I wanted to provide efficient <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Oct/4/datasette-ideas/#Keyset_pagination">keyset pagination</a> within the GraphQL schema, which is actually quite a complex things to implement.</p>
<p>Datasette already has a robust implementation of keyset pagination, but it's tangled up in the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/blob/0.50/datasette/views/table.py#L742-L770">the internal TableView class</a>.</p>
<p>It's not available as a documented, stable Python API... but it IS available via the Datasette JSON API.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if Datasette plugins could make direct calls to the same externally facing, documented HTTP JSON API that Datasette itself exposes to end users?</p>
<p>That's what the new <code>datasette.client</code> object does. It's a thin wrapper around <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/async/">HTTPX AsyncClient</a> (the excellent new Python HTTP library which takes the Requests API and makes it fully asyncio compliant) which dispatches requests internally to Datasette's ASGI application, without any of the network overhead of an external HTTP request.</p>
<p>One of my goals for Datasette 1.0 is to bring the externally facing JSON API to full, documented, stable status.</p>
<p>The idea of Python plugins being able to efficiently use that same API feels really elegant to me. I'm looking forward to taking advantage of this in my own plugins.</p>

 Deploying Datasette documentation 
<blockquote cite="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-50"><p>New <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying">Deploying Datasette</a> documentation with guides for deploying Datasette on a Linux server <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-systemd">using systemd</a> or to hosting providers <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/deploying.html#deploying-buildpacks">that support buildpacks</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/514">#514</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/997">#997</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>The buildpack documenation was inspired by <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/digitalocean_datasette-on-digitalocean-app-platform.md">my experiments</a> with the new <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/">DigitialOcean App Platform</a> this week. App Platform is a Heroku-style PaaS hosting platform that implements the <a href="https://buildpacks.io/">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a> standard which emerged based on Heroku's architecture a few years ago.</p>

<p>I hadn't realized quite how easy it is to run a custom Python application (such as Datasette) using buildpacks - it's literally just a GitHub repository with two single-line files in it, requirements.txt and Procfile - the buildpacks mechanism detects the requirements.txt and configures a Python environment automatically.</p>

<p>I deployed my new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/buildpack-datasette-demo">simonw/buildpack-datasette-demo</a> repo on DigitalOcean, Heroku and <a href="https://scalingo.com/">Scalingo</a> to try this out. It worked on all three providers with no changes - and all three offer continuous deployment against GitHub where any changes to that repository automatically trigger a deployment (optionally guarded by a CI test suite).</p>

<p>Since I was creating a deployment documenatation page I decided to finally address <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/514">issue 514</a> and document how I've used systemd to deploy Datasette on some of my own projects. I'm very keen to hear from people who try out this recipe so I can continue to improve it over time.</p>
<p>This is part of a series: see also the annotated release notes for Datasette <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jun/12/annotated-release-notes/">0.44</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/1/datasette-045/">0.45</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/15/datasette-0-49/">0.49</a>.</p>

WSO2 is the only 100% open source IAM vendor in the Forrester CIAM Wave&nbsp;2020.  In the order of the aggregated scores (50% on current product offering + 50% on product strategy), Identity Server is placed 5th out of&nbsp;13.  Under the current product offering category WSO2 Identity Server obtained the highest scores (5/5) in customer authentication, business systems integration, data orchestration &amp; user management, customer self-service, reporting &amp; dashboarding, privacy &amp; consent management, number of brands, and static &amp; contextual documentation.  Under the strategy category WSO2 Identity Server obtained the highest scores (5/5) in authentication plans, data orchestration &amp; user management, and commercial models.  <p>Not all the IAM vendors are included in the CIAM Forrester Wave. Forrester considered following four points in picking the 13 vendors included in the&nbsp;report.</p>  A thought-leading, productized portfolio of products and services.  Annual CIAM revenues of at least $4 million with at least 9.5%&nbsp;growth.  Mindshare with Forrester’s end user customers.  Mindshare with&nbsp;vendors.  <p>WSO2 Identity Server itself generates US $10M+ in revenue, with 700+ global customers (direct and OEM), and 1000+ open source deployments, and has a strong open source community with 650+ members in it is <a href="http://bit.ly/wso2isslack">Slack</a>&nbsp;channel.</p><p>This is the second Forrester CIAM Wave (the 1st one was in 2017), and its glad to see that we are well-positioned as a strong performer, in the very first CIAM Wave we participated in. Beyond that, we are more than happy — we could bring in open source into the industry’s one of the most prestigious analyst&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Forrester was tough in their evaluation. It took almost 250 pages to answer the enter questionnaire shared with us by Forrester, which was then followed by a non-stop 3hr demo with multiple integration use cases with many third party systems. On top of that, we only had two weeks to prepare everything — and add to it, the entire team was working from home due to COVID-19.

We integrated the product with 20+ systems, and also demoed strong and adaptive authentication capabilities. Glad, we could show what we have and pass the right message, and Forrester rated us with highest scores for customer authentication, business systems integration, data orchestration &amp; user management, customer self-service, reporting &amp; dashboarding, privacy &amp; consent management, number of brands, and static &amp; contextual documentation.</p><p>In case you hear about WSO2 Identity Server for the first time, let me briefly share some&nbsp;history.</p><p><a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/wso2-identity-server-6570bf4d57c9">WSO2 Identity Server</a></p><p>The product started in 2007 as an open source project under the Apache 2.0 license. We did the Identity Server 1.0 release in December 2007. It was just after 6 weeks since I joined WSO2, and <a href="https://medium.com/u/d4f352a99d80">Ruchith Fernando</a> was leading the product (and Ruchith left for higher studies in July 2008). Since the very 1st version of the product, I was fortunate to be part of the Identity Server team to see (with great pleasure) how it grew from a 4 to 100+ team, 0 to 700+ customers, 0 to 1000+ open source deployments, 0 to $10M+ in revenue and also, from being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Card</a> provider to a comprehensive CIAM offering!</p><p>It was an awesome journey, but still, the best part yet to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Now we are extensively working on something big to be announced early next year.

  <p>Git scraping is the name I've given a scraping technique that I've been experimenting with for a few years now. It's really effective, and more people should use it.</p>
<p>The internet is full of interesting data that changes over time. These changes can sometimes be more interesting than the underlying static data - The <a href="https://twitter.com/nyt_diff">@nyt_diff Twitter account</a> tracks changes made to New York Times headlines for example, which offers a fascinating insight into that publication's editorial process.</p>
<p>We already have a great tool for efficiently tracking changes to text over time: Git. And <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> (and other CI systems) make it easy to create a scraper that runs every few minutes, records the current state of a resource and records changes to that resource over time in the commit history.</p>
<p>Here's a recent example. Fires continue to rage in California, and the <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/">CAL FIRE website</a> offers an <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/">incident map</a> showing the latest fire activity around the state.</p>
<p>Firing up the Firefox Network pane, filtering to requests triggered by XHR and sorting by size, largest first reveals this endpoint:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents">https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents</a></p>
<p>That's a 241KB JSON endpoints with full details of the various fires around the state.</p>
<p>So... I started running a git scraper against it. My scraper lives in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history">simonw/ca-fires-history</a> repository on GitHub.</p>
<p>Every 20 minutes it grabs the latest copy of that JSON endpoint, pretty-prints it (for diff readability) using <code>jq</code> and commits it back to the repo if it has changed.</p>
<p>This means I now have a <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/commits/main">commit log</a> of changes to that information about fires in California. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/commit/7b0f42d4bf198885ab2b41a22a8da47157572d18">example commit</a> showing that last night the Zogg Fires percentage contained increased from 90% to 92%, the number of personnel involved dropped from 968 to 798 and the number of engines responding dropped from 82 to 59.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The implementation of the scraper is entirely contained in a single GitHub Actions workflow. It's in a file called <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/scrape.yml">.github/workflows/scrape.yml</a> which looks like this:</p>
  name: Scrape latest data

on:
  push:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '6,26,46 * * * *'

jobs:
  scheduled:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out this repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Fetch latest data
      run: |-
        curl https://www.fire.ca.gov/umbraco/Api/IncidentApi/GetIncidents | jq . &gt; incidents.json
    - name: Commit and push if it changed
      run: |-
        git config user.name "Automated"
        git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"
        git add -A
        timestamp=$(date -u)
        git commit -m "Latest data: ${timestamp}" || exit 0
        git push  
<p>That's not a lot of code!</p>
<p>It runs on a schedule at 6, 26 and 46 minutes past the hour - I like to offset my cron times like this since I assume that the majority of crons run exactly on the hour, so running not-on-the-hour feels polite.</p>
<p>The scraper itself works by fetching the JSON using <code>curl</code>, piping it through <code>jq .</code> to pretty-print it and saving the result to <code>incidents.json</code>.</p>
<p>The "commit and push if it changed" block uses a pattern that commits and pushes only if the file has changed. I wrote about this pattern in <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/github-actions_commit-if-file-changed.md">this TIL</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>I have a whole bunch of repositories running git scrapers now. I've been labeling them with the <a href="https://github.com/topics/git-scraping">git-scraping topic</a> so they show up in one place on GitHub (other people have started using that topic as well).</p>
<p>I've written about some of these <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/gitscraping/">in the past</a>:</p>
 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Sep/10/scraping-irma/">Scraping hurricane Irma</a> back in September 2017 is when I first came up with the idea to use a Git repository in this way. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2017/Oct/10/fires-in-the-north-bay/">Changelogs to help understand the fires in the North Bay</a> from October 2017 describes an early attempt at scraping fire-related information. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Mar/13/tree-history/">Generating a commit log for San Francisco’s official list of trees</a> remains my favourite application of this technique. The City of San Francisco maintains a frequently updated CSV file of 190,000 trees in the city, and I have <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sf-tree-history/find/master">a commit log</a> of changes to it stretching back over more than a year. This example uses my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff">csv-diff</a> utility to generate human-readable commit messages. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Oct/10/pge-outages/">Tracking PG&amp;E outages by scraping to a git repo</a> documents my attempts to track the impact of PG&amp;E's outages last year by scraping their outage map. I used the GitPython library to turn the values recorded in the commit history into a database that let me run visualizations of changes over time. 
 
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jan/21/github-actions-cloud-run/">Tracking FARA by deploying a data API using GitHub Actions and Cloud Run</a> shows how I track new registrations for the US Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) in a repository and deploy the latest version of the data using Datasette. 
 
<p>I hope that by giving this technique a name I can encourage more people to add it to their toolbox. It's an extremely effective way of turning all sorts of interesting data sources into a changelog over time.</p>

<p></p><p>In California, anyone can put an initiative on the ballot that amends the state constitution, proposes a bond measure, or even changes legislation - as long as you <a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/how-qualify-initiative">acquire the minimum number of signatures of support</a>. As a result, there are always an eclectic set of propositions on every California statewide ballot. <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_2020_ballot_propositions">This year, there are twelve</a>.</p><p>Particularly because there are a few ballot initiatives this year that touch on my areas of expertise, I thought it might be useful to discuss how I'm thinking about each one in public. This is one progressive technologist's voter guide; if you have alternative opinions, I'd love to hear them.</p> Proposition 14 - Yes <p>A "yes" vote authorizes $5.5 billion in bonds earmarked for stem cell research in the state, extending previous funding that was created by an initiative in 2004.</p><p>Critics say that the original initiative was created when there was a ban on federal stem cell research, and this has now outlived its usefulness. I disagree. The existing funding was mostly used across UC campuses, including UCSF, and has funded ground-breaking research and treatments, including for spina bifida and Parkinson's disease.</p><p>UCSF is one of the most important medical research institutions in the world, and I believe we should continue to allow this funding.</p> Proposition 15 - Yes <p>A "yes" vote increases funding for schools, public colleges, and local government services by increasing taxes on certain kinds of commercial and industrial property. The taxes are limited in scope and will mostly be paid by large, wealthy corporations, while providing tax exemptions for small businesses. This seems like a broadly positive amendment.</p> Proposition 16 - Yes <p>In 1996, affirmative action when hiring for public employment, public education, and public contracting was banned through another state proposition. This ballot initiative repeals that rule and allows diversity to be considered in the hiring process.</p><p>If this proposition passes, the state will be clear to start enacting affirmative action and diversity-based hiring initiatives, helping to make public positions more representative of the population.</p> Proposition 17 - Yes <p>Currently, people on parole for felony convictions don't have the right to vote. This constitutional amendment would give them that ability by restoring the right to vote once their prison term has been completed.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_disenfranchisement_in_the_United_States">Felony disenfranchisement</a> is one of the most shameful aspects of criminal justice in the United States, which disproportionately affects marginalized people. The right to vote is a crucial part of any democracy. 19 other states return this right once a prison sentence is completed; we should do the same.</p> Proposition 18 - Yes <p>If you're going to be 18 at the time of an election, and therefore can vote in it, but you're only 17 at the time of the primary, this amendment would let you vote in the primary.</p><p>Without this amendment, 18 year olds effectively only get to participate in half of the election. I'm in favor.</p> Proposition 19 - No <p>This amendment would allow residents over 55, with disabilities, or who had to flee natural disasters to transfer their property tax assessments to more expensive properties three times. It also prevents these beneficial tax assessments from being carried over to inherited properties (either from parents or grandparents) when the inheritor doesn't use it as their primary residence.</p><p>On one hand, I'm in favor of closing the inheritance loophole, which disproportionately benefits wealthy families. I also want to help the over 55s, people with disabilities, and victims of natural disasters.</p><p>On the other, it's sponsored by realtor associations. For them, it's a cash windfall. It has the side effect of persisting existing inequalities. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-17/vote-no-on-proposition-19">As the Los Angeles Times editorial board says</a>: "Proposition 19 would just expand the inequities in California’s property tax system. It would grossly benefit those who were lucky enough to buy a home years ago and hold onto it as values skyrocketed. It would give them a huge tax break and greater buying power in an already expensive real estate market. It would skew tax breaks further away from people who don’t own a home or who may be struggling to buy one."</p><p>On balance, I'm voting "no".</p> Proposition 20 - No <p>This state statute adds crimes to the list for which early parole is restricted - and removes the incentive to join rehabilitation programs, which is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. My vote is a hard "no".</p> Proposition 21 - Yes <p>This would allow local government to impose rent control on buildings that were first occupied 15 years ago, except when it's owned by a landlord that owns no more than two buildings in total. In other words, small, independent landlords are not affected; large private sector builders are.</p><p>Contrary to a recently-popular narrative, <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/11/rent-control-housing-crisis-affordability-supply">rent control works</a>. It doesn't constrain housing supply and it helps keep rents low, allowing a significant percentage of families to remain in their homes where it is enacted. It protects lower-income people. And it makes our cities more diverse.</p> Proposition 22 - No <p>Uber has spent $50 million to promote this statute; Lyft has spent $48 million; DoorDash $47 million; Instacart $27 million; Postmates $10 million. Allowing their gig workers to be classified as private contractors protects their businesses.</p><p>That's because their businesses heavily depend on paying gig workers poverty pay with no benefits.</p><p>Labor rights were hard-won. At a time when more people are struggling, it's absurd to allow this kind of backslide. In addition to removing protections that these workers are entitled to by law, proposition 22 would also remove their right to organize.</p><p>If a business can only succeed because it treats people badly, it's a bad business. Hard pass.</p> Proposition 23 - No <p>If this statute passes, dialysis clinics will need to have an attending physician or nurse practitioner. They will also need to report information about infections, and won't be able to turn people away based on type of insurance.</p><p>I care deeply about the state of dialysis centers. Three times a week, my mother spends half her day in one. She reports that the staff want to unionize, but are afraid to. They're underpaid and overworked. One of her dialysis technicians lives in a tent.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>I heavily support unionization of dialysis centers. I would support a statute that mandated reporting of infection data. I support not being able to turn people away because of insurance. But I can't back the physician requirement. Despite sounding good, it wouldn't actually result in a meaningful increase to the quality of care.</p><p>Worse than that, it appears to be a tactic by the healthcare workers' union to <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Vote-no-on-Prop-23-a-rehash-of-ugly-15544239.php">blackmail dialysis companies into accepting unionization</a>. Unionization is important and could really help these workers! But using the state initiative system as a pressure tactic is an unfortunate tactic. I'm voting "no".</p> Proposition 24 - No <p>Privacy is core to a free society. We have accidentally built a global surveillance apparatus as part of building business models that depend on building detailed profiles on each one of us. In the wake of Europe's GDPR, which forced tech companies worldwide to change their practices, California passed the CCPA. It's a great step forward that will be joined by other state laws, and ultimately form the basis of federal protections.</p><p>In contrast, this statute is fundamentally disingenuous. In the guise of increasing protections, it actually makes exemptions and cuts out requirements for companies like Facebook. <a href="https://calmatters.org/commentary/my-turn/2020/08/personal-information-measure-on-the-ballot-would-allow-redlining-and-hurt-small-businesses-of-color/">It creates a loophole for credit agencies.</a> It allows for digital redlining, allowing credit agencies and assessors to penalize people of color. And it allows privacy to be demoted to an add-on paid-for service tier, rather than a core right that everyone can enjoy.</p><p>For me, perhaps the most important changes are jurisdictional. Currently, the CCPA applies to any Californian resident, wherever they happen to be. Proposition 24 erodes this protection and allows privacy to be violated as soon as the resident physically leaves the state. It also removes the ability for you to tell your web browser to let every site know not to sell your data; under Prop 24, you would need to manually let every site know.</p><p>I can't endorse it or vote for it.</p> Proposition 25 - No <p>Cash bail is discriminatory. American judges are <a href="https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2018/08/17/the_bail_system_is_racist_and_unjust_it_needs_to_be_reformed_110764.html">set higher bail amounts for Black individuals</a>, despite their being more likely to come from lower-income backgrounds, meaning they are far more likely to serve pretrial time. Cash bail must go.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's just one symptom of a system that is, in itself, discriminatory. It's not enough to remove cash bail; we also have to make sure it's replaced by a system that also removes the underlying systemic discrimination. The cash requirement is a problem, but our racist criminal justice system is the underlying tragedy.</p><p>For people who don't understand it, software can seem like a magically unbiased system. It's a computer, after all, which doesn't hold its own opinions. How can it possibly be biased?</p><p>Of course, software is written by people, and is a reflection of their biases, beliefs, and blind spots. Additionally, machine learning as popularly implemented is an algorithm that depends on an enormous corpus of information about choices that humans have made in the past. The machine simply extrapolates and makes new decisions based on those choices. It's as biased as the data is - and if that data comes from our criminal justice system, it's very biased indeed.</p><p>So replacing cash bail with a predictive algorithm isn't just a bad idea - it's a spectacularly harmful one that entrenches racist biases in a way that makes them beyond reproach.</p><p>Software must never make judicial decisions. The truth is, it can't: the decisions are instead made with impunity by the people who write it, often unscrutinized, and by the people who are responsible for the underlying data.</p><p>Proposition 25 must not be allowed to pass, and all measures and legislation like it must be soundly defeated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tiffanytertipes?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Tiffany Tertipes</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/vote?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of the Digital Technology Supercluster?</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU0HuZLGSuU&amp;feature=youtu.be">Digital Technology Supercluster </a>solves some of industry’s and society’s biggest problems through Canadian-made technologies. We bring together private and public sector organizations of all sizes to address challenges facing Canada’s economic sectors including healthcare, natural resources, manufacturing and transportation. Through this ‘collaborative innovation’ the Supercluster helps to drive solutions better than any single organization could on its own.</p>



 <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/"></a> 



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets? </p>



<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, now more than ever we are relying on our ability to prove our identity and key personal information remotely. Over the past six months, we have worked with dozens of organizations to develop and deploy cutting-edge digital and virtual health platforms. A critical requirement to ensure uptake of these developments is ensuring that Canadians feel they are in control of their personal data and have trust in the institutions and protocols we have created.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does the Digital Technology Supercluster address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>For the Digital Technology Supercluster, we see digital identity as a key component in the adoption of our many innovative technologies – whether it’s accessing remote addiction and mental health treatment for health care workers, or receiving post-surgical treatment from home. Without secure digital identity, Canada will be unable to continue developing innovative solutions like these. As a team, we strive to collaborate with companies (large and small), organizations and academic institutions to ensure that we are addressing digital security from all sides. Ensuring privacy and control of personal information is at the heart of what we do, and organizations like DIACC provide critical guidance on this front.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada is already seen as a leader in the global economy. We are known for our transparency, ethical business practices and diverse resources. This foundation puts us on solid ground for not only contributing to the policy of digital identity, but alongside DIACC, leading the way on international interoperability in this space.</p>



<p>5. Why did the Digital Technology Supercluster join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We believe there is power in coming together towards a common goal, and that there is strength in bringing different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds to the table. To reach Canada’s full potential, it is critical that we leverage our diversity and unique strengths to share knowledge and expertise.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about the Digital Technology Supercluster?</p>



<p>While we are located in Vancouver, British Columbia, our members span across the country, with 40 per cent of our 750+ membership in provinces outside of British Columbia. We are open to working with all types of organizations. By facilitating bold collaboration, we bring together companies of all sizes from a myriad of sectors within the tech ecosystem and tech-enabled companies from a variety of industries. This allows these organizations to tap into a network of knowledge and experience they would not otherwise have had access to.</p>

   Are we stuck with Surveillance Capitalism?
I hope not. 
 But what are realistic alternatives? Alternatives that keep the amazing wonders that are
consumer technologies in 2020, but don’t invade our privacy, don’t spread misinformation, give us back
a measure of control over our electronic lives, don’t set us up for manipulation and
help rather than hurt our mental health? 
 Here are three scenario

  <p>Are we stuck with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Surveillance_Capitalism">Surveillance Capitalism</a>?
I hope not.</p>
<p>But what are realistic alternatives? Alternatives that keep the amazing wonders that are
consumer technologies in 2020, but don’t invade our privacy, don’t spread misinformation, give us back
a measure of control over our electronic lives, don’t set us up for manipulation and
help rather than hurt our mental health?</p>
<p>Here are three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_planning">scenarios</a> how we could get
out.</p>
 Scenario 1: Regulation Bites 
<p>Building on the success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
and buoyed by a growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_sovereignty">data sovereignty movement</a>
supported by the political right and left, the European Union intensifies regulating
cyberspace, and in short order:</p>
 
 disallows all businesses to move any personal information pertaining to its residents
to data centers outside of the European Union; 
 broadly disallows user tracking except for very narrow circumstances; in particular,
cross-site and cross-app user tracking becomes prohibited; advertising networks cannot
target audiences smaller than 100,000 members any more; 
 requires all social and communications apps to implement full data portability
(including loss-less transmission to a new provider) similar to phone number portability. 
 
<p>The dominant, American social networking giants focus their efforts in the courts to roll
back these regulations, but in the meantime, nimble European upstarts simply copy the feature
sets of the dominant platforms and implement them consistent with European regulations.
Local politicians mention these apps at every opportunity.</p>
<p>By marketing their products through schools, privacy-conscious German parents switch over
an entire new generation of users to the European apps, and when e-government initiatives
enable citizens to much more easily and securely interact with governments through the new apps,
the network effect starts hurting instead of favoring the American surveillance platforms.</p>
<p>As integration has become easy, a European startup figures out how to game-ify fact checking on this
new open platform, and on-line misinformation drops rapidly. This increases user engagement
and user confidence, and few people ever want to go back to the old apps.</p>
<p>Other countries outside the EU concerned about data sovereignty have been watching
carefully and quickly follow the European model, through regulation and targeted industrial
policy. Facebook and friends are playing catch-up and are forced to play by the new rules
to keep at least some of their user base in those countries.</p>
<p>And when they started to market their apps internationally, even large swathes of the
American population moved over, because they don’t want to be surveilled either.</p>
 Scenario 2: A Global Disinvestment Campaign Leads to a Vibrant Good Technology Market 
<p>With the slogan “Facebook is just as bad as burning oil”, digital rights activists
have partnered with veterans of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divestment#Divestment_for_social_goals">divestiture campaigns</a>
against South African apartheid, tobacco and fossil fuels for an international
public relations campaign targeting investment and retirement funds that invest in
companies monetizing surveillance.</p>
<p>Being reminded of the impact of previous disinvestment campaigns and sensing a business
opportunity, fund managers globally are rapidly rolling out new niche funds that promise
to only invest in companies that use personal data responsibly. Their initial target markets
are minorities and parents saving for retirement who are concerned about their kids’ safety
when using technology.</p>
<p>Upstart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital">VCs</a> jump on the opportunity that
this new, focused capital represents and funnel it via special-purpose “Good Tech Only” venture
funds to eager entrepreneurs world-wide to build next-generation social networking,
commerce and virtual/augmented reality companies, without fear that VCs will pressure them
to monetize customer data anyway when the company hits a difficult patch.</p>
<p>Having made a clean break from the surveillance business model, these upstarts are able
to innovate rapidly both on business model and technology. For example, enabled by new
business models, interoperability with other vendors has now become a value driver rather
than a leak in the enterprise’ <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicmoat.asp">moat</a>.
This completely changes the dynamics of the marketplace.</p>
<p>As a result, entirely new product categories no longer prevented by vendors’ data hoarding
strategies explode on the scene, including, for example, much better targeted advertising
because users can volunteer personal data without fear of privacy violations, proactive
maintenance of consumer products by an army of service providers no longer inhibited by
hermetically sealed
<a href="https://upon2020.com/blog/2015/03/lets-create-the-internet-of-our-own-things-indieiot/">cloud castle</a>
products, and far more reuse and upcycle of previously discarded products.</p>
<p>As the Good Tech brand rises, and unprecedented features become available, more and more
technology users are willing to make a clean break with surveillance legacy platforms,
and shame their friends to move from the legacy social networks into moving to Good Tech as well.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the legacy vendors practicing surveillance capital face shrinking users bases,
less access to capital, and structurally cannot compete with the new generation of
Good Tech companies.</p>
 Scenario 3: Frustrated Users and Open-Source Developers Start Cooperating for Mutual Benefit 
<p>It started small, with a few technically-competent digital rights activists pooling
their expertise and a little bit of money to operate their own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> server, so they could stay
in touch just like on Twitter, but without an unaccountable third party in the loop.
(Note: this, of course, already <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">has happened</a>; there are many
Mastodon deployments like this all around the world, some of which have already progressed
further along the lines outlined below.)</p>
<p>As interest and user numbers grew, the previously informal collaborations started to be
formalized: users not contributing their labor would pay a monthly fee, from which systems
administrators would be paid to keep the deployment up and running reliably. Over time,
the initial collaborative decision making process for the project
morphed into a formal cooperative governance structure in which all stakeholders –
users and maintainers – have equal rights. They decided on all matters affecting the
project democratically, although different cooperatives employ different styles of
governance including direct, liquid and representative democracy.</p>
<p>Soon users started to ask for additional tools provided to them in a similar manner,
like document sharing, calendaring, e-mail, and more. Accountants would ask: “Microsoft
charges me $6.99 per month to access Excel. If I pay the same amount to the coop, can’t
we host something like Excel ourselves, and I can be certain that my clients’ financials
stay private instead of whatever Microsoft does?” Some other users in the coop declared
that they had similar needs, and banded together, money in hand, to fund a project.
Which attracted open-source software developers who committed to porting open-source
collaborative document editing software into the cooperative’s environment and keep it
maintained for a monthly fee paid for by its users.</p>
<p>Of course, the apps operated by the various cooperatives always interoperated, because that’s
what users want and no vendor subject to the coop’s rules has the opportunity (or desire)
to lock in anybody. So leaving one cooperative to join another became as simple as moving
banks today, with no money or data lost in the process.</p>
<p>Some projects didn’t work out. Some money was wasted. Some coops imploded. Some users left
because initially, the quality of the coops’ products was below the quality of social
networking products of today’s dominant internet platforms funded by billions of Wall Street
dollars. However, because the cooperative structure
relates the needs and wants of the users directly to the revenue opportunity of the vendors,
with no independent shareholders to satisfy, ultimately the match between needs and
features became much better than in pure capitalistic for-profit models, creating legions
of fanatically happy users and profitable vendors completely outside the need or desire
for surveillance capitalism.</p>
 Some final thoughts 
<p>Of course, there are other scenarios; elements of these scenarios could be combined in
different ways or shake out differently, and predictions are hard, particularly about
the future :-)</p>
<p>But there are people working on each of those scenarios today (myself included!), and it
is not obvious to me that those projects are doomed. In other words, they have promise!
How can we help them be more likely to succeed? Because I want out from surveillance
capitalism, and chances are, you do, too!</p>

<p>Okta is an Identity and Access Management platform. The TL;DR: you offload the responsibility for secure authentication and authorization to Okta so you can focus on the business logic of the app you’re building.</p>

<p>Okta and Spring Boot already go together like peanut butter and chocolate. Add in feature flags care of <a href="https://split.io">Split</a>, and you can test new capabilities for your app without having to redeploy. That’s testing in production the smart way! And, you can leverage Okta’s groups to easily manage who should see the new stuff and who sees the old stuff.</p>

<p>In this post, I start with setting up an Okta org and configuring an OpenID Connect app. Next, I integrate Okta into a simple Spring Boot and Spring Security app. Finally, I add feature flags to deliver a new UI experience for select users - those that belong to a particular group.</p>

 Get Started with Okta 

<p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) rides on top of OAuth 2.0 for a modern Single Sign-on, authentication and authorization standard. Okta provides these standards as a service. Don’t know anything about these standards yet? Good news - You don’t have to! By following some simple instructions to provision and Okta org and setup a hosted instance of OIDC, you can easily integrate a Spring Boot app with just configuration. Let’s get started with 3 easy steps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re interested in learning more about OIDC and OAuth 2.0, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/07/25/oidc-primer-part-1">here</a> and <a href="https://oauth.com">here</a> are good places to start. Look for more links to posts on OIDC and OAuth 2.0 at the end of this post.</p>
</blockquote>

 Register for an Okta Org 

<p>Head on over to: <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">https://developer.okta.com/signup</a>. Fill out the form and click Get Started.</p>

<p>You’ll get an email from Okta to confirm your address. Click on ACTIVATE MY ACCOUNT. You’ll next see an onboarding page in your Okta Org. You can skip this for now.</p>

<p>Let’s add a few users and groups for use later in the Spring Boot app.</p>

 Add Users to your Okta Org 

<p>Click Users on the menu bar at the top. Here, you’ll see the user already created for you with the name and email you submitted to create the Okta org.</p>

<p>Click Add Person. This will bring you to the input form for adding a new user:</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>Change the Password field to Set by admin and uncheck User must change password on first login. Create the following users by filling out the form and clicking on Save and Add Another for each:</p>


  
    
      First name
      Last name
      Username
      Primary email
      Password
    
  
  
    
      Bob
      Belcher
      bob@belcher.com
      bob@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
    
      Linda
      Belcher
      linda@belcher.com
      linda@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
    
      Tina
      Belcher
      tina@belcher.com
      tina@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
    
      Gene
      Belcher
      gene@belcher.com
      gene@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
    
      Louise
      Belcher
      louise@belcher.com
      louise@belcher.com
      123456aA$
    
  


<p>Next, you’ll add some groups and assign some users to those groups.</p>

 Add Groups to your Okta Org 

<p>Choose Users &gt; Groups from the top level menu. Here, you’ll see the built in <code>Everyone</code> group. As you might imagine, every current and new user is automatically added to this group.</p>

<p>Click Add Group. This will bring you to the input form for adding a new group:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter BETA_TESTER in both the Name and Group Description fields. Click Add Group.</p>

<p>Click the link to the newly created BETA_TESTER group. Click Manage People. Click on each of Tina, Gene, and Louise on the left. Notice that those users are moved from the left to the right, indicating that they will be members of the group. Click Save to finalize these changes.</p>

<p>Now, you’re Okta org is configured with five users (the Belcher family), 3 of whom belong to the BETA_TESTER group.</p>

 Create an OIDC App in your Okta Org 

<p>Next up, you’ll create an OIDC app that the Spring Boot app uses below. A deep dive into how OIDC works is outside the scope of this post, but check the links at the bottom if you’re interested in learning more about OIDC.</p>

<p>Click Applications from the top menu bar.</p>

<p>Click Add Application. Choose Web from the available app types and click Next. Update the Name field. Change the Login redirect URIs to: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code>. Leave all the other fields as their defaults and click Done at the bottom.</p>

<p>At the top of the General tab, you’ll see the Client Credentials section at the top. Copy the values for Client ID and Client secret. You’ll use these values below to configure Spring Boot.</p>

 Configure the OIDC App to Return Groups 

<p>The last Okta configuration step is to make sure that the list of groups a user belongs to is returned when a user authenticates. You’ll see below that this integrates very easily with Spring Security.</p>

<p>Click API &gt; Authorization Servers from the top menu bar. Click the default link under the list of Authorization Servers (it should be the only one right now).</p>

<p>Click the Claims tab. Click Add Claim:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Fill the form in with the following (leave anything not named as default):</p>


  
    
      Field
      value
    
  
  
    
      Name
      groups
    
    
      Include in token type
      ID Token Always
    
    
      Value type
      Groups
    
    
      Filter
      Matches regex .*
    
  


<p>Click Create to finish.</p>

<p>Your Okta org is all ready to go to provide authentication and authorization services to your application. This is the great thing about Okta - with a little bit of configuration, you get all the services you need for auth allowing you to focus on the primary mission of your app.</p>

  <p>All of the configuration you did in this section can be done via the Okta Management API. If this is something that interests you, check out the documentation <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next up, you’ll wire up Spring Boot with Spring Security to your Okta org. When you see how easy it is, your mind might just get blown.</p>

 Get Started with Spring Boot 

<p>The Spring team over at Pivotal has done an amazing job of making getting started with Spring Boot super easy. The Spring Initializr project over at <a href="https://start.spring.io">https://start.spring.io</a> allows you to select everything you need for the app you want to build.</p>

<p>For our purposes (and to keep things simple), you just need:</p>


  
    
      Component
      Description
    
  
  
    
      Spring Web
      RESTful APIs and Spring MVC
    
    
      Thymeleaf
      Server-side Java templating engine
    
    
      Okta
      Easy integration with Okta; includes Spring Security
    
  


<p></p>

<p>Spring Initializr even makes it easy to load a pre-configured project from a <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.okta.examples&amp;artifactId=okta-split-example&amp;name=okta-split-example&amp;description=Feature%20Flags%20with%20Okta%2C%20Split%20and%20Spring%20Security&amp;packageName=com.okta.examples.okta_split_example&amp;dependencies=web,thymeleaf,okta">direct link</a>.</p>

<p>And, you can download the project from the command line with:</p>

   <code>curl -G \
--data 'type=maven-project' \
--data 'language=java' \
--data 'bootVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE' \
--data 'baseDir=okta-split-example' \
--data 'groupId=com.okta.examples' \
--data 'artifactId=okta-split-example' \
--data 'name=okta-split-example' \
--data 'packageName=com.okta.examples.okta_split_example' \
--data 'packaging=jar' \
--data 'javaVersion=11' \
--data 'dependencies=web,thymeleaf,okta' \
--data-urlencode 'description=Feature Flags with Okta, Split and Spring Security' \
https://start.spring.io/starter.zip  \
-o okta-split-example.zip
</code>   

<p>Expand the downloaded zip archive and open it in the IDE of your choice.</p>

<p>You can also find the completed application over on the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-split-example">Okta Developer GitHub repo</a>.</p>

 Integrate with Okta 

<p>In order for this Spring Boot app to connect to your Okta org you need to set up an <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code> file with just three configuration parameters:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: &lt;yourOktaDomain&gt;/oauth2/default
    clientId: &lt;oidc client id&gt;
    clientSecret: &lt;oidc client secret&gt;
</code>   

<p>At this point, the Spring Boot app is ready to run! Execute:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Navigate to: <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You should immediately be redirected to Okta to authenticate. After authenticating, you should end up with a <code>404</code> error, as you haven’t added any content to your app yet. You’ll do that next.</p>

 Create a Basic Thymeleaf Template 

<p>The last two pieces that are needed for a basic Model-View-Controller (MVC) app are a controller and a view in Spring Boot.</p>

 Create a Controller 

<p>Add a file called <code>HomeController</code> with the following:</p>

   <code>@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("username", user.getPreferredUsername());
        model.addAttribute("roles", user.getAuthorities());
        return "home";
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Using the <code>@AuthenticationPrincipal</code> annotation, the authenticated <code>OidcUser</code> is autowired into the home method. A <code>Model</code> object is passed into the method as well.</p>

<p>The <code>Model</code> object is updated with the authenticated user’s username and a list of the Spring Security authorities associated with that user.</p>

<p>Since the project is configured with the Thymeleaf templating engine, returning a <code>String</code> at the end of the controller method will automatically return a template with that name. In this case, Thymeleaf will look for a template named: <code>home.html</code>.</p>

 Create a View 

<p>Create a file called: <code>src/main/resources/templates/home/html</code> with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;span th:inline="text"&gt;Hello, [[${username}]]!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p/&gt;
        Here are your roles:
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;ul th:each="role : ${roles}"&gt;
            &lt;li th:inline="text"&gt;[[${role}]]&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>This template displays the <code>username</code> from the model. It then uses the Thymeleaf construct <code>th:each</code> to iterate over the list of <code>roles</code> from the model.</p>

<p>Restart the application, navigate once again to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and login as: <code>tina@belcher.com</code>.</p>

<p>Amongst a number of default roles and scopes, you should see that she has the <code>BETA_TESTER</code> role.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this point, the Spring Boot + Spring Security application is fully functional (such as it is).</p>

<p>Next, I talk about feature flags with Split and then I bring Spring and Split together.</p>

 Get Started with Feature Flags 

<p>Split is a platform for combining feature flags and experiments with data, giving you more confidence in releases of your app.</p>

<p>In the example for this post, you integrate a split treatment such that a select group of users sees a new ‘beta’ interface for your app while ordinary users see the current production interface.</p>

<p>When our imaginary beta testing is complete, you can enable the new interface for all users.</p>

<p>Best of all, you could repeat this process, creating new beta experiences to be tested by your group and eventually making that generally available.</p>

<p>Getting setup with a free developer account for Split is as easy as 1, 2, 3:</p>

 
   Go to: <a href="https://split.io">https://split.io</a>, click: Free Account 
   Fill out the registration form and click: SIGN UP 
   Follow the link you receive in email and set a password. 
 

<p></p>

 Create the Treatment in Split 

<p>Treatments allow you to define settings and behaviors for what you want to test. For my example, we want to setup a treatment that will return on or off depending on whether or not you are part of the beta tester group.</p>

<p>To start, click DE in the upper left. Choose Admin Settings and API Keys. Copy the value for sdk Type in the prod-default Environment. You’ll need this in the Spring Boot app shortly.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: If you’re new to using Split and/or on the free tier, the button in the upper left will say <code>DE</code> for default. If you’ve set up multiple workspaces, then the button will be labeled with the first two letters of the workspace name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, Click Splits on the left-hand side and click Create Split. Give it a Name. Leave the other defaults and click Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click Add Rules on the Targeting Rules tab. Split automatically adds on and off treatment definitions and sets off as the default.</p>

<p>For the use-case in this example, we want to add a group for which the treatment will return a value of on.</p>

<p>Click Add Rule in the Set Targeting Rules section. Here, we want to have the treatment return on if the user is in the group of beta testers. To accomplish this, enter groups in the Add attribute field. From the Select matcher dropdown, choose Set &gt; has any of and enter BETA_TESTER in the field. Change the serve dropdown to on.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This now makes it read like an english sentence: “If the user has an attribute called groups and the groups list contains the value BETA_TESTER, then serve ‘on’ for the treatment”</p>

<p>Click Save Changes</p>

<p>Click Confirm on the summary screen.</p>

 Integrate the Treatment with Spring Security 

<p>Edit the <code>pom.xml</code> file in the project. Add the following dependency:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.split.client&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;java-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;4.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>You can get the complete application, including the integration with Split over at the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-boot-split-example">Okta Developer GitHub repo</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This brings the Split Java SDK into scope for the project.</p>

<p>Next, add a configuration to the project to make the Split Java Client available to the application. Here’s <code>SplitConfig.java</code>:</p>

   <code>@Configuration
public class SplitConfig {

    @Value("#{ @environment['split.api-key'] }")
    private String splitApiKey;

    @Bean
    public SplitClient splitClient() throws Exception {
        SplitClientConfig config = SplitClientConfig.builder()
            .setBlockUntilReadyTimeout(1000)
            .enableDebug()
            .build();

        SplitFactory splitFactory = SplitFactoryBuilder.build(splitApiKey, config);
        SplitClient client = splitFactory.client();
        client.blockUntilReady();

        return client;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code> file:</p>

   <code>split:
  api-key: &lt;your Split API Key&gt;
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice that it’s using the <code>@Value</code> annotation to pull in the Split API Key from the environment. This is a best practice. You should never hardcode an API Key into an application nor commit it in a git repo. In this case, <code>application.yml</code> is listed in the <code>.gitignore</code> file to ensure it’s not added to the git repo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the key line that sets up the Split Client for use elsewhere in the code:</p>

   <code>SplitFactory splitFactory = SplitFactoryBuilder.build(splitApiKey, config);
</code>   

<p>Let’s set up a new template called <code>home-beta.html</code> (It’s mostly copypasta from the original template and should be located in: <code>src/main/resources/templates</code>):</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;WELCOME TO THE BETA EXPERIENCE&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
            &lt;span th:inline="text"&gt;Hello, [[${username}]]!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p/&gt;
        Here are your roles:
        &lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;ul th:each="role : ${roles}"&gt;
            &lt;li th:inline="text"&gt;[[${role}]]&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is in the <code>HomeController</code>. I want to have the app render the new <code>home-beta</code> template if the authenticated user is in the <code>BETA_TESTER</code> group. Here’s the updated controller:</p>

   <code>@Controller
public class HomeController {

    SplitClient splitClient;

    public HomeController(SplitClient splitClient) {
        this.splitClient = splitClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("username", user.getPreferredUsername());
        model.addAttribute("roles", user.getAuthorities());

        List&lt;String&gt; groups =  user.getAuthorities().stream()
            .map(GrantedAuthority::getAuthority).collect(Collectors.toList());

        String inBeta = splitClient.getTreatment(
            user.getPreferredUsername(),
            "BETA_UI_EXPERIENCE",
            Map.of("groups", groups)
        );

        return "on".equals(inBeta) ? "home-beta" : "home";
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The first thing to notice is that I am injecting the <code>SplitClient</code> using constructor dependency injection.</p>

<p>The real magic happens with the <code>splitClient.getTreatment</code> call. The first parameter is the username provided by Spring Security for the authenticated user.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that in much of the Split documentation, this first parameter is referred to as a <code>key</code>. Don’t confuse this with the API Key, which should NEVER be used as the first parameter to the <code>getTreatment</code> call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second parameter is the name of the treatment in Split that we want to target.</p>

<p>The third parameter sends a map where the key is groups and the value is the list of group names that the authenticated user belongs to. In the case of our user linda, this will be Everyone (among some other defaults). In the case of our user louise, this will be Everyone and BETA_TESTER.</p>

<p>The last line of the controller method now returns the home-beta template if the result of getTreatment is on and the home template otherwise.</p>

<p>Fire up the app and try to login as linda in an incognito window. You should see the same home template as before. Kill that incognito window, open another one and login as louise. You should see the new beta template.</p>

<p></p>

 Make Your New Functionality Generally Available 

<p>Now that we have different treatments of our home template for regular users and beta testers, you may be wondering how to go about making the beta template available to everyone?</p>

<p>Split makes it easy-peasy. Go back to your Split definition for BETA_UI_EXPERIENCE and switch the serve setting in the Set The Default Rule section from off to on. Save and Confirm the change.</p>

<p>Without restarting the Spring Boot application, login as linda again. You should now see the same page that you saw for louise earlier.</p>

<p>Pretty cool, eh?</p>

 How to Repeat the Beta / Release Cycle 

<p>With this architecture in place, it’s now very easy to set up a new beta cycle. The steps would be something like this:</p>

 
   Copy the <code>home-beta.html</code> template to <code>home.html</code> (now that it’s ready for production) 
   Create a new <code>home-beta.html</code> template 
   Set the default rule back to off in Split 
   Redeploy the app 
   Let your beta testers test the new experience 
   When ready, set the default rule back to on in Split 
   NO NEED TO REDEPLOY 
 

<p>You could do this over and over again and never touch the controller code. The only thing that’s changing are the templates and the settings in split.</p>

<p>This approach also lends itself to changing who is in your beta test program without having to change your code.</p>

<p>In a real application, you’d be working with a database or an Identity Management system where you could add and remove users from the BETA_TESTER group. With Okta, you can easily manage who belongs to the group from the admin console or via the Okta Management API. Those users would always see the latest and greatest beta while ordinary users would see only the current release.</p>

<p>JSON-LD, based on the ubiquitous JSON technology, is rapidly gaining&nbsp;<a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/da-jsonld">adoption</a>&nbsp;on the web.&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>&nbsp;is an innovation relevant to both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/02/25/why-is-json-ld-important-to-businesses/#565e8546e1bf">business minds</a>&nbsp;and developers alike. For those unfamiliar with this technology, this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vioCbTo3C-4">short video</a>&nbsp;is a great introduction. At MATTR we use JSON-LD in a variety of ways. For example, the platform generates credentials using this technology so that they can be inherently understood and referenced.</p>



<p>Despite it’s growing adoption, the success of standards based technologies like JSON-LD tends to depend on how quickly and easily developers can understand it. Developers rely on tools such as compilers, IDE’s (integrated development environments) like visual studio code and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">linters</a> to provide them with guidance and feedback as they code. These tools are essential for facilitating developer productivity and education.</p>



<p>When it comes to JSON-LD, many have observed that there are limited educational tools and resources available. The lack of training wheels in the space creates a barrier to entry, or results in developers breaking things along the way.</p>



<p>Having been on this journey ourselves, we want to make it easier for developers to pick up JSON-LD. That’s why we have developed a linter, which we are open-sourcing today.</p>



<p>Specifically, we are open-sourcing a mono-repo of packages (“JSON-LD Lint”) designed to lint/process JSON-LD documents. These packages are:</p>



  JSON-LD Lint Core – A typescript/javascript library containing the core linting engine for JSON-LD documents  



  JSON-LD Lint CLI – A command line tool for linting/processing JSON-LD documents   







  JSON-LD Lint VSCode Extension – A VS Code extension aimed at providing an improved development experience within VS Code when dealing with JSON-LD documents (coming soon to th VSCode marketplace).   







<p>We hope that these packages will help more developers to understand and adopt this technology. As always, we appreciate your feedback and welcome your involvement in progressing this project further! Head along to our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-lint">GitHub</a> to get involved. You can also <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">gain access</a> to MATTR’s sandbox platform to issue your own JSON-LD credentials today.</p>



 FAQ 



<p>What is JSON-LD and why is it on the rise?</p>



<p>The rise in popularity of javascript (due to its natural language monopoly in web-browsers) led to a mass exile from XML and shift over to JSON as the prefered data representation format. In the process, certain valuable features of XML were lost, in particular those that provide a standardised semantic syntax. JSON-LD defines this missing layer of syntax, which improves semantic reasoning around data. This is critical for maintaining data quality and trust in data, which is particularly important as we increase our reliance on digital infrastructure, IOT and AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is a Linter?</p>



<p>Developers are renowned for building tools that make their job easier – whether it be through automating previously manual processes or designing tools that help to catch their mistakes. The number of tools available has grown in tandem with the open source movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general a linter is a tool that analyzes some input (often source code) and flag errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. It provides developers with feedback around detected issues with their code/input and often includes information on how it could be fixed.</p>

<p>The rise of blockchain</p>



<p>Blockchain is already a reality in the Telecommunication, Media and Entertainment (TME) industry. In fact, many companies, both established and start-ups, have implemented blockchain-based solutions to automize, digitize and re-invent some of their processes.</p>



<p>Like other industries, TME is characterized by the lack of visibility, transparency and auditability of some of its processes, making asset transactions less efficient, thus generating both extra costs and revenue leakage. In telecommunication, a good example of such a process is wholesale voice settlements. Carriers around the world exchange large amounts of money for interconnection costs, but there are no industry standards to ensure consistency and transparency. Each report is subject to dispute and reconciliation. In the media industry, we all know how difficult it is for artists and music labels to track the revenues that are due to them from streaming and video platforms.</p>



<p>Hyperledger helps in bringing efficiency to TME operations</p>



<p>The stakeholders in the TME industry are pioneers in the application of blockchain to solve some of the critical industry issues. In particular, they recognize that a platform designed for the enterprise like Hyperledger Fabric provides tangible value-adds such as&nbsp; privacy, transparency, trust and security. Leveraging these key characteristics, telco and media companies have started building consortia and projects to validate the value of the technology. These consortia can be categorized into three categories: operations-focused, customer experience and full revenue generating ecosystems.</p>



<p>In the first category, companies collaborate to improve back end processes that take place between them, with the goal of eliminating redundant costs and activities. This helps improve productivity and efficiency in the value chain. In a nutshell, this is an efficiency play. Some processes touch all players in the industry. Examples include roaming settlements for telecommunications or digital advertising supply chains for the media industry. (Recently, <a href="https://www.syniverse.com/blog/blockchain/universal-commerce/">Syniverse and IBM</a> went live with the first blockchain-based roaming solution compliant with the new GSMA billing standard.) Alternatively, some processes may interest only a major player and its closest suppliers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reinventing customer experience with Hyperledger&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second category, customer experience-focused consortia, revolves around improving the engagement of the customer rather than the efficiency of the processes. The main financial goal is not cost cutting but revenue generation, either through new services or new business models.</p>



<p>In this context, the sky is the limit: use cases are several and very different. When the goal is to provide a better customer experience, Hyperledger technologies can be used to improve customer engagement and make client-facing activities easier and less redundant. For example: IBM uses Hyperledger Fabric to simplify the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DSNdLDOZ5w&amp;t=4s">dispute resolution process</a> for commercial financing. Fabric is also used to automatically enforce warranties or reduce the time needed to port your mobile number from one carrier to another, thus improving the customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other side, blockchain can be used to create new services for telecommunication and media companies. For decades, telcos have harbored an ambition to get into the mobile payment business. Now, with blockchain, they have an easy and secure way to implement digital wallets, create tokens and exchange them in their own network or with other networks. The same can apply to the gaming industry, where the concept of credits and digital token has been popular in the last few years but was hard to monetize.</p>



<p>Carriers can also now provide digital identity services. Blockchain is the ideal platform for creating a trusted identity, and carriers are in the perfect position to enable subscribers with digital identity and to develop an ecosystem of applications. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/identity">IBM’s Verify Credentials</a> creates a decentralized approach to identity management – enabled by blockchain – building on top of open standards in combination with Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other standards groups</p>



<p>Hyperledger Fabric is the foundation of new industry ecosystems</p>



<p>Finally, the third category, the ecosystems, comprises consortia that cover the entire industry. Consortia turn into ecosystems over time, when an initial application becomes an industry-wide platform, setting the standards for the whole industry and allowing for flexible, modular and open participation, in a “network of networks” fashion. The founder of the ecosystem can extract high value from the platform and become a winner.</p>



<p>The application of Hyperledger Fabric in the TME industry has not achieved the level of maturity necessary for the establishment of a real ecosystem, but a few companies and industry organizations are already laying the foundations for the future ecosystems.</p>



<p>There are several organizations that are creating consortia and implementing blockchain networks.</p>



 
 Companies that interact frequently are getting together to form small groups of three&nbsp; or four participants to streamline existing processes. They can either be telecom carriers that need to facilitate settlements among themselves or music streaming services that want to remunerate music labels faster and more accurately. 
 Regulators are playing a big role: in India, the local telecom regulatory agency (TRAI) mandated the use of blockchain to prevent unsolicited commercial communication. Indian mobile subscribers can opt out of telemarketing calls and a blockchain distributed ledger will manage this information for carriers, content providers and the regulators.&nbsp; IBM is working with <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/respite-from-pesky-calls-messages-airtel-awards-pan-india-blockchain-deal-to-ibm/69445537">TRAI and Bharti Airtel</a> on the commercial deployment that will initially help the operator curb unwanted calls and messages from advertisers. It will also help the operator in Mobile Number Portability, interconnect settlements, supply chain streamlining and content partner settlement. 
 The European Union, through the Horizon 2020 fund, is financing several blockchain projects to improve the way information and infrastructure is shared within telecom companies. 
 Service providers are very active organizations that are leveraging their neutrality to build industry-wide ecosystems. They can be either established platform providers that already serve the majority of their market or new start-ups trying to disrupt the competition. In the first case, service providers are improving their value proposition through blockchain. In the second case, start-ups are rethinking the way the industry works. 
 Finally, industry standard organizations are gathering their members to define how blockchain can transform their industry. This is happening both in telco and media. In telco, organizations such as the GSMA, TWI GLF and the Bridge Alliance are advocating for blockchain with the goal of establishing common standards for the most immediate blockchain use cases (e.g., wholesale and roaming settlements). In the media space, AdLedger is leveraging blockchain to re-shape the digital advertising industry. 
 



<p>2020 is going to be a KEY year for blockchain in the TME industry: we are going to see the outcome of the work done in the last couple years and the move to production of many consortia.</p>

  <p>We’ve all experienced the turbo-charged acceleration in digital transformation in the past six months of the pandemic. Working from home, banking from home, shopping from home, and eating your favorite restaurant meals at home are the new normal. We are also living this experience at ForgeRock. We’ve moved to a nearly 100% remote work environment and&nbsp;supported our customers who have relied on us for a seamless and secure <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/connect-everyone">online experience</a> over the years. Enabling this transformation for our customers is what drives us as a company. It is also why we are all immensely proud to be recognized by Forrester Research as a Leader in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-wave-ciam-2020">The Forrester Wave</a>: Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM), Q4 2020.&nbsp;</p>

   Innovation and Execution Matter Most&nbsp; 

<p>Forrester evaluated the 13 most significant identity and access management (IAM) companies against 32 different criteria spanning three categories: current solution offerings, strategy, and market presence.&nbsp; The evaluation of each company included in-depth reviews of product functionality, demonstration of capabilities, and customer references. ForgeRock was named a Leader in this CIAM evaluation which recognizes both the strength of our current offering as well as having the highest score in the strategy category amongst all vendors evaluated.</p>

 Strong Security and a Great User Experience Are Essential for CIAM 

<p>One&nbsp; prominent theme in this report is the shift in CIAM from “just” a security technology to becoming a key component of the online user experience. Forward-looking organizations are seeking identity partners to help acquire and retain customers while providing them with the security, fraud protection, and personalization capabilities to engage and transact across all consumer channels including web, mobile, call center, or in person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a company strongly focused on <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">CIAM</a>, we’ve invested heavily in designing, building, and continually improving our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> to meet the needs of our customers. We’ve emphasized the importance of capabilities such as data orchestration and user management, customer identity verification and registration, and consumer self-service. We’ve also invested in high performance and scale because they directly impact the user experience. We enable our customers to securely manage hundreds of millions of identities – with demonstrated performance in excess of 3.6 million authentication transactions per minute – and ensure a seamless user experience.</p>

 Looking Ahead 

<p>Forrester emphasized future strategy, investment, and execution roadmap as important criteria in their evaluation. It’s all about cloud choice and enabling hybrid <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">deployments</a>. At ForgeRock, we have known this for a while. It serves as a driving force behind our strategy, product, and go-to-market plan. And, it’s what drove our decision to raise <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-surpasses-100m-arr-raises-935-million-fuel-next-wave-growth-cloud">$93 million</a> in the first half of the year to continue to invest in our business and the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We believe recognition by Forrester Research is a testament to our momentum and validation of our future&nbsp; strategy and direction. Increasingly, our platform is becoming mission-critical to the largest organizations in the world – and we take our responsibility to deliver on their expectations seriously. We are incredibly proud that Forrester has named us a leader in CIAM.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/future-of-sales-2025-why-b2b-sales-needs-a-digital-first-approach/">Gartner Future of Sales 2025 report</a> reveals that 60% of B2B sales organizations will transition from experience- and intuition-based selling to data-driven selling by 2025. Why? Because <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-sales-should-know-about-modern-b2b-buyers/">B2B buyers</a> now prefer to engage with suppliers through digital and self-service channels, making multiexperience selling a must-have.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More interdependence of people, processes and technology will render the traditional sales models less reliable over time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To stay relevant and drive revenue in a world where many B2B buyers see little need or desire to engage with a seller at all, sales organizations need to build adaptive systems that incorporate hyperautomation of interactions and transactions between sellers and buyers, digital scalability for sellers and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37175"]</p>
<p>“The growing interdependence of people, processes and technology will render the traditional sales models less reliable over time — something for which most sales organizations are unprepared,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/49502/Theodore-(Tad)-Travis"> Tad Travis</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “Embracing this change means sales leaders must adopt the principles of hyperautomation — accept they have to meet customers where they already are and bring B2B digital commerce into the fold.”</p>
 Hyperautomation and AI-based selling 
<p>Gartner positions hyperautomation as the effective combination of complementary sets of tools that can integrate functional and process silos to automate and augment business processes. For sales leaders, that means automating sales process steps that were previously very analog and moving customer interactions and transactions into the digital channel they prefer, such as digital commerce.</p>
<p>Traditionally, sales organizations treat sales processes, sales applications, sales data and sales analytics as four distinct practices. But technology is rapidly transforming how sales organizations operate. In the next five years, there will be no separation between sales process, applications, data and analytics, as all four will merge into one single concept: AI for sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz02Nzc4MWY5YmZmNDMxMWVhYWNjNTA5ZGFiZmJmM2U5OQ=="></a></p>
<p>As sales leaders and IT leaders look to enable selling through all channels, they will have to rethink their sales force deployment model and focus investments on<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/adjust-to-the-reality-of-virtual-selling/"> virtual selling</a> and digital commerce channels. To do this, sales leaders and IT leaders should consider these three actions.</p>
 1. Build an advanced sales technology roadmap 
<p>The top priority for sales technology programs should be to build a roadmap that includes advanced approaches such as predictive analytics and guided selling. AI, such as prescriptive next best actions, can tell sellers what to do to close deals and prospects as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Prioritize AI-based guided selling 
<p>While developing an advanced sales technology roadmap, sales leaders must prioritize where AI-based guided selling functions would be most relevant by identifying the least efficient parts of the sales value chain. This can include processes that require a lot of human educated guessing, such as what to do next on a complex B2B deal.&nbsp;</p>
 3. Invest in technology that attracts new talent and enables virtual selling 
<p>Technology not only can optimize processes, it can help sales leaders attract top talent from the Gen Z demographic, who value remote work opportunities and digital collaboration. In addition, investing in technology allows sales organizations to ramp up virtual selling more quickly and improve the buyer experience. This includes arming sellers with high-quality audio and video hardware, and reliable remote meeting platforms that enable sellers to conduct productive customer interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating this transformation from insight-based selling to data-driven selling. Sales organizations now must accept that buying preferences have permanently changed and, as a result, so too will the sales organization and the role of sellers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have always had mixed feelings about the whole notion of “awareness”. On one hand, raising awareness is basically <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybersecurity_awareness_training">what we analysts do</a> on a daily basis: spreading the word about new security challenges and innovative products that solve them is a major part of our job. On the other hand, it does not really help, does it? We still hear about major data breaches and ransomware attacks every day: I suspect that many people have long become completely desensitized to that news. Well, perhaps learning about <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2020/09/a-patient-dies-after-ransomware-attack.html">the first death of a patient</a> in a clinic hit by ransomware (in my city of all places!) was a notable and unfortunate exception…</p>
<p>So, what are we doing wrong? Are we not putting enough effort into cybersecurity awareness? Should we do it differently somehow? I wish I had a clear-cut answer to these questions… Alas, I don’t think anybody does. However, there are several points we could address. First and foremost, cybersecurity culture should obviously not be limited to a special month. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble, and if people are not constantly reminded of the dangers, they will forget and focus on more relevant aspects of their daily jobs.</p>
 Awareness should be about solutions, not problems 
<p>Another critical aspect is that awareness alone never amounts to much. People (and organizations) should learn not just about potential troubles: they need to be given concrete solutions for those. For cybersecurity, this includes not only specific security tools but also giving actionable recommendations: how to improve your computer’s security, how to defend against account takeover, how to prepare for a phishing or ransomware attack and where to seek assistance after being hit… Ideally, cybersecurity hygiene has to become a routine part of your daily life like brushing your teeth or locking the front door.</p>
<p>One simple example: how many times have you heard about the dangers of using the same simple password between multiple online services? I’d argue that the public awareness of the issue is very high, and yet, the worldwide most popular password is still “123456”. How about suggesting using a free password manager instead, like <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> or <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a><a></a>? In enterprise environments, of course, one should look for solutions with centralized management and additional capabilities like <a href="https://www.passwordsafe.com/">Mateso Password Safe</a>. Using such a tool completely changes your “password routine”, making re-using an old password more cumbersome that generating a fresh strong one each time.</p>
<p>Even better, of course, is activating multi-factor authentication whenever available. Alas, there is still no single convenient tool to support all online services, but a combination of a hardware security key like <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubikey</a> and an authenticator mobile app like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> will have almost all your bases covered. And by the way, forget about changing your passwords regularly and using security questions – these have long been proven useless and are no longer recommended by reputable organizations like <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp800">NIST</a>.</p>
 Awareness in times of Corona 
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic that forced so many people to work from home for months has also completely changed the scope of enterprise cybersecurity. For years, strict segregation of work and personal activities has been enforced by security and compliance policies, even for Bring Your Own Devices. Nowadays, when so many employees resort to using their home PCs for remote work, this approach no longer works.</p>
<p>Even worse: the same devices are often used by remotely schooled children, blending the line between home and work security even further and introducing new, unexpected challenges to corporate security departments. Will raising awareness among elementary school students help? Who is supposed to do this job: Teachers? Parents? Parents’ employers? Governments? Or maybe the companies that develop the software used for remote communications?</p>
<p>One thing is certain though: the situation is not going to sort itself out. I believe, some kind of government-backed incentive is necessary<a></a>, not just for providing consistent guidance and governance across industries, but for supporting private initiatives and sanctioning negligence. Awareness campaigns like ECSM are a useful first step in that direction but other steps must follow soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the only sensible way to secure people working from home (including their families, because malware, like COVID, does not differentiate) is for organizations to expand the focus of their cybersecurity efforts beyond just BYOD. Cybersecurity Awareness Training should be an important and perhaps the first step in that direction. However, it has to focus on concrete, actionable, easily understandable guidance delivered in a way that actually makes people want to participate. A popular example of this approach is gamified phishing training. Not only people learn about the dangers of opening suspicious emails or clicking on unverified links, they are naturally incentivized to compete, learn more and apply their knowledge more often.</p>
 Expanding the scope of cybersecurity 
<p>However, organizations should not stop there. Securing their employees’ home devices should become a part of the corporate cybersecurity strategy. Of course, old-school tools like firewalls and VPNs are not suitable for such scenarios, but this is where security solutions delivered from the cloud come to the rescue. It is obvious that communications security (including not just email, but videoconferencing and online collaboration tools) should not differentiate between company-owned and personal devices. However, the same approach should apply to other fields as well, such as web security or endpoint detection and response. Even though such solutions are more “invasive” in terms of potential privacy issues, modern cloud-native products from companies like Akamai, Cisco or Zscaler offer a range of privacy-enhancing controls to overcome the compliance challenges.</p>
<p>Last but not least, government-issued guidance does not have to be your only source of expertise and best practices. Independent and strictly neutral research from industry analysts can be quite valuable as well, especially when it comes to selecting the most appropriate product for your specific risks and requirements.

<p>Kantara to Provide Its NIST SP 800-63-3 Conformity Assessment For Identity Proofing &amp; Authentication</p>
<p>WAKEFIELD, Mass., USA – October 7, 2020 — <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> announced today that the United States General Services Administration (GSA) is joining Kantara and plans to put its Login.gov service through the Kantara assurance and approval program based on third-party assessment against the requirements detailed in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines.</p>
<p>“NIST SP 800-63-3 is focused on modernizing the policy in keeping with rising threat levels for identity proofing, verification and authentication whilst also improving privacy in the overall digital user experience,” said Colin Wallis, Executive Director, Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; “Kantara has developed assessment criteria against each of 63-3’s normative requirements to drive consistency in assessments of applicable credential service providers (CSPs) done by Kantara 3rd party accredited assessors. Consistency in assessments drives long term integrity in Kantara’s Trust Framework and Trust Marks internationally, thereby building trust and confidence for all stakeholders in the wider digital economy.”</p>
<p>With the GSA’s oversight, Login.gov provides simple, secure, private access to participating US government digital services online.&nbsp; A single privacy-aware login.gov account can sign-in to multiple government agencies making managing federal benefits, services and applications easier and more secure for the public. Login.gov is used by over 60 applications at 17 agencies including the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy and the Executive Office of the President. To date, over 25 million people have signed up to use login.gov.</p>
<p>Kantara is one of the leading global consortiums improving trustworthy use of identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. It <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/800-63-3/">provides third party assessment against the NIST SP 800-63-3 for identity proofing and authentication</a>. US Government agencies are required to follow NIST guidelines and independent, external assessment is acknowledged as best practice to demonstrate NIST standards compliance.</p>
<p>Kantara was authorized as a US Government Trust Framework provider to the GSA’s then FICAM Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) program in 2011 and works with governments and standards-bodies internationally to align its Trust Mark program for multi-jurisdictional adoption. Kantara is one of the premier Trust Framework Providers aligned with the US National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) program as well as similar initiatives outside the US.</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3 is the set of prevailing digital identity guidelines to which US Federal agencies implementing identity verification and authentication must comply. It also serves as a widely-recognized benchmark for any organization or business wishing to implement identity verification and authentication services, both internationally as well as within the US.</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative Trust Framework</p>
<p>Kantara Initiative’s Trust Framework Operations and Identity Assurance program is the industry leading program that&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/idassurance/assessor-accreditation/">accredits Assessors </a>and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/idassurance/service-provider-approval/">approves Credential Service Providers</a> (CSPs).&nbsp; The program offers three Classes of Approval that enable CSPs to seek approval of their Identity and Credential Management Services as meeting NIST 800-63 rev.3 requirements. By design, Kantara’s IAF can be applied to a range of standards-derived schemes and classes of approval to verify an organization’s conformance, including NIST SP 800-63-3.</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative</p>
<p>The Kantara Initiative is one of the leading global consortiums improving trustworthy use of digital identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. Kantara provides real-world innovation through its development of specifications, applied R&amp;D and conformity assessment programs for the digital identity and personal data ecosystems.

					 <p>G-Suite, Office 365, Slack, Stripe, Asana, Twilio, Trello, Salesforce, LinkedIn, WordPress, HubSpot, Zoom, Typeform, Discord. What are two things these applications have in common?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Odds are, you are a user of one or more of them.<p>&nbsp;</p>  They now work seamlessly with self-sovereign identity (SSI).<p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In our eternal quest to make SSI easier to adopt, Trinsic partnered with leading workflow automation platform <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a> to enable Trinsic’s developer community to integrate self-sovereign identity with 2000+ common applications without coding! While Trinsic specializes in building the world’s best developer toolkit for decentralized identity, we recognize that plenty of non-technical people want to build SSI integrations. Zapier is the best tool we found to connect the APIs of various different services behind the scenes, making SSI more accessible than ever before.</p><p><br>If you’ve interacted with Trinsic much, you know we issue credentials for all sorts of things. Many of those workflows, including the Stripe, Calendly, and Zoom integrations, were done using Zapier and took less than 15 minutes to set up. We even issued our employees an Employee ID credential using Zapier! But we’re not the only ones who love this feature—see how other innovators are using Trinsic and Zapier to make self-sovereign identity a reality.</p>

					 <p>The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> is arguably the most important digital identity gathering there is. It’s happened every year, twice a year, for over 15 years now. Many of the internet’s most important digital identity standards, including Open ID, OAuth, and most recently SSI, were pioneered at this conference.<br><br></p><p>When IIW moved virtual, they wanted to practice some of what their community has been working on for several years. Phil Windley, co-founder of the workshop, set up an Eventbrite integration to enable digital tickets for IIW in the form of verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Sign up for IIW and get a digital, verifiable ticket credential <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxi-31-2020b-tickets-113035646662">here</a>.</p>

					 <p>Proof Market is a startup working on MedCreds, a personal health wallet that leverages the Trinsic platform. Through its easy-to-use portal, patients can easily &amp; securely collect their COVID test results, fill out medical questionnaires, and more. MedCreds wanted to keep a pulse on the performance of their application, so they set up a Zapier integration between Trinsic and Slack to notify a channel whenever a new registration is made through the platform.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sign up for your MedCreds digital health wallet <a href="https://portal.medcreds.com/register">here</a>.</p>

					 <p>The magic happens behind the scenes where the Trinsic API is integrated with the Zapier platform using special webhooks. Zapier specializes in creating workflows, or a series of actions across multiple different apps. Through this process, Zapier can pass data from other apps into Trinsic and visa-versa, enabling completely automated credential exchange workflows.</p><p><br>In Zapier, triggers are an event that initiates an automated workflow and actions are the events that occur in that workflow. In the example below, a new registrant in Eventbrite is the trigger of this workflow. In the workflow, the actions that are completed are issuing a credential, registering for a webinar, and sending a confirmation email to the new event attendee.</p><p><br>With integrations to over 2000 other applications, the sky is the limit in terms of integrations. Build an automated credential exchange workflow in less than 15 minutes by following these instructions:<br><br></p>  First, plan out your use case. Maybe you’re following the lead of the Internet Identity Workshop and issuing verifiable credentials as event tickets. Whatever you’re doing, make a plan for how you want the integration to work.<br><br>  Next, head to the <a href="http://studio.trinsic.id">Trinsic Studio</a> and create an Organization. You’ll need the API keys for the Organization in order to use Zapier.<br><br>  Once in the Trinsic Studio, set up a <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/issue-credentials#credential-definition">credential template</a>, verification template, or whatever else you need for your use case.<br><br>  Finally, set up the flow in Zapier and follow the prompts you’re given.  <p><br>Not sure where to start? Try one of the following integrations or check out our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/zapier">documentation</a>:</p>

					 <p>While this is indeed a huge step forward for self-sovereign identity adoption, the real adoption is coming from the hundreds of developers who use the Trinsic platform for the applications they’re building. While we plan to continually improve the Zapier functionality, it will never match the power and flexibility of using the APIs directly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With Trinsic’s fully-loaded package of 3 APIs, a front-end Studio, robust documentation, and SDKs in popular languages, your team is equipped with the flexibility and functionality needed to build something extraordinary.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s just one downside: that we can’t give everyone an award for their efforts. Trust me when I say it was no easy feat to choose the winners from among many worthy nominations. But after many hours of review and deliberation, our judging committee narrowed the field to identify the top entries across eight different categories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worthy award recipients were celebrated at our annual user conference, <a>IDENTIFY 2020</a>. Like many events this year, IDENTIFY was held virtually, but that didn’t stop us from rolling out the digital red carpet for these deserving companies. It’s my great honor to announce this year’s Identity Excellence Awards winners as follows.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When I began programming (in the ’80s), computers weren’t equipped with a network card by default. The internet was almost unknown and modems were slow and noisy. The software was installed from stacks of flexible floppy disks.</p>

<p>Today, computing resources are virtual. The internet is vital and there is an URL for everything. We live in the *aaS (* as a Service) era, where if you want something, there is likely one or more something as a Service providers you can easily get out of your favorite search engine.</p>

<p>In the software industry, a new type of figure has emerged and is gaining more and more importance; I am speaking of the *aaS expert, a.k.a. DevOps.</p>

<p>In this post, you’ll put on your DevOps suit and set up a CI/CD automation solution!</p>

 The Application 

<p>You are going to start by using <a href="https://github.com/okta/samples-aspnetcore/tree/master/samples-aspnetcore-3x/okta-hosted-login">this already existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web application</a>. This post is not about the application itself though, so here I will only refer to some aspects that are needed to complete the topic. You can find more information in GitHub and in the Okta developers’ blog.</p>

 Requirements 

<p>You’ll need a machine with Window 10 (at least Professional edition, I am using version 10.0.18363) and the following resources (all are free or offer free editions):</p>

 
   A local copy of the example <a href="https://github.com/okta/samples-aspnetcore/tree/master/samples-aspnetcore-3x/okta-hosted-login">application</a> 
   A <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account 
   An <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure account</a> (Free Tier is ok) 
   An <a href="https://dev.azure.com">Azure DevOps account</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer account</a> 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2019</a> (I am using version 16.6.5), with .NET Core and Docker workloads 
   <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker Desktop</a> 
   <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> 
 

<p>This application is an example of how to extend a basic ASP.NET Core MVC application with Okta’s implementation of <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc">Open ID Connect (OIDC)</a>.</p>

<p>The building blocks in this integration are as follows:</p>

<p>Call AddOktaMvc() in Startup.ConfigureServices().</p>

   <code>services.AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
{
    // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
    OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:OktaDomain"),
    ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
    ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
    Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
});
</code>   

<p>Add a Configuration Entry Object in appsettings.json.</p>

   <code>"Okta": {
    "OktaDomain": "",
    "ClientId": "{ClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{ClientSecret}"
}
</code>   

<p>Ensure UseAuthentication() and UseAuthorization() are Called in Startup.Configure().</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>These calls are not part of the Okta package (they are .NET Core methods) and are required to tell the framework that you want our app to use the authentication and authorization features. The ASP.NET Core runtime automatically manages auth{entication/orization} scenarios, in this case using the Okta middleware, as per your instructions in ConfigureServices().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, there are multiple ways to trigger the authentication/authorization process from your application. In the example I used for this post, there are two triggers:</p>

 Explicit (User Requests Sign In/Out From the UI) 

<p>The standard top bar created from the .NET Core Template project (_Layout.cshtml) has been enriched with Sign In and Sign Out hyperlinks</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex flex-sm-row-reverse"&gt;
    @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello, @User.Identity.Name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="nav-link" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Profile" id="profile-button"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
&lt;!-- Sign Out --&gt;&lt;form class="form-inline" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignOut" method="post"&gt;
                    &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark" id="logout-button"&gt;Sign Out&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    }
    else
    {
        &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
&lt;!-- Sign In --&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignIn" id="login-button"&gt;Sign In&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    }
</code>   

 Implicit (User Navigates to Protected Resources) 

<p>When the user accesses a protected feature without being logged-in, she’s automatically redirected to the authentication flow. To achieve this in our example, it is sufficient to mark the protected resource with the standard Authorize attribute (in this case, an MVC controller action):</p>

   <code>public class HomeController : Controller
{
...
    [Authorize]
    public IActionResult Profile()
    {
        return View(HttpContext.User.Claims);
    }
...
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: To trigger the implicit flow before logging in, you need to manually access the profile page, typing the ../Home/Profile path suffix in the browser address bar. This is because the only link available to the page is visible only when the user is logged-in.</p>
</blockquote>

 Prep Your .NET Core application for Azure DevOps 

<p>By now, you should have your fresh copy of the application somewhere in your local hard disk. Open the folder in Visual Studio; your solution explorer should appear as in the following picture:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Although not strictly necessary, to avoid confusion I prefer to change the name. The new name is okta-aspnetcore-container-example. Changing the Solution and Project name can be a challenge, especially in big projects. References to files or folders can break, making it impossible for the IDE to load the project correctly. A good way to mitigate this risk is to use the IDE itself to do the renaming. In this case, though, there is only one rename operation that Visual Studio cannot perform automatically: renaming the directory okta-aspnetcore-mvc-example. Even if you do this in Solution Explorer, Visual Studio does not automatically change the solution file. Therefore, you need to manually edit the solution file to make it right:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, double-click the solution file, and the solution will open as expected; without modifying the solution file manually, this operation would not succeed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To complete the rename consistently, rename the Solution and the Project in Solution Explorer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Change the default namespace for the project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Change Namespace for the Existing Source Code (Using Visual Studio Rename Feature)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Replace all occurrences of okta-aspnetcore-mvc-example and okta_aspnetcore_mvc_example with the new values.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, you should be able to build and run the application without any error. However, the Okta auth flows have not been configured yet.</p>

 Create the Okta Application and Bind it to the Project 

<p>Okta strives to offer a first-class quality service with tools that make the integration process as easy as possible for your development environment. Specifically, for .NET Core, Okta offers a NuGet package that seamlessly integrates with the middleware pattern popular for this framework. With a few additions to the source files, the full Single Sign On (SSO) experience is nicely embedded in a purely declarative syntax.</p>

<p>In the Okta console, login to your developer account and create an application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select the .NET Platform
Finally, provide settings as per the following image</p>

<p></p>

<p>The TCP port (5001 here) must be the same value present in launchSettings.json.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Last but not least, the Okta domain assigned to your Okta account, the Client ID, and secret generated by Okta for the new Okta application need to be copied into the placeholders in appsettings.json.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With this, you should be now able to sign in, sign out, and see the user profile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that to have Visual Studio launch the correct environment, you must select the correct profile</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

 Containerize Your Application With Docker 

<p>Getting familiar with all the nuances of the Docker CLI and the DOCKERFILE can take some time.
Fortunately, Visual Studio offers a scaffolding feature for Docker support. It can be selected when the project is created or added to an already existing project; this is the option to select here:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since this is a project in .NET Core, Linux or Windows can be selected as the Operating System. I chose Linux here, as normally Linux images have a smaller footprint. As a result of this operation, Visual Studio makes some changes to the project, like adding a DOCKERFILE and a template entry object to launchSettings.json. The only thing you need to do to obtain a locally testable Docker version of your application is to customize the template JSON object.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>With this, you can launch and debug your new Docker container in Visual Studio, just by selecting the correct profile.</p>

<p></p>

 Deploy Your .NET container with Azure DevOps 

<p>Deploying to Azure is also easy with Visual Studio support. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer, and select “Publish…“. You’ll be presented with the Publish Wizard (for good guidance of when to right-click publish your project, check out <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/when-should-you-right-click-publish/">this article</a>). See below the steps to deploy your container as a Cloud Web Application:</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Your Publish page will be populated with the new Publish profile. Note that I did not have to set any value in the wizard forms, I just accepted the default values. Of course in production scenarios, there should be a naming scheme for the resources.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Publish button and, in a short time (roughly 2 minutes in my laptop), your Azure account will be fully instrumented with all re resources needed to have your application up and running:</p>

 
   The resource group containing the newly created resources 
   The Azure Container Registry 
   The Docker image 
   An app service plan 
   The application instance itself, up and running 
 

<p>Last but not least, remember that you need to set up your Okta application with the newly published endpoint. The easiest way is probably to create another application like the one you created at the beginning of this post and use the Azure endpoint (in the example <code>https://localhost/5001</code> becomes <code>https://okta-aspnetcore-container-example20200729101138.azurewebsites.net</code>)</p>

 OAuth Redirection Note 

<p>If you try your application from the Azure deployment, you could encounter a problem when the security workflow runs. There is a little nuance occurring in a very specific scenario:  ASP.NET Core applications hosted in Linux containers seem to not use the https scheme when redirecting the browser in the middle of an OAuth flow. I did actually have this issue, but only in the Azure deployment, not while running locally on my laptop.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is an easy solution. (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57425951/asp-net-core-passing-http-not-https-redirect-url-in-oauth-challenge-when-hoste">ASP.NET Core passing HTTP (not HTTPS) redirect URL in OAuth challenge when hosted in Linux container</a>).</p>

<p>Simply add this code in your Startup.cs/Configure</p>

 <code>app.UseForwardedHeaders(new ForwardedHeadersOptions
{
      ForwardedHeaders = ForwardedHeaders.XForwardedProto
});

 Create an Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline For Your Containerised Application 

<p>This could be a microservice component of a larger Service Oriented Application solution or a standalone e-commerce web portal. Either way, it would be cool to be able to automate building and deployment. This is what modern DevOps is all about!</p>

<p>At the end of this section, you’ll have automation that—as soon as you push changes to your source control repo—will rebuild and deploy your application! In a few minutes, the changes will be fully deployed and available to your customers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that I didn’t mention testing as part of the pipeline. Good practice in Test Driven Development is to include in the solution automated tests to be executed after a successful build and establish rules to avoid deployment if the results of the tests are unsatisfactory. In this post I am not developing any tests, being the scope to show how to deploy using Azure DevOps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Visual Studio has a built-in wizard to get you up with a templated pipeline.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The wizard form is fully pre-populated with suitable values. The only missing value is the GitHub Personal Access Token. The wizard shows this miss and provides a handy link to jump directly to your GitHub repo, where you will generate a new PAT token and copy-paste it in the form.</p>

<p>Note that, by default, the wizard would create a new App Service. In this case, you have previously published the application and created an App Service for it, so go ahead and select that App service from the dropbox. To start the process confirm clicking on OK.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, you can open your Azure DevOps account and explore the freshly scaffolded CI/CD Pipeline.</p>

<p></p>

 CI Pipeline (Build) 

 

<p></p>

 CD Pipeline (Deploy) 

<p>Now, as soon as you push changes to your GitHub repo Azure DevOps will detect it, proceed to build, and then deploy the updated application automatically.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You will likely need to tweak some parameters to align the pipeline to your particular situation.</p>
</blockquote>

 Recap 

<p>In this post you’ve seen the basics on how to apply two modernization patterns to a .NET Core application:</p>

 
   Containerisation 
   DevOps CI/CD 
 

<p>Okta authentication/authorization support works just fine. The only thing to remember is that the base URL of the deployed application is different from the URL used when testing locally, and consequently the Okta application configuration must support both scenarios.</p>

  <p>Summary: The architecture of an identity system has a profound impact on the nature of the relationships it supports. This post categorizes the high-level architecture of identity systems, discusses the properties of each category to understand architectural influences, and explores what their respective architectures mean to their legitimacy as a basis for online life.</p>



	<a></a>

<p>
    Introductory note: I recently read a paper from Sam Smith, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a>, that provided inspiration for a way to think about and classify identity systems. In particular his terminology was helpful to me. This blog post uses terminology and ideas from Sam's paper to classify and analyze three different identity system architectures. I hope it provides a used model for thinking about identity online.
</p>

<p>
    John Locke was an English philosopher who thought a lot about power: who had it, how it was used, and how it impacted the structure of society. Locke’s theory of mind forms the foundation for our modern ideas about identity and independence. Locke argued that "sovereign and independent" was man’s natural state and that we gave up freedom, our sovereignty,  in exchange for something else, protection, sociality, and commerce, among others. This grand bargain forms the basis for any society. 
</p>

<p>
    This question of power and authority is vital in identity systems. We can ask "what do we give up and to whom in a given identity system?" More succinctly we ask: who controls what? In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> I made the argument that self-sovereign identity, supporting heterarchical (peer-to-peer) interaction, enables rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents. I argued that the architecture of SSI, its structure, made those relationships more authentic.
</p>

<p>
    In this post, I intend to explore the details of that architecture so we can better understand the legitimacy of SSI as an identity system for online interaction. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(political)">defines legitimacy</a> as 
</p>
<blockquote>the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime.</blockquote>
<p>
    While the idea of legitimacy is most often applied to governments, I think we can rightly pose legitimacy questions for technical systems, especially those that function in an authoritative manner and have large impacts on people and society.  Without legitimacy, people and organizations using an identity system will be unable to act because anyone they interact with will not see that action as authorized. My thesis is that SSI provides a more legitimate basis for online identity than administrative identity systems of the past. 
</p>


 Terminology 
<p>
    While we properly talk of identity systems, identity systems do not manage identities, but rather relationships. Identity systems provide the means necessary for remembering, recognizing, and relying on the other parties to the relationship. To do so, they use identifiers, convenient handles that name the thing being remembered. Identifiers are unique within some namespace. The namespace gives context to the identifiers since the same string of characters might be a phone number in one system and a product ID in another. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 1: Binding of controller, authentication factors, and identifiers in identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Identifiers are issued to or created by a controller who by virtue of knowing the authentication factors can make authoritative statements about the identifier (e.g. claiming it by logging in). The controller might be a person, organization, or software system. The controller might be the subject that the identifier refers to, but not necessarily. The authentication factors might be a password, key fob, cryptographic keys, or something else. The strength and nature of the bindings between the controller, authentication factors, and identifier determine the strength and nature of the relationships built on top of them. 
</p>

<p>
    To understand why that's so, we introduce the concept of a root of trust1. A root of trust is a foundational component or process in the identity system that is relied on by other components of the system and whose failure would compromise the integrity of the bindings. A root of trust might be primary or secondary depending on whether or not it is replaceable. Primary roots of trust are irreplaceable. Together, the roots of trust form the trust basis for the system.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis enabled by the identity system underlies a particular trust domain. The trust domain is the set of digital activities that depend on the binding of the controller to the identifier. For example, binding a customer to an identifier allows Amazon to trust that the actions linked to the identifier are authorized by the controller. Another way to look at this is that the strength of the binding between the identifier and customer (controller) determines the risk that Amazon assumes in honoring those actions.
</p>

<p>
    The strength of the controller-identifier binding depends on the strength of the binding between the controller and the authentication factors and between the authentication factors and the identifier. Attacking either of those bindings reduces the trust we have in the controller-identifier binding and increases the risk that actions taken through a particular identifier are unauthorized.
</p>


 Identity Architectures 

<p>
    We can broadly classify identity systems into one of three types based on their architectures and primary root of trust: 
</p>
 
     Administrative
     
     Algorithmic
     
     Autonomic
     
 

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic are SSI systems. They are distinguished by their trust bases. Some SSI systems use one or the other and some (like Sovrin) are hybrid, employing each for different purposes. We'll discuss the properties of the trust basis for each of these in an effort to understand the comparative legitimacy of SSI solutions to traditional administrative ones. 
</p>

<p>
    These systems differ in who controls what and that is the primary factor in determining the basis for trust in them. We call this control authority. The entity with control authority takes action through operations that affect the creation (inception), updating, rotation, revocation, deletion, and delegation of the authentication factors and their relation to the identifier. How these events are ordered and their dependence on previous operations is important. The record of these operations is the source of truth for the identity system. 
</p>


 Administrative Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an administrative architecture rely on an administrator to bind the the identifier to the authentication factors. The administrator is the primary root of trust for any domain with an administrative architecture. Almost every identity system in use today has an administrative architecture and their trust basis is founded on the administrator.
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 2: The trust basis in administrative identity systems.  (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 2 shows the interactions between the controller, identifier and authentication factors in an administrative identity system, the role of the administrator, and the impact these have on the strength of the bindings. The controller usually generates the authentication factors by choosing a password, linking a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism, or generating keys.
</p>

<p>
    Even though the identifier might be the controller's email address, phone number, public key, or other ID, the administrator "assigns" the identifier to the controller because it is their policy that determines which identifiers are allowed, whether they can be updated, and their legitimacy within the identity system's domain. The administrator "owns" the identifier within the domain. The administrator also asserts the binding between the identifier and the authentication factors. An employee's mistake, a policy change, or a hack could affect the binding between the identifier and authentication factors or the identifier and the controller. Consequently these bindings are relatively weak. Only the binding between the controller and authentication factors is strong because the controller generates them.
</p>

<p>
    The administrator's primary duty is to authoritatively assert the controller-identifier binding. Authoritative control statements about the identifier are recorded in the administrator's database, the source of truth in the system, subject to change by employees and hackers. The administrator might be an ecommerce site that maintains an identity system as the basis for its customer's account. In this case the binding is private, and its integrity is of interest only to the web site and the customer. Alternatively, the administrator might provide federated login services. In this case the administrator is asserting the controller-identifier binding in a semi-public manner to anyone who relies on the federated login. A certificate authority is an example of an administrator who publicly asserts the controller-identifier binding, signing a certificate to that effect.
</p>

<p>
    Because the administrator is responsible for binding the identifier to both the authentication factors and the controller, the  administrator is the primary root of trust and thus the basis for trust in the overall system. Regardless of whether the binding is private, semi-public, or public, the integrity of the binding is entirely dependent on the administrator and the strength of their infrastructure, policies, employees, and continued existence. The failure of any of those can jeopardize the binding, rendering the identity system unusable by those who rely on it.
</p>

 Algorithmic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems that rely on a ledger have an algorithmic architecture. I'm using "ledger" as a generic term for any algorithmically controlled distributed consensus-based datastore including public blockchains, private blockchains, distributed file systems, and others. Of course, it's not just algorithms. Algorithms are embodied in code, written by people, running on servers. How the code is written, its availability to scrutiny, and the means by which it is executed all impact the trust basis for the system. "Algorithmic" is just shorthand for all of this. 
</p>


	<a></a>
	Figure 3: The trust basis in algorithmic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    Figure 3 shows how the controller, authentication factors, identifier, and ledger are bound in an identity system with an algorithmic architecture. As in the administrative identity system, the controller generates the authentication factors, albeit in the form of a public-private key pair. The controller keeps and does not share the private key. The public key, on the other hand, is used to derive an identifier (at least in well-designed SSI systems) and both are registered on the ledger. This registration is the inception of the controller-identifier binding since the controller can use the private key to assert her control over the identifier as registered on the ledger. Anyone with access to the ledger can determine algorithmically that the controller-identifier binding is valid.
</p>

<p>
    The controller makes authoritative control statements about the identifier. The events marking these operations are recorded on the ledger which becomes the source of truth for anyone interested in the binding between the identifier and authentication factors.
</p>

<p>
    In an identity system with an algorithmic trust basis, computer algorithms create a ledger that records the key events. The point of the ledger is that no party has the power to unilaterally decide whether these records are made, modified, or deleted and how they're ordered. Instead, the system relies on code executed in a decentralized manner to make these decisions. The nature of the algorithm, the manner in which the code is written, and the methods and rules for its execution all impact the integrity of the algorithmic identity system and consequently any bindings that it records.
</p>


 Autonomic Architecture 

<p>
    Identity systems with an autonomic architecture function similarly to those with an algorithmic architecture. As shown in Figure 4, the controller generates a public-private key pair, derives a globally unique identifier, and shares the identifier and the currently associated public key with anyone.
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Figure 4: Trust basis in autonomic identity systems. (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The controller uses her private key to authoritatively and non-repudiably sign statements about the operations on the keys and their binding to the identifier, storing those in an ordered key event log2. One of the important realizations that make autonomic identity systems possible is that the key event log must only be ordered in the context of a single identifier, not globally. So, a ledger is not needed for recording operations on identifiers that are not public. The key event log can be shared with and verified by anyone who cares to see it.
</p>

<p>
    The controller also uses the private key to sign statements that authenticate herself and authorize use of the identifier. A digital signature also provides the means of cryptographically responding to challenges to prove her control of the identifier. These self-authentication and self-authorization capabilities make the identifier self-certifying and self-managing, meaning that there is no external third party, not even a ledger, needed for the controller to manage and use the identifier and prove to others the integrity of the bindings between herself and the identifier. Thus anyone (any entity) can create and establish control over an identifier namespace in a manner that is independent, interoperable, and portable without recourse to any central authority. Autonomic identity systems rely solely on self-sovereign authority. 
</p>

<p>
    Autonomic identifiers have a number of advantages: 
</p>
 
     Self-Certification—autonomic identifiers are self-certifying so there is no reliance on a third party.
     
     Self-Administration—autonomic identifiers can be idependently administered by the controller.  
      Cost—autonomic identifiers are virtually free to create and manage. 
     
     Security—because the keys are decentralized, there is no trove of secrets that can be stolen. 
     
     Regulatory—since autonomic identifiers need not be publicly shared or stored in an organization’s database, regulatory concern over personal data can be reduced.
     
     Scale—autonomic identifiers scale with the combined computing capacity of all participants, not some central system. 
     
     Independent—autonomic identifiers are not dependent on any specific technology or even being online. 
     
 

 Algorithmic and Autonomic Identity In Practice 

<p>
    We are all familiar with administrative identity systems. We use them all the time. Less familiar are algorithmic and autonomic identity systems. Their use is emerging under the title of <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/what_is_ssi.shtml">self-sovereign identity</a>.
</p>

<p>
    There are several parallel development efforts supporting algorithmic and autonomic identifiers. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier specification</a> is the primary guide to algorithmic identifiers that live on a ledger. The DID specification provides for many DID methods that allow DIDs to live on a variety of data stores. There's nothing in the DID specification itself that requires that the data store be a blockchain or ledger, but that is the primary use case.
</p>

<p>
    I've <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">written about the details of decentralized identifiers</a> before. DIDs have a number of important properties that make them ideal as algorithmic identifiers. Specifically, they are non-reassignable, resolvable, cryptographically verifiable, and decentralized.
</p>

<p>
    As algorithmic identifiers, DIDs allow the controller to cryptographically make authoritative statements about the identifier and the keys it is bound to. Those statements are recorded on a ledger or blockchain to provide a record of the key events that anyone with access to the ledger can evaluate. The record is usually public since the purpose of putting them on a ledger is to allow parties who don't have an existing relationship to evaluate the identifier and its linkage to the controller and public keys. 
</p>

<p>
    There are two related efforts for autonomic identifiers. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> is a general-purpose self-certifying system for autonomic identifiers. KERI identifiers are strongly bound at inception to a public-private key pair. All operations on the identifier are recorded in a cryptographic key event log. KERI has strong security and accountability properties. Drummond Reed has made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_564J1B3LfBHc_FQnO8jUMiYEx084LVUsHsY1mYPa6U/edit#slide=id.g9398465ffb_33_0">proposal that would allow KERI autonomic identifiers to be used with any DID method</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    The second option is <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/index.html">Peer DIDs</a>. The vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things need not be public and thus have no need for the ability to publicly resolve the DID. Peer DIDs fill this need with the benefits of autonomic identifiers listed above. 
</p>

<p>
    Like KERI, Peer DIDs maintain a key event log (called "deltas") that records the relevant operations on the keys in a cryptographic manner. The Peer DID key event log can be shared with other parties in the relationship over <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a>, a protocol that allows parties to a relationship to securely and privately share authenticated messages. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">security and authority of a DIDComm channel</a> are rooted in DIDs and their associated authentication factors. DIDComm can be used over a wide variety of transports.
</p>

<p>
    The vast majority of digital relationships are peer to peer and should use autonomic identifiers. Algorithmic identifiers allow for public discovery of identifier properties when relationships are not peer to peer. In the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>3, the ledger records public DIDs for <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/12/verifiable_credential_exchange.shtml">verifiable credential</a> issuers. But people, organizations, and things form relationships using peer DIDs without need for the ledger. This hybrid use of both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems was designed so that credential exchange would be practical, secure, and private while reducing the correlation that might occur if individuals used a few DIDs on a ledger.
</p>


 Comparing Identity Architectures 
<p>
    Table 1 summarizes the architectural properties of identity systems with administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic bases of trust. 
</p>


	  <a></a>
	  Table 1: Architectural properties of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    The table shows how the locus of control, source of truth, root of trust, and trust basis differ for each of our three architectures. For Administrative systems, the administrator is directly in control of all four of these. In an algorithmic architecture, the controller is the locus of control because the ledger is set up to allow the controller to be in charge of all key operations. Sometimes this is done using special administrative keys instead of the keys associated with the identifier. The organizations or people operating nodes on the ledger <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/07/answering_questions_about_self-sovereign_identity.shtml">never have access to the keys necessary to unilaterally change the record of operations</a>. No third party is involved in autonomic identity systems. 
</p>

<p>
    Table 2 summarizes the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems4.
</p>



	  <a></a>
	  Table 2: Summarizing the trust bases of administrative, algorithmic, and autonomic identity systems (click to enlarge)


<p>
    We can see from the evaluation that algorithmic and autonomic architectures are decentralized while the administrative system has a single point of failure—the third party administrator. As a result administrative systems are less secure since an attack on one party can yield a trove of valuable information. Administrative systems also rely on privacy by policy rather than having privacy preserving features built into the architecture. And, as we've seen, all too often privacy is in direct conflict with the administrator's profit motive leading to weak privacy policies. 
</p>

 Power and Legitimacy 

<p>
    I started this post by talking about power and legitimacy. From our discussion and the summary tables above, we know that power is held very differently in these three systems. In an administrative system, the administrator holds all the power. I argued in <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a> that the architecture of our identity systems directly impacts the quality and utility of the digital relationships they support. Specifically, the power imbalance inherent in administrative identity systems yields anemic relationships. In contrast, the balance of power engendered by SSI systems (both algorithmic and autonomic) yields richer relationships since all parties can contribute to it.  
</p>

<p>
    Clearly, administrative identity systems have legitimacy—if they didn't, no one would use or trust them.  As new architectures, algorithmic and autonomic systems have yet to prove themselves through usage. But we can evaluate each architecture in terms of the promises it makes and how well it does in the purposes of an identity system: recognizing, remembering, and relying on other parties in the relationship. These are largely a function of the trust basis for the system. 
</p>

<p>
    Administrative systems promise an account for taking actions that the administrator allows. They also promise these accounts will be secure and private. But people and organizations are increasingly concerned with privacy and seemingly non-stop security breaches are chipping away at that legitimacy. As noted above, the privacy promise is often quite limited. Since the administrator is the basis for trust, administrative systems allow the administrator to recognize, remember, and rely on the identifier depending on their security. But the account holder does not get any support from the administrative system in recognizing, remembering, or relying on the administrator. The <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">relationship is strictly one-way and anemic</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    SSI systems promise to give anyone the means to securely and privately create online relationships and trustworthily share self-asserted and third-party-attested attributes with whoever they chose. These promises are embodied in the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/10/fidelity_provenance_and_trust.shtml">property I call fidelity</a>. To the extent that algorithmic and autonomic identity systems deliver on these promises, they will be seen as legitimate. 
</p>

<p>
    Both algorithmic and autonomic identity systems provide strong means for recognizing, remembering, and relying on the identifiers in the relationship. For an algorithmic system, we must trust the ledger as the primary root of trust and the trust basis. Clearly our trust in the ledger will depend on many factors, including the code and the <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/02/decentralized_governance_in_sovrin.shtml">governance that controls its operation</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The trust basis for an autonomic identity system is cryptography. This implies that digital key management will become an important factor in its legitimacy. If people and organizations cannot easily manage the keys in such a system, then it will not be trusted. There is hope that key management can be solved since the primary artifacts that people using an SSI system manipulate are relationships and credentials, not keys and secrets. By supporting a consistent user experience rooted in familiar artifacts from the physical world, SSI promises to make cryptography a usable technology by the majority of people on the Internet.
</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>
    In this article, we've explored the high-level architectures for the identity systems in use today as well as new designs that promise richer, more authentic online relationships, better security, and more privacy. By exploring the trust bases that arise from these architectures we've been able to explore the legitimacy of these architectures as a basis for online identity. My belief is that a hybrid system that combines algorithmic public identifiers with autonomic private identifiers can provide a universal identity layer for the Internet, increasing security and privacy, <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/08/life-like_identity_why_the_internet_needs_an_identity_metasystem.shtml">reducing friction</a>, and providing <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/08/youve_had_an_automobile_accident_multi-source_identity_to_the_rescue.shtml">new</a> and <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/06/held_hostage.shtml">better</a> online experiences.

 Notes 
 
     Often the term root of trust is used to a hardware device or some trusted hardware component in the computer. The usage here is broader and refers to anything that is relied on for trust in the identity system. Trust anchor is a term that has sometimes been used in the cryptography community to refer to this same concept.   
     A number of cryptographic systems are trivially self-certifying (e.g. PGP, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.). What sets the autonomic identity systems described here apart is the key event log. Sam Smith calls these identifiers “autonomic identifiers” to set them apart from their less capable counterparts and emphasize their ability to self-manage keys without recourse to a third party system.

<p>At <a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR</a> we’ve been busy building the next generation of solutions for verifiable data and digital trust. Earlier this month we introduced <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">our platform</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/using-privacy-preserving-zkp-credentials-on-the-mattr-platform-4c9e351a2fc3">added experimental support</a> for a new, privacy-preserving method for selective data disclosure. Today, we’ve reached another milestone that gives our users even more choice and transparency by the addition of a new way to use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs).</p>



<p>Modularity and extensibility are key design principles underpinning our core platform architecture. The MATTR Platform is designed to support a wide range of distinct pluggable components, providing our customers with confidence that their technology choices will continue to evolve with new innovations as they emerge.</p>



<p>When it comes to DIDs, there are currently over 50+ <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">DID Methods</a> registered with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>. Each DID Method defines a CRUD model that describes how a particular DID scheme works with a specific <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">verifiable data registry</a> such as a distributed ledger or blockchain. The initial group of DID methods was quite small, and has expanded significantly over time as more solutions emerge in this space. While all of these new DID methods theoretically adhere to the DID core specification, each method makes a different set of choices that affect the underlying trust model at play. For instance, DID methods have distinct rules about who gets to add new transactions, what input data is required, where DIDs are anchored, who can view or monitor the DIDs, and more.</p>



<p>In short, there are many factors that affect the choice around which DID method to use, and it’s not a trivial decision.</p>



<p>We believe that DIDs, when deployed responsibly, can be extremely effective at preserving user privacy, enhancing transparency and consent, enabling data portability, and enforcing user control. To learn more about our approach, read our blog, <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/intro-to-dids-for-people-5ebe620b5a15">“Intro to DIDs for people”</a>.</p>







<p>In addition to our current support for <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a> (static key-based identifier) and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a> (ledger-based identifier), we are now proud to add <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a> (domain-based identifier) to our list of supported DID methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DID Web helps to bridge the gap between the way that trust is established on the internet today, namely using domains, and new and emerging ecosystems using DIDs. When using DID Web, rather than anchoring a DID to a decentralized ledger such as a blockchain, the DID is instead associated with a specific domain name, and subsequently anchored to the web host registered with that domain via <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS resolution</a>. Effectively, this allows a DID using this scheme to be resolved as simply as one resolves a web URL, every time they click on a link. For example, we’ve set up a DID Web using our own domain, which can be resolved at <a href="https://mattr.global/.well-known/did.json">did:web:mattr.global</a>.</p>



<p>Users in the emerging world of DIDs can use this mechanism to bootstrap trust by using the reputation associated with public domains. While this solution may not work in every circumstance and lacks some of the resilience and censorship guarantees afforded by DID methods with less centralized dependencies, DID Web provides a practical and useful pathway to adoption, particularly for entities whose data and identity are already public. When used in parallel with more natively decentralized mechanisms, we can help to ensure that the web remains free and open while providing a path for legacy systems to remain interoperable with the emerging distributed web of trust.</p>



<p>By adding support for new DID methods such as <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, we are creating optionality and choice for our users. Our products will always be ledger-agnostic. We will also continue to offer support for DIDs which are not anchored to any ledger. We aim to bridge the gap between approaches that are built on top of ledgers and those using domains, key registries, and other methods to establish trust.</p>



<p>We are also actively investigating how to add support for more scalable solutions that use ledgers on an ad-hoc basis, such as DID methods based on the layer two <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree">Sidetree Protocol</a>. This open-source protocol provides an abstract layer that sits on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger">DLT</a> infrastructure.</p>







<p>The <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/drivers">Platform Drivers</a> part of our architecture provides DID Method support in the form of&nbsp; pluggable integrations that prevent vendor lock-in and enable user choice. To find out more about how the MATTR Platform supports a broad spectrum of DID methods, check out our documentation on <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/platform/core/dids">MATTR Learn</a> and <a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">sign up</a> to get started.</p>

<p>Customize many aspects of your Gluu Server identity and access management service.</p>
<p>Interception scripts can be used to implement custom business logic for authentication, authorization and more in a way that is upgrade-proof and doesn’t require forking the Gluu Server code. Each type of script is described by a Java interface — i.e. which methods are required.</p>
<p>In 4.2, we’ve introduced new interception scripts for Post-Authentication Authorization (<a href="https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/admin-guide/custom-script/#post-authn">more details</a>), UMA2 RPT claims (<a href="https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/admin-guide/custom-script/#uma-2-rpt-claims">more details</a>), and application session management (<a href="https://gluu.org/docs/gluu-server/admin-guide/custom-script/#application-session-management">more details</a>).</p>
<p>Post-Authentication Authorization</p>
<p>For example: a sensitive web application may wish to force users to re-authenticate even if they present a valid session cookie to reduce the risk of a valid user session at an unattended computer being used by another person to access data inappropriately.</p>
<p>After the browser has a session, if a person visits a website, the RP can obtain a code without the user having to authenticate or authorize. In some cases, it is desirable to insert custom business logic before granting the code or tokens from the authorization endpoint. Post Authn script allows to force re-authentication or re-authorization (even if client is “Pre-authorized” or client authorization persistence is on).</p>
<p>UMA2 RPT claims</p>
<p>UMA2 standard is designed to separate the requesting party and the resource owner (where OAuth2 considers them to be only one person). And this differentiation allows us to address more use-cases than OAuth2.</p>
<p>RPT claims is a special script for UMA 2. It allows an admin to code logic for gathering additional claims (required by UMA RPT Authorization Policy).<br>
This script can be used in an oxAuth application only.</p>
<p>Application Session Management<br>
Session management is used to facilitate secure interactions between a user and some service or application and applies to a sequence of requests and responses associated with that particular user. When a user has an ongoing session with a web application, they are submitting requests within their session and are providing potentially sensitive information. The application may retain this information and/or track the status of the user during the session across multiple requests. More importantly, it is critical that the application has a means of protecting private data belonging to each unique user, especially within authenticated sessions.<br>
This script allows an admin to get notification about various session lifetime events. It’s possible to add multiple scripts with this type. The application should call all of them according to the level.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gluu.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gluu-server-webinars-on-identity-and-access-management.jpg"></a>The Gluu Server now supports CIBA. Improve the end-user experience during authentication and authorization</p>
<p>OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication Flow is an authentication flow like OpenID Connect. However, unlike OpenID Connect, there is a direct Relying Party to OpenID Provider communication without redirects through the user’s browser. CIBA enables a Client to initiate the authentication of an end-user by means of out-of-band mechanisms.</p>
<p>CIBA allows a client application, known as a consumption device, to obtain authentication and consent from a user without requiring the user to interact with the client directly. Instead, the client application can initiate a backchannel request to the user’s authentication device, such as a smartphone with an authenticator app installed, to authenticate the user and consent to the operation.</p>
<p>This specification does not change the semantics of the OpenID Connect Authentication flow. It introduces a new endpoint to which the authentication request is posted. It introduces a new asynchronous method for authentication result notification or delivery. It does not introduce new scope values nor does it change the semantics of standard OpenID Connect parameters.</p>

<p>Gluu Server 4.2 was<a href="https://openid.net/certification/#FAPI_OPs"> certified</a> to conform with the Financial Grade OpenID Provider profile. Called “FAPI” for short, this profile provides detailed requirements for the security features needed to perform payments.</p>
<p>Organizations can use OpenID Connect for both high and low assurance use cases. If you don’t need a ton of security, you don’t need to use all the fancy features OpenID Connect provides. But if you need more security, there are several useful risk mitigations. The FAPI profile uses signing and encryption to protect both the Openid Connect request and response, adding additional assurance and transport security.</p>
<p>But FAPI isn’t only for banks! If you want a lot of security, and a high level of assurance that the person authenticated is not a hacker, you may want to use the FAPI profile too.<br>
Digital enterprises need to improve the security of their operations and protect customer data. It is common practice of aggregation services to use screen scraping as a method to capture data by storing users’ passwords. This insecure practice creates security vulnerabilities which require financial institutions to allow an automated attack against their applications and to maintain a whitelist of aggregators. A new draft standard, proposed by this workgroup would instead utilize an API model with structured data and a token model, such as OAuth.</p>
<p>
FAPI is a working group of the OpenID Foundation, the body responsible for the development and maintenance of a family of protocol standards centered around OpenID Connect. FAPI was initiated in 2017 and sought to bring enhanced security to the new API standards being created to deliver PSD2 regulations across Europe, and one of the key drivers in open banking.</p>
<p>
The Financial-grade API aims to provide specific implementation guidelines for online financial services to adopt by developing a REST/JSON data model protected by a highly secured OAuth profile. The Financial-grade API security profile can be applied to online services in any market area that requires a higher level of security than provided by standard OAuth or OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>
This solution will help enterprises enable secure open banking application program interfaces (APIs) available to third parties, which can then use the APIs to seamlessly draw on customer data. Such easy data flow can help expand bank offerings and to quickly access information that would help in verifying applicants’ identities for a higher level of security.</p>

 The GiD Report#129 — What we learned about digital identity from&nbsp;OnlyFans <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-128-what-the-apple-app-store-backlash-tells-us-about-this-moment-in-time-805a4443f077">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Every company is a messaging company  What we learned about digital identity from&nbsp;OnlyFans  Facebook is worried about messaging (and being broken&nbsp;up)  Trump administration to sue Google next&nbsp;week  The EU and China are getting in on&nbsp;it  This week in the app platform&nbsp;wars  Stuff happens   1. The pandemic lockdown and the resulting era of remote work (and play) has brought to the forefront our platforms for interaction and bringing us together. There was that a16z saying — that every company is a fintech company. Today, it feels like every company is a messaging and groups&nbsp;company. <p>Zoom is <a href="https://zoom.us/feature/messaging">expanding into messaging and groups</a>. Venmo <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/217042878-Group-Accounts">experimented with groups but is apparently shelving the initiative</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/VS">/VS</a>). Discord is <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035969312-Community-Server-Guidelines">expanding groups and community functionality</a> with <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server">community servers</a>.</p><p>But none of those initiatives move the needle in terms of addressing lessons learned from this last cycle of the internet because none of these platforms address the issue of digital identity in a material&nbsp;way.</p><p>Really, it’s more of the&nbsp;same.</p><p>We need an interoperable, portable identity in order to best enable all people economically and socially around the world. We need a persistent identity in order to restructure incentives for better outcomes and prevent fraud and abuse. And we need an open platform so that developers can experiment and create with those messaging and groups (and payments) building blocks so that real innovation can&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>Fundamentally addressing that remains a huge opportunity.</p> 2. Incidentally, one platform that has addressed the issue of identity more than any other is OnlyFans. (For those out of the loop, OnlyFans has been trending this year as a way premium membership platform for influencers. As you might guess, there’s a lot of “adult”-ish type content&nbsp;there.) <p>In accordance to Rule 34 of the internet, they’ve also <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/lessons-from-the-rise-of-onlyfans">managed digital identity better than&nbsp;most</a>:</p><blockquote>First, OnlyFans offers an example of how the desire to get paid for content online smooths the way to validating user identities. There are three major reasons other social services don’t validate the people who participate in their networks. First, the friction of going through the validation process for new accounts prevents people from signing up. Second, it is expensive and time-consuming for services to validate identities. Third, requiring proof of real-world identity is quite exclusionary, as many people can’t easily make that proof. The desire to get paid for content provides a level of motivation that overcomes at least the first two of these&nbsp;hurdles.</blockquote><blockquote>At a bigger systems level, the lesson might be that the path toward trusted validation of identities will come through payment systems. I very much hope that we never face a world where someone has to prove their identity in order to share content on the internet; however, the financial system is far more structurally locked down. It seems likely that payments will become the wedge that forces people to validate online identities. That could lead to the creation of an internet environment where it is easier to validate the real-world identity (or at least the valid citizenship) of the people you are interacting with&nbsp;online.</blockquote><p>So yeah, it only took OnlyFans to validate GlobaliD’s vision that payments, messaging, and digital identity go hand in hand&nbsp;:)</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/lessons-from-the-rise-of-onlyfans">Lessons From the Rise of&nbsp;OnlyFans</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-29/private-social-app-clubhouse-courts-fresh-controversy?sref=BAcrnccI&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Private Social App Clubhouse Courts Fresh Controversy</a>  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity&nbsp;System</a>  <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/How-self-sovereign-identity-principles-suit-the-modern-world">How self-sovereign identity principles suit the modern&nbsp;world</a>   3. Much has been said about last week’s presidential debate. What’s clear, though, is that the country has never been more divided. What they’re not divided on, however, is the idea that we need to regulate Big&nbsp;Tech. <p>Sure, each side has its own motivations, but the end result is the same. Big Tech is the new Too Big To Fail. They’ve gotten too powerful, stifling competition and innovation. And they’ve gotten too influential, undermining social cohesion. Not even Apple is&nbsp;safe.</p><p>Anyway, Facebook is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-government-breakup-of-instagram-whatsapp-would-be-complete-nonstarter-11601803800">worried about messaging:</a></p><blockquote>The document was produced by staff at Facebook based on work commissioned from lawyers at Sidley Austin LLP. While light on legal citations and technical language, it offers a window into how Facebook may defend itself if it is sued on antitrust grounds and reflects its lawyers’ sense that any attempts to force a divestiture of WhatsApp or Instagram would be fought in both the public square and the courtroom.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 were examined by the Federal Trade Commission, which closed its reviews without issuing an objection. The company made big investments to boost growth on those platforms and they now share numerous operations that are integrated. In the paper, Facebook says unwinding the deals would be nearly impossible to achieve, forcing the company to spend billions of dollars maintaining separate systems, weakening security and harming users’ experience.</blockquote><blockquote>“A ‘breakup’ of Facebook is thus a complete nonstarter,” the paper declares.</blockquote>Tim Wu, Photo: New&nbsp;America<p>Tim Wu, who I interviewed many years ago (incidentally, also Big Tech monopoly related — yeah, we’ve been on this beat for a while), wasn’t impressed:</p><blockquote>Facebook’s contention that past government inaction on the acquisitions should limit current action is “surprisingly weak,” said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor, tech critic and author who has said Facebook should be broken up. A government antitrust case against the company would likely rely on the argument that Facebook made serial acquisitions to reduce competition, a question that wasn’t considered when the Federal Trade Commission originally chose not to oppose the Instagram and WhatsApp deals, he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“There’s no way a decision on one merger would be preclusive,” he said, noting that the FTC’s reviews of both acquisitions had reserved the right to revisit the deals at a later&nbsp;time.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook’s claim regarding the difficulty of a potential breakup would also be unlikely to carry legal weight. “There is no ‘it’s too hard’ defense,” Mr. Wu&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>The FTC is expected to file a formal complaint by year’s end. Meanwhile, Facebook is racing to integrate its messaging platforms to make it even more difficult to&nbsp;breakup.</p>  <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/new-messaging-features-for-instagram/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Say “hi” to Messenger: Introducing New Messaging Features for Instagram — About&nbsp;Facebook</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-says-government-breakup-of-instagram-whatsapp-would-be-complete-nonstarter-11601803800">Facebook Says Government Breakup of Instagram, WhatsApp Would Be ‘Complete Nonstarter’</a>   4. Things are happening more quickly for&nbsp;Google. <p>Maybe <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/02/trump-doj-google-antitrust-lawsuit-425617">as soon as next&nbsp;week</a>:</p><blockquote>The Justice Department and state attorneys general are expected to sue Google as soon as next week for alleged antitrust abuses, people familiar with discussions said Friday, marking a dramatic escalation of Washington’s fight to rein in Silicon Valley’s&nbsp;giants.</blockquote><blockquote>The Justice Department — which has been probing Google for 16 months — circulated text of a proposed complaint this week, according to three people with knowledge of the discussion. The complaint could come late next week or just after the Columbus Day holiday, two of the people said. All spoke anonymously to discuss an ongoing investigation.</blockquote><p>This suit will mainly focus on search. But the government’s commitment to the cause portends more to&nbsp;come.</p>  <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/02/trump-doj-google-antitrust-lawsuit-425617">Trump administration to launch antitrust suit against Google as soon as next&nbsp;week</a>   5. And I know that we usually speak about things here from a U.S. perspective, but this is apparently a sentiment felt worldwide. <p>The EU, of course, has long been at the forefront of regulating Big&nbsp;Tech.</p>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-tech-antitrust/u-s-tech-giants-face-curbs-on-data-sharing-digital-marketplaces-under-draft-eu-rules-idUSKBN26L293">U.S. tech giants face curbs on data sharing, digital marketplaces, under draft EU&nbsp;rules</a>  <p>But China wants in on it,&nbsp;too.</p>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-china-huawei-tech-exclusive-idUSKBN26L1OH">Exclusive: China preparing an antitrust investigation into Google — sources</a>   6.

  <p>With the Covid-19 pandemic causing a dramatic shift in how public sector organizations and agencies do their work and provide citizen services, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> has become a priority. Easy, yet secure, remote access for both citizens and employees is no longer a goal for tomorrow, it is a must for today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, traditional IT environments struggle to accommodate increased access demands. For example, legacy identity and access management (IAM) and identity governance and administration (IGA) weren’t designed to provide real-time, continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility, control, and remediation, or to collect and analyze identity data to identify security access and risk blind spots. These shortcomings result in error-prone and time-consuming manual work, poor user experiences, and increased risk — making it difficult for public sector organizations to successfully implement their digital transformation initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What’s needed is a comprehensive IAM and IGA platform capable of not only <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">modernizing and filling the gaps of legacy identity systems</a>, but also unlocking their value with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).&nbsp;</p>

<p>At ForgeRock we’re ready to help. I’m excited to announce that the ForgeRock Identity Governance and ForgeRock Autonomous Identity solutions are now available on the GSA Schedule, which means <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock’s complete IAM and IGA platform</a> can be purchased on the GSA Schedule with Carahsoft. ForgeRock has a long-standing partnership with Carahsoft within the public sector market across US Federal Agencies and State Governments. In fact, Rich Savage, Sales Director at Carahsoft, noted “We pride ourselves on helping government agencies find the best technology solutions available. ForgeRock’s AI-powered platform is exactly what IT teams need in the public sector for solving complex digital identity challenges.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both Identity Governance and Autonomous Identity are fully deployable in a DevSecOps environment. You can view the <a href="https://www.carahsoft.com/forgerock#products">new SKUs on our Carahsoft microsite</a> under ‘Products.’&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRock Identity Governance and Administration 

<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) is the ability to manage and reduce the risk that comes with excessive or unnecessary user access to applications, systems, and data.&nbsp;Users want to have easy and rapid access to all of the applications they need to do their jobs. As a security-conscious organization, you need to balance requests for immediate application access with security, while reducing the risk associated with this process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem is, many public sector organizations use manual processes or scripts to grant immediate access to users. However, this leads to a failure to implement proper monitoring and governance controls on access in order to determine whether users should continue to have access. When auditors ask for proof of proper detective and preventive controls, organizations often resort to even more manual processes that involve spreadsheets and emails. Imagine the worst-case scenario, when a security team is triaging and they have to rely on searching through emails and spreadsheets in order to understand the chain of events. Fortunately, there’s a better way.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">ForgeRock Identity Governance and Administration</a> is an integral part of the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>. It simplifies the manual access request, access approval, certification, and role mining processes while providing full identity lifecycle management for creating, managing, and restricting identity access to accounts, systems, applications, and infrastructure. With ForgeRock IGA, you can strengthen your security posture and automatically drive regulatory compliance.</p>

 ForgeRock Autonomous Identity&nbsp; 

<p>Legacy IGA solutions operate in ‘identity silos’ based on static data, including assignments, roles, and entitlements. Combined with the increasing volume and type of identities within the public sector, this can leave your already overburdened risk and security teams struggling to keep up as they manually provision access privileges and rubber stamp access requests and certifications.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">ForgeRock Autonomous Identity</a> is an AI-driven identity analytics solution that can be layered on top of, and integrated with, your existing IGA solutions to provide real-time and continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility, control, and remediation. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the Autonomous Identity collects and analyzes identity data, such as accounts, roles, user activity, and entitlements, to identify security access and risk blind spots. As a result, public sector organizations gain wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access as well as remediation recommendations.</p>

<p>As these product descriptions exemplify, there’s a better way to do Identity Governance and Administration to improve your overall access and security landscape while reducing manual processes and extending the value of your current investments. These solutions, along with ForgeRock’s comprehensive identity platform capabilities, help you achieve the digital transformation required for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/connect-everyone">today’s remote access demands</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the State of Utah wanted to gain greater reliability and scalability in its identity and access management (IAM) infrastructure to integrate more data and applications, and expand the number of online services available to employees, citizens, and businesses. Using the ForgeRock Identity Platform, the state integrated more than 900 applications and online services, providing the flexibility and scalability to support all 1,400 of the states online services and a growing variety of additional applications and services, including those running in the cloud. The above and more resulted in a projected savings of up to $15 million due to operational efficiencies. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/customer/state-utah">Read the full State of Utah customer story</a>.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the ForgeRock Identity Platform, as well as our newly added Identity Governance and Administration and Autonomous Identity solutions <a href="https://www.carahsoft.com/forgerock#products">on our Carahsoft microsite</a> under ‘Products’.

Photo by Shikoh Gitau/&nbsp;Qhala How Jumia and Facebook are competing, even though they’re playing different games <p>Tiffany* sells makeup, and is evaluating a new display shelf where her product would be at eye level with passing shoppers. That visibility could lead to new customers, but she’s not convinced it’s worth the trouble, because almost all of her customers currently find her on Instagram. And actually, that shelf isn’t even in her store — it’s in the front of a retail locker space where she rents a container in the back to hold her inventory. Tiffany keeps some of her most popular products on hand here so that customers can easily drop by and see the merchandise, but otherwise she runs a completely virtual, just-in-time business. And paying for a physical footprint, even if it’s only a few square feet of shelf space, might not give her the return she needs on scarce&nbsp;capital.</p><p>Tiffany is among millions of entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa taking advantage of popular digital tools to transform their business. Formal marketplaces such as Jumia or Takealot have successfully established a traditional model of e-commerce, while new platforms from Paystack, Flutterwave, and others provide the underlying tools for independent sellers. Despite these formal offerings, the vast majority of digitally connected small businesses are using Facebook, WhatsApp, and other consumer platforms to fulfill an increasing number of commercial use cases. This “social commerce” is often heralded as a leveler of the playing field, as even the smallest businesses can typically use social platforms for a low&nbsp;cost.</p><p>To help make sense of this mix of formal and informal, of purpose-built and appropriated, I developed a framework for comparing the range of digital solutions available to today’s entrepreneurs. For those with a commercial interest in this sector, the framework offers a lens for understanding how different solutions solve distinct parts of the value chain, and what this means for the likely addressable market of each solution. For policymakers and those interested in inclusive economic growth, the analysis highlights the implications of fundamentally different operational structures between formal ecommerce and social platforms, and why we should worry about how previously informal economic activity becomes formalized.</p> From analog to&nbsp;digital <p>Small businesses in sub-Saharan Africa looking to sell online have multiple options to consider; which I’ve simplified here into four categories.[<a>1</a>] These are by no means mutually exclusive, but for clarity I have separated them in the analysis.</p><p>Social commerce<br>The most accessible and likely approach for most small businesses is to use those consumer products that are already familiar and ubiquitous, especially Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Instagram. Entrepreneurs can create a page on Facebook and/or Instagram, post photos or videos of products, communicate with prospective customers, respond to customer reviews, and use built-in advertising tools to boost her page or specific product&nbsp;posts.</p><p>E-commerce marketplaces<br>Businesses may also sell on formal marketplaces such as <a href="https://group.jumia.com/">Jumia</a>, <a href="https://www.kilimall.co.ke/new/">Kilimall</a>, or <a href="https://www.konga.com/">Konga</a>. These online marketplaces aggregate supply and demand into a single platform, providing sellers with immediate access to a large audience — for a price. Like Amazon, they offer sales support with payment processing, fulfillment, and delivery, as well as back office business tools such as inventory management and analytics; typically they charge a commission on&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Standalone domains<br>More digitally savvy businesses might go a step further and publish their own standalone website using one of a growing number of e-commerce tools, such as <a href="https://paystack.com/commerce">Paystack Commerce</a> or <a href="https://flutterwave.com/us/store">Flutterwave Store</a>, two new solutions from Nigerian fintechs that combine payment processing and back office functions with a website builder into a single platform (essentially, Shopify for&nbsp;Africa).</p><p>B2B sourcing<br>And another option for FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) retailers are B2B platforms that connect businesses with suppliers and financing, such as <a href="https://www.tradedepot.co/">Trade Depot</a> in Nigeria or <a href="https://sokowatch.com/">Sokowatch</a> in East Africa, both of which aggregate demand from retailers to provide discounted wholesale pricing and deliver consumer products to the retailer.</p> The retail value&nbsp;chain <p>To understand how these digital solutions are reshaping retail in sub-Saharan Africa, it’s helpful to examine the business functions that each solves for. Retail businesses like Tiffany’s have a relatively straightforward value chain: retailers buy goods from upstream suppliers (inbound logistics), manage inventory and resources (operations), engage with customers (marketing), and, when they’re lucky, make sales and deliver product (sales/outbound logistics). Looking at each category of the value chain in turn, we can summarize the benefits different digital solutions provide to offline businesses looking to digitize.</p><p>Figure 1. Where different digitization solutions impact the retail value&nbsp;chain</p><p>Inbound logistics<br>The B2B marketplaces or supply chain solutions that service this part of the value chain are primarily trying to secure better pricing for retailers by aggregating demand. For example, Sokowatch in East Africa promises not only lower pricing but also financing and complete last-mile delivery to its retailers. These solutions are currently limited to FMCG, where high sales volume and commodity products make it easier to aggregate orders.</p><p>Operations<br>All of the e-commerce marketplaces provide warehousing services to eliminate the need for physical storage facilities. This is especially convenient if the retailer also pays the platform to handle fulfillment and delivery, but these services eat into margins, and many smaller businesses prefer to handle warehousing and fulfillment themselves. Businesses that sell on a marketplace are often also selling directly to customers via physical shops or social media, so the platform’s inventory tracking systems will only cover a portion of their business, reducing its&nbsp;utility.</p><p>Marketing<br>This is where digital options far outperform anything offline. A small retailer with no online presence can only market to those prospects who pass in physical proximity of the shop. Although advertising costs are low, the maximum size of the funnel is limited. But once the business starts marketing online, they can easily increase the reach of their advertising by many orders of magnitude. This is especially true of social media, where the smallest entrepreneur can put up a Facebook page and start bootstrapping eyeballs via their personal networks before transitioning to paid ad spend to “boost” their page or&nbsp;posts.</p><p>Marketplace platforms also offer substantial reach given the installed base of customers who use the site, and sellers pay to promote their products higher in the search or browsing results. One could argue that advertising dollars spent on an e-commerce platform should outperform those on social media, as customers on the former are more likely to be closer to a purchase decision, i.e. deeper in the sales funnel. But marketplace platforms can be brutally competitive for many product categories, and the structure of the market doesn’t allow for much retailer branding or other differentiation. You live and die by the transaction, with little opportunity to build a brand and a following — which is exactly what social media excel&nbsp;at.</p><p>Because standalone domains exist on the open web, they rely on driving traffic from other sources — search and social — to the domain, and therefore don’t benefit from any installed base of&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>Sales/ Outbound logistics<br>One of the bigger service offerings from both the marketplace platforms and the independent domain platforms, like Paystack Commerce, is the ability to process different kinds of payments. For some product categories and businesses this is important, but the majority of e-commerce payments in sub-Saharan Africa are still COD (cash-on-delivery).<a>[2]</a> And in markets where mobile money is popular, buyers can make non-cash payments (pre- or post-delivery) directly into mobile money wallets. So the payment processing function is most valuable only for customers who are willing to pay upfront and want to pay with a card or bank transfer.</p><p>Last-mile delivery to the customer is infamously challenging in most markets, and one of the key services that marketplace platforms offer to their sellers. But typically the delivery price is passed on to the buyer, not built into the product price. Many businesses work with local couriers or contract with new logistics platforms like Sendy in East Africa; many retailers let the customer choose a preferred logistics provider. Because most small retailers have less expensive options for delivery, paying the marketplace to handle delivery only makes sense if the retailer has sufficient volume such that the overhead of managing independent deliveries outweighs the cost&nbsp;savings.</p> Follow me for top-line&nbsp;growth <p>One helpful way to think about how each solution solves a different business function is to categorize it as impacting either (a) top-line growth or (b) bottom-line profitability. The latter category includes solutions that streamline procurement; process payments; digitize inventory management; or provide warehousing, fulfillment, and delivery services. Efficiencies in any of these can lower a retailer’s operational costs, but these will be incremental gains, especially for the smallest retailers.</p><p>On the other hand, digital advertising channels enable entrepreneurs to grow their business by reaching many more customers than they would otherwise. Social media platforms in particular allow businesses to substantially and cost-effectively increase their potential customer base, thereby scaling top-line growth and&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>In the language of unit economics, this is about very large reductions in CAC (customer acquisition costs) vs. incremental improvements to COGS (cost of goods sold). Obviously both are crucial metrics to a business, but have different implications at different stages of business maturity. For any business, reducing COGS and thereby improving margins, by say 10% can easily be the difference between break-even and profitability. But for the smallest businesses, where sales numbers are low, improving margins by 10% may not actually translate into anything meaningful in terms of absolute value.<a>[3]</a> On the other hand, if a small business can double or triple sales at a lower CAC, that revenue opens up all kinds of opportunities for staffing up or expanding the business in different ways.</p><p>Using the framing of the value chain analysis above, here’s a simple 2x2 illustrating which types of businesses are most likely to benefit from each type of digital solution. In addition to the maturity or size dimension, which as described above is a primary factor in determining the relative value of increasing reach and top-line sales vs. operational efficiencies, it plots average sales price on the other axis to serve as a proxy for the types of products and income level of the customers buying&nbsp;them.</p><p>Figure 2. The sweet spot for each type of&nbsp;solution</p><p>Social commerce occupies the lower left because it’s essentially free to use (minus paid advertising) and provides the best opportunity for growing the customer base with a lower CAC, the two most important factors for the smallest businesses. Social commerce likely has a ceiling in terms of average sale price, partly because of trust (i.e., consumers tend to place more trust in retailers on formal marketplace platforms, which may have buyer protection programs), but also as a function of how prospective buyers are most likely to search for and purchase products: Higher-income consumers are more likely to use a laptop and web-based search engines to find products, making them more likely to shop from marketplaces and standalone website domains. Lower-income consumers are more likely to only have a mobile device and spend more time within the confines of social media feeds, where social commerce&nbsp;reigns.</p><p>Ecommerce platforms like Jumia and Konga are used as sales channels by all kinds of businesses, but are most helpful to those that have grown to have multiple employees and higher sales volumes, where the operational and logistics services the platforms offer will have a greater impact on efficiency and overall profitability. Because of the additional formality and high transaction fees — Jumia sellers pay a sales commission of 10%-20% depending on the product category — vendors are less likely to focus on really low-value items, keeping the average sales prices higher than what you see with social media businesses.</p><p>Standalone domains supported by e-commerce platforms like Paystack Commerce are most appropriate for the largest businesses with the highest average sales price. Such firms already have established customer bases and are looking to control more of their brand without giving up margin to a marketplace. Because they exist on the open web, they have to drive traffic from search and social, which typically means a higher CAC and thus requires higher average sales&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Finally, B2B sourcing platforms have a hard ceiling on average sale price given that (at least in current incarnations) they are limited to FMCG and other high-volume, commodity products. The economics of bulk ordering and delivery costs mean that smaller shops with lower turnover are less likely to enroll given the expected cost benefits.</p> The future will be formalized <p>A natural question to ask is to what extent online commercial activity will migrate away from the social commerce model and toward the more formal paradigms of e-commerce marketplaces and standalone domains that are dominant in the West. I would argue that while the business logic that has the vast majority of African businesses choosing informal activity on social platforms won’t change anytime soon, those social platforms will increasingly push that economic activity into more structured and legible&nbsp;forms.</p><p>For the most part, social commerce businesses are appropriating tools designed for personal communication to use for business purposes; as such, the platforms don’t have good ways of knowing about these transactions being coordinated through their ecosystem. WhatsApp Pay and the new Facebook Shops are obvious steps toward improving the platforms’ visibility into commercial activity, and much more will come. The goal isn’t necessarily to compete head-to-head with e-commerce platforms with a fully integrated offering, but to capture enough of the activity to develop a completely new purchase behavior dataset that can be monetized via their ad engines.<a>[4]</a> Imagine advertisers being able to target their ads on Facebook to those users who have “purchased a health and wellness product for $10-$20 within the last 30 days from a seller with 5,000–25,000 followers.”</p><p>The result will be an asymmetric, top-down vs. bottom-up competition between the formal marketplaces and social media: Formal marketplaces will try to broaden their value proposition to reach lower to the smallest-scale businesses and spin the network effects flywheel, while social media will attempt to formalize its offerings, not to compete directly as a solution provider, but to develop one of the most comprehensive and valuable datasets on consumer economic activity.</p><p>The competition is asymmetric in that the two platform types have fundamentally different business models. Social media platforms, and for all intents and purposes this means Facebook, are ad-based; they make activity free in order to accumulate eyeball-hours. The marketplaces rely on the transactional revenue of the commissions they charge sellers on each sale. Put another way, the marketplaces have to make the unit economics work for each transaction on the platform, which Jumia has estimated to require something like a 10%-20% margin, a significant cost that is prohibitive to many smaller retailers.[<a>5</a>] Facebook, on the other hand, can afford to offer (a more limited set of) services for free because the resulting activity will substantially increase the value of its ad inventory. That data and resulting value may take a while to accumulate, but as <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-land-where-facebook-loses-money-d850c6593f70">I’ve argued previously</a>, Facebook can use its tremendous cash reserves from its high-ARPU user base in the West to cross-subsidize unprofitable initiatives in the Global South for as long as it needs. In any war of attrition, Facebook doesn’t&nbsp;lose.</p><p>This disconnect between Facebook’s revenue model and its consumer-facing services presents challenges not only for regulation (e.g., antitrust policy based on consumer welfare in the form of pricing), but also assessments of its net benefit to the resource-constrained populations who rely on it. As with Free Basics, its subsidized internet access initiative, Facebook’s commerce offerings provide very real value to millions of individuals with few truly affordable alternatives. Yet the long-term implications of allowing it to continue to envelop and become the de facto provider of adjacent sectors of the digital economy are&nbsp;immense.</p><p>In the context of social commerce, that risk may be under-appreciated, given that most of the commercial activity moving onto the platform was informal and unreported to begin with. The sheer size of the informal sector — an estimated <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_627189/lang--en/index.htm">86% of employment in Africa</a> — makes it a key focus for governments grappling with economic growth policies. And digitized network technology is key in state efforts to make legible the invisible, as large-scale identification and currency initiatives have shown. Yet as more informal trade moves onto and is structured by social media, we may face a future in which the most complete and accurate source of informal economic activity is held not in Abuja, Nairobi, or Pretoria, but in Menlo Park. The future of trade may indeed be formalized, but by a platform logic with a distinctly private&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>The unique market conditions of sub-Saharan Africa mean the dominant model of digital commerce that emerges won’t look like digital commerce in Southeast Asia, China, or the West. Savvy and ambitious entrepreneurs like Tiffany will continue to cobble together the services they need to grow their businesses digitally, but widespread adoption will require solutions that are accessible and affordable to a broader base of sellers. For the vast majority of these micro businesses and solo entrepreneurs, the driver of value is the ability to cost-effectively increase their reach to a wider market of customers. And if this is indeed the race, it is Facebook’s to&nbsp;lose.</p><p>Thanks for input and suggestions from Sammy Muraya (<a href="https://smkollectionz.com/">SM Kollectionz</a>), Winnie Makena (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nairobiluggagecentre/">EGD Luggage Center</a>), Sabina Naamwinbong (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/glammy_accessories/?igshid=9tca1b9naxgk">Glammy Accessories</a>), Bode Oyelami (<a href="https://www.konga.com/merchant/hekmore-systems-ventures">Hekmore Systems</a>), Mavis Dzedu (<a href="https://www.jumia.com.gh/hotfro/">Hotfro</a>), Annabel Schiff, Grace Natabaalo, Stephen Deng, and Jonathan&nbsp;Donner.</p><p>* A fictional persona. At Caribou Digital we often create composite personas to anonymize interviewees. In a prior version of this article, I used a Biblical name for the persona which I now understand could be perceived as offensive. I very much regret this oversight, and have updated the article with a new&nbsp;name.</p> Notes <p>[1] A note on scope: Many other models of digitally-enabled commerce exist, especially in China and Southeast Asia, where platforms like Pinduoduo and Go-Jek have successfully proven different operational models. While there are <a href="https://theflip.africa/newsletter/pinduoduo-social-commerce/">arguments</a> for why group purchasing, influencer-based revenue models, and other “social” practices may gain traction in sub-Saharan Africa, these are currently not widespread and thus not covered here. For simplicity, I also exclude classifieds marketplaces (e.g., <a href="https://jiji.co.ke/">Jiji/OLX</a>), which are lower-cost for the retailer but don’t offer the same range of services as formal e-commerce marketplaces.</p><p>[2] Jumia reports 65% to 95% of orders are COD; social commerce orders are even more likely to be cash <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/delivering-cashless-e-commerce-in-africa/">https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/delivering-cashless-e-commerce-in-africa/</a>.</p><p>[3] This is especially true for solo entrepreneurs, where the nature of the hustle makes it difficult to accurately account for time/labor costs. Yes, opportunity costs are real, but for the smallest shops an inefficient process that takes 50% longer but is free will win out over paid services that automate or streamline the task. The cost calculations change once the business is large enough for paid&nbsp;labor.</p><p>[4] Facebook already buys purchase behavior data (including offline) from external data aggregators in order to inform its user profiling, but this would be first-party data of transactions on its platform and concretely tied to the individual’s account, so infinitely more valuable.</p><p>[5] For reference, Amazon says it averages 8%-15%; <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#referral-fees">https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#referral-fees</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-race-to-digitize-commerce-in-sub-saharan-africa-252b2f977c86">The race to digitize commerce in sub-Saharan Africa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Sushma Varadaiah from <a href="https://coding-bootcamps.com/">Coding Bootcamps</a>.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?</p>



<p>I personally feel that it’s the right time to get into blockchain as it holds a lot of potential in the very near future. Blockchain will be the way that we are going to establish trust and transparency in the world as we move forward. Along with other technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things, the use of blockchain multiply.</p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on, and let us know what was it that made you want to get into blockchain?</p>



<p>I have 6+ years of experience as a software developer. I am currently working on blockchain systems (Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric). I got into blockchain because I studied cryptography and security while getting a Master degree in Computer Science and Information Security. It was easy for me to pick up blockchain’s underlying technologies because of my Master’s studies. I recognized the technology’s potential and got into blockchain.</p>



<p>What project in Hyperledger are you working on? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>I am working on Hyperledger Fabric. My journey with Hyperledger Fabric started when I got my first blockchain certification from the Linux Foundation followed by a Master’s degree certification in blockchain from International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. I have developed Hyperledger Fabric Proofs of Concept for a range of use cases including&nbsp; pharmaceutical drug supply chain, certificate verification and property registration network. You can find source code for all these in my GitHub page.</p>



<p>What are the main differences between teaching Hyperledger to students and developing Hyperledger applications?</p>



<p>While teaching at <a href="https://coding-bootcamps.com/">Coding Bootcamps</a>, the main challenge is to explain blockchain concepts to a student who is new to the technology. Troubleshooting the issues that are faced by students who are learning to develop blockchain applications is a very rewarding feeling. On the other hand, developing Hyperledger applications for a business involves different complexities like deploying and scaling the application according to user growth.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>Devtools for easy smart contract development and deployment.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s incubated projects start maturing and hit 1.0s and beyond, what are the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result from your perspective?</p>



<p>I personally feel Hyperledger Fabric has a lot of potential to bring transparency to supply chain management use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>Increasing transparency and trust among users.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I hope to see applications moving towards decentralization and industry maturing towards adoption of blockchain with other technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things.</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>Never stop learning.</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>



<p>Internet!</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> gets better all the time and our focus on delivering software development kits (SDKs) underscores our commitment to helping you build secure apps faster. Earlier this year, we talked about the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/six-reasons-why-forgerock-sdks-make-sense">Six Reasons Why ForgeRock SDKs Make Sense</a>. Today, we are pleased to announce there are now six more reasons you can count on ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/sdk">SDKs</a> to make your life easier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at SDK 2.0.&nbsp;</p>

 Reason 1: Unlock Intelligent Access 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a> combines Intelligent Authentication (or authentication trees) capabilities that our customers appreciate with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/self-service">Intelligent Self-Service</a> (self-service trees). Intelligent Access includes new journeys for user registration, password reset, and progressive profiling – to name just a few advanced features. With this new release, our SDKs now support Intelligent Access, effectively doubling the number of supported use cases. Now, developers using SDKs can save time and integrate authentication, registration, and self-service journeys into their apps faster than ever before.</p>

 Reason 2: Access Device Context 

  <p>ForgeRock SDKs can collect contextual information from devices (or browsers) and seamlessly integrate with the new <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7/authentication-guide/auth-node-configuration-hints.html#auth-node-device-profile-collector">Device Profile Nodes</a> of the ForgeRock IAM Platform. Device context can be used to build sophisticated authentication journeys and detect anomalies such as deviations in previously trusted devices, geo-fence breaches, access from tampered devices, and more. By using the SDKs, you can start building better authentication journeys with device context in no time.</p>

 Reason 3: Exceptional User Experiences With Usernameless and Passwordless Authentication 

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Say goodbye to usernames and passwords with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">ForgeRock Go</a> while providing great user experiences without compromising security. Our JavaScript SDK now supports FIDO2-based strong authentication with WebAuthn. This enables you to build this secure and seamless login experience into your single-page apps (SPAs) with ease. Our SDK can help you go passwordless faster.</p>

 Reason 4: Improve Application Security 

<p>Our SDKs do more than just simplify the integration with the ForgeRock IAM Platform. They have native capabilities to improve application security by implementing industry best practices and adopting the latest technologies in the iOS and Android ecosystem. Starting with this release, the ForgeRock iOS SDK uses Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/security/sec59b0b31ff/web">Secure Enclave</a> for hardware-backed encryption and storage of tokens. When you use our SDKs, you can be sure that credentials are in good hands.&nbsp;</p>

 Reason 5: Simplify the User Experience With In-App Authenticator 

<p>Using one time passwords generated by soft tokens or push notification based approvals are great ways to improve security by introducing a second factor in the authentication flow. Traditionally however this approach comes at the cost of user experience. End users are forced to download and use a dedicated Authenticator app which introduces a lot of friction in the user experience. With the latest version of the SDK, you can now <a href="https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/SDKS/Authenticator+SDK+-+Design+Document">embed these capabilities</a> into your own mobile apps and provide your users a superior, branded and seamless authentication experience.&nbsp;</p>

 Reason 6: Secure High-Value Transactions 

<p>Great experiences and proper security during login are paramount, but your customers have come to expect, and are also looking for, that same level of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security </a>during each and every transaction. That’s why they need a Zero Trust model or Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment (CARTA). With ForgeRock SDKs you can improve security by requiring the user to perform additional verifications when engaging in a high-risk transaction or while performing an action that deviates from their normal behavior. For example, they must reauthenticate by using a second factor or respond to a push notification on their mobile device.</p>

<p>Too many companies think of privacy as a feature that can be added later. And while, yes, it is true these features can always be enhanced and evolve, when it isn’t baked into your product, it will never be the default. Privacy by Design is an approach to make sure that it is.<br></p>



<p>Originally developed by <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/pbdce/about/ann-cavoukian/">Dr. Ann Cavoukian</a>, Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, the concept of Privacy by Design was formalized in a report on privacy-enhancing technologies in 1995. Having privacy incorporated by design, and by default, means that the product or solution is designed with privacy as a priority—not an afterthought—and that becomes integral to organizational priorities, development objectives, and design processes.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Cavoukian’s main thesis was that the future of security can not and could not be assured with compliance to regulatory frameworks, but that “privacy assurance must ideally become an organization’s default mode of operation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 The 7 Foundational Principles&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/privacy-by-design-and-electronic-identity-verification/">Privacy by Design (PbD)</a> has seven key principles. This is not a pick or choose, each element is as important as the next.<br></p>



 1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial 



<p>When building any product, service, or tool, companies should anticipate any and all of the ways that privacy breaches could happen before they happen. That means that PbD focuses on prevention rather than resolution. It comes before the fact, not after. This significantly reduces the potential exposure to risk associated with data breaches and also that less data is exposed in the case of a breach.<br></p>



 2. Privacy as the Default Setting 



<p>The burden never falls to the customer or user. That means that no additional steps need to be taken for them to protect their own personal data, the protection is built into the system by default. They don’t need to worry about taking extra steps because they are automatically protected.<br></p>



 3. Privacy Embedded into Design 



<p>It becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. That means the privacy embedded in your product, tool, or service is integral to the system without diminishing functionality.<br></p>



 4. Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum 



<p>There are no trade-offs in PbD. That means it is never privacy or security as if it’s not possible to have both. It also means that having both doesn’t mean that it comes at a cost to the overall functionality.&nbsp;<br></p>



 5. End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection&nbsp; 



<p>PbD means security, security, security. From start to finish, all data is securely collected, safely stored, and properly destroyed.&nbsp;</p>



 6. Visibility and Transparency in Privacy – Keep it Open&nbsp; 



<p>Accountability, openness, and compliance are required for an effective and secure system. Adding transparency to the where, how, and why of data collection and processing actually improves the overall system. This breeds confidence amongst all stakeholders that the company is following all promised procedures and keeps companies accountable.&nbsp;<br></p>



 7. Respect for User Privacy – Keep it User-Centric 



<p>Above all, the individual’s data-security should be the number one concern. People are rightly worried about their data ending up in the wrong hands. It should always be clear to them what personal information is being collected, for what purpose, and how long it will be stored. Keep their needs top of mind.</p>



<blockquote><p>Did you know?&nbsp;</p>The EU GDPR incorporates Privacy by Design. Companies who follow these principles have a far lower risk of exposure to GDPR violations and associated fines.&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p>Have you ever had a notification about a suspicious login attempt from a digital destination you’ve never been to? Hopefully it came with the option to say it wasn’t you, allowing you to deny access to that specific place and rebuff the user trying to sneak into your account or information. If so, you probably have token revocation to thank for the security measure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token revocation means a token is no longer able to be used for access to a protected digital place, and it’s often behind the scenes in the denying process. It’s similar to session revocation in that you’re blocking access at some level, but there’s a key difference. With session revocation, you can deny one or more sessions and still access protected information. But token revocation is more permanent because it “kills” the token that might otherwise be reused for the duration of the token’s lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokens play a big role in OAuth 2.0, which is designed to protect resources from wandering or malicious hands by using tokens to securely authorize users. You could build your own method of verifying access tokens and get a decent way there with open source packages, but a ready-made solution—token introspection—is easy to use and gives you the ability to offload the work from the app team to the identity platform’s team. PingOne for Customers handles the messy job of building a token verification system by giving you an API endpoint that does the work for you on our backend. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through how to use token revocation in PingOne for Customers.</p>

<p>Women should be at an advantage in the new business environment, yet only 11% of CIOs are women. Corporate culture is slow to change, especially in a male-dominated C-suite.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Women CIOs are often the first female C-level executive beyond the chief human resources officer, and they do face unique challenges,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/16733/Deb-Curtis"> Deb Curtis</a>, VP Analyst at Gartner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In addition to wearing the CIO hat, they must be prepared to carry the torch for advancing<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/diversity-and-inclusion-build-high-performance-teams/"> diversity</a> efforts to influence corporate culture, as well as fulfill the long-standing role model vacancy for other women in tech,” she says.</p>

 How women in technology build trust 
<p>Women in technology can prepare for success by demonstrating both traditional leadership skills and high emotional intelligence. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-steps-to-become-an-effective-digital-leader/">Digital CIOs</a> can delegate day-to-day IT operations to their leadership teams and focus instead on building trust and strong business partnerships.</p>
<p>“I’ve had multiple female CIOs as bosses,” says the male successor to the female CIO of a government agency. “They’ve each been inspirational, empowering, approachable and empathetic. They’ve also consistently been tough as nails, with high expectations for me. That balance of traits helped me grow as a leader, especially in terms of my emotional intelligence to establish relationships and network with peers.”</p>
 Remember: Your experience qualified you 
<p>First-time women CIOs often feel pressure to return to school for additional technical training to prove their worth to C-suite peers.</p>
<p>“You’ve been hired for your strategic thinking and business vision, so resist the tendency to prove your technical skills,” Curtis says. “Instead, count on your staff to have the answers.”</p>

 Gain support from a male colleague 
<p>Senior women in technology often view their hiring as a big win for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-steps-sustainable-diversity-inclusion-strategies/">workplace diversity and inclusion</a>. They assume the C-suite wanted a fresh perspective, but the same peers who interviewed them later complain that they’re “pushing changes too hard,” faster than they are ready to accept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To accelerate your transition to CIO, you may need an ally</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“From our client interactions, we conclude that many senior male executives are unprepared to embrace working with a female CIO as a peer,” says Curtis. “To accelerate your transition to CIO, you may need an ally.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask a male colleague from the hiring committee to play an active role and visibly support your leadership, diverse perspectives and alternative ideas, beyond reinforcing your qualifications and experience, especially in executive meetings and interactions.</p>
<p>Visible and proactive support from a male colleague can help you to chart the interpersonal dynamics of a predominantly male C-suite and ensure long-term cultural fit.</p>

 Guide behavioral change at the top 
<p>Although diversity is embraced in the hiring of a female CIO, the same behavioral traits that contributed to their selection often trigger resistance from C-level male colleagues in day-to-day interactions. Any outspokenness, questioning and risk taking, seen initially as desirable, may be later perceived as offensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When hitting roadblocks in interactions with C-suite peers, it can be helpful to remind your male peers of the reasons you were hired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, pick your battles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take time to learn the history, culture, business and C-suite peer personalities in the company and use what you learn to<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-create-a-powerful-organizational-change-management-storyline/"> drive behavioral change</a>, starting in the executive ranks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, pick your battles. Although progress may seem slow, behavior changes at the C-suite level set the tone at the top and will accelerate change down through the organization. Support and encourage male C-suite peers to build on the first step they’ve taken by hiring you.</p>

  <p>Running REST APIs with AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway has recently become a very popular option. Although AWS provides its own mechanisms to add an authentication and authorization layer to these APIs, you may want to use your Okta centralized user database and credentials instead.</p>

<p>Today we’ll talk about how you can use Okta as the authentication and authorization layer of your REST API hosted in AWS Lambda, validating Okta access tokens using a Lambda authorizer function implemented in PHP.</p>

 About Lambda authorizers 

<p>Lambda authorizers are the method provided by AWS API Gateway to manage authorization and authentication features. They are independent AWS Lambda methods that are called by the AWS API Gateway in order to validate the provided credentials and provide information about the authorized access level. Like other AWS Lambda methods, Authorizers can be implemented in any language and are run in a limited, managed environment.</p>

<p>This is the workflow of an API call when using an AWS Lambda authorizer:</p>

 
   The client calls a method on an API Gateway API method, passing a bearer token or request parameters. 
   The API Gateway checks whether a Lambda authorizer is configured for the called method. If it is, API Gateway calls the corresponding authorizer Lambda function. 
   The authorizer Lambda function checks the provided token or parameters and determines if the requested API action will be authorized or not (just by analyzing the provided token, or by calling external services). 
   If the API action must be authorized, the Lambda function grants access by returning an output object containing at least an IAM policy object and a principal identifier. 
   The API Gateway evaluates the returned policy object. If access is denied, the API Gateway returns a suitable HTTP error status code—such as a 403 error. If access is allowed, the API Gateway executes the method. 
 

<p>You can add authentication and authorization to your API methods without using a Lambda authorizer, buta Lambda authorizer will allow you to separate and centralize responsibilities in your code. This way, if you ever introduce a change in your auth methods, you’ll only have to change and re-deploy the Lambda authorizer.</p>

<p>Additionally, using a Lambda authorizer will allow the API Gateway to cache the auth result for an hour. This cache will be used by any subsequent API call from the same user. This could represent significant savings both in time and money, especially if the implemented Lambda authorizer launches external calls.</p>

 Interface of Lambda authorizers 

<p>All Lambda authorizers must be implemented so they receive a defined data structure from the AWS API Gateway. This structure depends on the configured type of Lambda authorizer. There are two possible types: token-based and request-based.</p>

 
   Token-based Lambda authorizers (also known as a <code>TOKEN</code> authorizers) receive the caller’s identity as provided in a bearer token, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT) or an OAuth token. It also receives the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) corresponding to the called API method. 
 

   <code>{
    "type":"TOKEN",
    "authorizationToken":"{caller-supplied-token}",
"methodArn":"arn:aws:execute-api:{regionId}:{accountId}:{apiId}/{stage}/{httpVerb}/[{resource}/[{child-resources}]]"
}
</code>   

 
   Request-parameter-based Lambda authorizers (also known as <code>REQUEST</code> authorizers) receive the caller’s identity through a combination of headers, query string parameters, and stage and context variables. 
 

<p>After deciding the result of an auth request, the Lambda authorizer method must return an object with the following structure:</p>
   <code>{
    "principalId": "{uniqueUserId}",
    "policyDocument": {
   	 "Version": "2012-10-17",
   	 "Statement": [
   		 {
   			 "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
   			 "Effect": "Allow",
   			 "Resource": "arn:aws:execute-api:{regionId}:{accountId}:{apiId}/{stage}/{httpVerb}/[{resource}/[{child-resources}]]"
        }
   	 ]
    },
    "context": {
   	 "custom": "1",
   	 "data": ["custom", "example", "data"],
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Where:</p>

 
   principalId will be a unique identifier for the user (as the user ID, a unique user name, or a unique email address). 
   policyDocument is an IAM policy document describing the action that we are allowing or disallowing. It includes:
     
       Version: must be <code>2012-10-17</code>. 
       Statement: an object including:
         
           Action: What we are allowing or disallowing. In our case, it will be <code>execute-api:Invoke</code>. 
           Effect: This field specifies if the user will be authorized or not to carry out the intended action. 
           Resource:  The resource for which we want to allow or deny this action 
         
       
     
   
 

<p>In our example, we’ll focus on building a token-based authorizer that receives a JWT token in order to allow or deny access.</p>

 Generating JWT tokens with client credentials in Okta 

<p>In this example, we’ll use an app with client credentials to keep things simple. You may follow these steps.</p>

 
   If you still don’t have one, create your free developer account at <a href="https://developer.okta.com">developer.okta.com</a>. 
   Create a new application of type Service. 
   Click on API -&gt; Authorization Servers and then click the Scopes tab. 
   Add a new scope called <code>demo</code> 
 

<p>Now, to obtain a JWT token you can call Okta’s token endpoint, giving it the application’s client ID and client secret.</p>

   <code>curl -X POST 'https://&lt;Client-ID&gt;:&lt;Client-secret&gt;@&lt;your-okta-server&gt;/oauth2/default/v1/token' -d grant_type=client_credentials -d scope=demo
</code>   

<p>This will return a JSON structure including a valid access token generated by Okta that we’ll be able to use when accessing our protected API.</p>

   <code>{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJQTnk1OGR(...)e6z-UOv4pGUnbIAMAHxmVsb2h4PXpblaH4",
  "scope": "demo"
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>access_token</code> field is the one we’ll use as a Bearer token in our requests to the API.</p>

<p>In a production environment, you’ll want to use an OAuth 2.0 flow to retrieve a token. I thoroughly recommend this great <a>Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a> and all the other articles it references.</p>

 Prevent API slowness—Keep things local 

<p>It’s very important that we keep the Lambda authorizer quick, as it will be called in every API request. Because of this, our Lambda authorizer should do only local JWT validation.</p>

<p>If we call out to Okta’s token introspection, we add an additional network request to every authorization call. This is not a good idea, especially when gateway requests need to pass through very quickly, and Lambda limits the amount of time that functions can run.</p>

<p>Local JWT validation should be more than enough, as the generated JWT tokens are signed. We just need the Authorizer function to keep a local updated copy of the public part of the key used to generate the signature.</p>

 How to write a Lambda authorizer function in PHP 

<p>Now that we know the inputs our Lambda authorizer function must process and the outputs it must generate, let’s get it done.</p>

 Prepare PHP runtime environment 

<p>For the first step, we’ll need to circumvent a little problem: at the time I’m writing this article (September 2020), PHP is not one of the languages AWS Lambda supports out of the box. Because of this, we’ll have to prepare the PHP runtime environment, including the PHP binary that will run inside Lambda’s containers, and its related libraries and extensions. The easiest way to do this is to compile it on the same platform as Lambda, so we’ll use EC2 for this.</p>

<p>In the Amazon EC2 console, choose Launch instance.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, when choosing an AMI, you must use the same image that is currently being used by the Lambda Execution Environment (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html</a>).</p>

<p>While writing this article, AWS Lambdas can be configured to use a runtime based on Amazon Linux or a runtime based on Amazon Linux 2. Unfortunately, the Amazon Linux 2 runtime is a custom runtime that is not based on any available AMI image.</p>

<p>In order to avoid problems and build a PHP environment compatible with the Lambda runtime, we need to use the image that is available as an AMI image.  When writing this article, this was the Amazon Linux-based AMI image <code>amzn-ami-hvm-2018.03.0.20181129-x86_64-gp2</code>.</p>

<p>You won’t find this image in the default Quick Start list that appears immediately when launching a new instance. Copy the image name and paste it into the search box. You’ll find it as a community AMI.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Launch the EC2 instance and connect to it.</p>

<p>Now we’ll compile the last version of PHP. In order to do that:</p>

 
   Update packages and install needed compilation dependencies 
 

   <code>sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install autoconf bison gcc gcc-c++ libcurl-devel libxml2-devel git openssl-devel -y
</code>   

 
   Then, we need to download the latest stable version of PHP. At the time of writing, it was 7.4.10. 
 

   <code>mkdir ~/php-7-bin
curl -sL https://www.php.net/distributions/php-7.4.10.tar.bz2 | tar -xvj
cd php-7.4.10
</code>   

 
   Let’s compile PHP with OpenSSL and libcurl support and install to <code>/home/ec2-user/php-7-bin</code> 
 

   <code>./buildconf --force
./configure --prefix=/home/ec2-user/php-7-bin/ --with-openssl --with-curl --with-zlib --without-sqlite3 --without-pdo-sqlite
make install
</code>   

<p>Here, we are disabling SQLite3 extension compilation, as SQLite3 development library is not installed by default in the selected AMI image. Depending on the requirements of your PHP Lambda functions, you may have to customize the <code>./configure</code> line to add extra libraries. <code>./configure --help</code> will give you a full list of parameters.</p>

<p>Once these commands are completed, please run <code>~/php-7-bin/bin/php -v</code> to verify everything has worked correctly. The runtime environment will be ready if you should see a message similar to this one:</p>

   <code>PHP 7.4.10 (cli) (built: Sep 10 2020 23:14:12) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
</code>   
 Validating Okta JWT access tokens in a Lambda function 

<p>Now, let’s start building our PHP authorizer. We’ll create a working folder to make the needed infrastructure. In order to do this, download the project from GitHub, and copy the generated PHP runtime into it:</p>

   <code>cd ~
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/php-jwt-okta-lambda-auth-validator.git
cd php-jwt-okta-lambda-auth-validator
cp ~/php-7-bin/bin/php ./bin
</code>   

<p>Now we’ll install composer, and use it to retrieve the PHP libraries that our <code>bootstrap</code> file uses to call the authorizer and other libraries related to the management of JWT tokens.</p>

   <code>curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | ./bin/php
bin/php composer.phar install
</code>   

<p>After this, you should just configure your settings in the <code>classes/Config.php</code> file:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace OktaLambdaAuth;

class Config {

    // Define here your Okta server hostname, like 'dev-XXXXX.okta.com' or 
    // 'xxxxx.okta-emea.com'
    const OKTA_SERVER_HOSTNAME = 'dev-XXXXX.okta.com';

}
</code>   

<p>Let’s examine the bootstrap file:</p>

   <code>#!/opt/bin/php
&lt;?php

// This invokes Composer's autoloader so that we'll be able to use Guzzle and any other 3rd party libraries we need.
// Depending on the configured runtime, its location may vary
if ( file_exists(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php' ) ) {
    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
} else {
    require '/opt/vendor/autoload.php';
}

// Initialize signing-key manager, and retrieve the current JWT signing keys from Okta
$keyManager = OktaLambdaAuth\KeyManager::instance();
if ( ! $keyManager-&gt;updateKeys() ) {
    die();
}

// This is the request processing loop. Barring unrecoverable failure, this loop runs until the environment shuts down.
do {

    // Ask the runtime API for a request to handle.
    $request = getNextRequest();

    require_once $_ENV['LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT'] . '/src/authorizer.php';

    // Execute the desired function and obtain the response.
    $response = authorizer($request['payload']);

    // Submit the response back to the runtime API.
    sendResponse($request['invocationId'], $response);
} while (true);

function getNextRequest()
{
    $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
    $response = $client-&gt;get('http://' . $_ENV['AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API'] . '/2018-06-01/runtime/invocation/next');

    return [
   	 'invocationId' =&gt; $response-&gt;getHeader('Lambda-Runtime-Aws-Request-Id')[0],
   	 'payload' =&gt; json_decode((string) $response-&gt;getBody(), true)
    ];
}

function sendResponse($invocationId, $response)
{
    $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
    $client-&gt;post(
   	 'http://' . $_ENV['AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API'] . '/2018-06-01/runtime/invocation/' . $invocationId . '/response',
   	 ['body' =&gt; $response]
    );
}
</code>   

<p>As we can see, we retrieve the JWT signing keys from the Okta server. These keys will be the ones used to validate the received JWT tokens.</p>

<p>Then we have an endless loop that will execute until the environment is finished. This loop will launch the authorizer function and any other existing functions corresponding to other methods in the API.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the KeyManager class (<code>classes/KeyManager.php</code>).</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
namespace OktaLambdaAuth;

use CoderCat\JWKToPEM\JWKConverter;

class KeyManager {

    // Static class
    protected static $instance;

    private $base_url;

    /**
     * @return KeyManager
     */
    public static function instance() {
   	 if ( static::$instance === null ) {
   		 static::$instance = new static();
   	 }

   	 return static::$instance;
    }
</code>   

<p>This class is designed as a singleton, as it will contain the currently valid keys that will be used in all the API calls; we’ll want to access it from anywhere.</p>

   <code>    private $keys;
    private $valid_until;

    public function __construct() {
   	 $this-&gt;keys = [];
   	 $this-&gt;valid_until = 0;
    }
</code>   

<p>I’ll keep the keys returned by the server in the <code>$keys</code> object. I’ll keep the Unix timestamp when the keys expire in <code>$valid_until</code>, as returned by the Okta server cache headers.</p>

<p>Let’s go with the <code>updateKeys()</code> method. This method retrieves the current JWT-signing keys provided by the Okta server and saves them, along with their expiration timestamp,  for future use from other functions.</p>

   <code>    public function updateKeys() {

    	// Build the URL from Okta that we'll use to retrieve the current set of signing keys
      $server = Config::OKTA_SERVER_HOSTNAME;
      $url = 'https://' . $server . '/oauth2/default/v1/keys';

      $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();

      $query_response = $client-&gt;get( $url );

      $response = json_decode( (string) $query_response-&gt;getBody() );

      if ( isset( $response-&gt;errorCode ) ) {
       // Error
       fwrite( STDERR, 'Error retrieving JWT-signing key: ' . $response-&gt;errorSummary );
       return false;
      }

      // Let's convert the received keys into PEM format, usable from the key verifier library
      $keys = $response-&gt;keys;
      $pem_keys = [];
      $jwkConverter = new JWKConverter();

      foreach ( $keys as $key) {
       $pem_keys[] = $jwkConverter-&gt;toPEM( (array) $key );
      }

      if ( count( $pem_keys ) ) {
      	// Save both the keys and their expiring moment for future use
       $this-&gt;keys = $pem_keys;
       $this-&gt;valid_until = strtotime( $query_response-&gt;getHeader('expires')[0] );
      }

      return $this-&gt;keys;
    }
</code>   

<p>The method <code>getKeys()</code> returns the current JWT-signing key information. But if the expiration time of the current information is in the past, it will refresh the saved keys. The <code>getValidUntil()</code> method will return the timestamp until which the current keys are valid.</p>

   <code>    public function getKeys() {
   	 if ( count( $this-&gt;keys ) &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;valid_until &gt; time() ) {
   		 return $this-&gt;keys;
   	 }
   	 return $this-&gt;updateKeys();
    }

    public function getValidUntil() {
   	 return date('Y-m-d H:i:s e', $this-&gt;valid_until );
    }
</code>   

<p>Now, let’s examine the <code>authorizer()</code> function code, in <code>src/authorizer.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

function authorizer($data) {

    $type = $data['type'];
    $jwt = $data['authorizationToken'];
    $method = $data['methodArn'];

</code>   

<p>The function receives the data from AWS through these three parameters. The authorization token will include the JWT token, possibly with the “Bearer “ prefix. So first, we’ll remove it.</p>

   <code>
    // Remove the "Bearer " prefix from $jwt, if it exists
    if ( strpos( $jwt,'Bearer ' ) === 0 ) {
   	 $jwt = str_replace( 'Bearer ', '', $jwt );
    }
</code>   

<p>Now it examines the correctness of the received JWT token:</p>

   <code>    $key_manager = OktaLambdaAuth\KeyManager::instance();
    $keys = $key_manager-&gt;getKeys();

    $decoded_token = null;
    $jwt_valid = false;

    foreach ( $keys as $key ) {
   	 try {
   		 $decoded_token = JWT::decode( $jwt, $key, array( 'RS256' ) );
   		 unset( $error );
   		 $jwt_valid = true;
   	 } catch ( ExpiredException | BeforeValidException $e ) {
   		 $error = 'Token expired, or used before its validity';
   		 break;
   	 } catch ( SignatureInvalidException $e ) {
   		 $error = 'Token not valid';
   		 continue;
   	 } catch ( Exception $e ) {
   		 $error = 'Token problem: ' . $e-&gt;getMessage();
   		 continue;
   	 }
    }
</code>   

<p>If the token was valid, it’ll allow access. If not, it’ll deny it.</p>

   <code>    if ( ! $jwt_valid || ! $decoded_token) {
   	 $result = [
   		 'principalId' =&gt; 'unknown',
   		 'policyDocument' =&gt; [
   			 'Version' =&gt; '2012-10-17',
   			 'Statement' =&gt; [
   				 [
   					 'Action' =&gt; 'execute-api:Invoke',
   					 'Effect' =&gt; 'Deny',
   					 'Resource' =&gt; $method,
   				 ]
   			 ],
   		 ]
   	 ];

    } else {

   	 $result = [
   		 'principalId'	=&gt; $decoded_token-&gt;sub,
   		 'policyDocument' =&gt; [
   			 'Version'   =&gt; '2012-10-17',
   			 'Statement' =&gt; [
   				 [
   					 'Action'   =&gt; 'execute-api:Invoke',
   					 'Effect'   =&gt; 'Allow',
   					 'Resource' =&gt; $method,
   				 ]
   			 ],
   		 ]
   	 ];
    }

    return json_encode( $result );
}
</code>   

 Configuring authorizer Lambda function 

<p>So, we have all the code and the environment ready:</p>

 
   We have a PHP binary compiled on the correct supported version of Amazon Linux 
   We have a bootstrap file coded in PHP that will handle the authenticator initialization and will invoke the actual authenticator when receiving requests. 
   We have a vendor directory with all the needed PHP libraries. 
   We have our own src and class directories including the authenticator method itself, and other auxiliary classes. 
 

<p>Instead of uploading our software as a single, monolithic component, we’ll upload it using layers, which will allow us easier and quicker updates if we need them. Let’s build two layers for the code that don’t depend on us—one for the PHP runtime and other for the Composer vendor folder.</p>

<p>After this, we’ll create another ZIP package including our code for the authorizer:</p>

   <code>zip -r runtime.zip bin 
zip -r vendor.zip vendor/
zip -r authorizer.zip bootstrap classes/ src/authorizer.php
</code>   

<p>From the AWS Lambda console, we’ll create the two layers first.</p>

 
   In Additional Resources &gt; Layers menu, select Create Layer. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Create a Layer Runtime, uploading the generated <code>runtime.zip</code> file. Select Custom runtime as the only compatible runtime. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Create another Layer “Vendor”, uploading the generated <code>vendor.zip</code> file. Select Custom runtime as the only compatible runtime. 
 

<p>Once this is done, let’s create the authorizer Lambda function.</p>

 
   Click on the Create function button 
   Select Author from scratch. 
   Assign a name for the function. We’ll call it “phpAuthorizer”. 
   As Runtime, select Custom runtime / Use default bootstrap. 
 

<p>Add the two already created layers to the function,  clicking Layers in the function designer below the name of the function, and then clicking Add a layer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The created layers will be visible after selecting the Custom layers option.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, in the function code frame, click Actions and select Upload a .zip file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select the already generated <code>authorizer.zip</code> file. You should be able to see and edit the code of the bootstrap and our other files from the AWS Lambda Console.</p>

<p>After this, the Authorizer Lambda function should be ready. Let’s test it.</p>

 
   Click Test in the header bar. 
   You’ll be able to configure the received test event. You must select a name for it (for example, “idtoken”). Then, use the Event template Amazon API Gateway Authorizer. This will create an event with the following JSON: 
 

   <code>{
  "type": "TOKEN",
  "authorizationToken": "incoming-client-token",
  "methodArn": "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-2:123456789012:example/prod/POST/{proxy+}"
}
</code>   

 
   
    <p>Replace the string incoming-client-token in the generated event with the access token you generated earlier, and create the test event.</p>
   
   
    <p>After this, you’ll be able to test the function by selecting the configured idtoken event and clicking Test in the header bar.</p>
   
   
    <p>The test should always be successful, returning Deny for invalid or expired JWT tokens, and Allow for valid, non-expired JWT tokens generated by the Okta server.</p>
   
 

 Configuring API Gateway to pass through only authenticated requests to the backend API 

<p>Once we have our Lambda authorizer, let’s configure an API Gateway to use it.</p>

<p>If you already have an API, you can use it. If not, let’s create a REST example API using the example “PetStore” provided by AWS:</p>

 
   Navigate to the API Gateway AWS service, then click Build under REST API. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Choose the REST protocol, select to use the Example API and the Regional Endpoint Type, and click Import. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Once the API PetStore is created, enter the Authorizers menu, and then click Create New Authorizer. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Select the Lambda type, and use the already configured authorizer Lambda function (phpAuthorizer in our example). 
   Select Token as the Lambda Event Payload. 
   Enter Authorization as the Token Source. 
   Leave the Authorization Caching enabled, with the default TTL of 300 seconds. 
 

<p></p>

<p>Grant all the requested permissions, and the authorizer will be created. Now we just need to configure all the endpoints of the API to use  the new authorizer. Before you’ll be able to choose the authorizer, you need to deploy the API. Deploy the API without authentication first—click on Resources in the API menu, and then select the Deploy API action.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll have to create a new Deployment Stage. Let’s use beta as the Stage name.</p>

<p>Next you’ll need to check all the existing methods you want to protect and set the defined Authorizer as its authorization method. Let’s see how this is done for the /pets GET method:</p>

 
   In the created API Resources menu, select the /pets GET method. Then, click on the Method Request definition. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Then click on the pencil icon in the Authorization setting, select the defined Authorizer as the authorization method, and click the check mark icon to save the selection. 
 

<p></p>

<p>You’ll have to repeat all these steps for all the endpoints you want to protect. For this example, I only left the root GET method unprotected, so we can test the difference between protected and unprotected methods.</p>

<p>After this, deploy a new version of the API. This time, you can reuse the previous stage you created in the last deployment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Congratulations! All the protected API Methods will now require a valid JWT token.</p>

<p>You can test this by making a request from curl using the access token you generated at the beginning of this blog post. To do this, the URL for every API access point can be retrieved from the API Stages section, selecting the stage you just deployed and clicking on the corresponding endpoint. You’ll see the URL in the Invoke URL frame.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you click on the provided Invoke URL for the / GET method, that we left unprotected, you’ll see the landing page of the Pet Store API which has a short description of the API.</p>

<p>To finish up,, let’s make a request to the Invoke URL for the <code>/pets</code> GET resource, first without an access token, and then with the access token. (You’ll have to retrieve the actual URL from the corresponding endpoint in the last deployed stage.)</p>

   <code>curl -i 'https://XXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/beta/pets'
</code>   

   <code>{"message":"Unauthorized"}
</code>   

   <code>curl -i 'https://XXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/beta/pets' -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI5VzhZV3Qxc2RqO..."
</code>   

   <code>[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "type": "dog",
    "price": 249.99
  },
  {
    "id": 2,

<p>Three months into the Covid-19 Pandemic, I had barely left the apartment. But
summer humidity splashed int our little apartment — and it became clear that
outdoor spread is almost nonexistent — I started taking daily walks. I quickly
expanded my range, delighted to find that one can walk from the south end of
Central Park at 59th Street to the northern­most tip of Manhattan almost
entirely in parks. It’s really quite stunning, and there’s so much to take in:
architecture, views, rivers, flowers and trees, wildlife — the works. Those of
you who follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theory/">my IG</a> know.</p>
<p>On my jaunt through <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/st-nicholas-park">St. Nicholas Park</a> yesterday, a branch shook vigorously
ahead, alerting me to an unusual presence. As I approached, this keen stare
greeted me, a mere 5-8m.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I expected to see, but it wasn’t this! I’ve heard that
red-tailed hawks<a>1</a> live in the trees or buildings of the nearby
<a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu">City College of New York</a>, but I never saw one I could recognize, and certainly
not this close. Turns out, red-tailed hawks are quite common <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/wildlifenyc/animals/red-tailed-hawks.page">residents of New
York City</a>, committed to pest control and delighting residents and visitors
alike. Myself included.</p>
<p>This one, however, paid little attention to me. Rather, it seemed quite curious
about this black <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/programs/rangers/wildlife-management/squirrels">squirrel</a> running up a tree between us, about a meter away.</p>

<p>The squirrel kept running a loop up and down the tree. It would disappear from sight
(mine, not the hawk’s), then reappear further down the trunk and scamper up again.
The hawk seemed curious, amused, then, perhaps, bored.</p>

			</p>
		
	

 

<p>Eventually I put my phone away and continued my walk, but kept thinking about
this vignette. What story could one tell? Was the squirrel trying to protect its
home by distracting the hawk? Was the hawk already well-sated, and now committed
to satisfying its intellectual curiosity with a little <a href="https://explorable.com/naturalistic-observation">naturalistic
observation</a>? Maybe the hawk and the squirrel were friends and neighbors,
happy to enjoy a bit of camaraderie on a beautiful fall day in The City.</p>
<p>When I circled back an hour or so later, the hawk had moved across the path, and
now was poking around in the ground cover. It saw me watching. Some
ethno­graphy, perhaps?</p>
<p>Naw, it kept picking something up and shaking its head; a dragonfly or cricket I
think, but couldn’t get close enough to tell. Could be it was hungry after all.</p>

<p>Either way, it made my day. Man I love this city.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>At least I think this is a red-tailed hawk. Though I
see many bird watchers on my city schlepps, I myself am not one. Please do
give me a holler if you happen to know just how mistaken I am. <a>↩︎</a></p>

  The Green New Deal may not be Joe Biden's climate plan, but you better believe he knows it deeply and could dive deep into the details.

<p>This exchange from first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates" title="Wikipedia: “2020 United States presidential debates”">presidential debate</a> a few days ago really struck me
(from the <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-joe-biden-1st-presidential-debate-transcript-2020" title="Donald Trump &amp; Joe Biden 1st Presidential Debate Transcript 2020">Rev transcript</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
 
 President Donald J. Trump: (57:56) 
 So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air.
Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the
way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion
dollars. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:08) 
 That is not my plan [crosstalk]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk] is not my
plan. [crosstalk]— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>A hundred trillion dollars? As <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/david-roberts">David Roberts</a> of Vox <a href="https://twitter.com/drvox/status/1311876351360552961">points out</a>, “US GDP is
$21.44 trillion.” But I digress.</p>
<p>A bewildering back and forth followed (something about insulting the military),
before moderator Chris Wallace managed to right the ship:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (58:53) 
 The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will
do— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (58:57) 
 The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going
to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants— 
 
</blockquote>
<p>This impressed the hell out of me. Shortly after saying the GND isn’t his plan,
Biden starts to get into its policy details to defend it? Wow. I mean, he may
not agree with it all, but to respond with, “okay, so you wanna talk about the
Green New Deal? I’ve got all the details, let’s go!” Props to level of policy
engagement.</p>
<p>But listening again jut now, I realize that I missed the next bit:</p>
<blockquote>
 
 Chris Wallace: (59:05) 
 So, do you support the Green New Deal? 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:07) 
 Pardon me? 
 Chris Wallace: (59:08) 
 Do you support the— 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:08) 
 No, I don’t support the Green New Deal. 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:10) 
 Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:12) 
 I support [crosstalk]— 
 President Donald J. Trump: (59:13) 
 You just lost the radical left. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:15) 
 I support [crosstalk] the Biden plan that I put forward. 
 Chris Wallace: (59:19) 
 Okay. 
 Vice President Joe Biden: (59:19) 
 The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New
Deal. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>He explicitly says that the GND not his plan and he doesn’t support it. When he
said, “The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward,” did he mean
to say “The Biden Plan”? Digging a little deeper, I don’t think so.  From the
actual <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-plan/" title="The Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice">Biden Plan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the
climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are
at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace
greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2)
our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is. The GND may not be his plan, but it deeply informs his plan, and
I’ve little doubt he could expound on it. GND champion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
eliminates any doubt in this clap-back to a <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/1311130638754381824">snarky tweet by Kellyanne Conway</a>:</p>

<p>A crash-course in the complex world of variously-open software licensing</p><p>The ostensibly binary distinction between “open” and “closed” software gets bandied about in many contexts, often in a dangerously simplified form, as though there were only two, mutually-exclusive options. It can also be extended to standards in an imprecise or oversimplified way. Sometimes people refer to groups like DIF “working on open-source standards,” but speaking precise, no such thing&nbsp;exists!</p><p>Only software code can be open-source, since after all, “source” is short for “source code” (pre-compiled software). Standards, whether open or not, are not code — instead, they are functional definitions and specifications that define and specify protocols that one application (or code base) uses to talk to another (or code base). Each standard can be understood as a benchmark for testing specific implementations, dividing existing and future codebases into those fully, partly, or non-compliant with its requirements.</p>“Lean Startup workshop” in Amsterdam, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus">Daria Nepriakhina</a><p>Code, whether open-source or not, can implement or “build to” a pre-existing standard, which can be developed in a variously open or closed manner; there is no inherent link or dependency between the openness or rigor of the two processes. Similarly, a standard can be “written around” one or more existing implementations, in such a way that the existing code is definitively compliant with the resulting standard tailored to it. This latter operation is an important function in open-source communities, in that it invites future developers to make new code that will be interchangeable or interoperable with that precedent. Even if that pre-existing code is closed, the resulting standard can be of great use to open-source development, particularly if the process used to write it was also “open” and participated in by the designers and implementers of that closed-source precedent.</p><p>In this series of three brief explanatory posts, we’ll first explain open-source development as a process rather than defining it by its results. In the next post, we will explain the characteristics and optionalities of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. Lastly, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p> Source Code and Intellectual Property&nbsp;Law <p>At their lowest level, computers are just machines that exercise millions of structured computations every second. They take inputs, perform computation, and produce&nbsp;outputs.</p>(public domain)<p>These computations can be combined into complex structures of data and decision-making called “programs” that interface with humans to make useful and meaningful outputs. At the lowest level, these computations still look like oceans of 1s and 0s to the untrained eye, but decades of refinement of operating systems, programming languages, scripting languages, and other abstractions make it easy for engineers to deal only with “source code” as a kind of human-readable abstraction at higher levels. This is “compiled” into more efficient, machine-readable “binaries” (ones and zeros) that can be deployed to standardized hardware in the real world where it is “run” (live software is often referred to as “runtime”).</p>by <a href="https://scs.senecac.on.ca/~chris.szalwinski">Chris Szalwinski</a> from <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp100/pages/content/compi.html">The C Program</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ca/">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada&nbsp;License</a>.<p>Because it is human-readable and because licenses apply to compiled binaries and functional software in specific jurisdictions, the software industry has largely applied practices analogous to academic “peer review” for sharing and critiquing core pieces of source code. This complicates the open/closed distinction further, since a closed-source project and a licensed binary might still offer key components up for review through github or other channels traditionally used for open development. Furthermore, the many gradients between complete “open” or “closed” software depends on the ownership and licensing of a given piece of software, which can evolve over time or differ in its enforceability across jurisdictions. Like all legal matters, mileage may vary and always consult a licensed&nbsp;expert!</p> A thumbnail history of licensing <p>There is a range of different licensing regimes for source code. Among open-source licenses, different functions can be enabled or facilitated independently of one another: external review, attribution, innovation, maintenance, and even revenue-sharing and other conditions on business practices.</p><p>Proprietary code bases are released under closed-source licenses, which are optimized for secrecy, exclusivity, and/or sale of the results through licensing-based revenue models. For decades, this was how Microsoft licensed not only its proprietary stand-alone software, but even the bulk of the Windows operating system. The licensing landscape is much more diverse today, but before the 1990s very little commercial software was developed in the open or had its source code published after the&nbsp;fact.</p><p>The culture of academia is one of sharing and publishing intellectual work for peers to see and review — open peer-review is as central in academic computer science as it is in the hard sciences. The internet was originally imagined, architected, prototyped, and built by academics, and tinkerers, primarily supported by military and government funding. These three cultures (the military, academia, and independent “hacker”/tinkerer types) formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Galaxy">basis of internet culture</a>. A fourth culture was added later when the general public’s access to the internet evolved into a massive commercial industry in the early&nbsp;1990s.</p><p>For our purposes here, we can limit ourselves to the fairly direct link, sometimes biographical, between the anomalous, non-commercial origins of the internet and the development of the open-source movement within the software industry. One “origin myth” that exemplifies this link is the story of a young Richard Stallman, then working in an early Artificial Intelligence lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wanted to customize some printer software for an expensive new printer shared across all the floors of a busy research building. To do so, he needed to get the source code from the manufacturer, which he had done to customize the previous “workhorse” printer in the same building.</p><p>The manufacturer of the new model, however, surprised Stallman by refusing to hand over the code on grounds of licensing and intellectual property rights. Stallman, to whom the motto “software wants to be free” is often misattributed, often <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823">credits the incident</a> for his deeply-held belief that the end-users of software have a right to modify and participate in the software they use, whether they paid directly for it or benefited from the procurements of governments. To this day, the details and boundaries of this right are still being debated, not only in open-source requirements for government procurements, but also in “right to repair” laws that extend these rights into the domain of hardware and the physical (and 3D-printed) world.</p> Varying degrees of “Software Freedom” <p>Stallman went on to found the Free Software Foundation and play a pivotal role in the elaboration of an open-source (and “free open source”) movement. He also created the first GNU Public Licence (GPL), still a major and influential family of licenses. All versions of the GPL have within them some version of these 4 essential “freedoms”:</p><blockquote>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (“freedom 0”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (“freedom 1”). Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (“freedom 2”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (“freedom 3”). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><p>Honoring these four freedoms textually and fully can make it very hard to sell software commercially for many reasons, salient among them that freely-available source code in a major language is trivial to compile into functioning binaries; commercial or “closed” software is generally sold as compiled binaries, keeping the source code&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Furthermore, many early open-source licenses like GPL explicitly forbid so-called “enclosure” of the code, i.e., incorporating pieces or subsets of the licensed code into a new, close-source product. Anti-enclosure licensing is often referred to as “copyleft” (because it prohibits future copyrighting!) or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license">viral</a> licensing,” since it cannot be mixed and matched with other licensing without overriding more restrictive licensing. This severely limits commercial potential of “forks” or derived variants. The entire Linux family of operating systems are licensed this way, which keeps Linux development squarely in the camp of maximally-open development throughout.</p><p>Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, the open-source movement grew and at some point the software industry could not afford to ignore it, even if directly participating with licenses like GPL was not feasible for most companies of any size. This period saw the first “compromise-licenses” and hybrid open/closed business-models evolve around them. Many of the licenses still popular today date to these early experiments. For instance, the license originally created for the University of California, Berkeley’s fork of Unix, and still known today as the Berkeley Software Development (BSD) license, is one such “commercially lenient” open-source licenses. These licenses allow developers to take code that was originally open, make significant changes to modified versions of it, and license or even sell those under more classically commercial licenses.</p><p>Similarly, more lenient variants of the Apache and MIT licenses date to this period as well. It is worth noting that Apache web servers were one of the first open-source pieces of software that replaced a dominant commercial product. Apache web server software reaching a dominant position in the previously closed-license, commercial niche was a watershed moment for open-source software.</p><p>Apache is often held up, alongside Linux, as an example of where open-source software optimizes for standardization and safety of mission-critical infrastructure, largely due to the thorough and ongoing auditing and maintenance enabled by its core components being completely open to review, testing, and improvement proposals. Conversely, however, some historians of software development point out that allowing enclosure to the degree that Apache licenses do can lead to simultaneous or “parallel” development of various (partially closed-source) forks to evolve in tandem according to various divergent business agendas. Over time, this can splinter development, wicking off talent, attention, and manpower into closed development and creating a major coordination problem for the open-source “parent” of the family tree. In the most severe cases, this can greatly diminish and forfeit the standardization and security gains that made sharing an open-source parent so desirable in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Today and&nbsp;Tomorrow <p>Today, cloud-based business models and Software-as-a-Service have revived and expanded the toolkit for closed-source development, and in turn breathed new life into the debate about how hybrid models could make open-source infrastructure sustainable by revenue shares from closed-source products that depend on it. Similarly, the so called “cloud loophole” in older GPL licenses, whereby software could be run but not “distributed,” was closed by the newer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero GPL</a> that applies to cloud environments.</p><p>Another interesting frontier in the evolving licensing landscape is being opened up in recent years by distributing computing and distributed ledgers. One key assumption of traditional licensing is that software runs on a finite set of distinct pieces of hardware, with ownership and liability that follow straightforwardly from there. Distributed computing, however, where computation work is spread out over a more diffuse and indeterminate numbers of computers, which might have limited or no insight into the “big picture” of the software they are running, muddy the waters even further than traditional cloud environment. On the radically open side of the spectrum, the distributed-computing ecosystem project HoloChain has innovated the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">Cryptographic Autonomy Licence </a>to empower users (and the software running in their name) by protecting them with encryption.</p><p>New forms of “confidential computing” and encrypted, self-sovereign networking take this even further, making the boundaries of software and runtime environments similarly porous. Attempts at licensing for these new topographies have been <a href="https://sdtimes.com/os/osi-co-founder-leaves-initiative-over-new-license/">controversial</a> at times, but they are also an important precedent and context for work happening in the DIF, such as that of the Secure Data Storage <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working&nbsp;group</a>.</p><p>There are even more radical experiments and movements happening in the open-licensing problem space, which would restrict usage not [only] according to commercial terms or enclosure, but according to non-monetary and non-licensing rubrics as well. For instance, the “ICE breaker” <a href="https://icebreaker.dev">project </a>has brought more attention to the movement to license software according to so-called “<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/">ethical licenses</a>.” These restrict derivative use anywhere it can be proven to support of human rights violations, such as in military applications or for “predictive policing” and other use-cases that run afoul of international authorities on human rights and discrimination. The provisions or triggers for such licensing might be as hard to enforce as international human rights law (i.e., very hard), but it sends a signal that specifications and standards from other disciplines such as human rights law and ethical philosophy might someday find their place among the commercial and attribution clauses in open-source licenses.</p> Further reading <p>All code developed under the DIF umbrella is strictly open source, and while DIF accepts donations of previously-closed source code, it is expected that all ongoing iterations of them will take place in the open. The original vision for DIF as a project within the <a href="https://www.jointdevelopment.org/about1.html">Joint Development Foundation</a> was to host code development, and it has since expanded to include co-developed pre-standards specifications and other educational and non-technical <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/education/home">materials</a> as well. Take a spin through our github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/">repositories</a> if you’d like to see an overview of historical and ongoing projects.</p><p>In this quick overview, we have only scratched the surface, though, and we encourage anyone working in the open software space to educate themselves further. The Open Source Initiative <a href="https://opensource.org/trademark-guidelines#Usage_That_Does_Not_Require_Permission">holds the trademark </a>on the phrase “open source” and maintains a very helpful list of licenses that it has decided are fully conformant with its principles. The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">list of approved licenses</a> that they maintain is a great place to start if you are researching the licensing landscape, and they also hold <a href="https://opensource.org/events">events</a> and offer a substantial offering of <a href="https://opensource.org/osi-open-source-education">educational materials</a>.</p><p>In our next installment, we’ll turn to Open Standards and the work of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">Drilling down: Open Source</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>On Monday, September 28 the 14th Vienna Digital Identity Meetup* (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Vienna-Digital-Identity-Meetup/">link</a>) hosted a focused session on digital identifiers and verifiable credentials in education.  We have two great updates from Kim Hamilton Duffy (Architect Digital Credentials Consortium, Chair of the W3C CCG and Verifiable Credentials for Education Task Force) and Lluis Arińo (convenor of Diplomas Use Case at European Blockchain Service Infrastructure and CIO Rovira i Virgili University, Spain).<br><br>Kim gave a great update on the W3C Verifiable Credentials in Education Task Force is working on, what educational institutions are currently participating on the Task Force and it objectives.  The presentation included some great questions from the event participants, as well as highlighting that the Task Force is interested in participation of institutions, organizations or individuals from Asia Region.  <br><br>Lluis  provided an overview of the goals and current projects (Notarisation of Documents, ESSIF, Diplomas management and Trusted Sharing Data) of EBSI (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure).  Lluis then gave a detailed overview of the Diploma Use Case covering, architectural elements, the centrality of verifiable credentials to the Use Case and the paradigm shift from institution centric to user centricity, making EBSI the common underlying building block for lifecycle management of diplomas.  <br><br>Recording of the Event: <a href="https://vimeo.com/464715275">https://vimeo.com/464715275</a></p><p>0:00:00 - Introductions<br>0:06:00 - Kim Hamilton Duffy - Verifiable Education Task Force<br>0:48:31 - Lluis Ariño - EBSI Diploma Use Case<br>1:32:21 - Upcoming schedule</p><p>For more information on Education Task Force: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/</a></p><p>For more information on EBSI: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Piloting+with+EBSI+explained">https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Piloting+with+EBSI+explained</a></p><p><br>Finally we covered the upcoming Vienna Digital identity Events:<br><br>	- October 26 - Bridging to SSI<br>	- November 9 - High Assurance Digital Identity (HADI) and Pharma<br>	- November 23 - Guardianship<br>	- December 14 - GADI</p><p><br>And as a reminder, due to increased COVID-19 infections we are back to online only events.

<p>I was starting to write this post when we were evacuated from the fire. Miraculously, after a really rough week, we were able to move back in on Friday. The house is still intact, the electricity is back on, and although the air is toxic, air purifiers allow the inside to be comfortable. I feel awful for the thousands of families who were not so lucky.</p><p>I'm now finishing and publishing this post as a way of adding some final punctuation to this terrible week. <a href="http://www.vaguelyinteresting.co.uk/as-i-was-saying-before-i-was-so-rudely-interrupted/">As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted ...</a></p><p>In the spirit of <a href="https://nownownow.com/">Derek Sivers</a>, I thought I'd write a quick update about what I'm doing these days. It's not quite a "now" page in the Sivers model, but it'll do .. for now.</p><p>Where I work:</p><p>I'm Head of Engineering and Sponsor Product at <a href="https://forusall.com">ForUsAll</a>. Understanding what ForUsAll does, and therefore what I do, requires a little bit of explanation: in the US, rather than traditional pensions, workers tend to get something called a 401(k) plan (memorably named after its tax code). A part of your pre-tax pay is sent to a fund that invests on your behalf; many employers match your contribution up to a certain level. At retirement you get to withdraw those funds; the hope is that your investments have grown in value in the interim.</p><p>They tend to be jargon-laden, badly-run, and offer web interfaces that look like they were built in Microsoft Frontpage in 1998. And that's if you even have access to one: most American workers at smaller businesses don't, and therefore have limited access to decent ways to save for retirement. ForUsAll's web platform makes it cheaper and less time-consuming for employers to run (or "sponsor") a plan. And we're working on other ways for regular people to build financial stability for themselves, even before retirement. It's not about employees at well-funded startups or Fortune 500 companies; it's everyone else.</p><p>So my role is to run the engineering team, as well as product for the employer side of the experience. It's my first fintech company, but that's not why I'm doing it - my personal mission statement continues to be to work on projects that make the world more equal, informed, and inclusive, and this fits the bill.</p><p>I'm bringing a few things to the table here: my experience building products from both an engineering and product strategy perspective, but also my design thinking and cultural development background. I'm finding that those instincts are coming in very useful, and my big self-development project is to second-guess myself less than I often have in the past. I've been given a large role in determining the future strategy of the company, and I'm trying to bring my all to it.</p><p>By the way, <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/forusall/3ae887ce-c793-42a6-bf93-4c14f12fb224">I'm hiring front-end engineers</a>.</p><p>Also:</p><p>I continue to sit on the board at <a href="https://latakoo.com">Latakoo</a>, the media startup where I was the CTO and first employee. Its technology - which I helped design and build - allows networks like NBC News to easily plan stories and transmit video from the field using commodity internet connections.</p><p>Latakoo is profitable. Its cloud service is used by many of the news organizations you can think of, and its on-premise servers have found homes in their editing suites. I'm really proud to have been a part of it, and to still be able to help where I can.</p><p>I believe deeply in the importance of media in our democracy, and I'm always excited to find opportunities to help support its future. In February I helped run (with my ex-<a href="https://matter.vc">Matter</a> colleague <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/profile/roxann-stafford/">Roxann Stafford</a>) a session on <a href="https://werd.io/2020/designing-for-equity">designing for equity</a> as part of a <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/training/product-immersion">Product Immersion for Small Newsrooms bootcamp</a> organized by <a href="https://newscatalyst.org/">NewsCatalyst</a> and the <a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/">Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism</a> with <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/">the Google News Initiative</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, I'm hoping to wind up <a href="https://withknown.com">Known</a>'s incorporated corporate entity - and its hosted service, which is still online - this tax year. This doesn't mean Known itself is winding down: the open source community continues apace, and has been <a href="https://opencollective.com/known">funding future development through Open Collective</a>. The Known copyrights and assets will revert to me once the closure is complete.</p><p>Beyond work:</p><p>More of my time has been spent helping to care for my mother. It's been a decade since her diagnosis, and my life has been turned completely upside down in the years since (including some time where I thought I probably had the terminal, genetic condition too). Being able to spend time with both my parents is a privilege. But it's also been very easy to put my personal life on pause. I started this year with a determination to unpause - although 2020 has sometimes had other ideas.</p><p>I'm about to start a <a href="https://www.writingclasses.com/classes/description/zoetrope-fiction-writing">Gotham Writers Workshop course on writing fiction</a>. Writing has always been my first love, and I'm determined to take it more seriously. I took some Stanford writing courses over the summer and found them to be both incredibly useful and motivating. I'd been waitlisted for a two year part-time novel writing certificate, but sadly didn't make the cut. (Who can blame them - who is this tech bro anyway?) No matter; I'm finding other ways to improve my skills and get closer to my goal of actually publishing a long-form fiction book.</p><p>I came first in my group in the NYC Midnight flash fiction competition this summer; I'm waiting to see if I got into the third round.</p><p>I read a lot more than I write, and I've been trying my best to keep off the social networks. They don't, as a whole, improve my life. But the addiction is strong. I just wholesale quit Facebook and Instagram as a protest against that company's actions, and it felt pretty good.</p><p>When I thought I also probably had my mother's dyskeratosis congenita, I gained a lot of weight. I've been trying my best to lose it, through only eating during an eight hour window, improving my diet, and increasing the amount of exercise I do. We bought a treadmill so my mother could walk without having to leave the house (my dad also has mobility issues); I've been using it to regularly run 5Ks. It's nowhere near as impressive as my runner friends, but it's a world away from my last few years. I used to walk 7-8 miles a day in the course of my life in the UK, and my life in California has never worked the same way. I've lost some weight but I've got a very long way to go.</p><p>I've been thinking about how I can help mission-driven founders. I was pretty naive when I founded Known, and more so Elgg; I'd love to help people who are genuinely trying to make the world a better place to avoid some of those same mistakes. Time is limited, though. So maybe an online book and/or community is the way to go.</p><p>What's next:</p><p>In 2021 I want to ...</p><p>... finish a fiction book. Whether it gets published or not is out of my hands, but I want to do the best job I can. And then prepare to do it again.</p><p>... lose that weight and continue to get healthier.</p><p>... re-find the joy in life. It's been a tough year, and I want to find a way to have more time and space that's really mine. Between work and caring it's been hard to carve out room for my own life. I wouldn't change those things for the world, but I'd like to be able to find a healthier balance.</p>

   A renewed emphasis on building out Datasette Cloud has produced three new plugins this week: datasette-dateutil, datasette-import-table and datasette-edit-schema, plus a major improvement to Datasette's default interface for browsing tables.

  <p>A renewed emphasis on building out <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/datasettecloud/">Datasette Cloud</a> has produced three new plugins this week: <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-dateutil">datasette-dateutil</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-import-table">datasette-import-table</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-schema">datasette-edit-schema</a>, plus a major improvement to Datasette's default interface for browsing tables.</p>
 Datasette column actions 
<p>If you take a look at the <a href="https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures/facetable">latest.datasette.io demo</a> (continuously deployed with the latest Datasette main branch) you'll see a new UI element: cog icons on each table column, which reveal a drop-down menu.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm calling these "column actions", and they're an improvement I've been planning for a long time.</p>
<p>So far these solve two problems:</p>
 
 Sorting a column in descending order previously required two full page load clicks - one to sort ascending, and another to reverse that order. You can now sort descending directly from the menu. 
 Datasette lets you facet by any column by appending <code>?_facet=column-name</code> to the URL, but this is not a very discoverable feature! It suggests facets for columns that have less than 30 unique values, but sometimes you want to facet by something else - US states for example. You can now facet any column using the cog menu, with the exception of single unique primary key columns since faceting by those is guaranteed to only return one result per value. 
 
<p>Additionally, if a column has visible blank values on the page a "Show not-blank rows" option will be displayed, for quickly seeing rows that have something interesting in that column.</p>
<p>I'm planning to make these available for extension by plugins - I'm sure there are all sorts of other potentially useful per-column actions.</p>
<p>One concern I had in building these was accessibility: I was particularly worried that adding the markup for a dropdown menu to a <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> element would interfere with screenreaders when they were using those headers to describe the contents of a cell.</p>
<p>In the end I solved this by creating the menu as a separate absolutely positioned element, which appears in the correct place when the cog icon is clicked.</p>
<p>This still needs more work - I need to learn how to use ARIA to make the menus fully accesible - but I'm optimistic in the approach so far. If you use a screen reader I would deeply value your feedback in the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/984">column action accessibility issue</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to try out column actions they're available in the latest alpha release, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/releases/tag/0.50a0">Datasette 0.50a0</a>.</p>
 datasette-dateutil 
<p>I'm working with students in the Stanford Big Local Journalism course this term, and it's really helping me figure out the gaps in Datasette and my forthcoming Datasette Cloud hosted offering.</p>
<p>I want Datasette to be as useful to journalists as possible. This means handling messy data from all manner of sources (many of them government).</p>
<p>One missing feature has been flexible date handling. I've been succesfully using the excellent <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil">python-dateutil library</a> for this for fifteen years now, so I decided to expose its functionality within Datasette as the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-dateutil">datasette-dateutil</a> plugin.</p>
<p>The plugin adds several new custom SQL functions. Here's an example query:</p>
  select
  dateutil_parse("10 october 2020 3pm"),
  dateutil_parse_fuzzy("This is due 10 september"),
  dateutil_parse("1/2/2020"),
  dateutil_parse("2020-03-04"),
  dateutil_parse_dayfirst("2020-03-04"),
  dateutil_easter(2020);  
<p><a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/fixtures?sql=select%0D%0A++dateutil_parse%28%2210+october+2020+3pm%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_parse_fuzzy%28%22This+is+due+10+september%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_parse%28%221%2F2%2F2020%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_parse%28%222020-03-04%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_parse_dayfirst%28%222020-03-04%22%29%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_easter%282020%29%3B">Try that query here</a>. It outputs the following:</p>
 <code>2020-10-10T15:00:00
2020-09-10T00:00:00
2020-01-02T00:00:00
2020-03-04T00:00:00
2020-04-03T00:00:00
2020-04-12
</code> 
<p>I've also exposed the <code>rrule</code> module, which implements recurring date rules as described in the iCalendar specification. The <code>dateutil_rrule()</code> and <code>dateutil_rrule_date()</code> functions return JSON arrays of dates matching the rule, for example:</p>
  select
  dateutil_rrule('FREQ=HOURLY;COUNT=5'),
  dateutil_rrule_date(
    'FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=3',
    '1st jan 2020'
  );  
<p><a href="https://latest-with-plugins.datasette.io/fixtures?sql=select%0D%0A++dateutil_rrule(%27FREQ%3DHOURLY%3BCOUNT%3D5%27)%2C%0D%0A++dateutil_rrule_date(%0D%0A++++%27FREQ%3DDAILY%3BCOUNT%3D3%27%2C%0D%0A++++%271st+jan+2020%27%0D%0A++)%3B">Try it</a> - here are the results:</p>
 <code>[
    "2020-10-02T23:12:55",
    "2020-10-03T00:12:55",
    "2020-10-03T01:12:55",
    "2020-10-03T02:12:55",
    "2020-10-03T03:12:55"
]

[
    "2020-01-01",
    "2020-01-02",
    "2020-01-03"
]
</code> 
<p>These are SQLite strings containing JSON arrays - but you can use SQLite's <code>json_each()</code> function to expand them out into tables that can then be joined against other tables! The README <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-dateutil#joining-data-using-json_each">goes into more details</a> on how you can do that.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful for solving problems like generating the number-of-items per day for a given time period while still returning a 0 for dates that do not have any corresponding items.</p>
 datasette-edit-schema 
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Sep/26/weeknotes-software-carpentry-sqlite/#weeknotes-sqlite-utils">previewed this last week</a>, when it was called <code>datasette-edit-table</code>. I realized that <code>datasette-edit-schema</code> is a better name as it doesn't imply that you can edit the rows within the table - just the schema of the table itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-edit-schema/releases/tag/0.3">Release 0.3</a> is the first non-alpha release, and provides the following capabilities:</p>
 
 Rename a table 
 Add new columns to a table 
 Rename columns in a table 
 Modify the type of columns in a table 
 Re-order the columns in a table 
 Delete a table 
 
<p>This is particularly useful should you import a messy CSV file (using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-upload-csvs">datasette-upload-csvs</a>) and then need to rename some columns, change their types (so that you can sort by integers and floats instead of everything being text), then re-order them to make more sense.</p>
<p>It also means you can rename <code>LAT</code> and <code>LON</code> columns to <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude</code> so that <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cluster-map">datasette-cluster-map</a> knows that it can render them on a map.</p>
 datasette-import-table 
<p>If you're going to modify and clean data, it can be helpful to start with an existing table. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-import-table">datasette-import-table</a> lets you provide the URL to an existing Datasette table hosted anywhere on the internet - it will then create a local copy of that table by paginating through the <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/json_api.html#table-arguments">JSON API</a> for that table and importing all of the rows.</p>

<p>Webinar: Tackling Scalability and Moving into Production</p>



<p>While DLTs are no longer a mystery to most enterprises, we still have not yet figured out how to build and scale production grade projects. It is easy to build a POC, but moving to the real world with real customers is a whole different issue. Moreover, the young age of the DLT space shows in lack of tooling. In this webinar, experts from Simbachain will explain how to use SIMBA, a smart contract as a service and blockchain innovation platform to rapidly design, build and scale production DLT applications using Hyperledger Fabric. The centerpiece of the presentation will be a live demo.</p>



<p>Tune on Wednesday, October 7, at 10:00 am EDT. For more information and to register, go <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-member-webinar-tackling-scalability-and-moving-into-production-simbachain">here</a>.</p>

<p>Bringing emerging privacy-preserving technology to a public health&nbsp;crisis</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young</a>, Identity Woman, Co-Founder of the Internet Identity Workshop; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyyang1122/">Lucy Yang</a>, Co-Chair of the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</p>Photo from&nbsp;Unsplash<p>We submitted this position statement to the “<a href="https://fpf.org/event/privacy-pandemics-responsible-uses-of-technology-and-health-data-during-times-of-crisis-an-international-tech-and-data-conference/">Privacy &amp; Pandemics Workshop: Responsible Uses of Technology and Health Data During Times of Crisis — An International Tech and Data Conference</a>” by the Future of Privacy Forum. The aim is to, from two participants’ point of view, share an abbreviated case study of CCI and to highlight key challenges that arose in our efforts to responsibly use new privacy-preserving technologies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We wanted to share our submission with the CCI community and the public in the hope to invite some further discussions.</p><p>So what is this emerging technology that is just coming to market with very early adopters and innovators leading the way (including the US government, the government of British Columbia, etc.)? It is called Verifiable Credentials (VC or VCs), <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">a data format standard developed </a>and published <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">by the W3C</a> last year. It is a universal data format for one entity (person, organization or thing) to assert something about another entity. The issuer packages up the credential and cryptographically signs it to seal the data it contains. It passes this to the subject, or holder, so that the subject can share it with the receiver of the credential, the verifier. At that point, the receiver is able to use cryptography to check the seal and the validity of the issuer. VCs are privacy-preserving because the issuer (identity provider) and verifier (relying party) do not form a technical/federated link with each other. The information does not pass directly.</p><p>This technology gives people the ability to collect and manage digital credentials — similar to the cards we find in our physical wallets — in digital wallets. These digital credentials act like paper credentials because individuals do not need to have the verifier directly connect to the issuer. Why is this new? Until now, to have provable information exchanged online, the issuer and verifier would need to directly “federate” to exchange information about the data&nbsp;subject.</p><p>Immunology is a complex science, but simplified basics about how it works with some viruses are known. It was based on these simple understandings that possibilities for how VCs might be used by people and institutions to better manage risk began to be explored. One obvious use case was the ability to issue VCs that reflect some type of COVID-19 status, a proof that&nbsp;one:</p>  Tests positive for antibodies and therefore not infected/or vulnerable to being infected.  Has recently tested negative and therefore the risk of being infected is low and that one could go to work, travel or visit a facility with vulnerable populations.  Has received a vaccine for COVID-19 and therefore safe to travel or access a large in-person event.  <p>Some of these use cases as articulated are not new (e.g. the Yellow Card); it’s just new to digitize them. It makes sense to consider how this simple paper-based technology can be updated to digital. However, the mild hysteria raised about doing things today done on paper via digital means that concerns were triggered without fully understanding or exploring how to use the technology. Some individuals were so concerned that they <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/resignation-at-identity-initiative-raises-doubts-about-immunity-passes">resigned</a> from organizations whose leadership <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/safracenterforethicswhitepaper8_01.pdf">floated these&nbsp;ideas</a>.</p><p>COVID-19 status is currently shared in two forms: 1) with the patient via a phone call or text message from the doctor or testing site or 2) in a patient medical record. Neither of these solutions provides a clear way for the subject to prove results to an entity that wants to know this information (e.g. an airline). VCs offer a new innovative format that provides people with information about their COVID-19 status that is under their control and verifiable by a relying&nbsp;party.</p><p>The VC approach is in strong contrast to the <a href="https://commonpass.splashthat.com/">CommonPass</a> effort, led by a Rockefeller-Foundation-backed nonprofit, that co-arose in the same time frame. The leadership at CommonPass is connected to the conventional medical records world and proposed the creation of a global system where patient medical records in some yet-to-be-determined way would be shared with a centralized decision engine that CommonPass would run globally. They held several global meetings with hundreds of people, including government leaders attending to build momentum for their proposed solution. There are also scores of siloed proprietary solutions popping up to solve these data-sharing challenges. For example, <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-health-screening-digital-id-48f5ee5b-05c4-4b5e-8fda-4d2f59b946b0.html">CLEAR is offering</a> a biometric data sharing solution. In a public health crisis, these non-interoperable solutions are only good when only one of them is widely adopted, which doesn’t seem to be the&nbsp;case.</p><p>The community that formed around CCI was mostly made up of small, early-stage startups who were already implementing VCs for other use cases and decided to collaborate on exploring COVID-19 use cases. This makeup of the community means that it is not connected to global elites, governments, health departments or healthcare institutions. One exception to this is a startup that had political connections and worked with a California State Legislator to have the bill <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004">AB2004</a> proposed, which opened up a committee to study the use of VCs for COVID-19 medical test results. The bill just passed the Senate and is now waiting to be signed by the governor to become a law. However, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has repeatedly voiced its opposition <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results">[1]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/california-tell-your-senators-ill-conceived-immunity-passports-wont-help-us">[2]</a>.</p><p>CCI has struggled to “raise voice” and be “heard” by the powers that make decisions. The experience of this group raises questions:</p>  How can emerging technology be “seen” by actors (governments, public health officials, airlines, workplaces) in the marketplace looking for solutions? Which technologists are listened to by policymakers? How are these actors making decisions about the claims these technologists are&nbsp;making?  How can networks of potential issuers of COVID-19 status credentials be spun up in such a way that the credentials issued are seen as valid by verifiers (airlines, etc.)? This set of challenges around the technology are not technical as much as they are about process and accountability systems.  How can existing norms of information sharing about people that are paper-based today be translated into a digital form in ways that make themselves and those concerned about human rights implications comfortable with the technical deployment?  How can a new privacy-preserving technology based on open standards be used for public health crises or any other time-sensitive occasions when its deployment and adoption require a lot of coordination, collaboration and communication? How can these things be facilitated by funders seeking to make a difference?  <p>We hope to hear your thoughts on the raised questions.</p>

<p>Wing, the first credit-based cross-chain DeFi platform built on the Ontology blockchain, has garnered a lot of attention since its launch in early September, laying the groundwork for the development of Ontology’s DeFi ecosystem and for the integration of Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, data, and credit evaluation systems.</p><p>Meanwhile, our team is delighted to have received feedback from the global Ontology community, including suggestions and recommendations for Wing’s future&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Now, as we celebrate one month since the launch of Wing, we can analyze the project’s performance so far and see what we can learn going forward. We hope this letter will also help keep community members updated on the milestones Wing has met to date, as well as what’s to come over the next few&nbsp;months.</p> Off To A Promising Start: High TVL and&nbsp;APY <p>Supported by Ontology’s blockchain infrastructure, Wing got off to a great start, offering lower transaction fees, faster transfer speed, and reduced costs overall. Wing’s TVL (total value locked) rose above 200 million USD on more than one occasion. At present, Wing’s TVL is around 150 million USD a very promising figure.</p><p>In addition to retaining a high TVL and providing higher returns to users in terms of APY (annual percentage yield), Wing also provides users with returns on borrowing and lending mainstream coins including ETH, USDT, DAI, and USDC, at some of the highest rates available on the DeFi&nbsp;market.</p><p>Currency — Wing Interest&nbsp;Rate</p><p>USDT — 11.97%</p><p>DAI — 11.96%</p><p>USDC — 11.97%</p><p>ETH — 11.97%</p><p>WBTC — 29.93%</p><p>TVL（Total Value Locked）/ — 134 Million&nbsp;USD</p><p>*Data Source: Borrow APYs of the above tokens are recorded from respective websites, as of 2:00 a.m. September 28, 2020&nbsp;(UTC)</p><p>Further, Wing is among the very few DeFi lending projects that has completed cross-chain integration with Ethereum assets, which has the potential to provide high yields for Ethereum assets outside of the current Ethereum ecosystem.</p> WING, Returning to a Governance Token <p>A token’s price in the secondary market is often regarded as a major indicator of its value. The day WING went live on Binance, the token instantly hit an all-time high of $300, before gradually cooled to $20. Of course, this resulted in some doubting the token’s&nbsp;future.</p><p>It’s likely that the recent hype in the DeFi market contributed to a $300 peak so quickly. These prices have, indeed, put both the Wing and Ontology teams under some pressure.</p><p>Comparisons can be drawn between WING quickly reaching a high of $300 and COMP’s experience of reaching an almost instantaneous high of $2,000 upon its release. As newly-launched projects are yet to reach proper transaction depths, an all-time high upon release is not a good indicator of its long-term price</p><p>In the long run, the market price of a token should be based on its application value and users enthusiasm around growth potential. In relation to WING as a governance token, the governance power and potential returns are substantiated by the ever-increasing TVL (Total Value Locked) on the Wing platform, as well as the transaction fees derived from interest on borrowing, lending and insuring. The Wing team believes that the value of the WING token will be more visible to community members when WING returns to its original position as a governance token.</p> Improving The Governance Model and Enriching Value <p>The Wing team greatly values feedback from the Wing DAO community..</p><p>In terms of next steps, Wing’s core development team will increase efforts in protocol implementation, product upgrades and improvements to user experience. In addition to further optimizing the Flash Pool UI, the Wing dApp will be released on ONTO, Ontology’s data wallet, at the end of September. In mid-October, a month after Wing’s official dApp launch, Wing.Finance will go through a structural upgrade that will facilitate the community governance framework and expand WING’s value in more dimensions.</p><p>As for product upgrades, in October, Wing’s core development team will submit a proposal to the Wing DAO community for a second lending pool incorporating credit, prompting Wing to venture into credit-based lending.</p> Empowering Wing with a Wing DAO-led Governance Strategy <p>As we have learned from Ontology’s positive growth history, a community-driven strategy is the cornerstone to a sustainable development of blockchain-based products. For this reason, the Wing community will remain our primary commitment in the next phase, and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Upon Wing’s launch, a series of mining activities were initiated by the <a href="http://gov.wing.finance">https://gov.wing.finance/</a> Wing team to ensure the steady growth of the ecosystem. Over the past 15 days, three proposals in the Wing DAO community were initiated with the aim of empowering Wing’s growth with a community governance approach of raising public proposals and seeking a vote from the entire community for execution.</p><p>As the governance policies formed by the three Wing DAO community proposals came to fruition, it has been great to see that the community has grown accustomed to taking governance power into their own hands. As the governance model has made a positive impact, the Wing project will prioritize a community-driven strategy in the next stage of Wing’s development. Meanwhile, we are more than happy to see community forums like <a href="https://gov.wing.fiannce/">https://gov.wing.fiannce/</a>,where members can express their opinions, and the community can gather together to brainstorm ideas. Every bit of feedback from the community is of significance to Wing’s&nbsp;growth.</p><p>A recent proposal suggested transaction fees from borrowing on WING should be bought back and burnt. The Wing team is currently looking into whether the proposal is technically feasible. If this is the case, the Wing team will initiate a fourth proposal for the community to make a final decision.</p><p>Following the Wing DAO-driven strategy, Wing will continue to adhere to an open and transparent governance structure, taking into account the community’s feedback to further improve the governance rules, simplify the process for member governance participation, perfect the governance protocol, and enable the protocol to be applied to more scenarios. We believe that as we progress, WING will be regarded as an increasingly valuable governance token.</p> Wing’s Strategic Significance to the Ontology Ecosystem <p>The success of DeFi projects requires ongoing commitment. Compound, a DeFi project released two years ago, has spent two thirds of its life in stealth mode until the unprecedented yield farming spree which took place inJune 2020. Uniswap provides us with another example of long-term users working together and remaining committed, ultimately cumulating in bountiful returns.</p><p>As the first credit-based cross-chain DeFi platform, Wing also serves as the first key project in Ontology’s DeFi ecosystem. Ontology’s decentralized identity framework (ONT ID) and decentralized data protocol (DDXF) can support users in managing their own identities and data verification, while also integrating with smart contracts to enable automatic verification of credit data and credit evaluation. A technical infrastructure such as this combined with OScore, Ontology’s credit evaluation system, makes it intrinsically possible for Wing to integrate credit data into its products.</p><p>In the next stage, Wing can be be fine-tuned to work as a crucial component of the Ontology DeFi ecosystem. We expect that more premium projects derived from Wing will emerge and enrich the ecosystem, in turn maximizing the project’s significance and value in the DeFi&nbsp;sector.</p><p>While we continuously improve our underlying infrastructure, Ontology will prioritize the development of our communities around the world. We’d like to extend our thanks to every community member who presented us with suggestions for Wing, and those who participated in Wing DAO governance in the last&nbsp;month.</p><p>Ontology is committed to continuing our efforts to optimize the governance framework, product design, and user experience of Wing. We also plan to explore more innovative DeFi products in a bid to build a bridge between DeFi and traditional finance.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/a-letter-to-the-wing-dao-community-from-jun-li-founder-of-ontology-7117c6eb41a5">A Letter to the Wing DAO Community from Jun Li, Founder of Ontology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Session management in multi-node applications presents multiple challenges. When the architecture includes a load balancer, client requests might be routed to different servers each time, and the HTTP session might be lost. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the configuration of session sharing in a multi-node Spring Boot application.

 Session Persistence 

<p>Session Persistence is a technique for sticking a client to a single server, using application layer information—like a cookie, for example. In this tutorial, we will implement session persistence with the help of <a href="http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/2.3/intro.html#3">HAProxy</a>, a reliable, high performance, TCP/HTTP load balancer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First, let’s create a web application with Okta authentication and run three nodes with HAProxy load balancing using Docker Compose.</p>

<p>Create a Maven project using the Spring Initializr’s API.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
 -d dependencies=web,okta \
 -d groupId=com.okta.developer \
 -d artifactId=webapp \
 -d name="Web Application" \
 -d description="Demo Web Application" \
 -d packageName=com.okta.developer.webapp \
 -d javaVersion=11 \
 -o web-app.zip
</code>   

<p>Unzip the project:</p>

   <code>unzip web-app.zip -d web-app
cd web-app
</code>   

<p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-maven-plugin">Okta Maven Plugin</a> to register a new account:</p>

   <code>./mvnw com.okta:okta-maven-plugin:register
</code>   

<p>If you already have an Okta account registered, use <code>login</code> instead of <code>register</code>.</p>

<p>Then, configure your Spring application for authentication using Okta:</p>

   <code>./mvnw com.okta:okta-maven-plugin:spring-boot
</code>   

<p>It will set up a new OIDC application for you and write your Okta settings to your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file.</p>

<p>Create a <code>GreetingController</code> at <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/webapp/controller</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.webapp.controller;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextHolder;

import java.net.InetAddress;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GreetingController.class);

    @GetMapping(value = "/greeting")
    @ResponseBody
    public String getGreeting(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser) {
        String serverUsed = "unknown";
        try {
            InetAddress host = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
            serverUsed = host.getHostName();
        } catch (Exception e){
            logger.error("Could not get hostname", e);
        }
        String sessionId = RequestContextHolder.currentRequestAttributes().getSessionId();
        logger.info("Request responded by " + serverUsed);
        return "Hello " + oidcUser.getFullName() + ", your server is " + serverUsed + ", with sessionId " + sessionId;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the application with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in an incognito window and you should be redirected to the Okta sign-in page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you sign in, you will get a 404 error when you’re redirected back to your Spring Boot app. This is expected because there’s no controller mapped to the <code>/</code> endpoint. You can fix this if you want by adding a method like the following to your <code>WebApplication.java</code>.</p>

   <code>@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class WebApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(WebApplication.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user) {
        return "Hello, " + user.getFullName();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now, let’s configure three Docker containers, one for each application node, and an HAProxy container. In the project root folder, create a <code>docker/docker-compose.yml</code> file, with the following content:</p>

   <code>version: '3.1'
services:
  webapp1:
    environment:
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER=${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET}
    image: webapp
    hostname: webapp1
    ports:
      - 8081:8080
  webapp2:
    environment:
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER=${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET}
    image: webapp
    hostname: webapp2
    ports:
      - 8082:8080
  webapp3:
    environment:
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER=${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET}
    image: webapp
    hostname: webapp3
    ports:
      - 8083:8080
  haproxy:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-haproxy
    image: my-haproxy
    ports:
      - 80:80
    depends_on:
      - "webapp1"
      - "webapp2"
      - "webapp3"
</code>   

<p>Create a<code>docker/.env</code> file with the following content:</p>

   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER={issuer}
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={clientId}
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={clientSecret}
</code>   

<p>You can find the issuer, clientId, and clientSecret in the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>, after running the Okta Maven Plugin. Remove the <code>\</code> in the issuer’s URL after you paste the value. Also, make sure to remove the curly braces around the values.</p>

<p>Create a <code>Dockerfile</code> for the HAProxy container, at <code>docker/Dockerfile-haproxy</code> and add the following:</p>

   <code>FROM haproxy:2.2
COPY haproxy.cfg /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
</code>   

<p>Create the configuration file for the HAProxy instance at <code>docker/haproxy.cfg</code>:</p>

   <code>global
    debug
    daemon
    maxconn 2000

defaults
    mode http
    timeout connect 5000ms
    timeout client 50000ms
    timeout server 50000ms

frontend http-in
    bind *:80
    default_backend servers

backend servers
    balance roundrobin
    cookie SERVERUSED insert indirect nocache
    option httpchk /
    option redispatch
    default-server check
    server webapp1 webapp1:8080 cookie webapp1
    server webapp2 webapp2:8080 cookie webapp2
    server webapp3 webapp3:8080 cookie webapp3
</code>   

<p>I’m not going to dive deep into how to configure HAProxy but take note that,  in the <code>backend servers</code> section, there are the following options:</p>

 
   <code>balance roundrobin</code> sets round-robin as the load balancing strategy. 
   <code>cookie SERVERUSED</code> adds a cookie SERVERUSED to the response, indicating the server responding to the request. The client requests will stick to that server. 
   <code>option redispatch</code> makes the request be re-dispatched to a different server if the current server fails. 
 

<p>Edit the <code>pom.xml</code> to add the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin">Jib Maven Plugin</a> to the <code>&lt;build&gt;</code> section to create a <code>webapp</code> Docker image.</p>

   <code>&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.cloud.tools&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jib-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.5.2&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;to&gt;
            &lt;image&gt;webapp&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;/to&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</code>   

<p>Build the <code>webapp</code> container image:</p>

   <code>./mvnw compile jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

<p>Start all the services with docker-compose:</p>

   <code>cd docker
docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you get a <code>URISyntaxException</code> on startup, remove the <code>\</code> in the issuer in <code>application.properties</code>.</p>

<p>HAProxy will be ready after you see the following lines in the logs:</p>

   <code>haproxy_1  | [WARNING] 253/130140 (6) : Server servers/webapp2 is UP, reason: Layer7 check passed, code: 302, check duration: 5ms. 1 active and 0 backup servers online. 0 sessions requeued, 0 total in queue.

</code>   

<p>Before you can sign in to your application, you’ll need to go to your Okta developer console and add a Login redirect URI for <code>http://localhost/login/oauth2/code/okta</code>. Otherwise, you’ll get a 400 error in the next step. While you’re in there, add a Logout redirect URI for <code>http://localhost</code>.</p>

<p>In a browser, go to <code>http://localhost/greeting</code>. After you sign in, inspect the request cookie <code>SERVERUSED</code>. An example value is:</p>

   <code>Cookie: SERVERUSED=webapp3; JSESSIONID=5AF5669EA145CC86BBB08CE09FF6E505
</code>   

<p>Shut down the current node with the following Docker command:</p>

   <code>docker stop docker_webapp3_1
</code>   

<p>Refresh your browser and wait a few seconds. Check the <code>SERVERUSED</code> cookie to verify that HAProxy re-dispatched the request to a different node, and the sessionId has changed, meaning the old session was lost.</p>

<p>You can stop the services with <code>CTRL+C</code>.</p>

 Session Sharing with Spring Session 

<p>Storing sessions in an individual node can affect scalability. When scaling up, active sessions will remain in the original nodes and traffic will not be spread equally among nodes. Also, when a node fails, the session in that node is lost. With session sharing, the user session lives in a shared data storage that all server nodes can access.</p>

<p>Next, for a transparent failover with the <code>redispatch</code> option in HAProxy, let’s add session sharing between nodes with Spring Session. For this tutorial, I’ll show you how to use MySQL for storing the session.</p>

<p>First, add the following dependencies to the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;mysql&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;mysql-connector-java&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.session&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-session-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.session&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-session-jdbc&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.zaxxer&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;HikariCP&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.2.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.h2database&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;h2&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code>, change your <code>okta.*</code> properties to be in YAML syntax, and add the following key-value pairs:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: {issuer}
    client-secret: {client-secret}
    client-id: {client-id}

spring:
  session:
    jdbc:
      initialize-schema: always
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/webapp
    username: root
    password: example
    driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    hikari:
      initializationFailTimeout: 0

logging:
  level:
    org.springframework: INFO
    com.zaxxer.hikari: DEBUG
</code>   

<p>In this example, you are using HikariCP for the database connection pooling. The option <code>initializationFailTimeout</code> is set to 0, meaning if a connection cannot be obtained, the pool will start anyways.</p>

<p>You are also instructing Spring Session to always create the schema with the option <code>spring.session.jdbc.initialize-schema=always</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>application.yml</code> file you just created contains the default datasource properties for the MySQL session storage. As the MySQL database is not up when the tests run, set up an in-memory H2 database so the application tests don’t fail.</p>

<p>Create a<code>src/test/resources/application-test.yml</code> file with the following content:</p>

   <code>spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    username: sa
    password: passord
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
</code>   

<p>Modify the <code>WebApplicationTests.java</code> class to add the <code>@ActiveProfiles</code> annotation:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.webapp;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
class WebApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Modify <code>docker/docker-compose.yml</code> to add the database container and the admin application to inspect the session tables. The final configuration should look like the following:</p>

   <code>version: '3.1'
services:
  webapp1:
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/webapp

      - 80:80
    depends_on:
      - "webapp1"
      - "webapp2"
      - "webapp3"
</code>   

<p>Delete the previous containers and previous <code>webapp</code> Docker image with the following commands:</p>

   <code>docker-compose down
docker rmi webapp
</code>   

<p>In the root folder of the project, rebuild the webapp docker image with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw compile jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

<p>Start all the services again (<code>docker-compose up</code> from the <code>docker</code> directory), and repeat the re-dispatch test (go to <code>http://localhost/greeting</code> then shutdown the active node with <code>docker stop docker_webapp#_1</code>). You might see a lot of connection errors until the database is up.</p>

<p>Now the session should be the same after changing the node. How cool is that?!</p>

<p>You can inspect the session data in the admin UI at <code>http://localhost:8090</code>. Log in with <code>root</code> and the <code>MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD</code> value that you set in<code>docker-compose.yml</code>.</p>

<p>I tried to sign up for phone banking and I just couldn’t see doing it, I don’t answer unknown calls and I wouldn’t expect anyone else to right now. I wound up with the Vote Forward letter-writing system, <a href="http://votefwd.org/?fbclid=IwAR2gJSKcIqL4prkZJPZ72oPvOxOnabufWkKxojLL0lRm2NlydSZye2ZQI_8">votefwd.org</a>, which I like for a variety of reasons. </p>



<p>It’s really well organized. You get batches of five or 20 letters that are for voters who are likely to be under-represented, and/or have not voted recently. The  templates just ask the person to vote, not specifying for whom, and provide links to localized voter info. </p>



<p>They also leave space for you to hand-address the recipient, add a handwritten message, and sign your name. </p>



<p>The last couple of batches I prepared are heading to South Carolina. The letters won’t go out until October 17, though, for maximum impact. This was a compromise, the original plan — backed by research — was for letters to arrive closer to the election. But now that the threat model includes USPS sabotage, the date had to be moved earlier. </p>



<p>Vote Forward claims to have evidence showing that this method makes a difference on the margin. I haven’t seen that evidence, and would like to, but it seems plausible. The recipients are getting a hand-addressed stamped envelope with a return address that has my name atop an address in their region, which is slightly deceptive but feels like a good way to get them to open the letter. </p>



<p>You buy your stamps, so there’s a bit of financial contribution that way.</p>



<p>As a bonus I am re-learning cursive handwriting, which I forgot was primarily about speed. My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Cloud, who tormented me about my handwriting, would approve.<br><br> I’m finding the process to be therapeutic, and it was a much better way to spend an hour and a half the other night than watching the so-called debate.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of time until October 17, so if you’ve been looking for a way to do something and haven’t found it yet, I can recommend this one. I’ve never done anything like this before, I hope the fact I am doing it now is representative of what a lot of others are doing in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>Explore the standards-based scalable identifiers and encrypted data storage tools that power Transmute’s product.</p>An example of the Transmute Encrypted Data Vaults Workbench document&nbsp;preview.<p>Transmute is proud to announce the release of several new technical workbenches as a part of our continued commitment to open-standards development, interoperability, and product transparency. Whenever possible, our team strives to provide interactive proof of functionality along with standards, specifications, and library&nbsp;support.</p><p>This new suite of tools is available for developers to experiment with today and includes:</p>  <a href="http://staging.element.transmute.industries/">Element Ropsten Workbench</a>  <a href="https://staging.data-vault.transmute.industries/">Encrypted Data Vault Workbench</a>  <a href="http://did.key.transmute.industries/">DID Key Workbench</a>  <p>Transmute leverages these workbenches as part of our global trade solutions, where our customers benefit from verifiable data workflows and integrated capabilities. Reach out to our team <a href="https://transmute.typeform.com/to/RshfIw">here</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> Workbench Details <p>Read on to learn technical details of what is included in each workbench, and follow the links to see how each works for yourself.</p><p>Element Testnet Workbench <a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.element.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve updated did:elem to support the latest stable version of the Sidetree protocol, and we’ve reimplemented our block explorer from <a href="https://element-did.com/">https://element-did.com</a> to support the new Sidetree filesystem and the latest element&nbsp;dids.</p><p>We’ve also added universal wallet* support to the element workbench, so you can create a Sidetree did and control it with the same keys you use for did key or any other universal wallet compatible product.</p><p>*The universal wallet is also an official work item of the W3C CCG <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/universal-wallet-interop-spec</a>.</p><p>Data Vault Workbench <br><a href="https://ropsten.element.did.ai/workbench">https://staging.date-vault.transmute.industries/workbench</a></p><p>We’ve added support for encrypted data vaults to the universal wallet spec, and provide a developer user interface which is similar to a database administration interface which helps DID controllers explore their vaults, documents, and indexes inside encrypted data&nbsp;vaults.</p><p>We also published the first vendor interoperability tests in the Secure Data Store working group: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store</a>. These tests help vendors prove they are interoperable.</p><p>Having workbenches like these helps Transmute separate standards, libraries, sample implementations, demos into microservices which are independently upgradeable and valuable by themselves as standalone products.</p><p>For example, our Sidetree node for Element regularly anchors testnet DID activity, and it’s helpful to be able to explore that activity on our block explorer, even if you didn’t use our node to anchor those events… If you want to dig into the Ethereum related details, we happily link you to <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">https://ropsten.etherscan.io/</a> for more detailed information about the Ethereum transactions and&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Our encrypted data vault workbench demonstrates the concept of “wallet portability” by showing how wallet content can be encrypted client-side and replicated between clients. This demonstrates the value of encrypted data vaults and the universal wallet interop spec at the same time…. It also helps us prove that encrypted data vaults work with did:key and did:elem.</p><p>DID Key Workbench <br><a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries">https://did.key.transmute.industries</a></p><p>We’ve added support for BLS12381, which is used to construct zero-knowledge proofs using <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020</a></p><p>We’ve also added support for the “NIST Curves” which are legacy elliptic curves that are supported almost everywhere, including natively in web browsers. Not everyone trusts them, you should review <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/</a>. Nonetheless, we have shown them to be working with DID Key, which opens the door for legacy integration and interoperability.</p><p>We use DID Key for testing, and because of its simplicity it’s an ideal starting point for learning about DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>The DID Key Workbench also has the first [to our knowledge] support for content-type and multiple did document representations. Support for multiple representations in the DID Core Specifications is currently being defined and subject to change. Today, there is a lot of language which describes JSON-LD, and almost no examples of JSON or CBOR. We hope that by showing how did:key can support both JSON and JSON-LD we can help the community figure out the representation sufficient for it to be testable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-releases-technical-workbenches-892f8140ac6e">Transmute Releases Technical Workbenches</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Why have things like cell phones and automobiles become more advanced, intuitive and cost effective over time while managing Identity, particularly Identity Governance, has remained complex and expensive? The time and resources it takes to implement an identity project hinders the business and slows any hope of digital transformation. The frustration is real and ripping and replacing has not proved to be the answer. So what’s it going to take to truly get IGA right? In this thought-provoking session, Jackson Shaw, an experienced thought leader in IGA will discuss the need to rethink the core of identity and why it’s time for an IDENTITY REVOLUTION.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive10_2020_10_01_shaw"></a>

  <p>ITSM is going well beyond ITIL and IT ticketing these days: It’s becoming the portal and workflow platform</p>
<p>Not that long ago, ITSM (IT Service Management) was what the name means: A technology used within IT to manage IT services and facing to the end user when it comes to IT requests. IT requests led to tickets as the tasks to be performed by workers in IT. And yes, there was and is ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) describing common IT processes, there were and are Service Catalogs, and there were and are CMDBs (Configuration Management Databases).</p>
<p>However, this is changing. ITSM platforms are shifting from IT solutions to business solutions and becoming strategic tools for organizations, for service delivery (and thus service definition, service management, and so on) across a range of business functions. They have become a widely used interface for users to a wide range of services, and they support the workflows and process automation behind these interfaces.</p>
<p>With IAM providing interfaces and with workflows and processes being a vital part of every IAM, it is obvious that there is a logical link between IAM and ITSM (or the other way round).</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, in his talk will look at the journey of ITSM and where ITSM is heading. He will look at the overlaps and links between IAM and ITSM. And he will take a high-level perspective on where integration is expected to become deeper and where IAM capabilities might shift to ITSM, specifically in the context of IAM evolving from monolithic platforms to modern, microservice-based architectures that can well make use of existing ITSM services, microservices, and APIs.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive10_2020_10_01_kuppinger"></a>

<p><a href="https://www.bioid.com/?utm_source=announcement&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=bioid">BioID</a> is a server side biometric platform that uses face, voice and eye modalities and liveness detection. Organisations can self-host or use BioID’s hosted API as a service. BioID publishes client software for iOS, Android and Javascript. User presence is verified through a highly accurate and strongly secured liveness detection algorithm. In the SaaS BioID Platform, users are referenced via an anonymous ID, providing privacy-protecting separation of biometric data and other personally identifying information, satisfying GDPR compliance through strong data protection and pseudonymized data handling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although you probably want to build BioID in a mobile application, it was expedient for the Gluu engineers to use the laptop webcam to build our demo. The interception script implements a two-step authentication workflow where username/password is step one, and BioID’s biometric authentication is step two.&nbsp;It’s also possible to implement a one step biometric authentication. Gluu has also published a <a href="https://casa.gluu.org/plugins/biometric-credentials/?utm_source=announcement&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=bioid">Casa plugin for BioID</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing is believing. CEO Mike Schwartz recorded a one minute video to show how easy it is to enroll and authenticate using facial recognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Detailed instructions for how to deploy the Gluu BioID interception script and Casa plugin can be found <a>here</a></p>
<p>You can find more information about how to use BioID from their documentation:</p>
 
 You can find all API reference at&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.bioid.com/bwsreference">https://developer.bioid.com/bwsreference</a>. 
 Lots of useful information about BWS is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.bioid.com/blog">https://developer.bioid.com/blog</a>.

  <p>Welcome back to another episode of ForgeTalks. This week we tackle how to help organizations prepare for unexpected spikes in consumer demand. I sat down with ForgeRockers Jeff Carpenter, director of product marketing and&nbsp;Ludovic Poitou, director of product management, to discuss the importance of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services/high-availability-scalability">scalability</a> for millions of identities. They explained how our Containerized Directory Services can help you handle massive&nbsp;transaction&nbsp;volumes and millions of identities at thousands of transactions per second.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We'll be answering questions like:&nbsp;</p>

  What role does&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services">Directory Services</a>&nbsp;play in identity? 
	 What are the risks of ignoring Directory Services?

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service">Social networking</a> websites
categorize the people I might be related to into:</p>
 
 those I am (bi-directional) “friends” with; 
 those that I follow (but they don’t follow me back), and vice versa; 
 those that are related to my friends, but not me directly; 
 those whose stuff the social network overlords think you should know about it
(that includes advertisers) 
 everybody else. 
 
<p>This categorizing seems contrary to the way non-dysfunctional human relationships work.
What is a better categorization? Here is my version:</p>
 
 
<p>My close family and friends. These are the people have the key to my house; they
live in my house or are welcome all the time, and will help out no matter what the time
of night it might be. I’ll call them Family, whether we have common genes or not.</p>
 
 
<p>Next are the people that I know well, but who I wouldn’t normally give a key to my
house. I know them well because I have worked with them, I have had fun with them, I
know a bit about their life history, I have some idea about their families
and what they worry about. Traditionally, that would be an actual village but in
times of the internet, people may live far away. It may include my neighborhood, my
congregation, my political faction, or people I have done projects with. I call
them my Village.</p>
 
 
<p>Beyond that is my Tribe. That’s people with whom I share a clear interest, although
I may know many members of my tribe only by name, or not at all. This would include
people of the same faith or Weltanschauung as I have, people in the same town, of the
same profession or political persuasion with a similar value system.</p>
 
 
<p>And there is everybody else, the World.</p>
 
 
<p>There may be one more tier between tribe and world, sort of on a country level. Other than
by allegiance to the same government (or grudging acceptance of the same government?),
I’m having some difficulties to define this tier, so I’m leaving it out of this post.</p>
<p>Worth noting is that I can be member of several of those groupings. For example, I can be
member of several Villages (my home town vs my college town) or Tribes (say, my
politics and my passion for electronics). Or maybe the better way of looking at it
would be to use this categorization only from my point of view; what is a single Village
to me may not be a single Village to anybody else.</p>
<p>I’m sure social science has lots of categorizations like that. Not being a social
scientist, what am I missing in this home-grown version?</p>

 Zeenab Aneez &amp; Neha&nbsp;Mujumdar  Session <p>It was media theorist Marshall McLuhan who popularised the phrase ‘the medium is the message’; to him, different kinds of media engage the senses in different ways, affecting how we process it and engage with its contents. Before situating research in the digital space, it is important to ask ourselves: what is the nature of the medium are we dealing with here? How do people interact with it? What are the opportunities it provides and the risks it poses? How can we study new digital objects, such as online-first news outlets, podcasts, etc in a way that recognises the medium’s&nbsp;newness?</p><p>The proposed session is an exploration of a methodology that is informed and defined by specific characteristics of the medium, with a special focus on digital news and journalism in India. Through this, it seeks to tackle the first of the four key focus areas of the conference: How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?</p><p>Keeping this key question in mind, we ask: how can digital methods research contribute to the study of news and journalism in the digital space? How can we use digital objects such as tags, Likes, and Comments to understand how user feedback works in the new information economy? What can the interface of a news creation platform tell us about the changing roles of Indian journalists in today’s media environment? How can we formulate a methodology for studying the metamorphosis of a news story by using Twitter and what skills are required to gather and process information for research of this&nbsp;nature?</p><p>In order to inform our responses to such questions, we borrow from Richard Rogers’ adage ‘Follow the medium’ (Rogers 2013), which argues that “natively digital”(Ibid. 19) objects like tags, links, Likes or Comments, which originate in digital networks, cannot be fully understood with methods, such as, say content analysis; an example of a non-digital method that does not recognise its digital nature. The proposed session will make use of the general philosophy embodied by Rogers’ approach and urge participants to acknowledge the specific properties of the Internet as a medium and look at news and journalism as part of the larger media ecology of the web. This calls for the use of new methods that are digital in nature; the discussion on contemporary news should expand from how the news industry is coping with the digital transition, to how we can better understand the specific elements of this transition and use this understanding to reflect upon the changing nature of journalism and news&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In order to channel the discussion, the session proposes using the framework from one particular field of digital research: platform studies. With the advent of Web 2.0 and the emergence of the ‘web as platform’ (O’Reilly 2007) and the strengthening relationship between the news industry and social media platforms(‘Reuters Institute Digital News Report’ 2015), traditional as well as digital-born news sites are increasingly adopting a platform model. Therefore, platform studies makes for a fitting framework within which to understand the workings of these platforms, their technological and formal structures, and the specific ways in which they allow users to interact with news&nbsp;content.</p> Plan <p>The session will begin with a brief introduction to digital methods (Rogers 2013) and the field of ‘platform studies’ (Bogost and Montfort 2009; Gillespie 2010; Dijck 2013), which will serve as a loose framework through which to study existing news platforms as well as perform analyses on social media platforms as sites for news and journalism. This will be supplemented by the works of Anne Helmond (2015) and Tarleton Gillespie (2010).</p><p>Following this, participants will be divided into groups of four-six, with each group anchored by a volunteer, with added support from the two co-leaders. They will then be given the task of formulating a research question that makes use of one or more of the digital methods presented and are also required to frame a methodology that makes allowances for the particularities of the Indian news environment. The session will conclude with a brief discussion based on their findings.</p><p>The goal of the workshop will be to explore how digital methods can be aligned with current concerns about news and journalism in India, and open up avenues for research that acknowledges that online news occupies a space that includes natively digital objects and information architectures and hence demands research methods specific to this environment. The workshop also aims at reflecting on potential collaborations between researchers in media studies, data scientists and technologists in developing a comprehensive methodology using which to study digital media in&nbsp;India.</p> Readings <p>Gillespie, Tarleton. “The Politics of ‘Platforms’.” New Media &amp; Society 12, no. 3 (2010):&nbsp;347–364.</p><p>Rogers, Richard. “The End of the Virtual: Digital Methods,” Digital Methods.

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of ModoHR?</p>



<p>ModoHR is a Canadian technology-driven business that provides modern solutions for the human resources industry. Our web application, <a href="https://www.screeningcanada.ca/product">ScreeningCanada™</a> was developed with the goal to empower Canadian organizations to remotely conduct background screening and digital identity verification. We help set the standard for Canadian privacy, compliance and data security; these unwavering principles provide Canadian organizations with compliant products and services that mitigate risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://modohr.com/"></a> 



<p>Simply put, digital identity is the foundation of background screening. Without a candidate’s consent and identity verification, compliant and thorough background screening cannot take place. In addition, the emerging markets like on-demand delivery services and ride-sharing have further highlighted the need for speed in the background screening industry. We strongly believe that a trusted digital identity solution is critical in removing these obstacles and improving remote hiring.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does ModoHR address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity will transform the Canadian and global economy by removing geographical barriers for individual job applicants. ModoHR is pioneering new identity verification solutions in the marketplace with tools that utilize credit file-based verification, live video verification and facial accreditation. Existing background screening processes have traditionally required face-to-face interaction with the hiring manager, or an in-person verification conducted by an authorized third party like Canada Post. ModoHR’s digital identity solutions remove barriers that previously existed for remote hiring. The process is compliant with federal and provincial physical distancing recommendations and approved by police services. This transformation will empower Canadians and organizations to increase diversity and inclusion by removing traditional remote hiring barriers.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>There is no question that Canada possesses the necessary knowledge and capabilities to be a leader in digital identity. Our national approach to privacy and compliance and the value we place on protecting personal information across all industries, is highly regarded around the world. In the coming months and years, Canadian provinces will need to work together to centralize, standardize and unilaterally protect personal information, and develop methods to securely utilize this information to verify identity.</p>



<p>Our competitors in this space are already operating on the global stage; Canada must move quickly to share resources, seek federal support and ensure that our sovereign interests will not be negatively influenced by the standards set by other nations. More importantly, we need to lead this charge to develop processes and platforms that are truly Canadian.</p>



<p>5. Why did ModoHR join the DIACC?</p>



<p>ModoHR Technologies joined DIACC to share our knowledge and experience relating to the important topic of digital identity, compliance, risk mitigation and global regulatory challenges.&nbsp; We believe that together, Canadian organizations can not only improve processes for Canadians but remain at the cutting edge of policy development globally. We look forward to networking and sharing knowledge with other DIACC members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about ModoHR?</p>



<p>ModoHR is owned by background screening and risk mitigation industry experts. Our executive team founded the pre-employment industry in Canada 20 years ago and built the largest risk mitigation firm in Canada. These subject matter experts came together to collaborate, re-imagine and empower Human Resources with technology that ensures privacy, security and streamlines processes for organizations and individuals alike. Our drive and enthusiasm is reflected in every new risk mitigation product or service that we create. In summary – we build what’s next™.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Whether you are a firm believer in the bright future of Artificial Intelligence or somewhat of a skeptic like me – you simply cannot ignore the great strides AI technologies have made in recent years. Intelligent products powered by machine learning are everywhere: from chatbots to autonomous vehicles, from predicting consumer behavior and detecting financial fraud to cancer diagnostics and crop harvesting. There is however a major factor limiting even further applications of AI and ML in almost any industry: AI algorithms are very computationally intensive and until quite recently, prohibitively expensive to operate “on-premises”.</p>
<p>The rise of cloud computing has given a major boost to AI technologies in recent years, and to this day, it is the cloud that powers the majority of AI applications, both for consumers and for enterprise applications. However, what works perfectly well for business analytics, language translation services or, say, virtual assistants, might be not enough for more mission-critical scenarios.</p>
<p>The Challenges of AI in the Cloud</p>
<p>The biggest challenge of cloud-based AI are potential connectivity issues: if a device is only occasionally connected to the Internet, it won’t be able to utilize cloud-based machine learning services efficiently. For real-time scenarios like self-driving cars, even the additional milliseconds of network latency can be a deal-breaker. Another major problem of cloud-based AI is the sensitivity of the information that has to be sent to the cloud for processing. Companies operating under strict regulations (which nowadays includes anyone dealing with personally identifiable information) simply cannot afford the risks for a security breach or a compliance violation fine.</p>
<p>These problems are nothing new, of course – they’ve been the biggest obstacle to adopting any cloud services for over a decade already. To address this challenge and to expand their customer base to these “not cloud-ready” companies, cloud service providers have been pushing the concept of Edge Computing. At its face value, edge computing simply means bringing computing and storage resources closer to the customer’s geographical location to reduce network latency. This has started over 20 years ago with CDNs (content delivery networks) but expanded to mobile phones, IoT devices and network gateways.</p>
<p>Nowadays, these devices are powerful enough to implement a substantial part of the cloud service stack locally, creating a distributed computing platform between corporate networks and clouds, dramatically improving response rates and reducing the strain on the core cloud infrastructure. It is important to understand that this trend does not by any means undo the achievements of the cloud model. Edge computing isn’t returning to on-prem data centers; it is simply another phase in the evolution of the cloud. Even the name itself implies it: the edge, of course, refers to the cloud, its proverbial “silver lining” …</p>
<p>In a sense, edge computing is an alternative approach towards hybrid architectures, one that tries to blur the massive divide in on-prem and cloud technology stacks and to expand the reach of cloud service providers even deeper into their customers’ networks. Bringing AI capabilities closer to their consumers is just another logical step in that direction.</p>
<p>The Future of the Intelligent Edge</p>
<p>It is well known that preparing data for machine learning and training of ML models is the part of AI that requires the most computing resources. The actual inference (i.e., putting a model to productive use) is much lighter. Optimizing ML models for running on edge devices is one of the primary methods of decoupling them from the cloud. Solutions like AI-powered antiviruses that only require updates every six months are already a reality. Simple image recognition can run directly on your mobile phone, helping you take better pictures of your food.</p>
<p>More sophisticated models require specialized hardware to run. Major semiconductor manufacturers like Intel and Nvidia and even cloud service providers themselves like AWS have specialized AI chips in their portfolios; smaller companies are offering solutions for developers to simplify and optimize the usage of this hardware. In other words, a whole ecosystem is being born, bringing AI/ML closer to customers and enabling usage scenarios previously impossible.</p>
<p>The field is still far from mature, however. Perhaps the best indication of this is a lack of standardization developments and a very fragmented market, where very few vendors can deliver a full technology and service stack to satisfy different use cases. Will we see the emergence of a standardized abstracted architecture similar to VMware or Kubernetes for traditional computing? Perhaps: companies like Run:AI are already working on AI orchestration platforms.</p>
<p>One thing is clear though: cloud AI isn’t going anywhere. For the foreseeable future, we’re going to deal with a multitude of hybrid architectures. History has a tendency to repeat itself, after all.</p>

<p>The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Freddie Mac, is the backbone of the United States housing sector. The government-sponsored public enterprise has provided more than $10 trillion to help more than 67 million homeowners and 11 million renters establish their homes since its inception 50 years ago, fulfilling its mission to provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the U.S. housing market.<br>
<br>
Recently, the Freddie Mac identity team determined it was time to <a>modernize their legacy web access management (WAM)</a> infrastructure. The system was nearing end of life and presented numerous security vulnerabilities that weren’t easily remedied. But given the number of resources involved and the 400+ applications that had to be migrated, the switch to a modern identity and access management (IAM) platform would be a massive undertaking.<br>

The platform has vast untapped potential as a tool for research as well as monitoring current events and trends. <a href="https://www.bu.edu/questrom/2018/11/26/why-twitter-isnt-the-echo-chamber-you-think-it-is/">A 2018 study</a> found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06795.pdf">compelling evidence</a> that Twitter isn’t very polarized. Average users are exposed to a diverse range of ideas and post content that is more politically moderate than what they receive in their&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1307693230352478209">the abundance</a> of content comes at a high psychological cost:</p>  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-020-09314-9">Information overload</a> makes me feel like I’m drowning as I navigate an infinite array of never-ending newsfeeds. Finding the signal that I’m searching for in a sea of noise takes&nbsp;work.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/22/1/1/3976922">Fear</a> of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268401217310629">missing out</a> and <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_ca/topics/insights/2018/FONK_is_the_new_FOMO.html">fear of not knowing</a> compel me to constantly check the application for anything important I may have missed. “Just one more refresh, just a bit more scrolling…”  <p><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-lists">Twitter lists</a> are an under-appreciated feature that can increase the platform’s potential to facilitate productive social discourse. They help address existing issues&nbsp;by:</p>  Allowing for the creation of multiple newsfeeds with content from personally curated groups of users, thus reducing information overload. Using <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/">Tweetdeck</a> to manage lists provides a much smoother Twitter user experience.  Providing raw data, via the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/accounts-and-users/create-manage-lists/api-reference/get-lists-list">Twitter API</a>, that can be used in applications that push relevant content to users and reduce the amount of time they spend searching and scrolling.  <p>Lists have helped satisfy my craving for nuanced political and economic discourse that transcends the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm#False_left%E2%80%93right_paradigm_political_theory">left/right paradigm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1251634412334141440?lang=en">focuses</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/palladiummag/status/1255916200275529728">addressing</a> systemic <a href="https://twitter.com/C4COMPUTATION/status/1296806626041556995">issues</a> rather than proposing simplistic band-aid solutions. They also help me effectively track technical, social, and cultural developments in the rapidly evolving crypto industry.</p><p>Twitter could become a vital part of the digital public square with the help of well-curated lists and better ways of interacting with them. It could help citizens fulfill their obligation to be <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/60.html">well informed</a> and perhaps even allow us to escape the bubbles of groupthink that social media has trapped us&nbsp;in.</p><p>Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jack-dorsey-twitter-blockchain-strategy-oslo-freedom-forum">recently announced</a> plans to transform Twitter into an open decentralized platform by using public blockchains to put users in control of their data. This shift will open up new possibilities in terms of what sorts of applications could be built using lists and drastically increase Twitter’s potential to serve the common&nbsp;good.</p><p>You can get started with exploring lists by checking out a few that I’ve&nbsp;made:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086059106874474496">AI</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/197289909">Bitcoin</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/884466365532209153">Blockchain Gaming</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1202739597286854656">Cryptofunds</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1195946586943000576">Cryptogurus</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1276220409445101568">Decentralized Finance</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1054920788019572736">Ethereum</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1306382711196590081">Gen Z&nbsp;Mafia</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1086057467455299584">Systems Thinkers</a>  <p>And some great public lists that others have&nbsp;created:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460429">Astronomers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/967118678205505536">Bitcoin Developers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/875371355570487296">Crypto</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1295245028386918402">Cryptoart</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/93883642">Congress</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/128331">Digital and Social&nbsp;Media</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/5158212">Economics</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/55356059">Financial News</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/84693025">Futurists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/73010929">Health Innovators</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/7450">Investors/VC/Angel</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1023884">Machine Learning</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1226161844793966593">Media \\&nbsp;Content</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/222800557">Neuroscience</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215437668">Philosophers</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/215460480">Physicists</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/68365941">Wall Street Influencers</a>  <p>Tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/shingaithornton">@shingaithornton</a> with any thoughts on lists or suggestions for how to improve the ones I’m working&nbsp;on.</p><p>This piece was originally posted <a href="https://blog.shingaithornton.com/twitter-lists-are-underrated/">on my personal&nbsp;blog</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Not bad, eh?  Also with plenty of cute characters on the Spritely site
(thank you to <a href="https://www.peppercarrot.com/">David Revoy</a> for taking
my loose character sketches and making them into such beautiful
paintings!)</p>
<p>But those cute characters are there for a reason!  Spritely is quite
ambitious and has quite a few subprojects.  Here's a
<a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/18aa2f92-36cc-4424-9a4f-6f2de946fbd2">video that explains how they all fit together</a>.
Hopefully that makes things more clear!</p>
<p>Actually that video is from <a href="https://conf.activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub Conference 2020</a>,
the <a href="https://conf.activitypub.rocks/#talks">talks</a> of which have now
<a href="https://conf.tube/video-channels/apconf_channel/videos">all have their videos live</a>!
I also moderated the <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/6289920f-4e35-4141-ab6f-379b357849ec">intro keynote panel about ActivityPub authors/editors</a>.
Plus there's an easter egg, the <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/285e7580-8281-4ae4-842e-81c687237c69">ActivityPub Conference Opening Song</a>! :)</p>
<p>But I can't take credit for APConf 2020... organization and support are thanks to Morgan Lemmer-Webber, Sebastian Lasse, and <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/285e7580-8281-4ae4-842e-81c687237c69">FOSSHost</a> for hosting the website and BigBlueButton instance and <a href="https://conf.tube/">conf.tube</a> for generously hosting all the videos.  There's a <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/87bc99dd-b1b8-4fc3-b034-dca805388179">panel about the organization of APConf</a> you can watch if you're interested in more of that!  (And of course, all the other great videos too!)</p>
<p>So... what about that week I was going to work on Terminal Phase?
Well... I'm still planning on doing it but admittedly it hasn't
happened yet.  All of the above took more time than expected.
However, today I am working on my talk about Spritely Goblins for
RacketCon, and as it turns out, extending Terminal Phase is a big part
of that talk.  But I'll announce more soon when the Terminal Phase
stuff happens.</p>

<p>We sat down with CYNAM Director, Madeline Howard, to find out what makes this ‘woman in identity’ tick….</p>
  
 Question 1: What do you do and what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m delighted to wear a few different hats! My day job is the Socio-Technical Engagement Manager at Cygenta, where I work on the human side of cyber security. I particularly focus on awareness, behaviour and cultural change. I love my field of work as I constantly feel as though I’m making a positive difference to help people and organisations to live more secure lives.</p>
<p>Cygenta also supports me as an <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/industry-100-introduction">i100 for the National Cyber Security Center</a> and their CyberFirst Schools programme. I dedicate one day a week to this – and I absolutely LOVE this part of my job.</p>
<p>Here, I get to work with amazing international, national and local companies to inspire, excite and enthuse the next generation about computer science and cyber security. It’s so rewarding to make a difference to the futures of young people while also supporting the industry talent pipeline.</p>
<p>Finally in my spare time, I’m a Director of Cyber Cheltenham, CyNam. It is a real privilege to be a Director of the UK’s largest cyber cluster and support the development of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>So what gets me out of bed in the morning? Well I’m passionate about making a positive difference. Whether that is in improving organisations and individuals cyber security awareness, exciting the next generation about their future opportunities or developing the incredible cyber security ecosystem we have, I always want to make a positive impact.</p>
 Question 2: How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>It was not exactly a ‘traditional’ route! I studied Geography at Newcastle University and really didn’t know what I wanted to do. Well that’s a lie, I knew my dream job was to be a weather girl… still true! When I finished university, I started in a role within cyber security working in business development. In months I knew I’d found my niche! I loved the pace at which this sector moves and it’s great to be constantly learning about how we engage with technology.</p>
<p>I was keen to pursue a career, raising awareness about cyber security. At Cygenta, I am extremely lucky enough to work for – and be mentored by – Dr Jessica Barker. One thing I recognise is that I’ve always been really lucky to have lots of fantastic people to turn to for advice and guidance and support when I’ve had to make tough decisions during my career.</p>
 Question 3: What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned is to go with your gut, ALWAYS.</p>
<p>I’ve had lots of great opportunities but I nearly turned down some of these simply because I over-thought things. Sometimes things can feel like a risk but if it feels right in your gut it normally is . And, if it doesn’t work out, you’ll still have learned so much simply by learning to take a risk – it’ll all help to shape the future you.</p>
 Question 4: What’s your advice to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>STOP: Thinking that your employees are your ‘human firewall’ against cyber attacks and incidents. The human firewall suggests your employees should prevent attacks and incidents. When it comes to cyber attacks, you can’t prevent every incident, and so this is a totally unrealistic ask on individuals. It also doesn’t prepare people for what to do when something does go wrong.</p>
<p>START: Developing individuals as ‘Human Sensors’. The concept of human sensors suggests that individuals know how to detect and respond to incidents. They understand the indicators of compromise and feel empowered to approach the correct individuals or platforms to report incidents. This ultimately minimises the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) they may have when they think an incident has occurred.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: Investing in cyber security – not just the technology but talent development and people skills. Ensure your employees feel confident and empowered to positively engage with cyber security to improve your response and resilience capabilities.</p>
 Question 5: In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In all aspects of life, diversity is the enabler for growth, innovation, collaboration and positive change.</p>
 Question 6: What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://thegogiver.com/">“The Go-Giver”</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It really resonated with me. In short, it suggests we shouldn’t do things because we expect something in return but because we just want to help. It is a fantastic ethos to live by – it’ll empower you to become the best version of yourself!</p>
 Question 7: What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Care less about what people think of you.</p>
<p>It’s not ‘uncool’ to want to achieve.</p>
<p>Go with your gut and everything will work out.</p>
<p>And, finally, accept that you can’t be in control of everything.</p>
<p>I tell myself everyday ‘I wonder if the stars will align?’. If something works out, the stars have aligned. I don’t know anything about the stars but sometimes when things work out, it’s nice to visualise the stars aligning and shining for you.</p>
 Question 8: Where can we find you on social media / the Web?

On September 2nd, Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, addressed the audience during “Ontology: Empowering DeFi with Credit” and joined a panel discussion themed “Public Chain’s Choice amid DeFi Pressure”. He stated, “By empowering DeFi with credit, we are poised to build the next ‘Super-Oracle’”. In addition, during the event, Erick Pinos, Americas Ecosystem Lead, was engaged in a discussion with the lead of Aave, as well as other renowned projects.  On September 4th, Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, participated in a live AMA panel hosted by HyperPay on the topic of “Braving the DeFi-spurred Storm: Where Will Public Chains Head”. During the panel discussion, he unveiled Ontology’s blueprint for DeFi, and briefed the community users on the innovative and transformative features of&nbsp;Wing.  On September 18th, Jun LI took part in a panel discussion themed “Prospects of Decentralized Finance” at 2020 International Fintech Innovation Conference (IFIC) in Shanghai. During the panel discussion, Li stated that should Ontology wish to stand out in the DeFi industry, while avoiding the transaction-fee issue as faced by Ethereum, it needs to work harder on its strategy to support different fees in scenarios of different technical complexities.  On September 3rd, Kendall MAO, Dean of Ontology Institute, discussed the dilemma posed by DeFi to public chains at a SheKnows live panel. The panel was organized by 8BTCnews, along with representatives from Bytom Blockchain. Kendall mentioned, “Wing, Ontology’s latest cross-chain DeFi project, is integrated with the element of credit. We believe that a dynamic integration with the OScore system will create new paradigms for DeFi innovations, thus opening up new opportunities for Ontology.”<br> <br>Recruitments<br>- Solution Architect<br>- Business Sales<br>- Global Development Manager<br>- Global Marketing Manager<br>- Social Media Associate<br>- Product Manager<br>- Product Operations<br> <br>New Team Members<br>- 1 Marketing Intern <br> <br>Contact Us<br>- Contact us: <a href="mailto:contact@ont.io">contact@ont.io</a><br>- Apply now: <a href="mailto:careers@ont.io">careers@ont.io</a>   Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-monthly-report-september-2020-3c9c1af617d7">Ontology Monthly Report — September 2020</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>From taking credit for someone’s idea to pet names, marginalization can take many forms in the workplace. A set of small actions that individually are annoying, but not egregious, can create a “death by 1,000 cuts” phenomenon — they collectively add up to an environment that does not feel inclusive to some members.</p>
<p>Kasey Panetta, Gartner Senior Content Marketing Manager, interviews <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/47591">Christie Struckman</a>, VP Analyst, to talk about confronting behaviors that marginalize <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-to-more-effectively-advance-underrepresented-talent/">underrepresented employees</a>. Christie explains that any employee can marginalize or be the target of marginalization and once these behaviors are recognized, they must be confronted.</p>
 Listen to interview 
<p>For the full interview, listen to the podcast below or read the transcript that follows, which has been edited for clarity and length. <br>
[swg_ad]</p>
 What is marginalization, and what does it look like in the workplace? 
<p>Marginalization is when someone feels their contribution is not valued, or their idea or specific recommendation is not valued, or because they as an individual, with a demographic that they cannot change, is being devalued. An example is when women feel that simply because they are female, they are not being valued by their peers or they're being treated differently because of that. I'll give an example of three types of marginalizing behaviors.</p>
 Unequal personality trait assessment 
<p>Let's say that we were in a meeting with three male cohorts, and as a group getting really frustrated because we were struggling to make a decision. It felt like we were caught in this sort of endless debate. And one of our male cohorts slammed his fist on the table and said something like, ‘Come on, we have to get our act together and make a decision. Let's move forward.’</p>
<p>The assessment would be that he is trying to take charge and move forward. But if a woman had done that exact same thing, she would be assessed as exhibiting the behaviors of a “B word.” So think about how uncomfortable it is when you feel that people think that you are a B when you're trying to move the conversation forward, like your other male cohorts have done on occasion.</p>
 Lack of confidence assumption 
<p>This occurs when there is a difference between what we think confidence looks like from men and from women. A woman who chooses to be a little bit more quiet in how she approaches things might come across as somebody who's not as competent. So there's this linkage between how confidence is exhibited and therefore somebody's competence, but confidence can look different.</p>
<p>Confidence can look different between men, of course, as well, but there tends to be some sort of natural differences between men and women. And so that difference in how we exhibit confidence being correlated to our competence can be very frustrating.</p>
 The “taking credit” 
<p>For example, in a meeting someone volunteers an idea that doesn't get a lot of discussion, but then five minutes later, another team member offers up the exact same suggestion, not giving me credit for the first suggestion, but instead takes it as their own and takes credit.</p>

 Do people see this as an HR problem to solve? Do they distance themselves from it at all? 
<p>Yes, and I think organizational processes encourage that because it then gets tied to their performance assessments. But when you do that, there's this huge separation between when the behavior happens and then the HR processes.</p>
<p>And I want to be really clear: The HR processes are necessary, but there's a lag. I refer to marginalization as a death of 1,000 cuts — no one instance in and of itself is going to inspire someone to reach out to HR and to say, “I feel like I'm being marginalized.” But collectively, they create an environment where people don’t feel supported.</p>
 What is psychological safety? Why is it so important? 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cios-play-a-key-role-in-improving-psychological-safety/">Psychological safety</a> means creating an environment that encourages, recognizes and rewards individuals for their contributions and their ideas and makes individuals feel safe enough that they'll take interpersonal risks. The biggest contributor to psychological safety is the relationship between employees and their managers.</p>
<p>Those employees who feel they can have an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-leader-checklist-to-foster-trust-on-remote-teams/">open and honest conversation</a> may be more comfortable bringing up work challenges. And it is an important part of the management role to create that environment, which is why I've put together five steps that managers can do when in the moment they see a marginalizing behavior.</p>
 What are the 5 steps to combat marginalization? 
 
 Recognize the behaviors. And here's the hardest part. If you're not being marginalized, you might not recognize it. So part of the research was going through and creating those 12 behaviors. If you can pay attention to these, you will be making a difference. And so I gave an example of taking credit, that unequal personality trait assessment, the lack of confidence assumption, but there's pet names, tokenism, sexist statements and “mansplaining,” or what I call overexplaining. 
 Address those behaviors publicly. You have to do it in the moment. When the situation occurs, quickly call it to attention. It doesn’t need to be a long lecture, but it signals to the marginalized employee that it was noticed. 
 Coach privately. If you're managing the employee it’s easier because you can have a conversation. If not, perhaps approach the employee’s manager to share the situation. Don’t assume why the employee behaved that way — it could have been an oversight. Often, once a manager starts paying attention to the behaviors, they'll realize that it has actually been happening all along, so it’s important to coach the employee privately to change the behavior. 
 Support the employee who was marginalized privately. Managers need to demonstrate empathy and to spend a little time with the employee so that they feel recognized. There is a chance that the employee didn’t feel marginalized, but it’s better to have the conversation so they feel that the manager is looking out for them. 
 Affirm the commitment to inclusion publicly. This doesn't have to be done in the moment, but reaffirm that you care about inclusivity at some point shortly thereafter. This could take the form of reminding people about employee resource groups. 
 
<p>I'm a big proponent of what I call diversity and inclusion norms. These norms are the socially <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-a-sense-of-belonging-in-the-workplace/">accepted ways that we're going to work with each other</a>. The value of norms is letting people know what is expected, by giving a language when we need to call somebody out on whether they're following that. Diversity and inclusion norms can be ones like seek to understand, take turns, listen generously and remember that words matter.</p>

 What other mistakes do you commonly see when it comes to dealing with marginalization? 
<p>I find two big mistakes. One is making an attribution about the person who made the marginalized behavior. Keep it to what you heard. For example, ‘Christie stated that I'm worried that we're not listening to each other, right?’ That's not attribution about why the behavior happened, but that's an observation about the behavior. I find that when you keep the conversation to observe behaviors that really can't be debated, it helps the conversation move forward.</p>
<p>The second mistake is assuming the impact to the woman. That's why the coaching privately is important to understand how that woman is feeling. Did she feel marginalized? Is this a pattern? Maybe this is happening in many more places. That lets you know where you need to spend more time so that you can help to confront and ferret it out. Or maybe the woman doesn't feel marginalized. And so it’s important to keep the conversation open and allow employees to have the freedom and the safety to open up.</p>
 Are there any final thoughts that you would like to share with our audience? 
<p>When I use the language to “‘confront behaviors,” I think that's very uncomfortable for leaders, especially if it's around marginalizing. So I expect that this is an uncomfortable proposal, but I've had many conversations with clients who told me that it was amazing how impactful confronting a behavior once or twice was. And my assumption is that most of these behaviors are a lack of attention versus an intention to hurt somebody's feelings.</p>
<p>The good news is that while it might be uncomfortable, I haven't come across clients who said that they felt like they had to continually confront. And then frankly, what it also does is it narrows down where you might have some issues where you need to get HR involved.</p>

  <p>Last month I came out with a video tutorial on Blazor WebAssembly and I thought it would be good to follow up with a written tutorial as well.</p>

 

 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1vSk8lPtU">Youtube Link</a></p>

<p>Because of the JS Interop, Blazor WASM has some key differences in the world of OAuth. Instead of thinking of this as a normal .NET back end application, you have to think of what Blazor resolves to in the browser - and that’s Javascript. Therefore, all of the security vulnerabilities that come along with browser-based languages apply here. Many have been handled by the team that built Blazor WebAssembly already, but they cannot code for you and make decisions about how to handle your token. We can help with that!</p>

<p>For this tutorial, we will focus on a Blazor WASM Progressive Web App (PWA) because it can be hooked up to a previously-built back end API that can handle the token validation with Okta - this way, we can learn what is required for the Blazor WASM front end website by itself. The ASP.NET Core Hosted option will be addressed in a future post and you can check out the <a>official Okta .NET Blazor samples</a> to see some samples in the meantime.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes">Visual Studio 2019</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2019-mac-relnotes">Visual Studio 2019 for Mac</a> (see the comparison <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/#vs_mac_table">here</a>) or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> (we will be using VS Code for the samples in this article since it runs on everything including Linux) 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0">.NET Core 3.0 SDK</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

<p>Ready to go blazing fast through hooking up external authentication? Start your engines and don’t blink - here we go!</p>

 Build a Blazor WASM Progressive Web App Project 

<p>Let’s start from the beginning with a fresh application. You can also use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/">.NET CLI</a> to create your app, but for this tutorial, I will walk you through the IDE and portal steps.</p>

<p>In Visual Studio, select Create a new project. Then, select Blazor App and click Next.</p>

<p>Set the Project name to “Okta Blazor WASM” and click Create.</p>

<p>Select Blazor WebAssembly App and check Progressive Web Application. We are starting with a PWA because this way you can hook it up to your own, previously-built back end API  leaving Configure for HTTPS checked as well.</p>

<p>Under the Authentication section, “No Authentication” will be set as the default option. Click Change.</p>

<p>Select Individual User Accounts to store user accounts in-app. Click OK.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This option will automatically add the configurations your Blazor application needs to handle authentication and cuts down on having to add some files manually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Click Create.</p>

<p>Build and run your new project to ensure there aren’t any updates to the Visual Studio templates needed. You should see the placeholder Blazor site!</p>

 Set up Okta to Handle Your Blazor WebAssembly App 

<p>You can access your dashboard via the email you received from Okta giving you your org URL. Go there now—unless you need to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">sign up</a> for an Okta developer account.</p>

<p>Once you are logged in, click on Applications and then Add Application.</p>

<p>Since this is Blazor WebAssembly (specifically a PWA), and not traditional .NET Core MVC, you are going to select Single-Page App and fill out the form with the following values:</p>

 
   Name: My Blazor WASM App 
   Base URL: <code>https://{yourLocalhostPortURL}</code> 
   Grant Type: Authorization Code 
   Login redirect URIs: <code>https://{yourLocalhostPortURL}/authentication/login-callback</code> 
   Logout redirect URIs: <code>https://{yourLocalhostPortURL}/authentication/logout-callback</code> 
 

<p>Click Done.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The login-callback and logout-callback parts of the URIs are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/?view=aspnetcore-3.1#authentication-process-with-oidc">Blazor WebAssembly specific routing for OIDC</a> that has been auto-generated for the project when we opted to add authentication to it during the wizard set-up. This is handled specifically inside of the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication">WebAssembly.Authentication</a> Nuget package installed with the latest SDK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the bottom of the screen, your newly registered Okta app will get a Client ID and Client Authentication. Notice that the only option you have is to do this flow with <a href="https://oauth.net/2/pkce/">PKCE</a> (instead of a traditional client secret), as this is a more secure way of handling security vulnerabilities in a front end framework like WebAssembly (which resolves to Javascript). You can read more about what Proof-Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/engineering/blog/pkce/">here</a>.</p>

<p>That’s all there is to set-up for Okta right now!</p>

 Add External Authentication to Your Blazor WASM Project 

<p>Now it’s time to return to the Visual Studio Blazor project and make some adjustments to allow an external auth provider to handle the user login.</p>

<p>Open the <code>Program.cs</code> file.</p>

<p>You’ll notice, because Individual User Accounts were selected during the wizard, “Local” is set up here but we are going to use Okta, instead. Replace “Local” with “Okta”. The line should now look like this:</p>

   <code>builder.Configuration.Bind("Okta", options.ProviderOptions);
</code>   

<p>This is going to pull from a configuration file. You can find that under the <code>wwwroot</code> folder, inside of your <code>appsettings.json</code> file.</p>

<p>Replace the JSON in the entire file with the code below:</p>

   <code>{
  "Okta": {
    "Authority": "https://{yourOktaOrg}.okta.com/oauth2/default",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>It’s important to specify in <code>Program.cs</code> that the kind of flow we are using is the authentication code flow with OIDC. The way you do that is by providing a ProviderOptions response type. Add the code below underneath your Okta configuration line:</p>

   <code>options.ProviderOptions.ResponseType = "code";
</code>   

<p>If you are interested in bringing over more information in the token, besides the user’s ID, you need to include some other scopes. I have added a few that come out of the box with your Okta default authorization server, but you can create and configure your own at any time in the portal. To see what scopes are available, look under API &gt; Authorization Servers &gt; default &gt; Scopes.</p>

<p>Add the following underneath the “code” ProviderOptions line to add more information about your user:</p>

   <code>options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add("profile");
options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add("address");
</code>   

<p>The <code>AddOidcAuthentication</code> method should now look like this altogether:</p>

   <code>builder.Services.AddOidcAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    // Configure your authentication provider options here.
    // For more information, see https://aka.ms/blazor-standalone-auth
    //builder.Configuration.Bind("Local", options.ProviderOptions);
    builder.Configuration.Bind("Okta", options.ProviderOptions);
    options.ProviderOptions.ResponseType = "code";
    options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add("profile");
    options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add("address");
});
</code>   

 Using Razor Components AuthorizeView in Your Blazor WASM App 

<p>A lot of work has been done on Blazor around templatizing the views to handle toggling what can be seen based on the user’s authenticated state. You don’t have to write a bunch of this from scratch; the wizard set-up generated a sample UI for you that is already observing that state. The built-in <code>Authentication.razor</code> page inside of the Pages folder already handles whatever Actions come through the routing with a RemoteAuthenticatorView.</p>

<p>Take a look at <code>App.razor</code> and you will see the entire site UI is wrapped in a CascadingAuthenticationState. You don’t have to write a separate one for each page, as this handles what is displayed to the user globally. However, you can override what the user sees in a logged out or logged in state at the Page-level as well. If you take a look at the Shared folder and open <code>LoginDisplay.razor</code> you can see an example of this inside of an AuthorizeView with Authorized and NotAuthorized HTML views for you to customize.</p>

<p>It’s great that all this works out of the box!</p>

<p>Let’s add a page to see a bit more about our user, which specifically shows the claims that came along with the token—but only if the user is logged in.</p>

<p>Right-click on Pages, add a new Razor Page and name it “Claims.razor”.</p>

<p>Copy the code below into the file:</p>

   <code>@page "/claims"
&lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
            Hello @context.User.Identity.Name,
            here's the list of your claims:
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            @foreach (var claim in context.User.Claims)
            {
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;@claim.Type&lt;/b&gt;: @claim.Value&lt;/li&gt;
            }
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm sorry, I can't display anything until you log in&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
</code>   

<p>The foreach loop accesses the application context and looks at the OIDC Claims collection. which has been added via token deserialization into the User object, courtesy of the built-in WebAssembly Authentication in Blazor.</p>

<p>Next, we need to add this page to the UI navigation.</p>

<p>Expand the Shared folder and open <code>NavMenu.razor</code>. Go to the NavMenuCssClass div and and another list item below “Fetch data”:</p>

   <code>&lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="claims"&gt;
        &lt;span class="oi oi-list-rich" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; User OIDC Claims
    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code>   

<p>Save, build, and run the application in a browser. It may take a minute to load whenever you make changes.</p>

<p>You can view three pages in a logged out state, but the new page you added should display this NotAuthorized message.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s log in now!</p>

<p>Click Log In at the top right-hand corner of the page. The user will be redirected to your identity provider, which is your Okta org. If you have a test user already added to your account, go ahead and try out those credentials. However, if you are interested in enabling a user to register themselves (highly recommended), go back to your Okta portal and turn that feature on. You can find it by selecting Users &gt; Registration and filling out the information you want to display to a new user. Once you are done there, a Sign up link should appear at the bottom of your Okta login screen. Click that, and fill it out (real email address required).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you are authenticated, it will redirect you back to your app‚which has grabbed the name of the logged-in user and displays it on the top-right of the screen—with a Log Out URL next to it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now if you navigate to your User OIDC Claims page, you should be authorized to see what was brought along with the token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can also log out to play with the visibility of sections of the app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Pretty sweet!</p>

 Recap 

<p>I found the process of plugging in Okta to Blazor WASM to be very quick and easy. The team that worked on WebAssembly for .NET was very thoughtful about the experience of using an external identity provider, and it shows. We’ve got more coming around Blazor, so tell us what you would like to see!</p>

<p>Until next time, fellow Coders.</p>

 The market capitalization of stablecoins reached $20.62 billion, Stablecoin regulatory policy of the United&nbsp;States <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1915489812">https://bihu.com/article/1915489812</a></p><p>Original publish time: September 30,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   The market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $757 million to $20.62&nbsp;billion.  Last week, the circulation of USDT, USDC, and DAI increased by 150 million, 334 million, and 213&nbsp;million.  OCC issued the regulations on stablecoins for the first time, confirming that the Commonwealth Bank can provide custody services for legal-collateralized stablecoins.  The bank has the right to deposit reserves of certain ‘stablecoin’, which refers to stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency.  The Bank verifies at least once a day that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with&nbsp;issuers.  FinHub encourages all parties involved in the construction and sale of digital assets to contact FinHub through the official website to help them ensure that such digital assets comply with the Federal Securities Act.

Stablecoin Regulatory Policy of the United&nbsp;States <p>As early as June, the OCC issued a ‘pre-notification of the proposed rulemaking’, asking the public to weigh how to use cryptocurrency and other financial technology tools in the financial sector before August 3. Several banks have indicated that they may be interested in providing crypto custody and other services to customers. Dominic Venturo, the chief digital officer of the National Association of American banks, said in response that the OCC should distinguish between utility tokens, stablecoins, and Exchange platform&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Last week, the OCC issued regulations on stablecoins, confirming that the Commonwealth Bank can provide custody services for legal-collateralized stablecoins. This is the first time the OCC has issued regulations regarding stablecoins. The OCC is a federal agency responsible for overseeing the implementation of laws related to the National Bank and supervising the Federal Bank and the agencies of foreign banks. Subsequently, the SEC FinHub Staff stated that it could consider adopting a ‘no action’ position on specific digital asset activities under appropriate circumstances.</p> The OCC released regulations on stablecoins for the first&nbsp;time <p>On September 21, the OCC issued a press release and subsequent explanatory letter stating that banks have the right to deposit certain ‘stablecoins’ reserves. The stablecoin mentioned here specifically refers to stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency and does not include other stablecoins backed by commodities, cryptocurrencies, or other assets. The demand for stablecoins is increasing day by day, with multiple applications, such as large-scale transfers, which have great potential. Two technologies for realizing cryptocurrency, encryption technology and distributed ledger technology, are developing rapidly.</p><p>The National Bank has a clear authorization to accept deposits, which is also the core business of the bank. Certain stablecoin issuers may also wish to deposit the cash reserves supporting their issuance of stablecoins in the National Bank. As long as stablecoin issuers can effectively manage risks and comply with relevant laws (including the ‘Bank Secrecy Law’ and anti-money laundering laws), banks can provide services for their legitimate businesses, including cryptocurrency businesses. Therefore, banks may obtain deposits from stablecoin issuers, including stablecoin reserve deposits related to custodian wallets.</p><p>Like other deposits, stablecoin reserves are also subject to laws and regulations related to deposit insurance coverage. The stablecoin reserve account can be the deposit of a stablecoin issuer or the deposit of a single stablecoin holder. Banks and the FSA should provide accurate and appropriate disclosures on deposit insurance coverage to ensure compliance with the BSA and other regulations, including but not limited to the customer due diligence under the BSA, customer identification requirements under the Patriot Act, requirements under the Federal Securities Act, and identification of the beneficial owners of the accounts&nbsp;enabled.</p><p>Reserves related to stablecoins may bring significant liquidity risks. New banking activities should be developed and implemented under sound risk management principles, and banks should establish appropriate risk management procedures for the development of new businesses. OCC hopes that all banks manage liquidity risks at the same level as the risks they assume. The protocol between the bank and the stablecoin issuer may include restrictions or requirements for holding assets in the reserve account, and the protocol may stipulate the responsibilities of the parties. For example, the bank should sign an appropriate protocol with the issuer to ensure that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with issuers. The agreement should include a mechanism for the bank to periodically check the amount of outstanding stablecoin.</p><p>To summarize, national banks are authorized to deposit stablecoin reserves, subject to the following restrictions:</p><p>Only support stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency.<br>The Bank verifies at least once a day that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with issuers.<br>Banks should establish appropriate risk management procedures for the development of new businesses.<br>Banks must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.<br>Banks must establish appropriate control measures and conduct adequate due diligence.<br>The bank must confirm the beneficial owners of the accounts&nbsp;enabled.</p> The Statement of&nbsp;SEC <p>After the OCC issued the explanatory letter, the SEC FinHub Staff issued a statement.</p><p>According to the Federal Securities Law, whether a specific digital asset (including stablecoins) should be considered security depends on actual conditions. The nature of the asset needs to be carefully analyzed, including the right to hold the asset and how to provide and sell the&nbsp;asset.</p><p>SEC FinHub believes that as long as it meets the relevant registration, reporting, and other requirements of the Federal Securities Law, market participants may construct and sell digital assets in a way that does not constitute securities. However, the terms used to describe digital assets or financial activities involving digital assets may not be consistent with the definitions of SEC in relevant laws and regulations. FinHub encourages all parties involved in the construction and sale of digital assets to contact FinHub through the official website to help them ensure that such digital assets can comply with the Federal Securities Act. FinHub staff will always be ready to assist participants. If appropriate, a ‘no action’ position will be considered.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

 The GiD Report#128 — What the Apple App Store backlash tells us about this moment in&nbsp;time <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-127-amid-tiktok-deal-ray-dalio-explains-chinas-differences-58c5cab76639">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  The era of David v.&nbsp;Goliath  The era of moderation  Stuff happens   1. I’ll just talk about two main things this week — both of which speak to the moment that we are currently in. The first is the Apple App Store backlash. <p>It’s worth noting — it’s still pretty unclear how any of this plays out. Apple is in a strong position in terms of its loyal user base, the quality of its products and ecosystem, and also possibly in the eyes of the law (disclaimer: I am not a lawyer). It’s Apple’s App Store and Apple gets to call the&nbsp;shots.</p><p>Plus, I’ve been an iPhone user since the 5S and I don’t see myself switching anytime soon. (Not that it would make a huge difference since Google — aside from allowing you to access apps outside the Play Store, essentially follows the same type of&nbsp;model.)</p><p>And Apple has taken criticism before from disgruntled developers.</p><p>But what all of this shows is that this time, it’s different.</p>Photo: Fortune Global&nbsp;Forum<p>Whatever you want to call it — the establishment, the status quo, Big Tech monopolies — people have never been more distrustful and/or critical of the large institutions that rule over us. As one of the world’s largest multinational corporations with a market cap of ~$2 trillion, Apple easily falls into that&nbsp;camp.</p><p>That distrust has been brewing for some time, but for the most part, I’m not sure people had a real sense of belief that things could change. It’s Apple. What are you going to do about&nbsp;it?</p><p>That’s what makes this moment different — the growing sense of belief that change is suddenly possible. It’s not just about Apple and the App Store, either. You don’t have to look around very much to see that this moment applies to everything — our platforms, our politics, our society in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney certainly senses the moment. His latest coalition is a call to&nbsp;arms.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/technology/apple-google-coalition-epic-match-spotify.html">NYTimes&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>For months, complaints from tech companies against Apple’s and Google’s power have grown&nbsp;louder.</blockquote><blockquote>Spotify, the music streaming app, criticized Apple for the rules it imposed in the App Store. A founder of the software company Basecamp attacked Apple’s “highway robbery rates” on apps. And last month, Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Apple and Google, claiming they violated antitrust rules.</blockquote><blockquote>Now these app makers are uniting in an unusual show of opposition against Apple and Google and the power they have over their app stores. On Thursday, the smaller companies said they had formed the Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit group that plans to push for changes in the app stores and “protect the app economy.” The 13 initial members include Spotify, Basecamp, Epic and Match Group, which has apps like Tinder and&nbsp;Hinge.</blockquote><blockquote>“They’ve collectively decided, ‘We’re not alone in this, and maybe what we should do is advocate on behalf of everybody,’” said Sarah Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the group. She added that the new nonprofit would be “a voice for&nbsp;many.”</blockquote><p>What the coalition is fighting&nbsp;for:</p><blockquote>At the heart of the new alliance’s effort is opposition to Apple’s and Google’s tight grip on their app stores and the fortunes of the apps in them. The two companies control virtually all of the world’s smartphones through their software and the distribution of apps via their stores. Both also charge a 30 percent fee for payments made inside apps in their&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><blockquote>App makers have increasingly taken issue with the payment rules, arguing that a 30 percent fee is a tax that hobbles their ability to compete. In some cases, they have said, they are competing with Apple’s and Google’s own apps and their unfair advantages.</blockquote><blockquote>On Thursday, the coalition published a list of 10 principles, outlined on its website, for what it said were fairer app practices. They include a more transparent process for getting apps approved and the right to communicate directly with their users. The top principle states that developers should not be forced to exclusively use the payments systems of the app store publishers.</blockquote><p>Reality check: At best, this is simply the beginning of a movement that is fundamentally a story of David v. Goliath. Despite the success of Fortnite, Apple is still 200x the size of Epic Games. And more recently, Apple’s has centered the narrative of the company’s future around “services.” Expect Tim Cook to stand his&nbsp;ground.</p><p>And the Goliaths of the world have been steadfast and reaping the rewards for some&nbsp;time.</p><p>But like I said, this time, it’s different:</p><blockquote>Scrutiny of the largest tech companies has reached a new intensity. The Department of Justice is expected to file an antitrust case against Google as soon as next week, focused on the company’s dominance in internet search. In July, Congress grilled the chief executives of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook about their practices in a high-profile antitrust hearing. And in Europe, regulators have opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple’s App Store tactics and are preparing to bring antitrust charges against Amazon for abusing its dominance in internet commerce.</blockquote><p>Grab some popcorn. Whatever happens, it’s a bit thrilling that the Davids of the world are starting to believe again,&nbsp;no?</p><p>In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://appfairness.org/">the coalition’s site here</a>, where they <a href="https://appfairness.org/our-vision/">outline their 10 principles</a>.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-opens-new-fight-with-apple-over-messaging">Facebook Opens New Fight With Apple Over Messaging</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage">Justice Dept.

The second thing we’ll highlight this week is really about the challenges of operating a platform in this current climate. Which is sort of a catch-22 seeing as the nature of our platforms have themselves deeply contributed to where we’ve ended up. Just look at Facebook. <p>And I’m not talking about the Facebook that you and I use. I’m talking about the internal Facebook that Facebook employees use.</p><p>Ina Fried:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: As political arguments on Facebook’s employee discussion boards have grown more heated and divisive, the company ordered new restrictions on the forums earlier this month, which run on Facebook’s Workplace platform.</blockquote><blockquote>Last week, the company banned employees from replacing their profile photos on the system with activist&nbsp;images.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook’s difficulty managing its own employees using its own social network suggests that the company’s problems might be rooted more in the conception and design of its products than in the fiery state of today’s public discourse.</blockquote><blockquote>Catch up quick: Facebook, like most Silicon Valley companies, has long prided itself on an open culture embracing free debate, epitomized by regular staff meetings where CEO Mark Zuckerberg answers employee questions.</blockquote><p>Mark’s solution has been to create “dedicated spaces&nbsp;… for discussing charged topics, with clear rules and strong moderation.”</p><p>Which makes you wonder — how will that make Facebook think about actual Facebook? The difference, of course, is that divisive engagement internally is bad because it makes the company dysfunctional. But divisive engagement on Facebook proper, despite contributing to a more dysfunctional society, is super aligned with their core ad-based business&nbsp;model.</p><p>Because what we’re learning — and frankly, what people have intuitively known for some time — is that the engagement that these platforms promote is probably not that&nbsp;great:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: What’s bugging so many Facebook workers is the same problem some of Facebook’s 3 billion users identified a long time&nbsp;ago.</blockquote>  By shunting so many different dimensions of our online communications onto the same platform — from school connections to family members and workplace acquaintances to people with shared interests — Facebook makes it impossible to keep different facets of our lives from overlapping.  <blockquote>The scholar Danah Boyd popularized the phrase “context collapse” to describe the tendency of social networks to flatten our&nbsp;lives.</blockquote>  Now that dynamic is pushing Facebook, which has staked out a content moderation policy that treads lightly on limiting political speech in public, to curtail the political speech of its own employees.  <blockquote>The catch: Facebook’s internal moderators will now have to figure out how to draw a clean line between “charged topics” and everything else.</blockquote><blockquote>Everything Facebook touches today has a political dimension, and everything from user interface design to machine-learning code to marketing materials has social and political dimensions that can trigger “charged” exchanges.</blockquote><p>I’m not going to put too much blame on Facebook for this one. They’re figuring things out along with the rest of us. But it certainly raises a bunch of important questions as we look to build the&nbsp;future.</p><p>And in an age when every company is also a messaging company (see: Zoom, below), these are questions that every platform will need to ask itself (and in a way, they’ll be able to come at it from a different perspective since companies like Zoom and Discord aren’t built on ad-based business&nbsp;models.)</p><p>Because how do we want to shape the incentives that define our communities such that we can constructively evolve as a&nbsp;society?</p><p>In any case, the road ahead won’t be easy or straightforward.</p><p>Certainly <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-13a2568e-e823-475a-88b8-eb370237d273.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">not for Facebook</a>:</p><blockquote>A group of high-profile Facebook critics on Friday announced the launch of what they are calling the “Real Facebook Oversight Board.” As Sara Fischer reports, it’s an effort that aims to counter an independent board established by Facebook last year to oversee its decisions on content moderation.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: The opposing effort represents how political the fight between Facebook and its critics has become in the lead-up to the presidential election.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The group includes leaders from the Stop Hate for Profit boycott, like Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, and Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, as well as prominent Facebook critics like Roger McNamee and some journalists and&nbsp;pundits.</blockquote><p>So yeah, tomorrow’s presidential debate will be interesting.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zoom-invests-in-big-messaging-upgrade-in-challenge-to-slack">Zoom Invests in Big Messaging Upgrade in Challenge to&nbsp;Slack</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/opinion/2020-election-security-tech.html">America’s Tech Billionaires Could Help Protect the Election.
