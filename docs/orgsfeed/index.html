<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Sushma Varadaiah from <a href="https://coding-bootcamps.com/">Coding Bootcamps</a>.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?</p>



<p>I personally feel that it’s the right time to get into blockchain as it holds a lot of potential in the very near future. Blockchain will be the way that we are going to establish trust and transparency in the world as we move forward. Along with other technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things, the use of blockchain multiply.</p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on, and let us know what was it that made you want to get into blockchain?</p>



<p>I have 6+ years of experience as a software developer. I am currently working on blockchain systems (Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric). I got into blockchain because I studied cryptography and security while getting a Master degree in Computer Science and Information Security. It was easy for me to pick up blockchain’s underlying technologies because of my Master’s studies. I recognized the technology’s potential and got into blockchain.</p>



<p>What project in Hyperledger are you working on? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>I am working on Hyperledger Fabric. My journey with Hyperledger Fabric started when I got my first blockchain certification from the Linux Foundation followed by a Master’s degree certification in blockchain from International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. I have developed Hyperledger Fabric Proofs of Concept for a range of use cases including&nbsp; pharmaceutical drug supply chain, certificate verification and property registration network. You can find source code for all these in my GitHub page.</p>



<p>What are the main differences between teaching Hyperledger to students and developing Hyperledger applications?</p>



<p>While teaching at <a href="https://coding-bootcamps.com/">Coding Bootcamps</a>, the main challenge is to explain blockchain concepts to a student who is new to the technology. Troubleshooting the issues that are faced by students who are learning to develop blockchain applications is a very rewarding feeling. On the other hand, developing Hyperledger applications for a business involves different complexities like deploying and scaling the application according to user growth.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>Devtools for easy smart contract development and deployment.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s incubated projects start maturing and hit 1.0s and beyond, what are the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result from your perspective?</p>



<p>I personally feel Hyperledger Fabric has a lot of potential to bring transparency to supply chain management use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>Increasing transparency and trust among users.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I hope to see applications moving towards decentralization and industry maturing towards adoption of blockchain with other technologies like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things.</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>Never stop learning.</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>



<p>Internet!</p>

<p>A crash-course in the complex world of variously-open software licensing</p><p>The ostensibly binary distinction between “open” and “closed” software gets bandied about in many contexts, often in a dangerously simplified form, as though there were only two, mutually-exclusive options. It can also be extended to standards in an imprecise or oversimplified way. Sometimes people refer to groups like DIF “working on open-source standards,” but speaking precise, no such thing&nbsp;exists!</p><p>Only software code can be open-source, since after all, “source” is short for “source code” (pre-compiled software). Standards, whether open or not, are not code — instead, they are functional definitions and specifications that define and specify protocols that one application (or code base) uses to talk to another (or code base). Each standard can be understood as a benchmark for testing specific implementations, dividing existing and future codebases into those fully, partly, or non-compliant with its requirements.</p>“Lean Startup workshop” in Amsterdam, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus">Daria Nepriakhina</a><p>Code, whether open-source or not, can implement or “build to” a pre-existing standard, which can be developed in a variously open or closed manner; there is no inherent link or dependency between the openness or rigor of the two processes. Similarly, a standard can be “written around” one or more existing implementations, in such a way that the existing code is definitively compliant with the resulting standard tailored to it. This latter operation is an important function in open-source communities, in that it invites future developers to make new code that will be interchangeable or interoperable with that precedent. Even if that pre-existing code is closed, the resulting standard can be of great use to open-source development, particularly if the process used to write it was also “open” and participated in by the designers and implementers of that closed-source precedent.</p><p>In this series of three brief explanatory posts, we’ll first explain open-source development as a process rather than defining it by its results. In the next post, we will explain the characteristics and optionalities of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. Lastly, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p> Source Code and Intellectual Property&nbsp;Law <p>At their lowest level, computers are just machines that exercise millions of structured computations every second. They take inputs, perform computation, and produce&nbsp;outputs.</p>(public domain)<p>These computations can be combined into complex structures of data and decision-making called “programs” that interface with humans to make useful and meaningful outputs. At the lowest level, these computations still look like oceans of 1s and 0s to the untrained eye, but decades of refinement of operating systems, programming languages, scripting languages, and other abstractions make it easy for engineers to deal only with “source code” as a kind of human-readable abstraction at higher levels. This is “compiled” into more efficient, machine-readable “binaries” (ones and zeros) that can be deployed to standardized hardware in the real world where it is “run” (live software is often referred to as “runtime”).</p>by <a href="https://scs.senecac.on.ca/~chris.szalwinski">Chris Szalwinski</a> from <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp100/pages/content/compi.html">The C Program</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ca/">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada&nbsp;License</a>.<p>Because it is human-readable and because licenses apply to compiled binaries and functional software in specific jurisdictions, the software industry has largely applied practices analogous to academic “peer review” for sharing and critiquing core pieces of source code. This complicates the open/closed distinction further, since a closed-source project and a licensed binary might still offer key components up for review through github or other channels traditionally used for open development. Furthermore, the many gradients between complete “open” or “closed” software depends on the ownership and licensing of a given piece of software, which can evolve over time or differ in its enforceability across jurisdictions. Like all legal matters, mileage may vary and always consult a licensed&nbsp;expert!</p> A thumbnail history of licensing <p>There is a range of different licensing regimes for source code. Among open-source licenses, different functions can be enabled or facilitated independently of one another: external review, attribution, innovation, maintenance, and even revenue-sharing and other conditions on business practices.</p><p>Proprietary code bases are released under closed-source licenses, which are optimized for secrecy, exclusivity, and/or sale of the results through licensing-based revenue models. For decades, this was how Microsoft licensed not only its proprietary stand-alone software, but even the bulk of the Windows operating system. The licensing landscape is much more diverse today, but before the 1990s very little commercial software was developed in the open or had its source code published after the&nbsp;fact.</p><p>The culture of academia is one of sharing and publishing intellectual work for peers to see and review — open peer-review is as central in academic computer science as it is in the hard sciences. The internet was originally imagined, architected, prototyped, and built by academics, and tinkerers, primarily supported by military and government funding. These three cultures (the military, academia, and independent “hacker”/tinkerer types) formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Galaxy">basis of internet culture</a>. A fourth culture was added later when the general public’s access to the internet evolved into a massive commercial industry in the early&nbsp;1990s.</p><p>For our purposes here, we can limit ourselves to the fairly direct link, sometimes biographical, between the anomalous, non-commercial origins of the internet and the development of the open-source movement within the software industry. One “origin myth” that exemplifies this link is the story of a young Richard Stallman, then working in an early Artificial Intelligence lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wanted to customize some printer software for an expensive new printer shared across all the floors of a busy research building. To do so, he needed to get the source code from the manufacturer, which he had done to customize the previous “workhorse” printer in the same building.</p><p>The manufacturer of the new model, however, surprised Stallman by refusing to hand over the code on grounds of licensing and intellectual property rights. Stallman, to whom the motto “software wants to be free” is often misattributed, often <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823">credits the incident</a> for his deeply-held belief that the end-users of software have a right to modify and participate in the software they use, whether they paid directly for it or benefited from the procurements of governments. To this day, the details and boundaries of this right are still being debated, not only in open-source requirements for government procurements, but also in “right to repair” laws that extend these rights into the domain of hardware and the physical (and 3D-printed) world.</p> Varying degrees of “Software Freedom” <p>Stallman went on to found the Free Software Foundation and play a pivotal role in the elaboration of an open-source (and “free open source”) movement. He also created the first GNU Public Licence (GPL), still a major and influential family of licenses. All versions of the GPL have within them some version of these 4 essential “freedoms”:</p><blockquote>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (“freedom 0”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (“freedom 1”). Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (“freedom 2”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (“freedom 3”). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><p>Honoring these four freedoms textually and fully can make it very hard to sell software commercially for many reasons, salient among them that freely-available source code in a major language is trivial to compile into functioning binaries; commercial or “closed” software is generally sold as compiled binaries, keeping the source code&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Furthermore, many early open-source licenses like GPL explicitly forbid so-called “enclosure” of the code, i.e., incorporating pieces or subsets of the licensed code into a new, close-source product. Anti-enclosure licensing is often referred to as “copyleft” (because it prohibits future copyrighting!) or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license">viral</a> licensing,” since it cannot be mixed and matched with other licensing without overriding more restrictive licensing. This severely limits commercial potential of “forks” or derived variants. The entire Linux family of operating systems are licensed this way, which keeps Linux development squarely in the camp of maximally-open development throughout.</p><p>Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, the open-source movement grew and at some point the software industry could not afford to ignore it, even if directly participating with licenses like GPL was not feasible for most companies of any size. This period saw the first “compromise-licenses” and hybrid open/closed business-models evolve around them. Many of the licenses still popular today date to these early experiments. For instance, the license originally created for the University of California, Berkeley’s fork of Unix, and still known today as the Berkeley Software Development (BSD) license, is one such “commercially lenient” open-source licenses. These licenses allow developers to take code that was originally open, make significant changes to modified versions of it, and license or even sell those under more classically commercial licenses.</p><p>Similarly, more lenient variants of the Apache and MIT licenses date to this period as well. It is worth noting that Apache web servers were one of the first open-source pieces of software that replaced a dominant commercial product. Apache web server software reaching a dominant position in the previously closed-license, commercial niche was a watershed moment for open-source software.</p><p>Apache is often held up, alongside Linux, as an example of where open-source software optimizes for standardization and safety of mission-critical infrastructure, largely due to the thorough and ongoing auditing and maintenance enabled by its core components being completely open to review, testing, and improvement proposals. Conversely, however, some historians of software development point out that allowing enclosure to the degree that Apache licenses do can lead to simultaneous or “parallel” development of various (partially closed-source) forks to evolve in tandem according to various divergent business agendas. Over time, this can splinter development, wicking off talent, attention, and manpower into closed development and creating a major coordination problem for the open-source “parent” of the family tree. In the most severe cases, this can greatly diminish and forfeit the standardization and security gains that made sharing an open-source parent so desirable in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Today and&nbsp;Tomorrow <p>Today, cloud-based business models and Software-as-a-Service have revived and expanded the toolkit for closed-source development, and in turn breathed new life into the debate about how hybrid models could make open-source infrastructure sustainable by revenue shares from closed-source products that depend on it. Similarly, the so called “cloud loophole” in older GPL licenses, whereby software could be run but not “distributed,” was closed by the newer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero GPL</a> that applies to cloud environments.</p><p>Another interesting frontier in the evolving licensing landscape is being opened up in recent years by distributing computing and distributed ledgers. One key assumption of traditional licensing is that software runs on a finite set of distinct pieces of hardware, with ownership and liability that follow straightforwardly from there. Distributed computing, however, where computation work is spread out over a more diffuse and indeterminate numbers of computers, which might have limited or no insight into the “big picture” of the software they are running, muddy the waters even further than traditional cloud environment. On the radically open side of the spectrum, the distributed-computing ecosystem project HoloChain has innovated the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">Cryptographic Autonomy Licence </a>to empower users (and the software running in their name) by protecting them with encryption.</p><p>New forms of “confidential computing” and encrypted, self-sovereign networking take this even further, making the boundaries of software and runtime environments similarly porous. Attempts at licensing for these new topographies have been <a href="https://sdtimes.com/os/osi-co-founder-leaves-initiative-over-new-license/">controversial</a> at times, but they are also an important precedent and context for work happening in the DIF, such as that of the Secure Data Storage <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working&nbsp;group</a>.</p><p>There are even more radical experiments and movements happening in the open-licensing problem space, which would restrict usage not [only] according to commercial terms or enclosure, but according to non-monetary and non-licensing rubrics as well. For instance, the “ICE breaker” <a href="https://icebreaker.dev">project </a>has brought more attention to the movement to license software according to so-called “<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/">ethical licenses</a>.” These restrict derivative use anywhere it can be proven to support of human rights violations, such as in military applications or for “predictive policing” and other use-cases that run afoul of international authorities on human rights and discrimination. The provisions or triggers for such licensing might be as hard to enforce as international human rights law (i.e., very hard), but it sends a signal that specifications and standards from other disciplines such as human rights law and ethical philosophy might someday find their place among the commercial and attribution clauses in open-source licenses.</p> Further reading <p>All code developed under the DIF umbrella is strictly open source, and while DIF accepts donations of previously-closed source code, it is expected that all ongoing iterations of them will take place in the open. The original vision for DIF as a project within the <a href="https://www.jointdevelopment.org/about1.html">Joint Development Foundation</a> was to host code development, and it has since expanded to include co-developed pre-standards specifications and other educational and non-technical <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/education/home">materials</a> as well. Take a spin through our github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/">repositories</a> if you’d like to see an overview of historical and ongoing projects.</p><p>In this quick overview, we have only scratched the surface, though, and we encourage anyone working in the open software space to educate themselves further. The Open Source Initiative <a href="https://opensource.org/trademark-guidelines#Usage_That_Does_Not_Require_Permission">holds the trademark </a>on the phrase “open source” and maintains a very helpful list of licenses that it has decided are fully conformant with its principles. The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">list of approved licenses</a> that they maintain is a great place to start if you are researching the licensing landscape, and they also hold <a href="https://opensource.org/events">events</a> and offer a substantial offering of <a href="https://opensource.org/osi-open-source-education">educational materials</a>.</p><p>In our next installment, we’ll turn to Open Standards and the work of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">Drilling down: Open Source</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Webinar: Tackling Scalability and Moving into Production</p>



<p>While DLTs are no longer a mystery to most enterprises, we still have not yet figured out how to build and scale production grade projects. It is easy to build a POC, but moving to the real world with real customers is a whole different issue. Moreover, the young age of the DLT space shows in lack of tooling. In this webinar, experts from Simbachain will explain how to use SIMBA, a smart contract as a service and blockchain innovation platform to rapidly design, build and scale production DLT applications using Hyperledger Fabric. The centerpiece of the presentation will be a live demo.</p>



<p>Tune on Wednesday, October 7, at 10:00 am EDT. For more information and to register, go <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-member-webinar-tackling-scalability-and-moving-into-production-simbachain">here</a>.</p>

<p>Bringing emerging privacy-preserving technology to a public health&nbsp;crisis</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young</a>, Identity Woman, Co-Founder of the Internet Identity Workshop; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyyang1122/">Lucy Yang</a>, Co-Chair of the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</p>Photo from&nbsp;Unsplash<p>We submitted this position statement to the “<a href="https://fpf.org/event/privacy-pandemics-responsible-uses-of-technology-and-health-data-during-times-of-crisis-an-international-tech-and-data-conference/">Privacy &amp; Pandemics Workshop: Responsible Uses of Technology and Health Data During Times of Crisis — An International Tech and Data Conference</a>” by the Future of Privacy Forum. The aim is to, from two participants’ point of view, share an abbreviated case study of CCI and to highlight key challenges that arose in our efforts to responsibly use new privacy-preserving technologies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We wanted to share our submission with the CCI community and the public in the hope to invite some further discussions.</p><p>So what is this emerging technology that is just coming to market with very early adopters and innovators leading the way (including the US government, the government of British Columbia, etc.)? It is called Verifiable Credentials (VC or VCs), <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">a data format standard developed </a>and published <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">by the W3C</a> last year. It is a universal data format for one entity (person, organization or thing) to assert something about another entity. The issuer packages up the credential and cryptographically signs it to seal the data it contains. It passes this to the subject, or holder, so that the subject can share it with the receiver of the credential, the verifier. At that point, the receiver is able to use cryptography to check the seal and the validity of the issuer. VCs are privacy-preserving because the issuer (identity provider) and verifier (relying party) do not form a technical/federated link with each other. The information does not pass directly.</p><p>This technology gives people the ability to collect and manage digital credentials — similar to the cards we find in our physical wallets — in digital wallets. These digital credentials act like paper credentials because individuals do not need to have the verifier directly connect to the issuer. Why is this new? Until now, to have provable information exchanged online, the issuer and verifier would need to directly “federate” to exchange information about the data&nbsp;subject.</p><p>Immunology is a complex science, but simplified basics about how it works with some viruses are known. It was based on these simple understandings that possibilities for how VCs might be used by people and institutions to better manage risk began to be explored. One obvious use case was the ability to issue VCs that reflect some type of COVID-19 status, a proof that&nbsp;one:</p>  Tests positive for antibodies and therefore not infected/or vulnerable to being infected.  Has recently tested negative and therefore the risk of being infected is low and that one could go to work, travel or visit a facility with vulnerable populations.  Has received a vaccine for COVID-19 and therefore safe to travel or access a large in-person event.  <p>Some of these use cases as articulated are not new (e.g. the Yellow Card); it’s just new to digitize them. It makes sense to consider how this simple paper-based technology can be updated to digital. However, the mild hysteria raised about doing things today done on paper via digital means that concerns were triggered without fully understanding or exploring how to use the technology. Some individuals were so concerned that they <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/resignation-at-identity-initiative-raises-doubts-about-immunity-passes">resigned</a> from organizations whose leadership <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/safracenterforethicswhitepaper8_01.pdf">floated these&nbsp;ideas</a>.</p><p>COVID-19 status is currently shared in two forms: 1) with the patient via a phone call or text message from the doctor or testing site or 2) in a patient medical record. Neither of these solutions provides a clear way for the subject to prove results to an entity that wants to know this information (e.g. an airline). VCs offer a new innovative format that provides people with information about their COVID-19 status that is under their control and verifiable by a relying&nbsp;party.</p><p>The VC approach is in strong contrast to the <a href="https://commonpass.splashthat.com/">CommonPass</a> effort, led by a Rockefeller-Foundation-backed nonprofit, that co-arose in the same time frame. The leadership at CommonPass is connected to the conventional medical records world and proposed the creation of a global system where patient medical records in some yet-to-be-determined way would be shared with a centralized decision engine that CommonPass would run globally. They held several global meetings with hundreds of people, including government leaders attending to build momentum for their proposed solution. There are also scores of siloed proprietary solutions popping up to solve these data-sharing challenges. For example, <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-health-screening-digital-id-48f5ee5b-05c4-4b5e-8fda-4d2f59b946b0.html">CLEAR is offering</a> a biometric data sharing solution. In a public health crisis, these non-interoperable solutions are only good when only one of them is widely adopted, which doesn’t seem to be the&nbsp;case.</p><p>The community that formed around CCI was mostly made up of small, early-stage startups who were already implementing VCs for other use cases and decided to collaborate on exploring COVID-19 use cases. This makeup of the community means that it is not connected to global elites, governments, health departments or healthcare institutions. One exception to this is a startup that had political connections and worked with a California State Legislator to have the bill <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004">AB2004</a> proposed, which opened up a committee to study the use of VCs for COVID-19 medical test results. The bill just passed the Senate and is now waiting to be signed by the governor to become a law. However, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has repeatedly voiced its opposition <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/05/no-california-bill-verified-credentials-covid-19-test-results">[1]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/california-tell-your-senators-ill-conceived-immunity-passports-wont-help-us">[2]</a>.</p><p>CCI has struggled to “raise voice” and be “heard” by the powers that make decisions. The experience of this group raises questions:</p>  How can emerging technology be “seen” by actors (governments, public health officials, airlines, workplaces) in the marketplace looking for solutions? Which technologists are listened to by policymakers? How are these actors making decisions about the claims these technologists are&nbsp;making?  How can networks of potential issuers of COVID-19 status credentials be spun up in such a way that the credentials issued are seen as valid by verifiers (airlines, etc.)? This set of challenges around the technology are not technical as much as they are about process and accountability systems.  How can existing norms of information sharing about people that are paper-based today be translated into a digital form in ways that make themselves and those concerned about human rights implications comfortable with the technical deployment?  How can a new privacy-preserving technology based on open standards be used for public health crises or any other time-sensitive occasions when its deployment and adoption require a lot of coordination, collaboration and communication? How can these things be facilitated by funders seeking to make a difference?  <p>We hope to hear your thoughts on the raised questions.</p>

<p>As the seasons change, each week on <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/podcast-main/">State of Identity</a>, we’re watching the trends in identity transition as well, especially as COVID-19 has accelerated the importance of these solutions across business landscapes. While it’s no surprise COVID unmasked itself in each episode, each guest moved past “what’s the impact” and rather dove into “what’s next” for businesses and users in the new normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We kicked off the month welcoming Jimmy Williams, Accelitas National Sales Manager at Accelitas, for a conversation centered around alternative data pertaining to access to financial services. The ways we access financial services, lending, credit, or otherwise have changed, and how to leverage alternative data for inclusion. How is Accelitas doing it?</p>
<p>“What we’ve found to be incredibly successful is consumer behavior, both at the physical point of sale as well as the virtual point of sale…because not only is it a reflection of that consumer’s spending, potential fraud, things like that, but also it’s a proxy for things like employment or payback behavior.” Tune in to learn how this data is opening up access to financial services, especially when physical documentation isn’t as accessible, and how this can be the future of establishing trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following, Christina Luttrell, Chief Operating Officer of IDology, sat down with Cameron D’Ambrosi (virtually, of course) to not just discuss the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the customer experience across industries. The conversation begins noting how they have seen a massive spike in not only the number of fraud cases but a shift in the ways they fraudsters are executing.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You know, the creativity isn’t quite there… it’s a lot of the old same old things that we’ve seen in the past. It’s just that it’s so much more. And it’s impacting demographics that normally wouldn’t be transacting digitally.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And while fraudsters will always be around, looking for ways to cause harm, this posed a broader conversation on successful, frictionless onboarding as companies see a rapid spike in users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conversation on fraud led us to wonder, is this spike an unprecedented event, like the pandemic itself? We continued the discussion with Socure Senior Counsel &amp; Privacy Lead Annie Bai, exploring why an uptick in identity fraud usually follows economic downturns, honing in on what kind of security and experiences customers expect, and how businesses – especially the financial sector – can meet them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A critical challenge that I think we need to face as an industry is can we balance these mandates of providing high levels of assurance and high levels of customer experience, with low friction, but also respecting the needs that these digital identities have with regard to inclusion?” Annie believes yes, emphasizing the importance of partnerships, alternative data, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, we rounded out the month by welcoming Yoti Commercial Director Gareth Narinesingh and Synectics Solutions Head of Presales Chris Lewis, following the launch of Project Endeavor, a pilot program to revolutionize electronic digital onboarding, identity verification, and risk assessment for the financial services sector in the United Kingdom. While they’re making significant strides with this new venture, the guests closed out in making some future-focused predictions, spanning from the adoption of digital identity, to open banking, to the lasting impact of COVID-19.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You’ve then got a global model, which is going to change the way that we engage digitally. But I think it’s probably not in the long term future. I think it’s medium-term future. And I think that schemes like Endeavor and many others like it are going to be big pioneers moving in that direction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re keen to see the impact Endeavor has, and if their predictions come to fruition. And while each of our guests left us with great food for thought, each took a future-focused look at the potential impacts of today’s landscape and how we can create a safer, more secure, and more inclusive world.

 Zeenab Aneez &amp; Neha&nbsp;Mujumdar  Session <p>It was media theorist Marshall McLuhan who popularised the phrase ‘the medium is the message’; to him, different kinds of media engage the senses in different ways, affecting how we process it and engage with its contents. Before situating research in the digital space, it is important to ask ourselves: what is the nature of the medium are we dealing with here? How do people interact with it? What are the opportunities it provides and the risks it poses? How can we study new digital objects, such as online-first news outlets, podcasts, etc in a way that recognises the medium’s&nbsp;newness?</p><p>The proposed session is an exploration of a methodology that is informed and defined by specific characteristics of the medium, with a special focus on digital news and journalism in India. Through this, it seeks to tackle the first of the four key focus areas of the conference: How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?</p><p>Keeping this key question in mind, we ask: how can digital methods research contribute to the study of news and journalism in the digital space? How can we use digital objects such as tags, Likes, and Comments to understand how user feedback works in the new information economy? What can the interface of a news creation platform tell us about the changing roles of Indian journalists in today’s media environment? How can we formulate a methodology for studying the metamorphosis of a news story by using Twitter and what skills are required to gather and process information for research of this&nbsp;nature?</p><p>In order to inform our responses to such questions, we borrow from Richard Rogers’ adage ‘Follow the medium’ (Rogers 2013), which argues that “natively digital”(Ibid. 19) objects like tags, links, Likes or Comments, which originate in digital networks, cannot be fully understood with methods, such as, say content analysis; an example of a non-digital method that does not recognise its digital nature. The proposed session will make use of the general philosophy embodied by Rogers’ approach and urge participants to acknowledge the specific properties of the Internet as a medium and look at news and journalism as part of the larger media ecology of the web. This calls for the use of new methods that are digital in nature; the discussion on contemporary news should expand from how the news industry is coping with the digital transition, to how we can better understand the specific elements of this transition and use this understanding to reflect upon the changing nature of journalism and news&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In order to channel the discussion, the session proposes using the framework from one particular field of digital research: platform studies. With the advent of Web 2.0 and the emergence of the ‘web as platform’ (O’Reilly 2007) and the strengthening relationship between the news industry and social media platforms(‘Reuters Institute Digital News Report’ 2015), traditional as well as digital-born news sites are increasingly adopting a platform model. Therefore, platform studies makes for a fitting framework within which to understand the workings of these platforms, their technological and formal structures, and the specific ways in which they allow users to interact with news&nbsp;content.</p> Plan <p>The session will begin with a brief introduction to digital methods (Rogers 2013) and the field of ‘platform studies’ (Bogost and Montfort 2009; Gillespie 2010; Dijck 2013), which will serve as a loose framework through which to study existing news platforms as well as perform analyses on social media platforms as sites for news and journalism. This will be supplemented by the works of Anne Helmond (2015) and Tarleton Gillespie (2010).</p><p>Following this, participants will be divided into groups of four-six, with each group anchored by a volunteer, with added support from the two co-leaders. They will then be given the task of formulating a research question that makes use of one or more of the digital methods presented and are also required to frame a methodology that makes allowances for the particularities of the Indian news environment. The session will conclude with a brief discussion based on their findings.</p><p>The goal of the workshop will be to explore how digital methods can be aligned with current concerns about news and journalism in India, and open up avenues for research that acknowledges that online news occupies a space that includes natively digital objects and information architectures and hence demands research methods specific to this environment. The workshop also aims at reflecting on potential collaborations between researchers in media studies, data scientists and technologists in developing a comprehensive methodology using which to study digital media in&nbsp;India.</p> Readings <p>Gillespie, Tarleton. “The Politics of ‘Platforms’.” New Media &amp; Society 12, no. 3 (2010):&nbsp;347–364.</p><p>Rogers, Richard. “The End of the Virtual: Digital Methods,” Digital Methods.

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of ModoHR?</p>



<p>ModoHR is a Canadian technology-driven business that provides modern solutions for the human resources industry. Our web application, <a href="https://www.screeningcanada.ca/product">ScreeningCanada™</a> was developed with the goal to empower Canadian organizations to remotely conduct background screening and digital identity verification. We help set the standard for Canadian privacy, compliance and data security; these unwavering principles provide Canadian organizations with compliant products and services that mitigate risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://modohr.com/"></a> 



<p>Simply put, digital identity is the foundation of background screening. Without a candidate’s consent and identity verification, compliant and thorough background screening cannot take place. In addition, the emerging markets like on-demand delivery services and ride-sharing have further highlighted the need for speed in the background screening industry. We strongly believe that a trusted digital identity solution is critical in removing these obstacles and improving remote hiring.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does ModoHR address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity will transform the Canadian and global economy by removing geographical barriers for individual job applicants. ModoHR is pioneering new identity verification solutions in the marketplace with tools that utilize credit file-based verification, live video verification and facial accreditation. Existing background screening processes have traditionally required face-to-face interaction with the hiring manager, or an in-person verification conducted by an authorized third party like Canada Post. ModoHR’s digital identity solutions remove barriers that previously existed for remote hiring. The process is compliant with federal and provincial physical distancing recommendations and approved by police services. This transformation will empower Canadians and organizations to increase diversity and inclusion by removing traditional remote hiring barriers.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>There is no question that Canada possesses the necessary knowledge and capabilities to be a leader in digital identity. Our national approach to privacy and compliance and the value we place on protecting personal information across all industries, is highly regarded around the world. In the coming months and years, Canadian provinces will need to work together to centralize, standardize and unilaterally protect personal information, and develop methods to securely utilize this information to verify identity.</p>



<p>Our competitors in this space are already operating on the global stage; Canada must move quickly to share resources, seek federal support and ensure that our sovereign interests will not be negatively influenced by the standards set by other nations. More importantly, we need to lead this charge to develop processes and platforms that are truly Canadian.</p>



<p>5. Why did ModoHR join the DIACC?</p>



<p>ModoHR Technologies joined DIACC to share our knowledge and experience relating to the important topic of digital identity, compliance, risk mitigation and global regulatory challenges.&nbsp; We believe that together, Canadian organizations can not only improve processes for Canadians but remain at the cutting edge of policy development globally. We look forward to networking and sharing knowledge with other DIACC members.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about ModoHR?</p>



<p>ModoHR is owned by background screening and risk mitigation industry experts. Our executive team founded the pre-employment industry in Canada 20 years ago and built the largest risk mitigation firm in Canada. These subject matter experts came together to collaborate, re-imagine and empower Human Resources with technology that ensures privacy, security and streamlines processes for organizations and individuals alike. Our drive and enthusiasm is reflected in every new risk mitigation product or service that we create. In summary – we build what’s next™.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On September 22nd, the<a href="http://know.oneworldidentity.com"> KNOW Identity Digital Forum</a> took a look into the growing ways that alternative data can expand services to new customer groups as well as combat fraudulent attempts worldwide. We gathered experts in the financial services and digital identity industries to discuss inclusion and security balances in our current banking systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each session was jam-packed with unprecedented insights, but a few standout takeaways included:</p>
 
 Fraud rates have accelerated in 2020 with more and more transactions happening online as a result of COVID-19. However, regulation is still slow to catch up to or empower technologies to ward off bad actors’ tactics. 
 Openness and data sharing across governmental bodies and private institutions are going to be critical to expanding service offerings to new customer groups, such as immigrants and previously thin-file consumers. Data collected from mobile devices can also help level the playing field for previously un- or underbanked consumers.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Combating Synthetic Identity Fraud&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first session, <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/ghost-in-the-machine-combating-synthetic-identity-fraud/">Ghost in the Machine: Combating Synthetic Identity Fraud</a>, in partnership with Acuant, tackled the ever-moving target of synthetic identities. Even difficult to define, these data mashups present unique threats for companies verifying relationships between user and data attributes. In 2020, the SSA in the U.S. will be rolling out its Electronic Consent Based SSN Verification Service (eCBSV), but is this the end-all solution to stop synthetics? Jose Caldera (Chief Product Officer at Acuant), Lauren Day (Compliance and Risk Manager at Binance.US) and Chuck Christofilis (Chief Compliance Officer at CoinZoom) discuss how businesses better detect and remove synthetic identities as fraudsters adapt their strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: One solution that has come to the fore on the synthetic identity fraud front is the eCBSV that has begun to be rolled out by the Social Security Administration to allow for verification of SSN and the tying a user-submitted social to the actual issuing database. Is this a magic bullet that can end synthetic identity fraud as we know it, or do we need to continue pushing ahead in terms of identifying ways as an industry to combat synthetic fraud?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acuant: I think that thinking of any solution as a silver bullet is probably not the right way of thinking. It is the components that make that solution, they are not necessarily available to every application where identity fraud or synthetic identity fraud is present. Certainly those applications that rely on the data and the data attributes are going to benefit from it. No question about that. But then you have to deal with the consent issue. I think a lot of other practitioners may be put off by the fact that you need to get consent from your end customer to let the Social Security Administration give you permission to access that data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other countries have similar solutions, but one of the issues that they have had is that one to one relationship. It is unclear whether those databases actually maintain that relationship between the security number and the entity of the person. It is unclear whether within the database itself, there might be multiple identities associated with the same person. So that is one to end or one to one relationship has been a problem in other countries with similar solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: What are we seeing in the current fraud landscape from the bad actors? Is synthetic fraud accelerating in 2020? Does this remain as one of the favored fraud vectors?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Binance.US: As we move online, more and more, our transactions move online. Companies move online and we’re just going to see more and more of these fraudsters trying to get around certain controls. We’ve definitely seen an increase. On top of not only synthetic fraud, we’ve also seen a lot of classic scams that essentially trick people into giving away certain elements of their personal identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Data offers greater visibility into quantifying synthetic fraud, and potentially being able to strengthen the models being used to predict or identify current parts of the portfolio or applicants who are believed to be synthetic fraudsters. What are some of those techniques that we’re seeing success with? And what are some of those new types of data that we are leveraging successfully in this fight against synthetic fraud?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoinZoom: We’ve seen [success] specifically in potential elder abuse cases where someone is using the same device. That’s a data point. And it’s information that just a few years ago was unthinkable. Now we’re able to prevent a lot of what could potentially be elder abuse when we just see people trying to set up accounts with different people on the same device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Do you foresee any challenges from the device data from a regulatory standpoint that is often a strong indicator of fraud? What are you seeing in terms of the evolving landscape, in terms of what we have access to to help make these fraud decisions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acuant: Just a couple of years ago was when FinCEN allowed that the collection and the reporting of data had to do with devices and IP as part of the source. I think from the regulatory standpoint, there is now a recognition of the detailed aspects of those transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how are they used for prevention? I think, regulatory-wise, it is being accepted as those reportings have more information about the detailed components of those transactions. By FinCEN adding this data to their [reports], it seems to be a recognition that this data is relevant and it’s important–it’s reliable to do analysis on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Alternative Data Revolution 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shifting gears from fighting fraud to expanding services, OWI next welcomed Robin Weiss (Sr. Technology Advisor at Fidelity Investments), Schan Duff (VP of Strategy at Kiva), and Steve Polsky (Founder and CEO at Juvo) to the virtual stage for <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/alternative-data-revolution/">The Alternative Data Revolution: Fast Forward to Today’s Inclusive Lending Through Big Data &amp; AI</a>. Weiss moderated the discussion on how each company has utilized mobile data and other digital touch-points to build alternative credit files for the previously un- and underbanked and what we have learned through grappling with the repercussions of the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fidelity: How are you each using alternative data sources to broaden financial service access through your work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Juvo: What we are trying to do is using the ubiquity of mobile phones and cloud computing to build what we call a financial identity, to establish who is thought of as credit worthiness, but with a broader perspective that their financial identity starts with their everyday usage of their mobile phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That gives us a macro ability to impact a large portion of populations in the countries that we serve. We can then turn this around and create a feed to financial service providers. A data feed that effectively bridges the gap between financial services providers who don’t have information on a group of consumers and a group of consumers who are unable to access financial service to close this gap through a new source of data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kiva: The thesis behind all of our work is that unbanked borrowers are not riskier borrowers. They’re not inherently uncredible. They’ve just been denied the opportunity and access to the formal financial system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Q2 2020, the United States in the height of the COVID pandemic, default rates on credit cards were somewhere near 3.8 percent or 4 percent. Over our time at Kiva, our default rates across those 90 countries, including conflict zones, is about 3.6 percent. This is lending to populations who aren’t included in credit bureaus, who don’t have bank accounts and don’t have access to formal financial services. So that experience proves to us that, in the words of William Gibson, the world is awash in credit data. In financial transaction data, it’s just not evenly distributed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fidelity: Inherent in both of your models is the fact that they are dependent on government-issued foundational identities that clearly vary from geography to geography. Can these or should they be replaced by a constellation of non-foundational identities? In other words, alternative data points to arrive at a high assurance I.D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Juvo: There’s essentially three parts that need to come together to provide someone financial services. One, you need an anchor: you need the government to step up and provide a system of identities, something you can tie into. Two, we need some form of biometrics. It’s not NSA always biometrics; that person needs to prove they are who they say they are just to eliminate fraud. Then the third piece is that we need to know that the person qualifies for the particular service they might be offered. To me, stitching these three things together is the key thing to enable someone to get access to a financial service. Juvo’s focus is on the last piece: understanding qualification and giving like a whole new group of people the ability to establish qualification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kiva: Our view at Kiva is that there will always be a role for a centralized identity issuer and that in some ways is going to be the most easy way to compliantly onboard an individual into regulated financial institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FATF, the Financial Action Task Force, which is the intergovernmental body that thinks about things like MLSE, a key compliance, has issued some really interesting guidance in the last year on the use of digital identities for compliant onboarding. Yet they leave the door open for what we’re thinking about risk-based approaches to this question. They haven’t gone as far as to say official identity is not required or is not recommended for financial sector onboarding…but I do think that it’s possible technologically to prove with a high level of assurance who a person is without reliance on an official identity. I think we’re still a little ways away from having regulators fully embrace that concept but I think it’s a conversation that if we’re serious about financial inclusion, we should be having.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity &amp; Immigrant Banking 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the final session of the day, OWI was joined by Alka Gupta (Co-Founder and Board Director of GlobaliD) to discuss how growing non-citizen or new citizen populations are able to access financial services in <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/coming-to-america-immigrant-banking-in-the-u-s/">Coming to America: Immigrant Banking in the U.S</a>. The conversation identified some of the current gaps and possible solutions in providing user-friendly services to these communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GlobaliD: For context…51 percent of [U.S.] foreign-born non-citizens are either unbanked or underbanked. Of those that are banking, 80+ percent of the immigrants are with one of five financial institutions, which means about 18 percent of them are spread across 60-70 other smaller banks or credit unions, with none of them making up more than 2 percent. Why is this happening? How do we help? What does this next chapter look like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges are three-fold. Banking has historically accepted limited forms of identity. Identity more traditionally is a driver’s license and Social Security, which many immigrants may not have. So how do we open that aperture? And many have, since government-issued I.D. vary from country to country. Banks have expanded the list, whether it’s the individual taxpayer numbers, passports, consular I.D., etc.. That’s a huge area. There is also fear. There’s just a fear of even walking into the bank. So how do we provide culturally-specific guidelines? And lastly is minimizing fees or not maximizing those types of schemes. This is frankly not true just with financial services, but also with international calling and other type of infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Where do we see the solutions coming into play? What role do we see governments playing? What role do we see nongovernmental organizations playing and what role do we see private sector players playing in solving this challenge? And where do you see the most progress being made in the near-term future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GlobaliD: I think there’s been some progress whether it’s startups or neo-banks looking to address some of the issues we’ve talked about, there are immigrant banking focused startups. So there is a cottage industry around migrant banking, migrant tech, but we need to step back and talk about the larger ecosystem. I do believe that the more meaningful improvements are going to happen, not just from a technology perspective. In fact, I might argue that this is not about the technology. This is about the silos coming down. We do see the world opening up more and more, but at the same time, sometimes we see more and more walls going up, given the times that we’re in. I think that much of the advancement is going to need to come from…cooperation and openness, open access to data and silos coming down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also think it’s about there being more user control and portability of that data and that information. Users need to control their data. Institutions need to respect the portability of data. And those that don’t know how to either keep data secure or store cetera are better off in focusing on their core competencies and allowing more of these horizontal plays. Whether it’s the identity, the chat, the calling, et cetera, to be to be frankly, you know, built within a horizontal stack that can be leveraged across whether it’s financial services or others. I think we’re at a time where we would be all well-served to consider how it is that the user is experiencing the data, the frustrations, the frictions. We would be better served really thinking about is that just neat and cool? Or if I were a user, would I actually engage? Would I trust it? I really think that’s what this next chapter is about and why I am so passionate about this space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s Next? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s always more to dive into (we recommend you <a href="http://know.oneworldidentity.com">secure your seat</a> at our next digital event now,) and we’re looking forward to seeing how the industry drives further inclusion in financial services through this data.

<p>We sat down with CYNAM Director, Madeline Howard, to find out what makes this ‘woman in identity’ tick….</p>
  
 Question 1: What do you do and what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m delighted to wear a few different hats! My day job is the Socio-Technical Engagement Manager at Cygenta, where I work on the human side of cyber security. I particularly focus on awareness, behaviour and cultural change. I love my field of work as I constantly feel as though I’m making a positive difference to help people and organisations to live more secure lives.</p>
<p>Cygenta also supports me as an <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/industry-100-introduction">i100 for the National Cyber Security Center</a> and their CyberFirst Schools programme. I dedicate one day a week to this – and I absolutely LOVE this part of my job.</p>
<p>Here, I get to work with amazing international, national and local companies to inspire, excite and enthuse the next generation about computer science and cyber security. It’s so rewarding to make a difference to the futures of young people while also supporting the industry talent pipeline.</p>
<p>Finally in my spare time, I’m a Director of Cyber Cheltenham, CyNam. It is a real privilege to be a Director of the UK’s largest cyber cluster and support the development of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>So what gets me out of bed in the morning? Well I’m passionate about making a positive difference. Whether that is in improving organisations and individuals cyber security awareness, exciting the next generation about their future opportunities or developing the incredible cyber security ecosystem we have, I always want to make a positive impact.</p>
 Question 2: How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>It was not exactly a ‘traditional’ route! I studied Geography at Newcastle University and really didn’t know what I wanted to do. Well that’s a lie, I knew my dream job was to be a weather girl… still true! When I finished university, I started in a role within cyber security working in business development. In months I knew I’d found my niche! I loved the pace at which this sector moves and it’s great to be constantly learning about how we engage with technology.</p>
<p>I was keen to pursue a career, raising awareness about cyber security. At Cygenta, I am extremely lucky enough to work for – and be mentored by – Dr Jessica Barker. One thing I recognise is that I’ve always been really lucky to have lots of fantastic people to turn to for advice and guidance and support when I’ve had to make tough decisions during my career.</p>
 Question 3: What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned is to go with your gut, ALWAYS.</p>
<p>I’ve had lots of great opportunities but I nearly turned down some of these simply because I over-thought things. Sometimes things can feel like a risk but if it feels right in your gut it normally is . And, if it doesn’t work out, you’ll still have learned so much simply by learning to take a risk – it’ll all help to shape the future you.</p>
 Question 4: What’s your advice to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>STOP: Thinking that your employees are your ‘human firewall’ against cyber attacks and incidents. The human firewall suggests your employees should prevent attacks and incidents. When it comes to cyber attacks, you can’t prevent every incident, and so this is a totally unrealistic ask on individuals. It also doesn’t prepare people for what to do when something does go wrong.</p>
<p>START: Developing individuals as ‘Human Sensors’. The concept of human sensors suggests that individuals know how to detect and respond to incidents. They understand the indicators of compromise and feel empowered to approach the correct individuals or platforms to report incidents. This ultimately minimises the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) they may have when they think an incident has occurred.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: Investing in cyber security – not just the technology but talent development and people skills. Ensure your employees feel confident and empowered to positively engage with cyber security to improve your response and resilience capabilities.</p>
 Question 5: In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In all aspects of life, diversity is the enabler for growth, innovation, collaboration and positive change.</p>
 Question 6: What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://thegogiver.com/">“The Go-Giver”</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It really resonated with me. In short, it suggests we shouldn’t do things because we expect something in return but because we just want to help. It is a fantastic ethos to live by – it’ll empower you to become the best version of yourself!</p>
 Question 7: What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Care less about what people think of you.</p>
<p>It’s not ‘uncool’ to want to achieve.</p>
<p>Go with your gut and everything will work out.</p>
<p>And, finally, accept that you can’t be in control of everything.</p>
<p>I tell myself everyday ‘I wonder if the stars will align?’. If something works out, the stars have aligned. I don’t know anything about the stars but sometimes when things work out, it’s nice to visualise the stars aligning and shining for you.</p>
 Question 8: Where can we find you on social media / the Web?

<p>SAFE Identity and Kantara Initiative announced a reciprocal agreement to endorse and support each other’s Trust Frameworks for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and non-PKI domains together with their certified identity providers.</p>

<p>Since 1980, the United States has suffered more than 250 extreme weather disasters causing more than $1 billion damage each. Every time a natural catastrophe strikes, state regulators quickly ask insurance carriers to send them data about the affected properties. This data helps regulators model risk, monitor market activity, protect consumers, and plan for future emergencies.</p>



<p>These ad-hoc reports come on top of routine quarterly and annual statistics that insurance carriers must provide to regulators. But the reporting process was flawed. Insurers could barely keep up with the requests for data, in various formats and often with short deadlines, coming in from 50 different state regulators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a national, not-for-profit member association that gathers, aggregates and anonymizes data from its property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance industry members to inform legislative policy, Chicago-based American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) saw the reporting problems first hand. In fact, everyone in the industry saw the need for a more resilient and efficient resource: a system that would yield data to inform policymakers and also help carriers operate efficiently and the platform to compete and innovate in the marketplace.</p>



<p>AAIS invited carriers and regulators to brainstorm a solution they could build and deploy to address the industry’s data problem. As discussions progressed, the group raised the idea of using blockchain. And, to address the cost concerns, using open source software. By starting with an existing open source framework, AAIS wouldn’t have to code a blockchain platform from scratch. The team could get on with building the higher-level components and interfaces for their system, which they named the Open Insurance Data Link (openIDL).</p>



<p>That led to the choice of Hyperledger Fabric. After AAIS picked a blockchain platform, it needed a development partner with all the skills and resources to bring openIDL to life. The team decided to partner with IBM because of the organization’s track record with Hyperledger Fabric and their expert team. With shared philosophies that included design thinking and agile development, AAIS and IBM developed and tested a prototype in record time. With the first prototype, they were able to test five million records in less than 90 days.</p>



<p>In 2018, openIDL went into production as the first blockchain network connecting data across the American insurance industry. Insurers have the option to manage their own node or use the multi-tenant environment managed by AAIS. And, to help insurers spin up their own nodes, IBM created openIDL in a Box: a managed service offering everything an insurer needs to join the blockchain network.</p>



<p>Hyperledger worked with AAIS to document key steps in engaging stakeholders in planning openIDL and building a network that ensures data privacy for insurers and reporting for regulators. Read the full <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/openidl-case-study">case study here</a> for more on the design process, solution architecture and next steps for openIDL.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance defines standards that enable strong consumer authentication and seeks to use those standards to improve security on the internet. EMV 3-D Secure (EMV 3DS) is a payment industry standard for performing consumer verification and authentication within the context of online payments via credit cards. EMV 3DS also standardizes payment transaction information which is sent from a merchant to the issuing bank and includes data about the cardholder account, payment environment, and actions taken during payment. Using this data, the card issuing bank or a party operating on their behalf can perform transaction risk assessment and minimize the need to apply unnecessary friction to a payment transaction when it is deemed low risk. This is also known as “frictionless authentication” within the EMV 3DS standard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This document focuses on the role of the merchant as the FIDO or WebAuthn relying party and defines the methods for the merchant to leverage EMV 3DS as the conduit to report FIDO Authentication Data to the issuing bank. This data, along with the other transaction details sent using EMV 3DS messaging via the 3DS Authentication Request message, can help ensure minimized friction through risk-based authentication at the time of online payment. Although the resultant assurance level is reduced using this method, as opposed to an issuer-managed credential, and it will need to be viewed within the context of the entire EMV 3DS message, it can provide an approach that can be more easily deployed at scale than issuer-managed FIDO Authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>RESTON, Virg. and WAKEFIELD, Mass. – September 29, 2020 – <a href="https://makeidentitysafe.com/">SAFE Identity</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, two globally acknowledged Trust Framework Providers focused on expanding digital identity trust and security, announced today a reciprocal agreement to endorse and support each other’s Trust Frameworks for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and non-PKI domains together with their certified identity providers. This collaboration is significant because it will consolidate the digital identity assessment and Trust Mark process for companies in the healthcare, financial services and other sectors, helping to reduce risk for organizations who rely on SAFE and Kantara Trust Frameworks.</p>
<p>“What we have done is agree to honor each other’s Trust Marks. Industry can now assess and manage digital identity more easily across both PKI and non-PKI domains when making risk-based decisions concerning the validity of someone’s digital identity credentials and providers’ services,” said Colin Wallis, executive director, Kantara. “Kantara always looks for ways to serve more value to its members through non-financial, non-exclusive collaborations such as this, in the furtherance of its non-profit mission. Instead of duplicating efforts, SAFE and Kantara are helping to expand the reach of our respective missions”.</p>
<p>Kantara and SAFE Identity are dedicated to trusted digital identity management services and solutions, but they focus on different yet complementary assurance aspects and technologies. Kantara’s efforts are typically directed towards de jure standards conformity assessment, standardization, and non-PKI innovation that apply across multiple technologies. SAFE’s focus is expanding and standardizing the use of PKI-based credentials employed for identity, confidentiality and data integrity.</p>
<p>“When SAFE-BioPharma evolved into SAFE Identity <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/05/19/2035512/0/en/SAFE-Identity-Announces-Revamped-SAFE-Biopharma-Trust-Framework-and-New-Services-to-Expand-and-Evolve-Digital-Trust-in-Healthcare-Sector.html">earlier this year</a> we introduced new services to operationalize and certify PKI-based trust and interoperability,” said Kyle Neuman, managing director of SAFE Identity. “While that has been our top priority, non-PKI credentials have always been an important part of the SAFE-BioPharma Trust Framework and, through this collaboration, will continue to be part of the SAFE Identity Trust Framework. As part of the agreement, non-PKI credential service providers will now be assessed by Kantara’s accredited assessors and we will accept Kantara’s approvals and Trust Mark grants. It is no longer necessary for SAFE to do this work in parallel when there is a capable Trust Framework provider already supporting the non-PKI space. In return, Kantara will accept and list SAFE Identity certified PKI credential providers, thereby offering a holistic view of the identity landscape.”</p>
<p>Non-PKI credential services assessed and approved under Kantara’s Trust Framework as Full Service or Full Service (technical) have the option to additionally display a SAFE Trust Mark and be listed on the SAFE Identity website. Equivalent PKI credential issuers tested and approved by SAFE will have the option to display a Kantara Trust Mark and be listed on the Kantara website.</p>
<p>This relationship also helps to solve a key dilemma with Trust Framework Providers: picking one. Through this collaboration, SAFE Identity and Kantara together offer relying parties more choice, flexibility and simplicity in choosing identity providers they can depend on. Kantara offers service providers third party conformity assessment and assurance against its Classic and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/classes-of-approval/">NIST 800-63-3 Classes of Approval</a> under <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/">its&nbsp;Identity Assurance Trust Framework</a>, amongst others. SAFE evaluates identity providers based on many of the same standards as Kantara which include requirements from the U.S. government Federal PKI, EU regulations and additional requirements determined by SAFE’s industry-led <a href="https://makeidentitysafe.com/policy-management-authority/">Policy Management Authority</a>. Together, these organizations are creating trust, and helping to simplify the path towards more secure, authentic and interoperable digital credentials.</p>

<p>A cross-community effort to standardize on common, DID-anchored capabilities</p><p>If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented. The addresses take the form of a long, opaque “string” (a long block of letters and numbers, in this case of a fixed length), and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID “documents”</a> that get returned when they are queried contain some cryptographic key material and, depending on the particularities of the returning system, maybe a few other pieces of information or addresses.</p><p>Identity systems have traditionally been largely hierarchical, focusing on asymmetrical or vertical relationships. The most open system that allows horizontal communications between users in different systems is email, and even there, user-to-user communications are mediated by servers, which banlist each other based on a federated reputation system. DIDCommunications (DIDComm), on the other hand, is a set of tools to allow horizontal (or at least, power-neutral) and bidirectional channels of communication between two entities that know each other’s DIDs and nothing else. It resembles today’s end-to-end encryption systems like Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp more than it resembles traditional email.</p> How DIDComm&nbsp;works <p>DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that&nbsp;DID.</p><p>This architecture is powerful because it provides a way to do mutual authentication between any two parties. Right now many systems of messaging and communication on the open web don’t provide for mutual authentication with cryptography; they ask individuals to authenticate to sites or businesses (nowadays mostly with single-sign on integrations, i.e. “log in with your XXX account” buttons), and these businesses vouch for and secure the end-user. In exchange, businesses get valuable insight into the communications or commercial activity they facilitate — insights they often sell to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Furthermore, while the onus is on individuals to authenticate themselves to these enabling institutions and middlemen, the business themselves do little to authenticate themselves reciprocally. Over time, the “lock icon” next to URLs in modern browsers has come to be a useful norm (and users have been habituated to reacting suspiciously to any website which cannot provide on). However, phishing attacks, where intercepted or falsified communications lead users to malicious websites impersonating ones they trust, continue to be a major attack vector for fraud and identity theft. By supporting mutual authentication, a more uniform and democratic protocol is established for secure communications, which raises the bar for user expectations for security assurances from institutions and websites.</p> A Quick History of DIDComm and the Aries Protocols <p>DIDComm was first developed within an international and collaborative open source co-development project called <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> (hosted at <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger</a>) and under a IPR regime <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs#about">designed to cover</a> software but not specifications. Aries was spun out of the earlier Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> project, to both iterate, expand, and make more blockchain-agnostic the codebase and tooling created earlier for the identity blockchain Indy. In the same process, Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Ursa</a> was also created to advance the underlying cryptographic elements independently of the blockchain and the identity systems relying on it. The Indy project continues evolving as well, from a single blockchain to a family of <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36734079">interoperable</a> ones.</p><p>The name “DIDComm” and version 1 of its libraries and designs evolved in this context: it adapted the Indy-specific horizontal communications libraries to a more agnostic Aries context and iterated them to be more configurable for new contexts and implementations. At some point, however, it became clear that further interoperability would be best served not by writing specifications based on existing Aries implementations, but by a more “green-field”, specification-first design process with interlocutors from further afield. This work came to be co-sponsored by DIF and Hyperledger partly to engage these outside interlocutors, and partly because the IPR protections of DIF were more appropriate to a specification-first open-standards process. The charter of the DIDComm working group at DIF&nbsp;.</p>Source: CHAPI101/DIDComm101 <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">joint session</a> at&nbsp;#<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a> The Future of&nbsp;DIDComm <p>Since the chartering process began in September of 2019 at the post-IIW DIF Face to Face, the work of designing a new core for DIDComm and thinking through new features and structure has proceeded at a steady clip. The implementations and details are still being hammered out in some places, but the feature set is stable. The benefits of the new protocol will&nbsp;include:</p>  Mutual authentication  Robust, email-like threading support for relying messaging systems (including error-handling and other machine-readable messaging systems)  Support for new security and transport primitives like the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">JWM&nbsp;envelope</a>  Asynchronous by default, but with synchronous communication modes also supported  Offline support so that two agents who are not online can exchange information via bluetooth or QR&nbsp;Code  Easy to support with a web server (among many other topographies)  Many of the positive qualities of the earlier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12/">SOAP</a> protocol, include message format standards, routing, transport agnostic support, and subprotocols.  <p>This effort has the direct support and participation of many core members of the Aries community. It is within the plans of the Aries community to migrate to DIDComm V2 as it becomes ready for use and tested. In both existing DIDComms (many of which are already in production), protocols relying on a DIDComm-encrypted channel for authentication or communications functions will be moved over. The relationship between DIDComm and these relying “subprotocols” is quite similar to the relationship between HTTP and the APIs created on top of HTTP — an upgrade to the underlying security or feature set will not affect the relying applications that just need a secure&nbsp;channel.</p><p>There is <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/111">some consternation</a> about the use of the term “DIDComm Protocols” to describe the various different types of exchange or transactions that could be built on a DIDComm foundation. Regardless of whether one chooses to call them “protocols” or something else, a cross-community standard will be crucial to co-developing broadly interoperable capabilities and common libraries on the basis of secure, authenticated DIDComm channels. Some examples of what these would&nbsp;include:</p>  Secure user messaging or even chat-like instant messaging  Issuing a credential  Presenting a credential or an identity&nbsp;proof  Interactions with IOT systems or even directly with specific, authenticated devices  Payment coordination   Getting involved <p>A good place to jump in would be this video recorded by DIDComm WG Chair Sam Curren at the June DIF Face-to-face meeting:</p><p>With this background, a read through the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_DIDcomm_WG_Charter_v1.pdf">charter</a>, the mailing list <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/didcomm-wg/topics">archives</a>, the github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/DIDComm-js">repository</a>, or the Slack channel of the DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">working group</a> at DIF will make a lot more sense; as will DIDComm sessions at the new IIW and F2F meetings.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Whether, why, and how to attend the biannual conference along with&nbsp;DIF</p><p>The <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a> is an interactive “un-conference” that has convened various kinds of researchers, identity technology companies, and thinkers since 2005. It brings together a wide swath of people working towards great control of the digital representations of themselves, incorporating theoretical, market-building, research, and policy-oriented projects. This coming month, the 31st edition will be held entirely only on the Qiqochat platform, like the 30th edition before&nbsp;it.</p> The Storied History of&nbsp;IIW <p>Kaliya Young, Doc Searls and Phil Windley founded the conference in 2005. At the time, all three were active in a group known as “the Identity Gang”. They had been discussing identity technology concepts in detail on a mailing list since meeting each other at Digital Identity World in the fall of 2004; after a year of passionate discussions, there came a point where an in-person meeting felt necessary. The first meeting was in Berkeley, California, and ever since it has been hosted at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. It has moved online-only since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early&nbsp;2020.</p><p>In 2005, many in the community were blogging and writing about identity and related themes. Some had made broad and widely acclaimed pronouncements like Kim Cameron, most known in this regard for his essay, <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">The Seven Laws of Identity.</a> One early collaboration within the community was a <a href="http://wiki.idcommons.net/Lexicon">Lexicon</a> that has aged well. Many were also writing code and founding projects to realize their various visions. At the first IIW, eight different projects gave structured presentations on the first day, while the second day was devoted to a more open-ended and collaborative synthesis, facilitated by Kaliya Young using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space Technology</a>.</p><p>At that first event, several of the projects focused on using URLs as identifiers for individuals, who could authenticate against these as they moved around the early Web 2.0, commenting on different sites. Conversations at the event were formative on the OpenID protocols and the OpenID Foundation. Since then, many different protocols have been conceived and/or nested at the conference, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, <a href="http://www.simplecloud.info/">SCIM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Resource_Identifier">XRI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDI">XDI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger">Web Finger</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_(protocol)">Salmon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub">PubSubHubbub</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>The event attracts people from all over the world and continues to be the “biggest tent” for collaboration and ideation across the various user-centric identity spheres and communities, particularly for what is now called “decentralized identity” or “self-sovereign identity”. You can see the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">book of proceedings</a> from most of the IIWs for the last 15 years, refined and edited in the month after each organic and <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/engagement-guidelines/">self-organizing</a> event.</p> The Decentralized Identity Foundation at&nbsp;IIW <p>IIW has always been a neutral venue where diverse groups across the community focused on the decentralized identity, that often work in parallel between IIWs, come together to report out and understand each other’s projects. Furthermore, many attendees come from established sectors of the software industry, such as Enterprise Identity and Access Management (EIAM), Cybersecurity, or Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). This creates a healthy mix of specialists, professionals, activists, and novices, balancing the “bikeshedding” of technology specifics with societal conversations and industry-wide trends and roadmaps. The open culture of DIF and its commitment to integrations with today’s identity technologies thrive in this environment, and many key DIF collaborations have begun or successfully recruited new participants at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>Anyone who attends from any of the myriad organizations in the space can put agenda/discussion topics forward, which also makes it a very generative place for researchers, innovators, and market-watchers. Many of the DIF working groups present their latest work at the event for technical or business review, and it is a key venue for soliciting insightful feedback from related organizations and industry stakeholders. Sometimes projects in early stages of development, specification, or scoping even do requirements gathering or technical sanity-checks at the&nbsp;event.</p><p>Historically, the DIF has hosted a one-day face-to-face meeting immediately before or after the IIW conference proper to take advantage of the geographic co-location of so many key players. This time around, however, DIF is experimenting with a more spaced-out approach to allow for a period of processing of the IIW sessions to allow for a more complementary role 5 or 6 weeks after the fact. Stay tuned for more details about design or development sprints to take place bookended by the two&nbsp;events.</p> Hot Topics across #IIW30 and&nbsp;#IIW31 <p>At the last IIW, DIF working groups put forward these sessions:</p>  The internal governance group shared its new <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Code_of_Conduct_-_at_DIF">Code of Conduct </a>and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Group</a> also gave a presentation on its <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/finding-the-bell-curve-of-meaning-61a1d22b7bdd">methodology</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Glossary_Results_-_Credentials,_Wallets,_Agents_Defined._%2B_Next_Steps">results</a>  There were four different sessions presenting and gathering feedback on four different aspects <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/%22KERI_(A)_Key_Event_Receipt_Infrastructure._A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">of</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_-Part_B_Key_Event_Reciept_Infrastructure.A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">the</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">KERI&nbsp;</a><a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_Implementation:_Whats_Next_DID:UNI_Method._Ref_Imp._DIF_Project.">project</a>.  Similarly, there were multiple presentations on the BBS+ signature suite at the heart of both the Aries <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/BBS%2B_JSON-LD_ZKPs_and_Aries_%26_Indy._Your_Thoughts%3F">AnonCreds2</a> system for verifiable presentations and a novel <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD_using_BBS%2B_-_Round_2">JSON-LD-based system</a>, development of which continues to be lead by Mattr&nbsp;Global.  The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a> WG gave a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/DIDComm_WG_Progress_Update">progress report</a>, which was particularly important to many stakeholders in the Aries community not involved in the autonomous research &amp; development project. A separate session was held on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/JSON_Web_Messaging_(JWM):_What_are_they_and_why_are_they_useful_for_secure_messaging_sytems%3F">JSON Web Messaging (JWM)</a> proposal that the DIDComm WG submitted to the&nbsp;IETF.  Similarly, there was a well-attended joint progress report on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Sidetree_Protocol_/_Element_DID_and_Friends">SideTree Protocol / Element DID and Friends</a>&nbsp;, as well as an update from the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/TxAuth_and_XYZ_(and_Maybe_someday_OAuth_3)">XYZ project</a> to iterate the OAuth protocol.  A breakthrough <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">panel</a> (which was recorded — see previous link) explored the potential interaction or combination of the complementary browser-based CHAPI communications/transport protocol and the more browser-independent work of the DIDComm&nbsp;WG  Frameworks and ecosystem maps were presented by the new Trust-over-IP foundation, the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Understanding_MyData_Operators_-_white_paper_published_today">Operators</a> <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">project</a> of MyData Global; certification programs were announced and outlined by the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Intro_to_the_Me2B_Alliance_Testing_Specification">Me2B Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ID2020_Certification:_feedback_and_next_steps">ID2020</a>&nbsp;project.  For a more detailed overview of highlights, see Juan Caballero’s <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/lessons-from-the-internet-identity-workshop-2020-89a4915c4658">detailed recap</a> for the <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">company blog</a> of DIF member organization, Spherity&nbsp;GmbH  For the complete, edited notes from all sessions, see the <a href="https://github.com/windley/IIW_homepage/raw/gh-pages/assets/proceedings/IIW_30_Book_of_Proceedings.pdf">Proceedings Book</a> (sponsored by DIF member organization, Jolocom&nbsp;GmbH)   Heading into the 31st IIW, we can expect significant interest and attendance at sessions on these&nbsp;topics:   A progress report on the alignment of the browser-native Presentation Exchange DIF specification and the relevant Aries RFCs and libraries  Moving KERI from prototype to actual implementations (and integrations!), as well as Drummond Reed’s less-technical introduction entitled “KERI for Mere&nbsp;Mortals”  Cross-method interoperability and portability, within and beyond Indy networks (which are proliferating quickly in&nbsp;Europe!)  Test Suites and a process to incentivize (or even fund?) revisions of major specifications to include more explicit test&nbsp;vectors  Lessons from the mid-2020 DID-Core sprint and PING W3C Security&nbsp;Review  Updates on OIDC-DID bridging work, OAuth &amp; GNAP, and fast-moving regulatory changes in Europe and North&nbsp;America   Making your IIW&nbsp;plan <p>DIF has had great success presenting work at IIW — and increasingly, it is becoming an important aspect of our educational and outreach efforts to post recordings of these presentations on our youtube <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ?c=UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ">channel</a>. We’re hoping this tradition will build more momentum at the upcoming&nbsp;IIW!</p><p>The event is a great opportunity for those who are already very active in the community working on standards and code related to decentralized identity. It is also a great opportunity for those who are very new to get up to speed quickly via what language professors call “deep immersion.” It is very welcoming and friendly, and since each session includes experts from different fields, there are few assumptions and much level-setting. DIF leadership attends the event and encourages its membership to actively participate.</p><p>For those already planning to attend, please note that a skeletal structure is already <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/schedule/">posted</a>. The most important sessions to attend are each day’s “agenda creation” sessions; the “demo hour” sessions for live demos of new products and prototypes, and the “closing circle” readouts from each day’s events are close seconds. Cordoning off those timeslots in your calendar weeks in advance is highly recommended, as a way of keeping those timeslots free of conflicts in your home time&nbsp;zone!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-at-iiw31-f8aafe64c985">DIF at #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The financial services market has long turned to technology to address a range of back-end challenges and enhance customer-facing services. Blockchain is increasingly becoming a go-to technology for advancing many different financial systems and solutions with different Hyperledger platforms serving as the core for an array of applications now in production.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on for just a sampling #HyperledgerFinTech solutions, built using a mix of Hyperledger technologies:</p>
<p>Bakong</p>
<p>Sponsored by the National Bank of Cambodia, the country’s central bank, <a href="https://bakong.nbc.org.kh/">Bakong</a> is the first retail payments system in the world using blockchain technology. Built on Hyperledger Iroha, Bakong delivers value for customers, merchants and banks. Individuals can now transfer money and buy from merchants with a simple smartphone app. Merchants gain a fast, cashless, and secure payments system. And banks can do interbank transfers at much lower cost.</p>
<p>Bakong was developed by <a href="https://soramitsu.co.jp/">Soramitsu</a> and, after a soft launch in 2019, is now expanding with 16 financial institutions using the system and more expected to join in the near future. The project was also designed to promote financial inclusion for the country’s large number of unbanked citizens. Any citizen of the country can open a Bakong account, even if they don’t have a traditional bank account. The more than 500 merchants that accept Bakong can be viewed in a map inside the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>daura&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built atop the private<a href="https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/company/innovation/blockchain.about.internal.html#stc"> Swiss Trust Chain</a> run by Swisscom and Swiss Post and powered by Hyperledger Fabric, <a href="https://www.daura.ch/en/">daura</a> is a digital share platform for financing and investing in Swiss SMEs. With daura, the share register is easily digitized and capital increases are carried out quickly and inexpensively at the push of a button. Shares can be split into any number of small lots and the share register is always digitally maintained, complete and up-to-date. With daura, companies have also transitioned virtual Annual General Meetings as a response to COVID-19 with authorization and access are granted directly via the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ioCash</p>
<p><a href="https://io.builders/">ioBuilders</a> is a blockchain technology company focused on building regulated fintech and enterprise solutions based on distributed ledger technology to help businesses succeed in their blockchain adoption. The company offers professional services, including technical, business and regulatory, and develops its own product line. ioBuilders has been one of the first adopters and advocates of Hyperledger Besu, providing essential feedback to improve its enterprise requirements capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://io.cash/">ioCash</a>, one of ioBuilder’s core products, is a fintech platform enabling the use of regulated fiat money on blockchain networks, making it programmable with smart contracts and able to interact with other blockchain use cases. ioCash’s platform operates under an electronic money licence, providing accounts (with or without IBAN) and complex payments functionalities through API and smart contracts connectivity. ioCash is also available as a technology license for financial institutions that hold banking or electronic money licences and are aiming to add the benefits of blockchain into their payment systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memberpass</p>
<p><a href="https://www.culedger.com/">CULedger</a>, a credit union service organization (CUSO) that began when a group of credit unions came together in 2016 as a direct response to the increasing threat of fraud, set out to bring a decentralized identity solution product for credit unions to market. The result was <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a>, a permanent, portable digital identity credential for credit union members.</p>
<p>Built in partnership with <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a> and using Hyperledger Indy, Memberpass replaces vulnerable authentication processes such as common knowledge-based questions. Now credit unions are able to issue a digital credential to members, giving them a hassle-free way to control and prove their identity quickly and easily while protecting their personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verified.Me&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://verified.me/">Verified.Me</a> offers a secure and convenient way to help Canadians verify their identities.</p>
<p>Verified.Me is a service offered by <a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey Technologies Inc</a>. The Verified.Me service was developed in cooperation with seven of Canada’s major financial institutions – BMO, CIBC, Desjardins, National Bank of Canada, RBC, Scotiabank and TD. The Verified.Me network continues to evolve adding new identity providers and service providers to make your life easier.</p>
<p>Verified.Me is built on top of the IBM Blockchain Platform which is based on Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Fabric v1.2, and will be interoperable with Hyperledger Indy projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users of the Verified.Me mobile app or web browser experience are able to get a free credit score with Equifax, register with Sun Life, verify their identity when registering for Dynacare Plus, an online and mobile service that lets users manage their health remotely, and more.</p>

<p>If blockchain is really going to change the world, then why are so many of us stuck in pilot purgatory? Is it because our distributed ledgers are too disruptive to the existing incumbents? Or that they already have solutions that are good enough, at least for now, so breakthrough ideas like blockchain could wait on the back burner?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is there a large scale, urgent business problem out there that requires massive collaboration and does not have existing incumbents?</p>



<p>We believe there is one: Climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we as a society recognize that climate change is real and have the technologies to fix it, we lack a way to get all the parts of our economy — businesses, investors and banks, consumers, and regulators — to work together on it.&nbsp; Part of the problem is we have to work across traditional boundaries of industries and countries and integrate vast supply chains around the world. And we have to do it without recognized central authorities because they don’t exist at this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, blockchain, or distributed ledger technologies (DLT), may be just the right tool for this challenge: It is designed for coordinating trust and collaboration across multiple parties, with greater speed and much greater scale than ever before. With blockchain, we could record trusted Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions for every type of economic activity and transfer them across supply chains as products and services are transacted.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Climate+Action+and+Accounting+SIG+Home">Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group</a> (CA2SIG) of the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger project is an open source effort to foster a collaborative network of climate, DLT, and other emerging technology organizations (i.e., universities, NGOs, government, startups, corporations, multilateral development banks, etc.) that can create a center of gravity around the role of DLT and open source software to address challenges in the global climate action, policy and digital accounting space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope that our work could act as a shared initiative where participants can contribute value to and share explorations in the use of DLT alongside other emerging technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), big data, and machine learning to address the challenge of keeping a transparent climate accounting system towards the climate targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p>



<p>The CA2SIG is currently comprised of the following working groups:</p>



<p><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Carbon+Accounting+and+Certification+Working+Group">Carbon Accounting and Certification Working Group</a>, which is working on automating accounting and transactions of emissions:</p>



 

 



<p><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Consumer+Disclosure+Working+Group">Consumer Disclosure Working Group</a>, which is working on ways of making customers aware, in a meaningful, understandable way, of the impact they bring about on the environment while going about their daily life:</p>



 

 



<p><a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Standards+-+WG">Climate Accounting Standards and Protocols Working Group</a>, which is focused particularly on the protocols and standards that will enable consistent climate accounting&nbsp;:</p>



 

 



<p>Together, these working groups are building software for the following goals:</p>



  Implementing GHG emissions accounting using verified data and models, which could publish trusted emissions data for a wide variety of business activities.  Passing GHG emissions up to national and supra-national structures.  Making accurate GHG emissions available at the consumer level.  



<p>By making our work open source, we hope to enable more developers to build on our work and extend GHG accounting to every part of our economy around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we’re asking is for people to help us integrate our software into more activities. Climate change is happening because every little thing that is happening is contributing to it just a tiny bit. We want to be able to get data on those activities, model their emissions, and start making people aware of their impact and work together to reduce emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you’re an experienced developer, from the business side, or a private individual, we could use your help in linking real world activities to climate change and coming up with solutions together. Join us on the <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Climate+Action+and+Accounting+SIG+Home">Hyperledger Wiki</a> for more details and links to regular calls.</p>

To address this problem, healthcare leaders are actively working to put new tools into the hands of pharmacists to ensure the right drugs reach the right people.</p>



<p>Part of that effort is the <a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/publications/issue/2017/November2017/what-are-the-drug-supply-chain-security-acts-key-provisions">Drug Supply Chain Security Act</a> (DSCSA), an ongoing, decade-long effort to track and trace prescription drugs in the United States. The DSCSA is intended to enhance the FDA’s ability to help protect consumers from drugs that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The vision is to have an interoperable system in place by 2023 that will allow for drug tracing, product verification, and prompt detection and response protocols to handle all suspect medications. To get the system in place, the FDA turned to the public in 2019 and asked for new, cutting-edge approaches to improve the prescription pipeline.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ledgerdomain.com/">LedgerDomain</a>, an enterprise-grade blockchain solutions provider known for its work on developing the next generation of healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chains, was one of the companies that responded to the FDA’s request. LedgerDomain’s proposal of a blockchain-based solution in collaboration with UCLA and the pharmaceutical company Biogen was selected by the FDA as part of its pilot project program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LedgerDomain’s pilot centered on the development and live testing of <a href="https://www.bruinchain.com/">BRUINchain</a>, a blockchain-based system that meets DSCSA standards for pharmaceutical dispensers all within a shared-permission yet private ecosystem. While the pharmaceutical supply chain has numerous stakeholders, BRUINChain, which is built on Hyperledger Fabric, establishes one version of the truth for the pipeline that is immutable and invaluable.</p>



<p>The team tested BRUINchain within UCLA Health’s network of 500 pharmacists and technicians, focused on tracking the drug <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-drug-spinal-muscular-atrophy#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug,affecting%20muscle%20strength%20and%20movement.">Spinraza</a>, the first medication approved to treat children and adults with a rare and often fatal genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy. The results exceeded UCLA Health and LedgerDomain’s expectations. The BRUINchain app’s barcode scanning functionality on iPhones was 100 percent effective, and the Hyperledger Fabric-based system was able to track every dose of Spinraza at UCLA Health, down to which refrigerator each dose was stored in across the campus. Even before the pilot ended, the team was adding new functionality and products as the network of pharmacists grew more reliant on the BRUINchain system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hyperledger teamed up with LedgerDomain on a detailed case study on the BRUINchain pilot, including deployment details and results, projected cost and time saving and next steps based on the solution’s success to date.</p>

<p>Hyperledger Latinoamerica is a new regional chapter for 20 countries bound together by common language and similar culture. Spanish is the world’s third most widely spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese and Hindi, with 450 million speakers spread over three continents: North, Central and South America, Spain, and Equatorial Guinea in Africa.</p>
<p>Our goals as a chapter are to promote adoption of Hyperledger projects, engage users and developers, foster regional contributions, and provide a platform for learning, training and collaboration on blockchain and DLT ecosystems.</p>
<p>Hyperledger Latinoamerica began with eight Hyperledger Meetup communities in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Ciudad de Mexico and Mérida in Mexico, and Panamá. It is open to all meetups worldwide, as well as SIGs, WGs, and other Hyperledger communities.</p>
<p>After two months of planning guided by David Boswell, the chapter&nbsp; launched last June 17, and since then it has grown by leaps and bounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have two series of biweekly meetings, one for panel discussions of general issues and another for use case webinars, with an average monthly attendance of 800. In parallel, two main projects gather wider interest day by day: a free introductory course on Hyperledger Fabric ‘en Español,’ and the translation of Fabric documentation to Spanish.</p>
<p>The free online course “<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CP/Curso++Hyperledger+Fabric">Hyperledger Fabric ‘en Español</a>’” began August 20th and lasts 11 sessions. We have an enrollment of 565 participants, and an average attendance of 180 attendees from 28 countries. Ricardo Ruano from Business Blockchain gives this course, together with Bram Dufour and Juan Pablo Ramírez from Grupo Bancolombia. There is a free Certificate of Assistance and a 30% bonus for official certification by the Linux Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our project “Fabric ‘en Español’” is an open source collaboration to create <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/tree/release-2.2/docs/locale/es">new translations for Hyperledger Fabric documentation</a>. It is coordinated by Claudio Ceballos Paz, with the initial support of David Boswell at Hyperledger, María Teresa Nieto from Telefonica and Anthony O’Dowd from IBM Tiger Team and Enablement. In the first week, we gathered a round of six volunteers. Help us rally more!</p>

<p>Dear OpenID Foundation Members:</p>
<p>It is with a heavy heart to share this news with you. Don Thibeau, after many years of his excellent service, informed the OpenID Board of his intention to move on from his position as the Executive Director at the end of 2020 to pursue other opportunities and challenges in the identity space. This is such a loss for the Foundation, as we would never have grown to what we are without Don’s dedicated service as a colleague and friend to many of us.</p>
<p>Don has committed to the Board of Directors to provide the time needed to ensure a successful transition to new leadership in 2021. Don will continue to be instrumental through his tenure in the many liaison relationships that the Foundation has under way.</p>
<p>I have asked Vice Chairman Bjorn Hjelm to lead the Foundation’s transition to new leadership in 2021. The Executive Committee and the Board of Directors have started this work under Bjorn’s direction and will continue to communicate with membership and the community at large on our progress. If you have any questions or input into this process, please direct your inquiries to <a href="mailto:bjorn.hjelm@oidf.org">Vice Chairman Bjorn Hjelm</a>.</p>
<p>This is an important transition in the evolution of the OpenID Foundation. The Board of Directors is committed to taking the time required to successfully execute a transition plan while being transparent in our efforts, and continuing the work of the Foundation with its members and working groups. Thank you for your continued support and contributions to the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,&nbsp;</p>

 Urs Gasser on two new books — and what’s&nbsp;ahead <p>The precariousness of the early days of the pandemic turned parents into educators and scholars scrambling to make sense of the historic challenges faced by our societies and the institutions governing them.</p><p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a>, the Executive Director of the Berkman Klein Center (BKC) and Professor of Practice at Harvard Law School, has co-authored two timely books that inform both of those struggles.</p><p>Gasser co-authored <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/john-palfrey/the-connected-parent/9781541618022/?fbclid=IwAR0ulyZ9NQKm-mqVQdg6WidnjTpS6IqSswaAgAChB2W7OJOV6IVGjV035kU">The Connected Parent</a> with <a href="https://www.macfound.org/about/people/president/">John Palfrey</a>, president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which turns a decade of academic research into practical guidance for parents raising children in a “digitally connected” world. He also wrote an essay series published in German (<a href="https://www.helbing.ch/detail/ISBN-9783719044022/Pandemie-als-Verbundkrise-und-digitales-Ph%C3%A4nomen">Pandemie als Verbundkrise und digitales Phaenomen</a>) that focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law. This book is co-authored with <a href="http://drolshammer.net/work-experience/">Jens Drolshammer</a>, professor emeritus at the University of St. Gallen and former BKC faculty associate.</p><p>We spoke with Gasser about the books, threads between them, and what he is working on&nbsp;next.</p> You’re the co-author of two new books to be published within a few weeks’ time. Let’s start with “The Connected Parent”. In a nutshell, what is this book&nbsp;about? <p>“The Connected Parent”, written with my friend and long-time collaborator John Palfrey, offers advice to parents and other caregivers on how to support their children as they grow up in an increasingly digitally connected environment. The book includes very practical advice and suggestions. John and I summarized the best available research, including 15 years of <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">youth and media</a> work at the Berkman Klein Center (BKC), to help parents figure out how to think about issues like screentime, social media usage, privacy and well-being, digital activism and citizenship skills, to name just a few — and what to do about them to minimize risk and embrace opportunities.</p> Your second book focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law. Can you tell us more about&nbsp;it? <p>This book is published in German and in the form of an essay collection. It offers initial reflections on COVID-19 as a specific type of risk that Judge Posner a decade ago in a seminal <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/catastrophe-9780195306477?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">book</a> described as a “catastrophic risk” — something most recently also taken up in Tony Ord’s <a href="https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/toby-ord/the-precipice/9780316484893/">new&nbsp;book</a>.</p><p>The texts were written during the “lockdown” and in collaboration with my former teacher and previous BKC associate Jens Drolshammer. Switzerland serves as a country case study to better understand what role the law plays during such a massive crisis. We have heard and learned a lot from public health experts during the crisis. Understandably, the legal system has been less front-and-center. Yet, it turns out that law is almost everywhere and hugely relevant especially during a crisis of this magnitude. Some of the essays also explore the historic role digital technologies play in dealing with COVID-19 — I call it metaphorically the first “digital pandemic.” We talk about the intersectionality of these&nbsp;things.</p> Both of these books are timely to the ongoing pandemic, in different ways. Are there any connecting points between these two&nbsp;books? <p>We submitted “The Connected Parent” manuscript before COVID-19 arrived in the US and were only able to add small references to it as our publisher was initially skeptical about how much of a “big deal” COVID-19 would be. Well, of course, now we know better. Parents and educators are trying to figure out how digital tech can be used to support kids around the world as their education is so deeply disrupted by COVID-19. The book will not give a full answer to the current crisis, but might be still helpful in the present based on the connected parent philosophy we sketch in the book. And we believe it offers sound longer-term guidance that helps parents to engage with their kids — and be connected with the digital world they live in. The book on the pandemic reflects on some of the educational experiences in real-time, albeit from a policy and not necessarily a parental perspective. There are also other connection points between the two books. Both are written with a broader audience in mind, and both are the fruit of collaboration.</p> What motivated you and John Palfrey to write “The Connected Parent”? Isn’t it unusual for scholars to write a parents’&nbsp;guide? <p>Yes, it is! John and I have already written several books together, including our 2008 and 2016 book “<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/node/99526">Born Digital</a>,” and in some ways, the new book is its cousin. Since our last book, we’ve been asked many times for more practical guidance than we were willing to offer in our previous work. And at some point, we decided to take on this challenge and translate what we can learn from research in ways that it translates into recommendations for parents. For me, it’s been a great learning experience to write this book. As academics, we are used to making all sorts of caveats — “can’t say, more research is needed” — where the data is shaky. But as a parent, you have to make decisions, whether you have scientific evidence or not. So we’ve tried to take this seriously and be helpful even where we don’t have all the answers. We did so by being very honest about what we know and what we don’t know — and then still give advice based on what we think makes sense based on our own experiences as researchers, educators, and parents. The <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media</a> team at BKC has been very helpful to keep us honest and grounded.</p> In the introduction to the essay series on the pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law, you and Jens Drolshammer state that the book is an experiment. What do you mean by&nbsp;that? <p>It’s been an experiment in multiple ways. It’s experimental in the sense that it was written during the early moments of the pandemic, with lots of uncertainty and even unknown unknowns. The texts offer real-time observations and reflections, without a rigorous methodology, which of course means that our observations are not scientific and offered more in the spirit of early hypotheses. We looked at it like writing initial observations and questions into a personal journal and making these entries publicly available because it might be of interest to others as well. We did so based on stories, reports, news coverage, etc. we’ve collected from the first day of the pandemic based on a set of 10 criteria.</p><p>So both the format and working style is experimental, at least for me. We hope that these early and only tentative entries into what we termed our “logbook” might invite more rigorous work over the years to come. It’s also an experiment to write and publish such a book across the Atlantic during such an extraordinary time.</p> Will you publish an English translation of the&nbsp;book? <p>I don’t think so. While I enjoy the challenge of writing and publishing in two different languages, I generally don’t feel excited about translating what I’ve written in one language to the other. To me, it’s about more than translating the text: When writing in German or English, I think differently about what I am going to say and how — it’s like flipping a&nbsp;switch.</p><p>That said, a brief summary with some of the key observations, as well as a transatlantic conversation with Professor Martha Minow and John Palfrey that is included in the essay collection, is also <a href="https://medium.com/@ugasser/pandemic-as-a-composite-crisis-and-digital-phenomenon-ba45cb5e3b9b">available on&nbsp;Medium</a>.</p> Do you plan to continue writing books, and if so, what’s&nbsp;next? <p>I try to keep a balance as far as types of contributions are concerned. I’m working on a number of shorter articles right now, but have another book project lined up — this time a book on the turn to information and information law, which brings me back to the roots of my academic&nbsp;life.</p><p>On a personal level, I enjoy working on books because it forces me to learn and engage in different ways than what has become the dominant mode in today’s professional lives. I’m acutely aware that both reading and writing books are an enormous privilege, and I couldn’t be more grateful for&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/urs-gasser-on-two-new-books-and-whats-ahead-de04c663b385">Urs Gasser on two new books — and what’s ahead</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m working for HSBC and have been here since May 2016 doing a variety of roles, but recently (well since Jan 2018), I have been getting my fingers dirty in something very exciting –&nbsp; defining and creating a brand new strategic capability for the Bank called – Events Based Data Assurance – which will underpin our Digital Identity efforts.</p>
<p>Essentially, all Digital Identity is customer data that we trust. We have a lot of customer data in the Bank but we don’t record why we trust this data and so we ask the customer to prove who they are over and over again. i.e. when someone wants to open a new account, we ask them to prove their ID by showing us their passport. Someone in the Bank will look at the passport, match the photo on the passport to the person standing in front of them, and confirm that they match. However, what is recorded is the person’s name, DOB, Nationality BUT not the event of ‘passport check in branch’.</p>
<p>If we recorded ‘why we trust the data’ using a new type of data called ‘EVENTS’ i.e. the event which led to us knowing why we trust a piece of data (in the above example, Suzie, a Branch advisor in our Canary Wharf branch checked that the photo on the passport matched the person in front of them and it matched, it unlocks a huge opportunity inside the bank to ‘RE-USE’ data across markets and functions – resulting in a fantastic customer experience and reduction in costly and often duplicative processes.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I started on the Barclays Bank Graduate Programme and tended to move around every 3 years or so to new places.</p>
<p>I had a curious mind and wanted to do ‘new’ things rather than be in a BAU type role.</p>
<p>I was hungry to learn and develop and so sought opportunities every time I felt like I had learnt all I could from an organisation. I’ve tried my hand at all sorts of things from Banking, to Management Consulting, to starting up a brand new dotcom business, to digitising an insurance company, studying for an MBA, moving to the online travel industry and then back to Digital Banking and now most recently, qualifying as a Personal Performance Coach and setting up a Coaching Business as a side hustle!&nbsp; I absolutely love helping people understand what their potential is and to guide them to go and realise this!</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson I have learnt along the way is to be your authentic self, don’t try and be someone who you’re not. I know this is difficult because we all suffer from this, especially us women. We’re always comparing ourselves with the person who is always getting the promotions, the attention, the recognition etc – but by trying to be like her, you slowly start to move away from who you are at your core – your authentic self.</p>
<p>This will only result in a lot of frustration and unhappiness which can become a huge problem.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re an individual with skills, experience and a personality which is unique to you. Embrace this and become comfortable in your own skin and let people see the real you! You’ll be surprised where this can lead!</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
 
 
 
 Writing down your internal business activities in a granular way – so that others can understand why they should trust this piece of data 
 Agree on a common data model which can be used to describe events 
 Define the key trusted providers in your country (utility companies, passport office, mobile phone companies, travel companies) who are willing to start exchanging data/ events with you; get them to write down what they do to assure data in a machine readable way (using the same data model) 
 
 
 Stop:
 
 Trying to solve for the World – start small, and then scale focusing on real life use cases 
 
 
 Continue:
 
 to have dialogue with organisations, governments and customers/ citizens to keep the conversation going so that potential solutions/ way forward are relevant 
 to define key customer/ citizen/ employee pain points and look to solve for these 
 
 
 
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>We are all unique and with this uniqueness, we each bring a different viewpoint to the same problem so be tolerant, embrace this difference and experience the powerful results that follow.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>I’d highly recommend ‘Man’s search for meaning’ by Viktor Frankl because it teaches us/demonstrates the power of the mind and resilience.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the quote in the book: “he who has a WHY to live can bear with almost any HOW……and what alone remains is the last of human freedoms is the ability to choose one’s attitude in a given set of circumstances.”</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Don’t be afraid, speak your mind, be yourself and think positive thoughts. As a kid growing up in the UK, I suffered from both racial discrimination and bullying – which impacted hugely on my self -confidence. I hid in my shell and didn’t feel as valued, important or equal to my peers and therefore didn’t take the opportunities that presented themselves to me because of this.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about what people will think; ask the ‘stupid’ questions and never feel that you’re not good enough!</p>

Photo: Pixabay<p>Should tech companies follow human rights law to govern online speech? This proposal has tremendous appeal. International human rights law can offer a set of rules designed in the public interest with the broad support of a global community. This certainly appears superior to the status quo wherein a handful of CEOs set rules for the speech of billions of social media users. Unsurprisingly, scholars (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3250950">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/lawless/8504E4EC8A74E539D701A04D3EE8D8DE">here</a>) and civil society organizations (<a href="https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Regulating-speech-by-contract-WEB-v2.pdf.">here</a> and <a href="https://www.observacom.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Estandares-regulacion-grandes-plataformas-Internet.pdf.">here</a>) have expressed their support and the project has gained a lot of traction since David Kaye — then UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression — <a href="https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/38/35">promoted</a> it in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>However, adopting international human rights law might not lead to more legitimate content moderation rules. First, international human rights law is not a set of universally accepted rules. The framework favors some speech standards over other reasonable alternatives. The choice for those standards should itself be subject to a legitimate rule-making process. Second, international human rights law is in many areas highly indeterminate. It offers guidance but no precise answers to many challenging questions. In those cases, human rights law might not constrain the power of tech firms but instead only create the appearance of legitimacy. In other words, the proposal could mean business as usual with the added ‘legitimacy-aura’ of human rights&nbsp;law.</p> International Human Rights Law Is Not&nbsp;Neutral <p>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the Covenant) offers the primary international guidance for free expression standards. The Covenant puts a priority on some normative options over others in areas in which reasonable disagreement between legal systems, experts, and communities exists. Two current controversies illustrate this&nbsp;point.</p><p>In July, the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">Stop Hate for Profit</a> campaign brought together hundreds of companies. For one month, they withheld advertisement from Facebook demanding that the tech giant curb the spread of hate on the platform. Among other demands, the campaign requests the removal of groups focused on Holocaust denial. Although sensible and understandable, the request is in tension with Articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant. The Human Rights Committee, the body that authoritatively interprets this international treaty, <a href="https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/gc34.pdf">has said</a>, “Laws that penalize the expression of opinions about historical facts are incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant imposes.” Indeed, in 2019, Kaye explicitly <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25174&amp;LangID=E">used</a> the bans on Holocaust denial as an example of a law that breaches states’ international obligation to protect freedom of expression.</p><p>In other areas, human rights law sides with the campaign’s demands. Stop Hate for Profit also asks that platforms apply their rules equally to politicians and other users. Twitter and Facebook, however, see things differently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they decided not to delete President Trump’s posts violating their rules on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274323/trump-twitter-glorifying-violence-minneapolis-shooting-looting-notice-restriction">glorification of violence</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/technology/twitter-trump-tweet-warning.html">election integrity</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/08/05/trump-post-removed-facebook/">COVID misinformation</a>. They reasoned that the public interest of citizens in learning what their representatives think in these cases outweighed the harmful effects of such speech. In other instances, Facebook did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/technology/trump-facebook-coronavirus-video.html">remove</a> a video posted by Trump’s campaign for spreading COVID-19 misleading information, and both firms <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199845/twitter-tweets-brazil-venezuela-presidents-covid-19-coronavirus-jair-bolsonaro-maduro">took down</a> content that Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro had posted in violation of their&nbsp;rules.</p><p>In this contentious debate, international law falls much closer on the side of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. Kaye’s 2019 report (see para. 47) explains that even though exceptions to protect political speech could in exceptional cases be acceptable, in principle politicians and the public ought to be subject to the same rules. According to the report, harmful speech can even be more dangerous when uttered by political leaders. Therefore, there are even stronger reasons to apply speech rules to these&nbsp;figures.</p><p>The main point is that reasonable disagreement exists about how to balance these different considerations when governing politicians’ speech. And the choices that international law (or the Human Rights Committee) makes in these debates are not obvious and not universally accepted. They should themselves be subject to the control of the people. Rather than shifting decision-making power from tech companies to the UN (although certainly a step forward), it is urgent to focus on building processes that can actually involve the public in the deliberation over speech&nbsp;rules.</p> Lending Legitimacy to Unconstrained Power <p>At the same time, international human rights law leaves many speech questions unanswered. I have written about the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-international-human-rights-law-cannot-replace-content-moderation-d3fc8dd4344c">contradictions</a> between regional human rights systems that the UN framework does not solve. A more fundamental open question is how to apply the legitimacy requirement of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to content moderation.</p><p>According to Article 19, all restrictions to freedom of expression must have a legitimate end. Legitimate ends for governmental restrictions on speech are the protection of national security or of public order or of public health or morals. Evelyn Aswad <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3250950">asks</a> the right questions: Which ends would be legitimate for content moderation rules set by private companies? Could tech companies claim a business interest as a legitimate purpose? And even if they were not entitled to rely on the most explicit commercial interests such as advertisers’ preferences, could these companies claim that a specific content moderation rule helps them shape the type of community they want to&nbsp;foster?</p><p>Most supporters of the proposal would acknowledge that it is necessary to let companies disallow content for the purpose of meeting the preferences and expectations of different users. This appears sensible. Otherwise, all the speech that international human rights law protects — including adult nudity, pornography, and many graphic depictions of violence — would likely have to be allowed on platforms such as Facebook. This would render platforms nearly useless to a large set of users that does not want to navigate through all forms of legal, but perhaps undesirable, speech. But the line between permissible and impermissible ends becomes blurry, and the Covenant, designed to be applied to states, definitely does not draw such a&nbsp;line.</p><p>As long as no line exists, international human rights law poses few constraints on what companies can do. For any rule a company might wish to set, it could articulate a public interest end that the rule advances. For instance, for nudity rules, tech firms could claim they are trying to avoid all possible non-consensual distribution of intimate images. For hate speech that does not incite violence, they could posit that they are creating a “safe” environment for communities that are disproportionately the target of such speech. And the list goes on. Susan Benesch has <a href="https://www.yalejreg.com/bulletin/but-facebooks-not-a-country-how-to-interpret-human-rights-law-for-social-media-companies/">proposed</a> helpful guidance to translate the requirements of Article 19 to content moderation. But unless broad consensus can be built around the meaning of terms such as “the protection of moral,” human rights law will lend its legitimate framework and vocabulary without meaningfully constraining private regulatory power.</p> International Human Rights Law as a Framework <p>Adopting human rights law as default content moderation rules can be a project of translation, meaning: take international law standards that already exist and translate them into implementable content moderation rules. For the reasons I discussed earlier, I have little faith in that&nbsp;project.</p><p>However, another proclaimed virtue of international human rights law is that it offers a common framework and vocabulary to guide the discussion between multiple actors on how to come up with a new language, a new rulebook specifically designed for online speech. Indeed, it may still be valuable to rely on the human rights framework not to answer all questions but to agree on what questions need to be asked (does the rule have a legitimate end? is the rule necessary to meet that end? are less intrusive measures available?). Tech companies (or anyone making the rules) can contribute to public reasoning and deliberation by being transparent about the lack of unequivocal answers. They should explain, instead, why they prefer certain rules and how they think about them through the lens of the standards set forth in Article 19 of the Covenant. That type of transparent reasoning could be the start of a dialogue with other actors in a shared language.</p><p>Such an approach resembles what Larry Lessig refers to as “latent ambiguities.” Lessig tried to imagine how judges would react to novel legal questions posed by the development of technology. In some cases, translation of already existing rules would be easy: for example, extending the protection of mail to electronic communications. In other cases, however, there is no unequivocal answer, and there is a need to decide anew how to regulate. For those situations, Lessig imagined that judges could promote democratic deliberation by identifying those “ambiguous” areas, proposing possible paths forward, and explaining how their own decisions would advance constitutional values.</p><p>There is one fundamental difference between Lessig’s work on judicial adjudication and content governance. In the case of judicial decision-making, legislatures could later contest the judges’ decisions. Lawmakers can debate and vote for a different rule. In the governance of online content, although civil society may well play a role in contesting the reasoning and choices tech firms offer, no institution has the authority equivalent to that of a legislature to move the dialogue forward. In that sense, the transparent reasoning of companies can be the beginning of a conversation, but it remains unclear who can “speak”&nbsp;next.</p><p>As Jonathan Zittrain <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3458435">argues</a>, the current era of content moderation requires experimentation with processes and institutions that can reconstruct legitimacy and open opportunities for people’s participation in online governance. Looking at international human rights law, to the extent that it offers a common framework to enable conversations, might be a step in that direction. I have tried to begin exploring which positions that framework gives priority to and to emphasize the need for finding other actors that have the capacity to contest the public reasoning of tech companies. Only then will international law be able to foster an actual conversation rather than a monologue uttered by tech firms in the guise of human rights language.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/international-human-rights-law-is-not-enough-to-fix-content-moderations-legitimacy-crisis-a80e3ed9abbd">International Human Rights Law Is Not Enough to Fix Content Moderation’s Legitimacy Crisis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The fifth generation of cellular networks or 5G promises revolutionary improvements compared to the previous generation that reaches beyond merely multiplying the bandwidth and reducing latency. 5G is expected to enable a wide range of new internet-based services such as vehicular communications and Smart City infrastructure that, in addition to connectivity, require on-demand fine-grained infrastructure and resource access to operate. Hence, the allocation of the underlying resources has to be capable of supporting and adapting to sudden changes in demand for resources and be able to flexibly provide customized bundles of resources to fit the demands of the vertical industries using the 5G infrastructure.</p>



<p>Entering the 5G market, an operator may experience up to 65% increase in RAN deployment and infrastructure costs [1]. Discovering new ways to more efficiently allocate resources can, to some extent, alleviate the massive increase in the infrastructure cost. Network and infrastructure sharing is one of the solutions that could help major operators to gain considerable returns by leasing out portions of their idle resources to other service providers that o are willing to operate in the same geographical region.</p>



 A Decentralized Marketplace for Network Infrastructure Sharing 



<p>The practice of infrastructure/network sharing dates back to the previous generations of cellular networks. However, these sharing models were typically in the form of bilateral agreements and were limited to long-term sharing of passive and seldom active network resources. Such sharing models cannot support either the on-demand short term sharing requests or the larger markets where the parties involved in resource trading exceed only two operators. On the other hand, the intense competition in the telecoms industry rules out the prospect of a centralized marketplace where a trusted intermediary is in charge of the market and makes the final decision regarding the allocation of the resources and the price. Therefore, a decentralized approach is required to incentivize participation by the infrastructure providers, network operators, and over-the-top service providers.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Fabric blockchain technology can provide the foundation for the described decentralized marketplace where all the market players could participate in the resource allocation and pricing process in a transparent and trustworthy way and without relying on a third party.&nbsp;</p>



 Case Study: 5G Network Slicing 



<p>Network virtualization technology allows the division of network resources into isolated virtual slices of the network that could be then offered to other users. This creates a new business opportunity for network operators and infrastructure providers to monetize their idle resources. Therefore a new business model has been gaining attention where operators and service providers can trade network resources in a marketplace equipped with a market mechanism(e.g., auctions). The aim is to develop a marketplace that does not rely on a third-party broker to conduct the market.</p>



 Why Hyperledger? 



<p>Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source project that is built as a modular software so that every piece of it can be tailored into the needs of the developers. Besides, with Hyperledger Fabric, there are no coding language lock-ins as the platform does not force the developer to use a particular language for the smart contracts. Finally, compared to other blockchain frameworks, the supported high transaction throughput and low latency make it a right candidate for 5G use cases.</p>







 Scenario: 



<p>A number of operators and service providers are participating in a marketplace to buy/sell network slices [2]. They each offer ask/bid prices for the offered quantity of a network slice and the smart contract that has to be endorsed by every single operator decides the final allocation and price of the network slices.</p>



  The commodity: A network slice consisting of computing, RAN, and storage resources.  Member organizations: Infrastructure providers, network operators, and service providers.  Technology: Hyperledger Fabric v 1.4.1, Raft ordering service  Architecture: Five organizations each with one peer node and 10 Raft orderers.  The Smart Contract: A sealed-bid double-sided auction mechanism that allows bilateral trade of network slices.  







 Conclusions: 



<p>The research team at Connect Centre [3] have developed the smart contracts and deployed the Hyperledger Fabric network on one of the major public cloud provider’s infrastructure. The results of the performance benchmarks of the blockchain solution are reported in [2]. In addition to the 5G slicing, other resource sharing problems in 5G are expected to benefit from the blockchain technology. One other example is Virtual Network Function (VNF) marketplaces where network operators and software vendors could offer their virtualized network services such as Firewall, DNS, CDN, etc.&nbsp;</p>

 Governments and Businesses to Begin Testing Across Canada 



<p>TORONTO, September 15, 2020 – The<a href="https://diacc.ca/"> Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada</a> (“DIACC”) today announced the launch of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>TM (“PCTF”), a set of digital ID and authentication industry standards that will define how digital ID will roll out across Canada. Its launch marks the shift from the framework’s development into official operation and will begin alpha testing by public and private sector members in Canada. The alpha testing will inform the launch of DIACC’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark Assurance Program</a>&nbsp; (“Voila Verified”), set to launch next year.</p>



<p>“The pandemic has pushed digital adoption five years into the future. Without the proper infrastructure for digital ID and authentication in place, we’ve seen firsthand how Canadians have been left vulnerable and with limited access to essential services” said Eros Spodotto, Executive Vice-President, Technology Strategy and Business Transformation at <a href="https://www.telus.com/en/">TELUS</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“Trust and security are the foundations of the digital economy. The key to unlocking a true digital experience comes from having a digital ID ecosystem that extends beyond any one sector.”<br> – Franklin Garrigues, VP Digital Channels at <a href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/">TD Bank</a>, and DIACC Board Vice-Chair</p></blockquote>



<p>From open banking to e-health, digital ID is a key enabler in unlocking the next frontier of our digital economy. Banks and telcos fortunately have been able to leverage existing digital ID services to support Canadians. “Digital identity verification has helped countless Canadians receive financial aid during the pandemic,” notes Andre Boysen, Chief Identity Officer at <a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey,</a> “but it’s not enough. Now, we need to leverage that momentum, and push out a solution for digital ID in all levels of society. The PCTF is that answer.”</p>



<p>“The PCTF launch marks an important milestone in Canada’s digital transformation initiatives,” exclaims Dave Nikolejsin, Board Chair at DIACC, “Canadians have had to deal with identity theft and fraud, high anxiety in accessing services that they were in dire need of while facing social distancing measures, and attempting to go about their lives as normally as possible. Digital ID minimizes all of those pain points, and elevates the livelihoods of Canadians everywhere.” Joni Brennan, President of DIACC, adds, “Our economy has also been heavily impacted by all this, and we know digital identity has the potential to add at least 3 percent of GDP, which is <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=33&amp;pr.y=15&amp;sy=2016&amp;ey=2021&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=156&amp;s=NGDP_RPCH%2CNGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPPC%2CPCPIPCH&amp;grp=0&amp;a=">potentially almost $100 billion</a> back into our Canadian economy. This is why we’ve accelerated the launch of the PCTF. The time for digital ID is now.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The Digital ID Laboratory of Canada is a proud partner of the DIACC, with a strong community that is ready to support the launch of the PCTF and ensure that together, we can accelerate the adoption of user-centric and interoperable digital ID solutions across the country.”<br> – Pierre Roberge, General Manager of the <a href="https://digidlab.ca/">Digital ID Laboratory of Canada</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Alpha testing of the PCTF will be carried out by over 20 Canadian public and private sector <a href="https://diacc.ca/membership/">DIACC member organizations</a> during the next two quarters with the purpose of operationalizing the framework as fast as possible. Organizations that have volunteered to take part in the alpha test seek to gain strategic and operational insights to become demonstrated leaders in digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learnings taken from the alpha testing will help DIACC identify what is needed to scale up a digital identity infrastructure across Canada, and help Canada secure international digital interoperability and accreditation by working with international and third party partners such as <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/trust-services-and-eid">eIDAS</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/what-we-do/">Kantara Initiative IAF</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Digital ID Trademark You Can Trust</p>



<p>The alpha testing will also inform the launch of the DIACC <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark Assurance Program</a> (“Voila Verified”). The program is set to launch in fall 2021, and will issue a PCTF Voila Verified Trustmark to organizations who demonstrate compliance with PCTF components. Voila Verified will enable solutions and service providers to leverage the trustmark to elevate their market leadership and allow them to collaborate securely with assurance, providing their customers with the digital-first experience that they demand.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We’re pleased to work with the DIACC to help recognize the Voila Verified Program on an international scale. It is through secure global credentials that we can transform the state of digital identity, and progress the digital economy worldwide.” <br>– Colin Wallis, Executive Director of <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/">Kantara Initiative</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Multijurisdictional Collaboration: Enabling Trusted Digital Inclusion for All</p>



<p>The launch of the PCTF comes at a time when having a strong digital economy is no longer a ‘nice-to have’; rather, it is imperative for Canadians. More than 70 per cent of Canadians want to see the government and private sector collaborate on a joint identity framework in Canada. “We’ve seen the benefits and advantages of digital ID for people in British Columbia during this pandemic,”, said CJ Ritchie, Associate Deputy Minister and Government Chief Information Officer for the Province of British Columbia, “From government to healthcare, commerce, and financial services, the entire provincial economy is being impacted by COVID-19. Having a robust digital identity/trust ecosystem allows all Canadians to do more online, in a safer, more secure and confident way.”</p>



<p>The PCTF was developed collaboratively between public and private sector stakeholders, with contributions from a broad array of individuals and organizations around the world. Over 3,400 public comments were provided over four years that helped progress the framework to its launch today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The framework released today was created through an incredible collaboration involving hundreds of people who worked to contribute, comment, and lend their ideas,” noted Peter Watkins, Program Executive for the Pan-Canadian Digital ID at the Institute for Citizen-Centred Service, “we’re committed to continuing our multi-jurisdictional collaboration as we move into the next stages for this important work.”</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CMO&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights_Actions_to_Counter_Email-Based_Attacks_on_Election-Related_S508C.pdf">&nbsp;issued an advisory</a> Thursday recommending cyber attack remedies for election-related activities&nbsp; including the use of FIDO authentication to thwart phishing&nbsp; attempts and account takeover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advisory, entitled “ACTIONS TO COUNTER EMAIL-BASED ATTACKS ON ELECTION RELATED ENTITIES” noted that 78 percent of cyber-espionage incidents are enabled by phishing. CISA makes specific recommendations on protecting against cyber attacks to aid organizations involved in election-related activities.</p>



<p>Among other recommendations, FIDO Authentication was highlighted to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover for cloud email and other high-value services. Specifically, CISA cites <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> Security Keys as a tool that campaigns and organizations can, and should, use to protect themselves. The advisory also recommends that, when available, campaigns and organizations should enroll users in advanced protection services such as <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">Google Advanced Protection</a>, which leverages FIDO Security Keys as a best practice over other 2FA methodologies to protect workforces from account takeovers related to malicious attacks.</p>



<p>FIDO security keys offer protection against phishing attacks by working as a second, physical factor of authentication and only authenticating when a user is on the correct website. Thus, even if a user is tricked into supplying their password to a phishing website, the physical security key will still block attackers from accessing their account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phishing continues to be a problem and remains one of the most popular means by which cybercriminals obtain data. Embracing FIDO technology is smart politics, and smart policy for those who understand the gravity of the cyber threat. As the election draws near, we’re increasingly seeing foreign agents <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-campaign-firm-hit-by-suspected-kremlin-hacking-attack">attempting</a> to infiltrate, influence and disrupt our elections.</p>



<p>As the CISA advisory implies, phishing and other cyber attacks are a critical issue with widespread and damaging implications to U.S. national security. The CISA advisory highlights the importance of locking down email systems, which have become a preferred vector for malicious activity. The CISA recommendations are intended as a preferred method for protecting the 2020 and future political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June, NIST put out a call for comments on the next iteration of its Digital Identity Guidelines, SP 800-63-4. We welcomed the opportunity to comment; read our full comments in the <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FIDO-ALLIANCE-Response-to-NIST-800-63-3-call-for-comments.pdf">Government &amp; Public Policy area of the website</a>.</p>



<p>Up front, we note that SP 800-63-3 represented a significant improvement in NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines, taking a more modern approach to identity proofing, authentication, and federation. That said, technology and threat are both never static, and we are encouraged to see that NIST is embarking on another revision of the document.</p>



<p>In our comments, we make three recommendations for SP 800-63-4:</p>



<p>1. NIST should adjust its approach to AALs to help implementers clearly differentiate between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, a variety of authenticators based on shared secrets – including Look-Up Secrets, Out-of-Band Devices (i.e., Push), and OTP apps and tokens – are given the same weight in AAL2 as authenticators based on asymmetric public key cryptography, such as FIDO. Given how attackers have caught up with the former, it no longer makes sense to combine&nbsp; these two types of authenticators under a single designation. Doing so misleads implementers into thinking these two categories of authenticators are equivalent in strength or resiliency. In our comments, we provide NIST with several ideas for how it can adjust the AALs to provide more differentiation between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. NIST should engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements</p>



<p>When SP 800-63-3 was first published, it created a path for some FIPS 140 validated FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 – if those authenticators were deployed in concert with Token Binding to deliver Verifier Impersonation Resistance. Since that time, most major browser vendors have withdrawn support for token binding. Per discussions with NIST, we understand that this means that FIDO authenticators can no longer meet AAL3 without implementing other approaches to mitigate the loss of token binding. As NIST embarks on the next revision of SP 800-63, we urge NIST to engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements.</p>



<p>3. Provide more direct references to FIDO</p>



<p>SP 800-63B describes Requirements by Authenticator Type but is inconsistent in how it points to standards that support that type. This has created some confusion in the marketplace when implementers consult SP 800-63B and see reference to standards like OTP and PKI but do not see any specific reference to FIDO. In our comments, we offer three suggestions for how the guidance can directly reference FIDO so that implementers have a clearer understanding of where FIDO fits in and supports the requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We greatly appreciate NIST’s consideration of our comments and look forward to ongoing dialogue and collaboration as they seek to update the Digital Identity Guidance.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Celero?</p>



<p>Our vision is to be a leading provider of technology solutions to the financial industry that…</p>



  Others aspire to be  People want to work for  Clients know they can rely upon.  



<p><a href="https://www.celero.ca/about-celero/">Celero</a> is realizing this vision is by delivering a digital technology, integration and payments ecosystem to credit unions and financial institutions across Canada. This is accomplished through an innovative mindset, commitment to delivery, strong external partnerships and an unrelenting focus on reliability and security.</p>



 <a href="https://www.celero.ca/"></a> 



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>As a provider of technology solutions to credit unions, we recognize the growing expectation our clients face from their members who demand convenience, innovation and robust security in every financial experience.</p>



<p>Digital identity is the mechanism to enable our clients to secure their members’ trust as they serve them in an increasingly digital world. Beyond that, digital identity can be an enabling force for Canadians who are unbanked or underbanked. We believe in supporting the financial health of our customers’ customers and recognize that authentication of identity is a means for a more financially inclusive Canada.</p>



<p>Overall, Celero recognizes we have a critical role to play in enabling our clients to build trusted and lasting relationships with their current and future members through a trusted digital identity framework.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Celero address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>To protect consumers, organizations put safety measures in place that can also cause constraints on convenience. This has been an ongoing challenge for financial institutions, and today’s ‘on-demand’ culture has served to spotlight these issues.</p>



<p>A trusted digital identity framework for Canada will provide a backbone of security in convenient transactions – removing barriers, streamlining service delivery, and strengthening national and global economies.</p>



<p>Celero can help shape the framework with a&nbsp; credit union perspective and can seek out the potential use cases and applications that can benefit our clients and their members and contribute to the DIACC’s goals through our expertise in financial technology and cyber security.</p>



<p>For instance, the Celero Xchange™ digital integration ecosystem platform enables financial institutions to seamlessly connect their secure platforms, such as their core banking system, to fintech applications – without the complexity of managing different standards for sharing data between products and partners.</p>



<p>Authenticating and authorizing a credit union member without compromising the security while maintaining a seamless member user experience is a key component of our platform and value proposition.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada has a growing fintech industry that is constantly seeking new ways to address digital innovation challenges and better serve consumers. The industry is becoming internationally recognized, and that expertise can serve Canada well in shaping a world-class digital identity framework that sets the standard for other countries to follow.</p>



<p>5. Why did Celero Solutions join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Our goal in joining the DIACC is to participate in driving forward solutions for digital identity trust in Canada, while obtaining new insights to apply with our clients in offering their members security, flexibility and convenience in a digital first society.</p>

<p>How many times have you answered, “What’s your mother’s maiden name?” or named your first pet when setting up a new account? Today, those common knowledge-based authentication questions have become the most vulnerable forms of customer identification as financial institutions are being increasingly hit by fraudsters in the call center.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.culedger.com/">CULedger</a>, a credit union service organization (CUSO) that began when a group of credit unions came together in 2016 as a direct response to the increasing threat of fraud, took up the challenge of improving the member identity authentication process across all delivery channels. CULedger was formed specifically to bring a decentralized identity solution product for credit unions to market. Hence<a href="https://www.memberpass.com/"> MemberPass</a>—a digital identity credential held by credit union members that protects credit unions and their members from identity theft and fraud in all financial interactions, from call center authentication to lending to opening new accounts—was born.</p>



<p>CULedger worked with decentralized identity organization, Evernym, to build MemberPass (formerly called MyCUID) with Hyperledger Indy—a distributed ledger software project that is interoperable with other blockchains or can be used on its own to power the decentralization of identity. With Hyperledger Indy at its core, MemberPass serves as a permanent and portable digital identity that reduces member friction and injects more trust in digital interactions within credit unions.</p>



<p>During a pilot program with three credit unions in 2019, initial results for MemberPass were promising. Whereas authentication in the call center could take anywhere from 90 to 120 seconds—or sometimes even up to five minutes depending on the transaction—MemberPass reduced that process down to 15 seconds or less.</p>



<p>There are now thousands of MemberPass credentials in live production, with the expectation that number will grow year after year as the focus shifts to scaling and evolving the network. Credit unions recognized the advantages of MemberPass from the get-go and are looking to get more of their members using the digital identity credential. One participating credit union is working with CULedger on a strategy for issuing new MemberPass accounts inside its branch locations as part of their new member onboarding process. Other credit unions have expressed interest in implementing MemberPass in its Internet banking channel and its mobile banking channel. More use cases are being defined as more credit unions begin to understand the power of this privacy-enhancing technology.</p>



<p>Hyperledger teamed up with CULedger to capture the details behind the launch of MemberPass as well as steps that are underway to grow adoption and interoperability. Find out more in the full <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/culedger-case-study">case study</a>.</p>

 Local Ambassador, Helen Chua, gives a round-up of the latest WiD launch on August 28th 2020 
<p></p>
<p>There has been much discussion of the role of digital identity since the pandemic. Most countries have experienced lockdowns and are now looking to digitise many traditional services.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the pandemic clearly highlighted the digital divide. While much has already been done to fill the gap, there is still more to do. This was a key point made by Minister Indranee, the keynote speaker at our recent webinar.</p>
<p>She explained that the Singapore government’s enduring vision is to have a fair and just society where everyone has equal opportunity to fulfill their dreams. But, like many countries, social divisions have widened during COVID-19.</p>
<p>The launch of the WiD Singapore chapter is a timely one as it emphasizes the importance of digitalisation and digital identity. &nbsp;The Minister believes that, in order to encourage women into careers in these areas, we have to start educating young girls to the benefits and opportunities of STEM subjects.</p>
<p>Ms Rama Sridhar, EVP at Mastercard, highlighted that the establishment of WiD will further encourage women to participate as subject matter experts around various aspects of technology. It is one of WiD’s core objectives to encourage and support women into leadership roles.</p>
<blockquote><p>The establishment of WiD will further encourage women to participate in speaking as subject matter experts around various domains of technology.</p>
<p>Rama Sridhar, EVP at Mastercard</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I am very excited about the role that WiD can play in Singapore, promoting digital identity and digital inclusion. Digital identity empowers every business and individual to reach their full potential.&nbsp; This is just the beginning of our journey as the Singapore chapter and we really want to reach out to more Singaporeans to elevate, inspire and support women in their STEM careers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group</a> (eKYC &amp; IDA WG) of the OpenID Foundation welcomes the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12528-EU-digital-ID-scheme-for-online-transactions-across-Europe/F548976">proposal of the Commission to extend the scope of eIDAS trust services</a> by introducing a new trust service for identification, authentication and for the provision of attributes, credentials and attestations and allowing the provision of identification for devices (Option 2 in the EC Revision of the eIDAS Inception Impact Assessment). This will allow companies operating identity solutions to contribute to securing digital transactions across the EU.</p>
<p>The eKYC &amp; IDA WG is a dedicated working group of the OpenID Foundation (the technical standardisation body specifying OpenID Connect and accompanying extensions). The OpenID Foundation delivers specifications for interfaces that enable interoperability between implementations, and the eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group is focusing on use cases and extensions to OpenID Connect for communicating strong identity assurance. (<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/</a>).</p>
<p>Most commercial identity providers have built their solutions on OpenID Connect because of its strong support for mobile platforms, ease of integration, formally proven security, and the ability to have users explicitly consent. Billions of transactions are performed every day using OpenID Connect. A significant number of identity providers, e.g. financial institutions or telecommunications operators, are also able to assert digital identities on a level comparable to eIDAS trust level substantial or high. A significant number of relying parties and their developers are familiar with OpenID Connect as it is used for Open Banking as well as their own use cases. In order to leverage the respective digital identities for the EU Single Market, we recommend the commission to endorse OpenID Connect beside SAML (which was already endorsed under Implementing Act 2015/1501) as a technical standard for eIDAS.</p>
<p>We would also like to mention that several Identity Providers provide access to government issued identities via OpenID Connect and even eID systems use OpenID Connect, namely itsme (Belgium), BankID (Norway, Sweden, &amp; Finland), and France Connect (France). We think this is a strong evidence that OpenID Connect could facilitate the implementation of all options given in the inception impact assessment document.</p>
<p>We also know that most commercial identity providers provide a mixture of attributes maintained according to different trust frameworks and at different trust levels (just think of name vs eMail address) and even self asserted attributes for the same identity. Technical standards utilised to implement the updated eIDAS regulation should consider and support such use cases by providing a clear delineation between identity attributes verified and maintained according to different trust frameworks as well as accompanying metadata about sources, validation process, and trust level (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TorstenLodderstedt/identity-assurance-with-openid-connect">https://www.slideshare.net/TorstenLodderstedt/identity-assurance-with-openid-connect</a>).</p>
<p>The commission might also want to consider use cases where the digital identity of EU citizens is used beyond the boundaries of the EU. The eKYC working group focuses on an international standard that is relevant to many jurisdictions with representatives from Japan, Australia, UK, US, France, Czech, and Germany. In our experience, international use cases increase the requirement for dedicated representation of the aforementioned metadata in the technical standard for attribute provisioning in order to allow the relying party to process identity data in a robust fashion.</p>
<p>Since the consultation paper mentions blockchain based identity solutions, we would like to point out that technical diversity in implementations is of utmost importance for innovations. However, adoption across member states and services requires technical interoperability. That’s why there is also work under way to provide a bridge between blockchain based identity solutions and relying parties via the mature and simple integration with OpenID Connect standard.</p>
<p>As subject matter experts in digital identity, we are thrilled with the direction eIDAS is taking and are more than happy to offer our advice in the course of targeted stakeholder interviews.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2020/09/03/the-ekyc-ida-working-group-welcomes-the-proposal-of-the-european-commission-to-extend-the-scope-of-eidas-trust-services/">The eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group Welcomes the Proposal of the European Commission to Extend the Scope of eIDAS Trust Services</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>.</p>

<p>1. What’s your organization’s mission and vision?</p>



<p>Based in the United States and India, <a href="https://www.vlinder.io/">Vlinder’s</a> vision is to enable an inclusive and sustainable ecosystem, with trust as the underpinning foundation.</p>



<p>Vlinder platforms are built harnessing new-gen technologies including blockchain, IoT and artificial intelligence to foster inclusion and sustainability within the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vlinder platform offerings are focused on helping private and public enterprises working towards the seventeen <a href="http://un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy?</p>



 <a href="https://www.vlinder.io/"></a> 



<p>Globally, there are 1 billion people without proper identification,  which equates to roughly one seventh of the world’s population. This population typically includes low income and vulnerable groups including women and girls, migrants, refugees, individuals with disabilities, and indigenous populations.</p>



<p>Not having access to proper ID restricts these vulnerable populations in obtaining basic essential services such as health, education, and financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ID is a foundational element that is a direct and indirect enabler of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including:</p>



  Access to finance  Gender equality and empowerment  Access to basic health and education  Child protection  Social protection  Labour Markets  



<p>Building an inclusive sustainable ecosystem will not only better the lives of vulnerable populations, but will also help improve the global economy as more people will be contributing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. How does your organization address the needs of this transformation?</p>



<p>Vlinder has built a decentralized ID platform, Klefki, which enables citizens to:</p>



  Own their identity.  Accept credentials from issuers and store them securely in mobile wallets.  Share credentials with verifiers using consent on demand.  Disclose selective details of credentials, as opposed to sensitive data.  



<p>Enables issuers to:</p>



  Issue credentials directly to the users wallet.  View all the credentials issued.  



<p>Enables verifiers to:</p>



  Verify credentials with citizens directly.  



<p>Our platform is being piloted in various countries, and is focused on bringing trust and inclusion to the broader population, while enabling the existing system to be more efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>All countries have a role to play in accelerating progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Canada is a leader in technology and with a progressive mindset is well positioned not only to transform the ID (and peripheral) ecosystem within the country, but to bring change and transformation to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any transformation led by Canada will be seen by the world and developing economies as a reference model for adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join DIACC and what else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Vlinder joined DIACC to participate and contribute to an important initiative, which is not only transformational for the Canadian population, but to the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an enterprise software developer, I’m used to thinking about solving real world business problems.&nbsp;So, naturally, I was pretty skeptical of bitcoin and the blockchain when I first heard about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet the idea of a “distributed ledger” kept tugging at me.&nbsp;Since all the apps we’ve built, from ERP to CRM to e-commerce, revolved around a ledger of transactions, what could a global, distributed ledger allow us to build?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took me three years of off-and-on studying and a few very smart people to finally make me realize that the blockchain, or distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), is just a small step from what we’re already used to.&nbsp;But that little step could unlock a new world of possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this post, let me address some of the common skepticism I’ve encountered as part of the <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/CASIG/Climate+Action+and+Accounting+SIG+Home">Hyperledger Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group</a>.&nbsp;Then in a follow-up post, I’ll show you why I believe climate change is the killer app for the blockchain.</p>



<p>I Don’t Need a Blockchain</p>



<p>Are you sure?&nbsp;Because you’ve probably already started building a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With enterprise software, we often have to prove that the data we’re using is authentic.&nbsp;So how would you assure someone that the data you’re using has not been altered or tampered with?&nbsp; You know that the data provider might change its API or the data you get from it, so&nbsp;</p>



  Did you make a local copy of the data you got?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Did you record the date and time you got it?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Did you record a hash of the data, so it could be compared with the data you used for your application?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Did you store archival copies of the data and the hash so that you could prove that they are all correct?&nbsp;&nbsp;  Did you store multiple copies just to be sure?  



<p>If so, then you’ve built much of what goes into a blockchain or distributed ledger.&nbsp;A blockchain is really a protocol to store data across multiple nodes while assuring their consistency.&nbsp;It follows all the steps outlined above, plus a few more, to make sure that once stored, data cannot be lost or altered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So if you’ve already been building your own “distributed” data records, then you obviously need what the blockchain offers.&nbsp;It addresses many of the pain points of data integration that we deal with every day in enterprise software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advantages of an open source blockchain platform such as Hyperledger Fabric or Hyperledger Sawtooth, compared to a homegrown solution, are many: Most obviously, there is security and scalability of a developed solution.&nbsp;Then there is the support for the “unknown unknowns,” use cases you may not realize exist but would surface over time.&nbsp;Finally, there’s the chance to work with some very smart people and learn more about this emerging technology.</p>



<p>Databases Are Faster than Blockchains</p>



<p>This is certainly true, and nobody would suggest that you replace your database with a blockchain.&nbsp;The two have different but very complementary uses.</p>



<p>Databases are great for fast read and write access of data within an organization.&nbsp;Blockchains are great for making sure data is stored immutably, so that its authenticity could be proven across multiple organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another way to think about it is that databases are for building applications, while blockchains are for building collaboration.</p>



<p>There Are too Many Competing Blockchains for Me to Use Them Now</p>



<p>This probably stems from confusing blockchain with Bitcoin, just like people once confused Compuserve or AOL with the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember that blockchain is a technology, while Bitcoin is a protocol and a cryptocurrency implemented with blockchain. There will always be many different protocols, cryptocurrencies, and frameworks implemented with blockchain technologies, just like there were many different websites implemented on the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchains are Too Energy Intensive and Bad for the Environment</p>



<p>I get this from climate activists, some of whom actually got angry when I mentioned the blockchain.&nbsp; Again, this stems from confusing blockchain with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other implementations of the blockchain.</p>



<p>The early blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum used proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, which required a lot of energy-intensive “mining” of cryptographic puzzles.&nbsp;Their&nbsp; creators probably never imagined them to become as popular as they did, or that they would consume as much energy as whole countries.</p>



<p>Fortunately, we’re all moving away from proof-of-work because it is so energy intensive and simply slow.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a>, for example, is both fast and energy efficient because it does not use proof-of-work.</p>



<p>Blockchains are Too Immature Right Now</p>



<p>This may have been true five years ago but is definitely not true any more.&nbsp; There are plenty of blockchain applications — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Compound to name a few — that have billions of dollars of stored value.&nbsp;On the enterprise side, Hyperledger platforms have been used in production for a range of interesting use cases for a while now.</p>



<p>The field will continue to evolve, but, as a whole, blockchain has probably reached the level of maturity of the internet around when Amazon got started, if not further.</p>



<p>There is No Killer App for Blockchain</p>



<p>Which brings us back to the original question: What could a global, distributed ledger allow us to build?</p>



<p>I believe it would allow us to create collaboration on an unprecedented scale, across traditional national and industry boundaries and over long time horizons.&nbsp;And there’s no use case better suited, or more urgent, than climate change.&nbsp;Stay tuned.</p>

There are a growing number of interpretations and implementations of various decentralized standards. These standards are at different stages in their development lifecycles, harmonizing gradually. As a result, there are lots of data, from lots of sources, that, without a little planning, won’t play nicely with other data. It is exciting to see the enthusiasm around the standards we know and love and to watch the proliferation of verifiable and portable data. With implementation boundaries as a hindrance, data interoperability will continue to be difficult. We could lose much utility and portability of the data. Luckily, in the midst of this excitement, a great opportunity presents itself: to forge bridges between data islands and promote the cross-pollination of methodologies for generating and exchanging verifiable data. Enter: the Presentation Exchange specification.</p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims &amp; Credentials working group</a> has been hard at work on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange specification</a> for months. The effort, starting in January 2020, began to provide a solution to the question, “How should we request and exchange credentials across implementations and systems?” Though <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">a few solutions</a> <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof">have been proposed</a> <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">before</a>, none have been as inclusive in the data model and transport agnosticism, or able to attract broad adoption, as Presentation Exchange. The working group is working towards the first release — at the time of writing, we have made over 100 commits and closed 37 GitHub&nbsp;issues.</p><p>The specification prides itself on its adaptability, aiming to be “both credential format and transport envelope agnostic, meaning an implementer can use JWTs, VCs, JWT-VCs, or any other credential format, and convey them via OIDC, DIDComm, CHAPI, or any other transport envelope.” At the same time, Presentation Exchange has garnered the interest and support of many key-players throughout the ecosystem, a step crucial to fulfilling the ambitions of the specification.</p><p>You may be wondering, what’s up with the title? Isn’t interoperability much broader than sharing credentials? Yes! Absolutely. Sharing credentials is only part of interoperability. Universal wallets, secure data storage, transports, identifiers, DIDComm, and so many more pieces are paramount to thriving in an interoperable, decentralized ecosystem. At the heart of many of these interactions, we find ourselves exchanging verifiable data. By driving a standardized method for requesting and returning verifiable data, which adapts to many data models and functional use cases, we cross an important threshold in making interoperability possible. Without working software to back up the specification, it is merely an interesting idea. We need to go further — to make it an interesting reality.</p><p>Recognizing how important the Presentation Exchange spec and reference implementations could be for accelerating real interoperability and healthy competition, we, on the <a href="http://credentials.workday.com">Workday Credentials</a> team, are involved in the specification’s development and are investing significantly in one of its first demonstrable implementations. Workday has been a very active member of DIF since 2019. Our interests lie across the DIF stack, with a focus on standards compliance, affording us opportunities to interoperate with community members and standards adopters alike. Towards that end, we have <a href="https://github.com/workdaycredentials">open-sourced much of our code and specifications</a> relating to decentralized identity. For Presentation Exchange, we have <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange-implementations">recently pushed a Golang representation</a> of the object model that can be useful in building and validating presentation definitions, submissions, and verifiable presentations (as defined by the W3C standards). We are building out more Presentation Exchange logic that we plan to open source in the coming months. We intend to adopt Presentation Exchange at Workday as we gain confidence in the specification and its other implementations. We are considering different ways Presentation Exchange can be useful in interoperating with verifiable data that does not originate on our platform.</p><p>We are looking forward to seeing others contribute reference implementations in other languages and we encourage you to consider contributing to Presentation Exchange and DIF! For more information, please <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">reach out to DIF</a>, or jump in on the <a href="http://decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange:%20Specification%20that%20codifies%20an%20inter-related%20pair%20of%20data%20formats%20for%20defining%20proof%20presentations%20(Presentation%20Definition)%20and%20subsequent%20proof%20submissions%20(Presentation%20Submission)">public GitHub</a>.

 Silpa Mukherjee, Ankita Deb &amp; Rahul&nbsp;Kumar  Session <p>We propose to design the panel as a workshop with three paper presentations followed by an open discussion with the house exploring the key question of media objects‟ (in the form of film/film music/memes/gifs/trolls) changing relations with law; copyright and piracy having attained newer connotations in the age of media convergence. While we deal with the materiality of cinema in the new media moment, the session will open out debates on the mutability of media objects in a networked digital terrain ushered in by fast growing and cost-effective internet culture in urban&nbsp;India.</p><p>In terms of methodology the panel deploys media archaeology to trace the mutations that film culture has undergone in the digital age. The coexistence of the obsolete media copyright with its meme and its digitally re-mastered copy on torrent informs the research that the three papers involve. A certain engagement with the logic of informed/fan-cinephilic digital labour that unwittingly maintains and updates the algorithmic database of Web 2.0 services will run through the presentations. Along with archival research and interviews with professionals involved with online media companies and “users” who are now the “pirate/prosumer-cinephiles” of media objects, we will carry out extensive digital ethnography to map the chimera of digital territory that user traffic based internet culture in India helped&nbsp;produce.</p><p>The digital is a space of intervention: a space for the users to intervene and play with the material online. It is a constant form of participation underscoring a potential for democratic authorship. The definitive notion of authorship voices the overarching body of the state through its legal status. Thus copyright as a legal entity produces a discourse of power through this form of authorship. The contemporary medium or rather the multi-media constellation driven by internet culture in India produces an alternative discourse on authorship, complicating the notion of copyright and piracy at the same time. This charged terrain of (il)legality is also due to the nature of piracy in the digital domain, which does not exist in isolation but have now created bodies or spheres where it has been appropriated as a sub-cultural practice. The figure of the “pirate”/ the “troll”/ the “fan” and the “cinephile” now merges with the technologically enabled body of the user of new media who negotiates with the medium in multiple ways (and morphs it) and thereby touches all kinds of spaces within and outside the webspace. It has changed the physical scope of cinephilia as addressed in the paper “A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar,” where the culture of networked sharing evolves from and further complicates physical stations. It has permeated into the body of film music in the paper “Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item numbers and the web”, which interrogates the layers of user-based morphs that the text of a dance number in Bollywood undergoes in the culture of web based remixing and hacking. It changes the way protected materials like films circulate in the space designated as YouTube, marked by its ability to reproduce copyright materials without violating the law as the third paper titled “Online Streaming in the Era of Digital Cinephilia” points out; the logic of the obsolete license of old Hindi films which gains a new viral life on YouTube with its official upload vying with the multiple hacker-user uploads.</p><p>Thus the panel intends to explore the dizzying overlaps that produce this internet induced distinct zone of ambiguity that neither the law nor the state or the author can claim ownership over. The very embodiment of the material in the digital is in transition i.e. in a state of being morphedby the blurring of the identities of the multiple bodies at work at each moment. Through the three papers we intend to chart this transitional aesthetic sometimes contained and sometimes flowing out of the body of the media text onto the physical, technological and extra textual objects as well. The panel seeks to position this new world of media objects that overlap and form an uncontainable entity, seeking newer forms of negotiations with the older existing order. We seek to explore then what happens to the very essence of author(ity)ship when digital enters its&nbsp;domain.</p> Plan <p>A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar</p><p>With the changes technology has brought to contemporary life, cinephiles — for whom movies are a way of life, films and how they are experienced have undergone major changes. The classic cinephile, as the term was adopted in the 1960s has undergone a major change in the era of internet piracy. I will look at the way pirated films via torrent downloads are consumed by students in certain pockets in New Delhi especially around Mukherjee Nagar area. These students who come from the upwardly mobile Indian middle class families are engaged inpreparations of competitive exams to land a lucrative government job. Circumstances dictate that these students own a laptop to watch films but not a high speed internet connection. To fuel their cinephilic urge, they are dependent upon soft copy vendors of pirated films. These vendors are like a video library, the repository here being a laptop and a storage drive. These professional film pirates depend upon the p2p file sharing commonly referred as “torrent.” DVD and Blu Rays released by official sources are ripped at a bigger size by certain uploaderswhich are downloaded by another one who rips it to an even smaller size, fit enough to be downloaded by pirates with a slower broadband till it reaches places like Mukherjee Nagar. Using this particular case study, where the world of online film piracy merges with a third world piracy domain, I plan to interrogate the logistics of a new kind of cinephilia and try and frame this particular form of informal circuit of media production and consumption into a coherent perspective.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://kat.cr/">https://kat.cr</a>, <a href="https://yts.la/">https://yts.la/</a>, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/">https://torrentfreak.com</a>.</p><p>Relevant software: Handbrake, uTorrent / Deluge /&nbsp;Vuze.</p><p>Relevant reading: Treske, Andreas. The Inner Life of Video Spheres: Theory for the YouTube Generation. Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam, 2013</p><p>Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item Numbers and the&nbsp;Web</p><p>The coming of new digital technologies has rendered the relationship of media objects’ with law extremely malleable and volatile. It urges us to rethink certain categories we have been working with, viz. piracy and copyright. The specific focus of the paper will be on item numbers’ relationship with changing technology and the law. The proprioceptive body being the central node of enquiry here: the law that affects the body that moves on screen and the body that is moved by the screen is made flexible in the digital age with Web 2.0’s unique design that spawns hackability and remixability. Through the registers of music licensing to YouTube, circulation of content offline as MP3 downloads in cheap mass storage devices, user generated morphed content related to item numbers (in the form of memes, GIFs, trolls, posters, tumblr blogs and listicles) spawned by amateur digital culture and remixing videos of film content the paper traces the gray zone between web based music piracy and its copyright rules. It will interrogate the moment when the entertainment industry has recognized the clear shift of its spectatorship from the older media to the more digital platforms and appropriates the contingency brought in by the algorithmic anxiety of Web 2.0 and its unique relationship with law and hence censorship regulations to innovate newer means of mass circulation and bypassing censorship.</p><p>Relevant content: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok</a>.</p><p>Relevant user-traffic-oriented platforms: <a href="http://www.memegenerator.com/">http://www.memegenerator.com</a>, <a href="http://www.trolldekho.com/">http://www.trolldekho.com</a>, <a href="https://www.imgur.com/">http://www.imgur.com</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">https://www.tumblr.com/</a>.</p><p>Relevant curated online media platforms: <a href="http://scoopwhoop.com/">ScoopWhoop</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/india">Buzzfeed India</a>, <a href="http://blog.erosnow.com/">blog.erosnow.com</a>.</p><p>Online Streaming in the era of Digital Cinephilia</p><p>Digital piracy has allowed for certain democratization of film distribution and consumption through a parallel economy of piracy. The lack of control over these channels of distribution produces a blatant threat to the copyright and intellectual property rights that are quintessential to the mainstream culture of commercial film distribution. This paper will focus on the intersection of these two dichotomous cultures through the experience of watching old films via online streaming. The resurfacing of old films hosted by big corporations like Shemaroo, Venus and Ultra who began as film rights and video rights owners at one point host their old video content in a user generated space called youtube. The video content is a very specific form here. It is an obsolete entity, defined by its ambiguity with copyright that is able to make a legal transgression in order to circulate.</p><p>The circulation of the feature films in a web space that is primarily known for its clip culture also provides an interesting paradigm for the copyright material. The big corporate copyright floats in a culture of pirated experiences where the legal domain becomes a dizzying site of contradictions. Through this paper I will draw parallels between the history of these companies and their work in the field of film circulation and to the creation of a new form of cinephilia and its complicated relationship to the law. I will use a variety of archival sources, legal documents and discourses on online streaming to contextualize my argument.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt">https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies">https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour">https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour</a></p> Readings <p>None.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day1.DigitalDesires">IRC 2016: Day 1 #Digital Desires : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Silpa Mukherjee is a Delhi based research scholar.

<p>Esme Wardhaugh sat down with Andrew to talk about identity, and the digital community.</p>
 What is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Andrew Weaver
<p>I wear a number of hats – from Digital Identity Aotearoa/New Zealand, to independent consulting, helping equip organisations with payments technology through to supporting mahi aroha (literally ‘love work’) with charities and social enterprises. I love supporting people to reach their full potential, especially if it involves challenging the status quo.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>A common thread of applying knowledge of technology and systems (including human systems) to improve and add value. I’m most definitely not a fan of shiny tech for shiny tech’s sake!</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Knowledge and wisdom is everywhere around us – in nature, in history, in different perspectives and worldviews. My most effective and rewarding role is in exploring and drawing that wisdom out, rather than assuming my own narrow perspective is shared by everyone.</p>
 What’s your message to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they start, stop or continue doing – and why? 
<p>Identity is Taonga, a Māori word meaning something that is treasured and cherished. When we change our view of identity information and recognise it as something very personal and very precious we will start to treat it with a lot more dignity, care and respect. That means stopping treating identity as a means to a monetised marketing end and stopping the wholesale harvesting and sale of personal information.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>I have to quote your own motto (which I do all the time, by the way) – Identity systems built for everyone are built by everyone. #ForAllByAll</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>Technically Wrong is a great book on inclusive design.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Explore More</p>
 Where can we find you on social media / the Web? 
<p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewweavernz/">LinkedIn</a> and at <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">digitalidentity.nz</a>.</p>

 Guiding Principles 
<p>At Women in Identity, we strive for a diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplace iwhere all volunteers and members feel valued and respected, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, sexual orientation or identity, education or (dis)ability, .experiences and heritages and will ensure that all voices are valued and heard equally.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We aim to create a model for diversity and inclusion that the identity industry can adopt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide informed, authentic leadership for cultural equality, Women in Identity strives to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 See diversity, inclusion and equality as critical to the well-being of our staff and the identity communities we serve.&nbsp; 
 Acknowledge and dismantle any inequalities within our policies, systems, programs and services and continually update and report our progress.&nbsp; 
 Explore potential underlying, unquestioned assumptions that interfere with inclusiveness.&nbsp; 
 Advocate for and support board-level thinking about how systemic inequalities impact our organisation, and how best to address that in a way that is consistent with our mission. 
 Help to challenge assumptions about what it takes to be a strong leader and champion diversity of leadership at all levels of our organisation &nbsp; 
 Practise and encourage transparent communication in all interactions. 
 Lead with respect and tolerance. We expect all members to embrace this notion and to express it in organisation interactions and through everyday practices. 
 
<p>Women in Identity commits to promoting diversity and inclusion in our workplaces:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Pursue cultural competency throughout our organisation by creating substantive learning opportunities and formal, transparent policies. 
 Generate and aggregate quantitative and qualitative research related to equity<br>
to make incremental, measurable progress toward the visibility of our diversity, inclusion, and equity efforts. Once the content is curated it will be added to our website so others can access. 
 Improve our cultural leadership pipeline by creating and supporting programs and policies that foster leadership that reflects the diversity of communities that the identity industry serves.&nbsp; 
 Pool resources and expand offerings for underrepresented constituents by connecting with other identity organisations committed to diversity and inclusion efforts. 
 Develop and present sessions on diversity, inclusion, and equality to provide information and resources internally, and to members, the community, and the identity industry.&nbsp; 
 Develop a system for being more intentional and conscious of bias during the hiring, promoting, or evaluating process.&nbsp; 
 Include a salary range with all public job descriptions.&nbsp; 
 Advocate for public and private-sector policy that promotes diversity, inclusion, and equity. Challenge systems and policies that create inequity, oppression and disparity. 
 
 Our 2020 Goals 
 
 Opening a US entity 
 Restructuring Board of Directors 
 Renewed focus on supporting non-western markets&nbsp;
 
 Ambassador in India 
 Seeking out multiple ambassadors for Africa 
 
 
 External Diversity Review 
 Kick off our inaugural research project which focuses on the impact of diversity and exclusion in the identity industry. The outputs of this project will include a code of conduct and implementation framework that will give identity organisations a practical and pragmatic guide to adopting a more diverse and inclusive approach to product development

<p>In the digital space, people need new solutions to know the identity of who they are dealing with and whether or not they can trust them. A number of initiatives are working on the future of digital identity. Some of them are government-led while others are linked to specific private institutions or proprietary technologies.</p>
<p>Banks and insurers are in a unique position to offer trust verification services built on their long track record of protecting personal information and providing banking privacy. They also have much at stake in how digital identity develops. The future of the customer relationship could be significantly altered in some scenarios, while in others they can build on traditional strengths, leverage their capabilities and monetize services they provide to the data economy. Recent developments have heightened the implications as COVID-19 accelerated digitalization and placed greater emphasis on Digital Identity as a critical underlying building block of the economy. At the same time, large tech firms are rapidly enhancing their capabilities as hubs of health data (in addition to the other areas they dominate).</p>
<p>The Institute of International Finance is collaborating with the OpenID Foundation, member firms, officials and various other entities to support the Open Digital Trust initiative, an interoperable and open source development with the objectives of introducing foundational trust into the global digital economy. It aims to create a vibrant marketplace for Digital Trust services which help individuals and entities to confirm identity and understand and manage risk. Specific workstreams have been mobilized (each with their respective working groups), with the IIF leading on policy development &amp; OpenID leading on technical standards.</p>
 
 Technical protocols: This group is developing updated standards by 2021. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.openid.net">openid.net</a> or contact Don Thibeau, Executive Director at <a href="mailto:don@oidf.org">don@oidf.org</a> 
 Policy initiative: will develop policy recommendations, requirements, and guidance for both public and private stakeholders in support the project’s wider objectives. Publishing target Q4’2020. 
 
<p>The Open Digital Trust Policy Initiative will build on guiding principles with focus groups developing the specific details in the following areas:</p>
 
 Individual centricity / purpose: Balance protecting individual rights (control, privacy) with a perspective among all stakeholder interests (individual, societal, corporate). Look across jurisdiction and regional approaches, such as the EU and ASEAN, to balance individual privacy with broader societal interests. 
 Liability / legal frame: Create a market-based mechanism for addressing liability and legal frameworks of reference. 
 Interoperability: Explore frameworks across geographies and develop “concordance mapping” across platforms to demonstrate interoperability and common values across different sectors, countries, and models such as self-sovereignty. 
 Role of governments / public sector / academia 
 
<p>Participation in each of these working groups and their deliberations are open to all, without any cost or obligation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2020/08/27/open-digital-trust-initiative-a-proposal-for-financial-institutions-to-use-an-open-standards-protocol-to-verify-identity-protect-privacy-and-build-trust/">Open Digital Trust Initiative: A Proposal for Financial Institutions to Use an Open Standards Protocol to Verify Identity, Protect Privacy and Build Trust</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>.</p>

   Hi all, this is a slide deck that I discussed on the B’s Working Group call today; just sharing with the rest of the group in case of interest.     It’s a few years old and relates to the ‘Omie’ project that we were tinkering with at Customer Commons a few years back; we stopped that work when the OS project we were experimenting with closed down/ was no longer an option.

<p>Just before the age of COVID began in earnest, The New York Times ran a feature on “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/education/learning/education-technology.html">How Technology Is Changing the Future of Higher Education</a>.” The rise of remote learning and other pandemic-related changes and challenges have added to the need and opportunity for technology-driven advances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Hyperledger community is doing its part to help the higher education market adapt to an increasingly digital world. Below we look at five Hyperledger-powered solutions that are at work now in the education market. They are helping colleges and universities modernize how they tackle a number of core tasks, including issuing and verifying academic credits, automating on-campus payments and managing students’ identity and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on for more about these #HyperledgerEdu solutions, built using a mix of Hyperledger technologies:</p>



<p>Byacco, an on-campus payment system</p>



<p>Soramitsu has officially released <a href="https://soramitsu.co.jp/byacco">Byacco</a>, a payment system based on Hyperledger Iroha, for the University of Aizu, Japan. Byacco is a system that allows students and staff of the University of Aizu to use an application on their phones to pay for goods in the cafeteria and university store and to transfer funds within the campus. To make a transaction, all they need is to scan or to provide a QR code, depending on the operation. Byacco’s technology also has high standards for transfers: it follows the EMV® QR Code specification and has bank application level financial security protocols. The keys that are used to authorise transactions on the blockchain are stored only on the device, in a secure storage, so that no one except the owner can access the funds. Students of the university can join the development of the system, thus acquiring skills in creating financial systems based on Hyperledger technologies.</p>



<p>DoDream, a “Study Abroad Platform”</p>



<p><a href="http://www.dainleaders.com/view/en.php">Dain Leaders</a> is an education solution provider for universities in Korea. It serves more than 45 Korean universities by providing services for students’ career path development. As part of that effort, Dain Leader is introducing its “Study Abroad Platform,” called DoDream, to support the extended education ecosystem of the universities, accreditation and related agencies, and prospective employers. Based on Oracle Blockchain Platform Cloud Service (which is powered by Hyperledger Fabric), the platform is an O2O service that provides foreign students with information on studying in Korea and a matching service with Korean universities.</p>



<p>Oracle Digital Certificates Solution</p>



<p>In the face of fast-changing demographic and economic drivers and student expectations, the current processes for issuing and verifying student certificates are too inefficient and time consuming. They can also lead to fraudulent or counterfeit certifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Oracle Digital Certificates Solution, built on the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/blockchain">Oracle Blockchain Platform</a> (based on Hyperledger Fabric), provides a complete, end-to-end solution for educational institutions to issue verifiable tamper-proof and secure credential certification that improves the student experience after graduation and improves operational efficiency. The solution enables institutions to issue digital certificates along with transcripts and provide self-sovereign capability to the students who can share them securely with third parties through an access token.</p>



<p>This solution has been successfully deployed in production by customers like China Distance Education Holdings Limited (CDEL) and Taibah Valley University. CDEL uses Oracle Blockchain to share educational records and professional certifications across many educational institutions to help employers and recruiters verify the educational credentials claimed by individuals.<a href="https://www.theblockchaindomain.info/topics/apps-and-use-cases/articles/441270-oracle-adds-functionality-blockcha-platform-drive-development.htm">&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Many other institutions like national universities, employment agencies, government organizations, professional skills academies and universities that provide student grants/scholarships are using this solution as part of ongoing or planned pilots.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>PwC Smart Credentials</p>



<p>Data is the new gravity in the world today and organisations are gravitating to and concentrating around trust as the ultimate currency in this data driven world. This trust is crucial for people to exchange information, especially in this digital age when trust is often violated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that premise, PwC developed <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/blockchain/smart-credentials.html">Smart Credentials</a>, a credential issuance, sharing, reviewing and revocation platform levegering the inherent core benefits of blockchain technology such as immutability, tamper-proof nature, transparency, authenticity and security.</p>



<p>Built using Hyperleder Indy and Hyperledger Aries to support the verification process, Smart Credentials has two key pillars: Authentication (you are who you say you are) and Authorization (genuine claim). Both are crucial ingredients of building trust in any ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smart Credentials recently won a “Bronze” medal for the Best Global Blockchain Innovation 2019 at the Reimagine Innovation awards (Backed by Wharton and QS) and is a finalist in the DataIQ 2020 awards “Best data product/ service” of the year category.</p>



<p>Verified.Me</p>



<p>As higher education moves deeper into online and remote learning for traditional and non-traditional students, colleges and universities are now offering a broader array of services that extend the campus experience to the digital realm. Beyond the advent of digital programming, educational institutions are also privy to sensitive personal student, faculty and alumni data from income and payment information to disciplinary records, healthcare and insurance information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SecureKey Technologies’ <a href="https://verified.me/education/">Verified.Me service</a> is one approach that supports education’s new digital and data privacy demands. This new digital identity verification service can help verify students, alumni and faculty in a timely and secure manner, strengthening educational institutions’ ability to expand their digital offerings with confidence – while also providing much-needed cost savings. Verified.Me is built using the IBM Blockchain Platform, which is based on Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Fabric.</p>

  Looks great, but in my personal opinion it currently focuses too much on the defence/ stop bad stuff happening, and not enough on the offence (empower people and make good things happen). The end game is that when people are empowered, that negates the need for the bad stuff in the first place.    It would be good to bring in the ‘we need to talk about our relationship’ theme from the case statemen

The end game is that when people are empowered, that negates the need for the bad stuff in the first place. <br>  It would be good to bring in the ‘we need to talk about our relationship’ theme from the case statement document; that covered both the empowerment and and the prevention?  <br>  Thanks  <br>  Iain<br> <br>

<p>In the latest KNOW Identity Digital Forum event, we tackled how digital identity is aiding in safely reopening the global economy. From solutions focused on robust contact tracing in healthcare to ensuring remote learning can successfully be implemented with privacy built-in, digital identity is taking on unique challenges in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Highlights from these conversations were abundant but some important takeaways included: 
 
 Impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic are being felt globally and cross-industry. Digital transformation is happening at an ever-quickening rate and identity has been proven to be the underpinning to many solutions 
 Implementing contact tracing has been trialed in several geographies, but low trust and therefore adoption among consumers is rendering less useful products. Lack of medical understanding of re-infection rates is also delaying immunity credentials from gaining traction. Motivating users to enroll ‘for the greater good’ is the biggest challenge seen thus far. 
 Remote education challenges have overlapping needs with other authentication use cases, except there are incentives for the student user to commit fraud themselves. Biometrics and liveness detection technologies can combat much of these exam proctoring hurdles. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the absence of a vaccine or other treatments, monitoring and mitigating exposure to the virus is paramount for containing its spread. But how can governments and health agencies conduct this sort of surveillance without sacrificing the privacy of its citizens? In the first session, <a href="https://know.oneworldidentity.com/contact-tracing-identitys-role-in-re-opening-the-economy/">Contact Tracing &amp; Identity’s Role in Reopening the Economy</a>, we spoke with Robin Tombs, CEO at Yoti, and Nathan Rowe, Chief Product Officer at Evident ID, on how their respective solutions are tackling the challenge of contact tracing globally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: As we know, COVID is still raging across the globe. How might we begin safely bringing folks back to work, back to school…make physical spaces accessible again? What are some of the challenges are you encountering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evident ID: Health information is of the utmost sensitivity and there’s this opportunity to help our customers and help a new customer base manage and control the risk associated with COVID infections, impact to the workplace, impact to families, and do it in a way that actually helps them achieve regulatory compliance and privacy of the information. Given what we know about the fleeting nature of COVID immunity today, it’s likely that assigning immunity credentials to individuals is still a very long way off. A few states in the U.S. have released privacy-focused COVID solutions for tracking purposes, but they all have very limited adoption. Canada, which has traditionally been a pioneer in privacy regulation, has developed a privacy-focused app called COVID Alert that can let people know of possible exposures before any symptoms appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yoti: People and not trusting that the advice they may get from the contact tracing is actually reliable. They’re not keen to quarantine in the U.K. for 14 days when there’s probably only a 30 percent chance that they may actually have COVID. So, a lot of people haven’t downloaded the app in the U.K. and of course, if not many people download the app, you get into a bad cycle where the app contacts you do a particularly good job, but not very many people use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evident ID: These systems are going to feel like a burden to the end-user. There has to be a good bit of messaging and communication to the population to ensure they feel motivated to adopt the technology. It has to be clear that [they] are doing this for the greater good and the safety of those around them. Similarly to the argument of why you wear a mask. The mask is not to protect you, it’s to protect others. And, you know, if people can have the right mindset, it’s just going to make that easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yoti: The biggest need for tracing is to protect people and therefore the industries most likely to really need it are those with the highest rates of interaction and closest proximity range. If you’re an individual interacting with many different people through the day, then not only do you have a greater risk of infection personally, but you carry the same risk of spreading the virus to others. Retail, travel and transport, health care, deliveries, large business hubs and sites are obvious – but the virus will jump to anyone given the chance and anywhere so we can’t apply solutions like tracing to one part of society while ignoring others. The approach needs to be joined up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Looking to the future, you know, in many ways we have seen COVID as driving organizations that had been lagging behind the curve in terms of thinking about digital identity. Do we think that this could serve as a catalyst for greater both enterprise and consumer adoption of digital identity platforms? Or do we think that folks are going to fall back on old habits and methods once we no longer need to be locked down?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yoti: It will be a dramatic change. The U.K. has already changed quite a few regulations where I think otherwise they would have taken another several years to do so. People are very cautious and conservative. But in the last six months, regulators have already made some very significant changes. There’s much more adoption of e signing for all sorts of things. Now, it’s possible that they will go back, but I think a huge number of regulators are now being given the chance to test out things that normally they would take a long time to take a risk on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evident ID: Regulation and law are always slow to adopt technology, some of it is they’re not as plugged in there. They’re more risk-averse. They don’t want to have this thing change too fast. They don’t have the option right now. The acceleration of telemedicine has been a great example. I mean, that wasn’t just regulators: insurers would not pay for telemedicine. In the same way, they now have to. I think what you’ll see is clearly the regulation has turned upside down on its head, but also this massive change in both the consumer and the employee expectation of what can be done and what is possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shifting gears from public health to education, OWI was joined by Blake Hall, CEO of id.me, and Reinhard Hochrieser, VP of Product Management at Jumio, to cover <a href="https://know.oneworldidentity.com/schools-out-fool-proofing-remote-education/">School’s Out: Fool Proofing Remote Education</a>. As communities remain closed due to the pandemic, academic institutions are grappling with the tough reality of transitioning in-person classrooms online. In a remote learning environment, how do you verify the identity of each student completing their coursework and online exams? Education is only one of the many industries where remote proofing is suddenly an immediate imperative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: Education is in uncharted territory with remote learning, unlike businesses where work-from-home and remote access have largely been adopted and onboarded by the workforce. What are you seeing are these challenges that schools are coming to you with and where do you see the biggest points of friction and discomfort right now in terms of transitioning from an offline to an online educational space?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jumio: I think everyone remembers how we received an education. We sat in a classroom and the teachers just spread information. I think that’s what’s changing, and not just because of COVID. Of course, that’s accelerating the change. But we’ve seen that change over the last one to two years, that more universities and online education platforms are reaching out to us not just to implement a way to do identity verification, but to get guidance about how to do it because there are so many different ways. Online education doesn’t just mean that you offer material online. You need to think about how you onboard the classmates or the attendees. How do you share grades? How do you offer exams? Do you want to combine it with existing proctoring services?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Id.me: Education really crosses verticals. We’ve seen a number of DMVs that need to give people driver’s license exams and to do that remotely now that the field offices are closed. There’s a variety of different ways to have a workflow that’s secure. But there are some unique elements to education in that most identity verification. Typically you’re focused on preventing third-party fraud, somebody else trying to take over your identity. In education, it’s often the opposite, where the test taker has an incentive to let a smarter friend or associate or somebody they’ve paid take the test for them. You really have to make sure that that person is who they’re claiming to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OWI: There are unique challenges to the educational market: the fact that there may be children involved or those under 18 that can’t be expected to have a driver’s license or other I.D. and then to try to be as inclusive as possible from a technology perspective. Equity and education, obviously a major goal for just about everyone. How can we make sure that we are not excluding pupils who maybe don’t have the latest smartphone, who don’t have the latest webcam, who don’t have a super high-powered computer? What are those barriers and how are you seeking to drive inclusive and address the challenges of making sure that these solutions can accommodate as many people as possible, regardless of their income and technological or government-issued credential levels?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jumio: We’re addressing that particular problem over the last couple of years by providing a real omnichannel solution, which means regardless if a student is using the latest and greatest iPhone or Android device or a computer with a weaker webcam, we can support all those different use cases to really ensure that each and everyone can benefit from our services. It doesn’t matter if the enrollment happens on the phone or on the computer without technology. This supports the growing demand for flexibility in regard to online education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Id.me: There’s still a wide variety of folks who are using knowledge-based authentication, based on credit history to try to verify folks and that that modality is completely outdated, especially when it comes to inclusion and security. The move in the market has been toward using possession-based modalities like your device with corroboration against the telecom possession of a government I.D. From an inclusion standpoint, we lead with that device verification. Phone ownership is way, way higher than credit records, so it’s a more inclusive modality. It’s also way more secure because your phone is talking to your telecom that we’re talking to a cell phone tower every eight seconds. If you think about that versus like the credit or data broker-based methods, it’s way more inclusive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 There’s always more hot topics to dive into, and we’re now looking forward to seeing how the industry drives reopening forward through identity technologies.

<p>Besides generic session authentication, there is an increasing need to gather explicit user consent for a specific action, i.e. “Transaction Confirmation”. Transaction Confirmation allows a relying party to not only determine if a user is involved in a transaction, but also confirm that the transaction is what the user actually intended – for example, whether they intended to pay $1000 to company X for purchasing product Y, or whether they consent to have specific data shared with another party, such as test results with a doctor.</p>



<p>This paper provides an overview on Transaction Confirmation and the drivers for its support including: regulatory requirements (PSD2, eIDAS); addressing friendly and mobile fraud; and to enable online binding agreements. It explains current approaches for Transaction Confirmation, including through FIDO protocols for native applications, and the value of adding support for it directly in web browsers. It concludes with a call for feedback from relying parties on whether they would like to see Transaction Confirmation should be supported directly in web browsers.</p>

<p>This is the third piece in a four-part series on nationalism and its threat to digital identity. If you missed it, read parts <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/data-privacy-human-rights-insights-by-one-world-identity/">one</a> and <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/chinas-digital-identity-schema-propels-nationalist-tech-ambitions/">two</a> now for the most comprehensive insights.</p>



<p>To recap: on July 7th, the EU announced that it had revoked the <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ecj-invalidated-the-eu-us-privacy-71770/">Privacy Shield</a>, a transatlantic agreement that enabled the legal transfer of data between itself and the United States (U.S.). Remarkably, the invalidation of the Privacy Shield framework was made effective immediately, leaving no grace period for an estimated <a href="https://fpf.org/2020/07/14/new-fpf-study-more-than-250-european-companies-are-participating-in-key-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">5,400 companies</a> that rely on the program’s protections to transfer data to and from the EU. Compounding the ambiguity of the moment is the flurry of complaints filed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/eu-websites-use-of-google-analytics-and-facebook-connect-targeted-by-post-schrems-ii-privacy-complaints/">European privacy groups</a> against major companies with regional operators still relying on Google Analytics / Facebook Connect integrations (still reliant on Privacy Shield-adjacent arrangements).&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The present moment might be ostensibly described as another dip on the regulatory rollercoaster at the heart of the EU’s mandate for individual privacy. The announcement a few days ago that the European Commission has begun initiating discussions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/eu-us-privacy-shield-is-dead-long-live-privacy-shield/">construct a new Privacy Shield</a> seems to encapsulate such imagery. It mirrors how the same court responsible struck down a similar decades-long data agreement in 2015, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/europes-highest-court-strikes-down-safe-harbour-data-sharing-between-eu-and-us/">Safe Harbour agreement</a>, propelling the European Commission to propose and enact the Privacy Shield in 2016.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we should recognize the past few years as indicative of the EU’s growing willingness to play privacy “bully-ball”, pressuring other countries — including close allies — to comply with stronger data privacy mandates as a basic requirement to conduct business in the region. Indeed, the EU is making a nationalist digital identity play, focused on addressing the control over <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/identity-building-blocks/">identity’s building blocks</a> at a regional level.</p>



<p>The EU’s prioritization of individual privacy is best understood as a cocktail of two countervailing forces – one part historical concerns that the union has had with overbroad government interests, and one part overbroad commercial interests. For the past three decades, the EU has always had a comprehensive, region-spanning privacy framework — first with the Data Protection Directive (DPD), transposed consequently by the <a href="https://gdpr.report/news/2018/03/06/data-protection-directive-versus-gdpr-understanding-key-changes/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> in 2018 (GDPR). The two equally address protection against government and industry forces, applying to all organizations in the EU operating in the public and private sector. In contrast, the US has consistently been plagued by a patchwork approach. Its <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44257.pdf">legal precedent</a> has largely focused on governmental intrusions on individual privacy, and its commercial protections are industry-specific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EU also has had a vested interest in pushing back against Silicon Valley (SV) incumbents, reflecting its issues with the US regulatory approach to privacy. Moreover, this interest is couched in the historical and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-siliconvalley/strong-ties-bind-spy-agencies-and-silicon-valley-idUSBRE96214I20130703">silent cooperation</a> of SV corporations <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-reddit-idUSKCN0WX2YF">with</a> US intelligence agencies. In fact, it was the 2013 revelations about the scope and breadth of the US National Surveillance Agency, laid bare by Snowden, which prompted the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44257.pdf">original scrutiny in the EU leading to the 2015 Safe Harbor agreement strikedown</a>. Previous actions the EU has taken also reflect this, with the EU <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/eu-ups-antitrust-pressure-on-google-cites-nsa-scandal-android-domination-as-a-factor/">citing potential NSA involvement</a> in 2018 as it applied antitrust pressure against Google.</p>



<p>Although the EU is focused primarily on individual privacy — whereas China has focused on national security as its guiding principle — its strong preference for data localization suggests a similar belief that strong government actions and regulations can also play a part in re-establishing the EU as a power in the digital identity space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EU’s commercial ambitions for digital identity are made chiefly evident by viewing its government initiatives in the context of anti-SV and anti-US regulatory trends. Its Data Strategy, announced in February 2020, will set into motion a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/building-european-data-economy">€2 billion investment </a>into EU specific data processing and sharing infrastructure. Moreover, in April 2020, the union announced <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/02/eu-data-market-technology-silicon-valley">plans</a> to stand up a region-specific industrial database that could rival SV, aiming to capitalize on a EU-centric data economy worth roughly <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-data-market-study-update">400 billion euros</a> and a data market worth roughly 75 billion euros.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s clear that, at least when it comes to digital identity, the EU has furthered its national interest and led the narrative around who controls and shapes it. And while the impact to its data economy has yet to be captured fully, the EU has succeeded in establishing itself as a regulatory leader for data privacy. It has pushed other countries (notably, <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/argentinas-new-bill-on-personal-data-protection/">Argentina</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en">Japan</a>) to achieve adequacy for data protection within the region.&nbsp;<br>In doing so, the EU has legitimized the phantom of cyber-nationalism sweeping the globe, and suggests its investment in leading and molding digital identity for both its citizens and — by proxy — the rest of the world. The EU Commission’s Data Strategy states this plainly, emphasizing that the moment to act against “sources of competitiveness for the next decades in the data economy” (i.e. SV incumbents) <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-european-strategy-data-19feb2020_en.pdf">is now</a>. Acting otherwise, it states, “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-european-strategy-data-19feb2020_en.pdf">reduces incentives</a>” for data-driven businesses located in the region to emerge, to grow, and to compete.</p>

<p>Members of the <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> Alliance are united in the belief that identity is a fundamental and universal human right and that we all deserve better ways to prove who we are — both in the physical world and&nbsp;online.</p><p>As a community of technologists, advocates, implementers, and funders, we also believe that ethically implemented, privacy-protecting, user-managed, and portable digital ID solutions offer a better alternative to the current “data as a commodity” paradigm.</p><p>A new report from KPMG entitled, <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2020/new-imperative-corporate-data-responsibility.html">The New Imperative for Corporate Data Responsibility</a>, suggests that the American public increasingly agrees with this perspective. Based on a survey of 1,000 respondents, the report concludes that consumers expect corporations to “take significant steps to better protect, manage, and ethically use their&nbsp;data.”</p><blockquote>“The findings are unmistakable,” says Orson Lucas, Principal, KPMG Cyber Security Services. “Data privacy and protection are clear priorities for consumers. Close attention to customer data handling, management, and protection practices are key, foundational elements of establishing and maintaining digital&nbsp;trust.”</blockquote><p>The report outlines valuable findings regarding how the public feels about the security of their data, the issues that concern them, and who they believe bears responsibility for creating a more secure and trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p><p>Key Findings: Beliefs</p>  97 percent of respondents say that data privacy is important to&nbsp;them  87 percent believe that data privacy is a human&nbsp;right  86 percent believe that data privacy is a growing&nbsp;concern  68 percent don’t trust companies to ethically sell their private&nbsp;data  54 percent don’t trust companies to use their personal data in an ethical&nbsp;way  53 percent don’t trust companies to collect data in an ethical&nbsp;way  50 percent don’t trust companies to protect their personal&nbsp;data  <p>These insights should not surprise us. After all, a majority of Americans have, at one time or another, been personally affected by a data breach. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see that public opinion is shifting; our experiences have made us all more cognizant of how our identity and personal data are being misused and mismanaged. On the other hand, these experiences are also contributing to a growing mistrust of all forms of digital ID. For those who work in this space, this is a timely reminder that, as we develop and deploy new forms of digital ID, we must do so with an intentional focus and abiding commitment to rebuild and maintain public&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Key Findings: Concerns</p>  83 percent of respondents worry most about the theft of their Social Security Number, followed by their credit card number (69 percent), and their passwords (49&nbsp;percent)  Only 16 percent are worried about their medical records being stolen. Medical records are the most commonly cited example of data that consumers trust companies to protect (57&nbsp;percent)  <p>Given these rapidly changing consumer opinions, and with our vision of good digital ID for all as our guiding star, we at ID2020 regularly revisit the question: how do we get&nbsp;there?</p><p>The data suggest what we have long believed: that, in the coming years, market forces (i.e. consumer demands) will drive tectonic shifts in the data economy. But will market forces be&nbsp;enough?</p><p>Most telling in the data is that the public is most likely to trust healthcare companies to protect the privacy of their medical records. Laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) establish robust data protections and stiff penalties for companies that mishandle data. These offer the public a degree of confidence that their health information will be held sacrosanct.</p><p>The house is on fire and that the public is finally smelling the smoke when it comes to data security. Market forces can be extremely powerful, but we expect that governments will play an equally important, catalytic role by establishing the regulatory frameworks and consumer protections necessary to rebuild trust and encourage the broad adoption of safe and secure digital ID applications.</p><p>Here as well, the KPMG data provides some valuable insights for policymakers.</p><p>Key Findings: Who is Responsible</p>  91 percent of respondents say that corporations should take the lead in establishing corporate data responsibility  56 percent say that companies should prioritize giving consumers more control over their data in&nbsp;2020  84 percent are open to state legislatures giving consumers more control over their&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Data privacy issues are not going to go away,” says KPMG Cyber Security Services Principle, Steve Stein. “In fact, consumer protections around data privacy, like the ones provided by the CCPA, are very likely to be codified in other states and eventually at the federal level. Simply put, privacy laws are only going to increase in volume and rigor. That’s why visibility, protection, and trust is gaining such momentum in the marketplace and also why leading-edge companies are not looking at data privacy as just another compliance or check-the-box exercise. They see privacy as one of the pathways to growing their business by improving trust with their customers.”</blockquote><p>So…How DO We Get&nbsp;There?</p><p>Identity systems rely on trust to function; trust between issuers of identity and relying parties and, critically, that of those who use the system to prove their identity to access various goods, services, and privileges.</p><p>ID2020 was established in 2016 to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions. To achieve this vision, we are working simultaneously along three&nbsp;tracks.</p><p>We are helping shape the market through the ID2020 Certification, which applies 41 rigorous, outcome-based Technical Requirements to certify best-in-class digital ID solutions. We are working with policymakers in the United States and internationally to advocate for the ethical implementation of better forms of digital ID. And, as the technologies continue to evolve, we are implementing programs in the field to test and apply what we learn as these systems are replicated and brought to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Fully realizing the potential of digital ID will require businesses, technology providers, policymakers, and civil society to collaborate — and quickly — to build and implement functional, privacy-preserving, user-managed ID systems, and work to overcome the mistrust which could impede their broad adoption. We developed the ID2020 Alliance model to foster this collaboration.</p><p>The road to good ID for all is riddled with potholes…and we have one chance to get this&nbsp;right.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights, while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/new-report-highlights-public-concerns-about-data-privacy-6cfd1e248d49">New Report Highlights Public Concerns About Data Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 “Covid State of Play” examines sick buildings, planning lags, and reopening <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/carolyn-schmitt">Carolyn&nbsp;Schmitt</a></p>A tent hospital in Central Park. Photo: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Park_tent_hospital_(2)_jeh.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a><p>In the absence of leadership guidelines for mitigating COVID-19, creative solutions — in concert with established public health recommendations — are&nbsp;key.</p><p>Low-cost air quality sensors, rethinking what schools look like, and identifying new modes of collaboration are a few of the creative approaches discussed during a recent discussion hosted by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a> and <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/margaret-bourdeaux">Magaret Bourdeaux</a> of the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-digital-pandemic-response">Digital Pandemic Response</a>&nbsp;program.</p><p>The talk examined the current “Covid State of Play,” and covered COVID-19 testing, school reopenings, and ventilation. Their guest, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/joseph-allen/">Joseph Allen</a>, is an Assistant Professor of Exposure Assessment Science at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public&nbsp;Health.</p><p>Bourdeaux, also of the Harvard Medical School’s Global Public Policy and Social Change program and the Harvard Kennedy School’s Security and Global Health Project, outlined the current testing situation in the United States, urging for more action and implementation.</p><p>“I think this is all about hard work. It is about systematic planning. It is about leadership and not counting [on] that there’s going to be some miracle cure, some miracle intervention that is going to save us. We are going to have to actually do the work that is required to control this outbreak and we just have to grow up and do it,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Allen added that there ongoing work on a rapid saliva-based at-home test, which needs to be reviewed by the FDA but has the potential to be a quick, accessible, low-cost test. “There is the technology available for at-home rapid tests. To Margaret’s point, we need it now,” he said, noting that the test isn’t the same as the PCR tests currently in use. “It takes a different mentality. It’s not a diagnostic test like we expect at the doctor’s office. It’s a tool to control the pandemic or help control the pandemic, so we need a mindset shift here and think about how we think about testing.”</p><p>School reopenings without testing infrastructure and public health implementations are also a pressing concern. Atop the testing challenges, many schools and universities have buildings with poor ventilation, Zittrain pointed out. Bourdeaux and Allen emphasized how being outside is safer than being indoors, but buildings with good ventilation are important for mitigating the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>“We are in the sick building era,” Allen said, meaning many buildings meet only minimum air quality standards to save energy. “So we’re paying the consequence right now for our choices that we’ve stopped designing buildings for&nbsp;people.”</p><p>Zittrain inquired about the use of carbon dioxide sensors in indoor spaces to monitor the air quality, a tool Allen said is already in use, and that his lab has also built. “Some of these can connect to the building information system, so in real-time it can, to your point, ‘hey, your CO2 hit a certain level. Let’s open up the dampers in here.’ In fact, it’s called demand control ventilation,” Allen explained.</p><p>But the availability of low-cost carbon dioxide sensors means employees can also raise red flags about air quality. “It’s democratized this healthy buildings idea and people are sharing that data. They are sharing that. Buildings are getting labeled sick buildings,” he said. “People can finally make the invisible visible with these cheap sensors.”</p><p>With “sick buildings” as a backdrop, the conversation shifted to whether schools should reopen. Allen, a <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/harvard-expert-outlines-recommendations-for-school-reopenings/">proponent </a>for reopening schools, argued there should be prerequisites to opening: “One, you have to control the spread and two, you have to make enhancements to your risk reduction strategies within the school. So it’s the when and the what. When to open and what has to be done, and so that’s where I’ve been bullish to say hey, if you do those things, sure, schools should&nbsp;open.”</p><p>Allen cited recent reopening failures in states like Georgia as examples of when these conditions were not met and should not have opened. “I am confident if we meet those metrics you’ll have low community spread and the probability of entering into the school and your new cases lower, that’s obvious as a numbers game. And then if you put these other strategies in place which we know work in hospitals and elsewhere, including and beyond airborne transmission, it’s mask-wearing, it’s de-identification, it’s managing flows of people and queues of people,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Bourdeaux echoed Allen’s concerns, emphasizing the importance of controlling community transmission, including case counts, and “understanding how robust your public health measures to end community transmission are.”</p><p>She compared the current response to the virus to the way people experience a hurricane, where the storm blows over and the perceived danger subsides. Instead, she said, there is more work to do from a public health perspective before having the reopening conversation. Bourdeaux said having a national plan and for having the important conversations to help stop the spread of the virus should be part of this action&nbsp;plan.</p><p>“We’re not having a very intelligent conversation about really what we’re dealing with to date, and so that’s not related to schools and whether schools could be made safe,” she said. “They absolutely can be made safe. We’ve seen buildings like hospitals, as Dr. Allen has pointed out. We can make places safe but I think that it’s asking a lot to say okay, let’s reopen schools when we’re not having a smart conversation about where we stand with community transmission in general.”</p><p>While children have lower infection and mortality rates, Allen countered that schools play an important function for many students, and other risks — such as access to food and virtual dropout — should be factored in as well. “If we don’t think there are consequences to keeping tens of millions of kids outside of school, they’re at higher risk of abuse and neglect, exploitation. The loss of learning. The loss of socialization. Over 30 million kids rely on schools for meals. These are massive costs and it’s horrifying to recognize that our country hasn’t prioritized this,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Along similar lines, Zittrain asked whether any official guidelines for reopening might further intensify the inequalities between wealthier communities — who have access to more resources — and marginalized communities, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.</p><p>These inequalities will still exist with virtual schooling, Allen said. “This virus is exposing deep fissures within our society, the structural racism that’s in our society that exists within these schools. If we keep kids all at home that’s going to exist for the exact same reason and if you bring back some, well that inequality, inequity is going to exist and be exacerbated as well. There’s no simple answer here other than honestly it’s a systemic issue that needs to be fixed and fixed&nbsp;fast.”</p><p>To address these myriad challenges presented by COVID-19, Zittrain asked about best practices for sharing information and working together. Both Allen and Bourdeaux underscored the great opportunities and responses they have seen. Allen described the past few months as a period of great collaboration and camaraderie with “the whole world, every scientist and medical professional is focused on the same problem.” As an illustration of such new collaboration, he cited <a href="https://schools.forhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2020/06/Harvard-Healthy-Buildings-Program-Schools-For-Health-Reopening-Covid19-June2020.pdf">a report</a> he worked on to advise school superintendents. Bourdeaux similarly emphasized how so many people are trying to take action to help and support during the pandemic, and referred to a <a href="https://apnews.com/9126a38ef22c244f9ca18f9584061f8d">recent poll</a> that says most Americans support a mask&nbsp;mandate.</p><p>The trio also explored creative ways to host schools, such as makeshift schools outside, similar to how hospitals made tented spaces in parks. Allen pointed to an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/27/we-can-must-reopen-schools-heres-how/">op-ed he wrote </a>outlining steps to reopen, which includes temporary school&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>“Let’s put some tents. Let’s use the ball field. Let’s get creative. Look at what the medical community did…There were tents in Central Park,” he said. “We should turn convention centers into schools. Let’s put tents in every park. We can get real creative here instead of saying well, we have this old crumbling infrastructure, what are we going to do? Let’s just jam a thousand kids back into it and do everything the same way. Instead, I think there are some creative solutions out&nbsp;there.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/no-simple-answer-99085ffd0623">“No simple answer”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We all have heard blockchain stories. Stories that redefined the way businesses operate. Stories that created new business across the domains. Stories that propelled innovation. Stories that are defining the future of technology. Stories that helped others run their business in decentralized fashion. And a lot more.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has seen increasingly wider adoption across the industries. Digital transformation of businesses and innovation in the healthcare industry have seen unprecedented demand like never before during the challenging times of COVID-19. What seemed impossible in the past is now turning to be reality.</p>



<p>The Hyperledger India Chapter aims to bridge the gap between the blockchain technology enthusiasts and the blockchain technology experts. To us, it seemed it was time for an event to bring together booming startups and established organizations to share their blockchain journey. In these demanding times, having physical get-togethers is impossible around the world. There is a saying in Sanskrit “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,” which translates to “World is Indeed One Family.” The idea of having the virtual event in India transformed to one that could benefit the whole Asia Pacific audience. The event time was chosen so that everybody in the Asia Pacific region from the Middle East to Australia/New Zealand could attend.</p>



<p>In the last week of May and through June, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hyperledger-india-chapter">Hyperledger India Chapter</a> proudly organized a series of interactive events, the most anticipated “Blockchain Stories 2020.”</p>



<p>The series was an attempt to answer the questions one normally hears. Is blockchain really being adopted across the industries? What uses can blockchain solve? How do you effectively use a blockchain solution? Can blockchain transform agriculture? How does blockchain transform education and certification in the future? Is blockchain an answer to all the healthcare problems? What are the barriers for the adoption of blockchain technology?</p>



<p>Highlights:</p>



  25+ organizations presented their solutions. The topics covered a range of domains including supply chain, telecom, healthcare, agriculture, digitally verifiable certificates, self sovereign identity and security, digital currency, global trade, research and education.&nbsp;  More than 1,000 blockchain enthusiasts from across the Asia Pacific region signed up for the events.  Community engagement continued across five weeks.   20+ volunteers helped tirelessly, physically separated but virtually connected.&nbsp;  



<p>That’s not all. Since Hyperledger believes in inclusive community growth, sessions not only showcased solutions built on Hyperledger projects but also ones built on other platforms. These sessions focused more on how blockchain as a technology pillar is helping to design solutions to the demanding problems. The series also featured talks on how to measure and improve the performance of blockchain frameworks.</p>



<p>Indian blockchain firms have made an impact on Industry 4.0, which created massive hype amongst the young, brilliant and blooming minds of India. Blockchain tech has already made its way into many mainstream industries. The emerging technology startups thanked the Hyperledger India Chapter for organizing an event and providing them an opportunity to present their solution alongside the lights of big establishments. AyanWorks, a blockchain startup based in Pune, India, presented their immunity passport solution for safe reopening of the post pandemic world. Snapper Future Tech &amp; IIT Alumni Association presented their solution on COVID-19 X-Ray analysis using&nbsp; blockchain &amp; AI, reducing the cost of testing. Tech Mahindra showed how blockchain is helping to solve the telecom’s billion subscriber problem, and countries including the USA are requesting a similar solution. The dltledgers, a blockchain startup based in Singapore, shared their digital transformation journey for cross border trade finance. Soramitsu, a blockchain technology firm based in Japan, shared their payment solution.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunsm93/">Arun S M</a>, Walmart Global Tech, says “It feels amazing to see the great response from the community. What started as a thought late last year took multiple turns, shapes and forms to be finally called Blockchain Stories 2020. Hyperledger staff members made it easy for us to turn a local event into a virtual one that reached an audience throughout Asia Pacific. The community stood by us through a technical glitch on our first day of the event, showing quality and a high level of interest and engagement.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-gordon-12a2a3/">Julian Gordon</a>, VP, Asia Pacific, Hyperledger, says “Hyperledger’s India Chapter volunteers worked tirelessly and enthusiastically to produce this wonderful series of ‘Blockchain Stories 2020’ for the Hyperledger and wider blockchain communities. Each event featured cutting-edge blockchain solutions, addressed opportunities and challenges, and showcased exciting developments in blockchain. Hyperledger has received excellent and appreciative feedback from the series’ virtual audience. It’s particularly timely and heartening to see quality virtual events like these take place in this challenging time of Covid-19. It’s a pleasure to support Hyperledger’s India Chapter, and I would like to thank them for all their work on the ‘Blockchain Stories 2020’ series.”</p>



<p>Did you miss the event? We have got it covered. Watch the recap <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0MZ85B_96CEOZ2WrkVuAfSKtzNwsyDk5">on YouTube</a>. The Hyperledger India Chapter thanks all the volunteers and organizers for helping to make this event a success story.</p>



<p>About Us: The Hyperledger India Chapter is responsible for growing the Hyperledger community in India, promoting contributions to Hyperledger projects and providing a platform for collaboration, mentoring and support. The chapter aims to showcase the broad range of Hyperledger projects and initiatives to the Indian audience. Join us and share your ideas! Weekly meeting details can be found at the Hyperledger <a href="http://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings">Calendar of Public Meetings</a>.</p>



<p>Future Plans: There is a huge interest in the community to contribute back to open source projects. We are happy to provide a platform and connect, guide and mentor the technical community in India. Following the success of the “Blockchain Stories 2020,” we will organize a “Hyperledger Project Connect Series” to benefit tech enthusiasts in Africa, Europe and the Asia Pacific regions.</p>

It is decentralized in its processes as well as its topography. Learning the “lay of the land” entails bouncing around a network more than surveying a city from a high vantage point. But that’s ok! We recommend starting from the least familiar of these links and bouncing around, rather than reading start to&nbsp;finish.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@benjaminjohnelliott">Benjamin&nbsp;Elliot</a> —Video Introductions to&nbsp;SSI   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djhYZZ3CkuM">An Introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity</a> 9min<br>This presentation by the “SSI Ambassador” (Adrian Doerk of the LISSI project, headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany) touches on the psychology and sociology of identity definitions. It highlights why digital identity offers many different ways to present ourselves and walks through the basics of how ID today is dominated by mega-IdPs (identity providers). It gets to the conceptual heart of what SSI is about. It also shows a real live demonstration of a scooter-authorization project spearheaded by T-Mobile&nbsp;Germany.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GkdBRmsbE&amp;t=9s">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Foam Figure Explainer v2</a> 9min<br>John Phillips from 460 Degrees, a consulting firm from Sydney, AU, updated his earlier video in January of 2020. This level-setting and first-introduction was designed to help Phillips’ clients understand what SSI looks like from a business-process perspective, which is the key perspective from which large enterprises are mostly likely to decide how much to invest in researching and considering SSI solutions. For more guidance on B2B sales and education, see his longer <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/explaining-ssi-c-suite-executives-anyone-else-john-phillips-webinar-48/">February presentation</a> at SSI Meetup about how to explain SSI to C-Level executives.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AydQmOTcECk">The True Meaning of Identity </a>38 min<br>In September 2019, Kaliya Young presented to SIBOS (the conference of the SWIFT settlement network central to global banking) in their Innovation Track. The video introduces the concept of identity and how it has evolved over time, before sharing at a high level how Self-Sovereign Identity works and why it solves widespread business problems.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfi11GZjbWM">Domains of Identity</a> — 33 min<br>In July of 2018, Kaliya Young presented to the MyData Conference and tied together her research work developing the <a href="https://www.anthempress.com/the-domains-of-identity-hb">Domains of Identity</a> and how the various domains connects to the usage of decentralized identity technology — decentralized identifier and verifiable credentials.  <p>The <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/">SSIMeetup</a> series run out of Madrid, Spain by the indefatigable Alex Preukchat has been assembling a video archive of their live webinar series for years. For these, they invite leaders of influential SSI projects from around the world. These events have a loyal following of regular attendees, making for a spirited Q&amp;A session at the end of each video. While most of the videos tend towards deep dives in specific technical, governance, business, or regional topics, some of them can be useful, accessible, and inspiring for novices.

It is uniquely co-created by its participants in a mostly-organic and community-driven way, with no pre-picked speakers, keynotes, or commercial presentations aside from a demo hour. True to its name, workshopping, whiteboarding, and open (but detailed and concrete!) discussion on a massive scale are the core of the event. The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">books of proceedings</a> organize and refine all of the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">notes</a> taken live during all the sessions convened at each&nbsp;event.</p> <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> <p>This influential and egalitarian global organization grew out of a series of <a href="https://online2020.mydata.org">conferences</a> first held in 2016. They advocate for a human-centric and rights-driven vision where individuals can get digital services that support them to collect their data, not just safeguarding and well serving but even empowering the data subject. Organizational members and individual members come together to create an ongoing dialogue between “consumers” and ethical businesses to shape new types of markets for digital services. Rooted in the values of the <a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData Declaration</a>, they focus primarily on elaborating refined, nuance, and bottoms-up models for data governance; only from a solid governance foundation do they begin to make policy, business, and technology decisions. They recently published the <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">MyData Operators paper</a>, bringing their policy, business, and technological goals more squarely into the realm of decentralized identity.</p> <a href="https://sovrin.org/">The Sovrin Foundation</a> <p>Since the early days of decentralized identity, Sovrin has been one of the major hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship, serving as a kind of all-in-one community, codebase, blockchain, and better business bureau. They have also published many canonical educational and marketing texts that have been foundational to the development of “self-sovereign identity” as a sector of the software industry. The Aries project (housed in the Hyperledger Foundation) and the Trust-over-IP foundation are, in a sense, spin-outs of the Sovrin foundation, and both remain loosely based (sometimes by design, sometimes by momentum) on the Sovrin community’s codebase, ledger, and design principles. The fastest way to familiarize yourself with these is the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/">whitepaper library</a> on the Foundation’s website.</p> Standards organizations <p>These centers of gravity are where ideas and business models evolve in broad conversation. Inevitably, structuring ground rules and governance models for these eventually have to be negotiated between technical experts and standards adopted before major investments (of capital, but also of legislation and public good will) can be approved. See Nader Helmy’s great <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards-f82efd9ab6c7">tour</a> of standards organizations relevant to these centers of&nbsp;gravity.</p> — Government Initiatives:  United States Federal Government <p>Anil John, head of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program run under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology directorate has been funding the development of standards and business models in the nascent field for years. Their website hosts an <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">overview</a> of related projects <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">articles by them</a>, as well as guidance documents such as the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/white-paper/2020/01/14/a-taxonomic-approach-to-understanding-emerging-blockchain-idms/final">Taxonomic Approach</a> to Understanding Emerging Blockchain Identity Management Systems. Anil’s blog hosted by CyberForge includes many thoughtful pieces, such as Anil’s recent thoughts on interoperability or his article on the role of government in free-market technology, <a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/can-less-be-more/">Can LESS be&nbsp;more</a>?</p> The British Columbia Provincial Government <p>“BCGov” has invested significantly in the SSI IT management model and has pioneered an approach to verifiable public data represented by the <a href="https://vonx.io">Verifiable Organizations Network</a> (“VON”). This network provides public-record credentials about registered business in a publicly accessible repository of Verifiable Credentials, bringing the traditional “orgBook” into the decentralized era. By directing much of their IT budgets towards open-source development and participating heavily in the emerging open-source community around this project, they have provided invaluable leadership, particularly within the Aries community, including such major contributions as the core of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-plugin-toolbox">Aca-Py Codebase</a>.</p> The European&nbsp;Union <p>ESSIF (European SSI Framework) is an ongoing open-source initiative to seed and accelerate the role of SSI in the EU digital “single market” strategy. It is housed jointly between the directorate-generals responsible for IT planning and policy in Brussels and the independent European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Get+Started+EBSI">EBSI</a>), a 30-country collaboration of EU and EU-affiliated countries working together to build a shared infrastructure for government blockchain projects.

<p>ID2020 is proud to announce the certification of Immunity Passport from BLOK Bioscience, a digital ID-based solution for COVID health status certificates. Immunity Passport is the first COVID-focused solution to be certified by&nbsp;ID2020.</p><p>Immunity Passport offers individuals a self-sovereign record of their testing, antibody and, ultimately, vaccination status. Initially envisioned as a means to help businesses and governments manage the safe and incremental return to public life in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the solution is expected to be applied more broadly in the future to support immunization certificates and the transmission of other medical test&nbsp;results.</p><blockquote>“The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust digital credentials into the global spotlight,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “As we consider digital ID-based solutions for public health applications, getting the technology right is not negotiable. We intentionally set a high bar for certification and are delighted to recognize the BLOK Bioscience Immunity Passport solution for meeting our high standards for privacy protection, user-management, portability, and&nbsp;more.”</blockquote><p>To be eligible for certification, solutions must adhere to 41 functional, outcomes-based<a href="https://id2020.org/uploads/files/Technical-Requirements.pdf"> Technical Requirements</a>. In addition to providing a roadmap to help developers create better products, the ID2020 Certification also provides a “third-party seal of approval” so that implementers — and ultimately, end-users — can trust that the technology was developed in accordance with the highest ethical and technical standards.</p><blockquote>“Pandemic management is essentially an entirely new solution domain,” said BLOK Solutions Chief Technology Officer, Areiel Wolanow. “The precedents we set now will set the standard for how the future unfolds, so we have a duty to get things right. By starting with the principle that individuals should always be the sole owner of their data, it is our hope at BLOK that this a standard that others will find it exceedingly difficult to deviate&nbsp;from.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Certification is already impacting the technical landscape for digital ID and technology providers of all sizes are increasingly aligning their technical approaches to comport with ID2020’s requirements. To date, more than 30 technology providers from every corner of the globe have submitted applications and worked with the ID2020 staff and advisory committees to complete the application process.</p><p>Today, Immunity Passport joins Kiva Protocol, Gravity.earth, and ZAKA as part of a small, but rapidly growing, cadre of ID2020 certified digital ID solutions.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org/">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About BLOK BioScience, Ltd.</p><p>BLOK BioScience is part of the BLOK Group. With a network of global experts and a robust and far-reaching supply chain, we provide trusted and authentic solutions to help respond to the rapidly changing population wellness landscape.</p><p>Our unique combination of medical and strategic expertise and technical knowledge results in secure and compliant solutions for tracking and verifying immunity, and we use rapid antibody testing and recording to enable governments and industry to manage viral outbreaks and mitigate the economic and social effects of pandemics</p><p><a href="http://www.blokbioscience.com/">www.blokbioscience.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-announces-certification-of-blok-bioscience-immunity-passport-1f86013e9da5">ID2020 Announces Certification of BLOK Bioscience Immunity Passport</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

But, if you want to deploy FIDO in your enterprise, what are the first steps? Do you need to explain “why FIDO?” to your CISO? What do the timelines look like? Should you build your own server or work with a vendor? What FIDO authenticators should you accept? How do you manage&nbsp; them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) will answer these questions, and more, in its new white paper series. The series aims to educate corporate management and IT security on the improvements available for authentication today and how to leverage them within their own organizations. This work is dedicated to eliminating passwords and securing the simple act of logging into company systems and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First up in the series is the primer “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">CXO Explanation: Why Use FIDO for Passwordless Employee Logins</a>?” This document is the guide for you and/or the executive leaders in your organization as to why you should invest in FIDO2 deployment for your employees.</p>



<p>It addresses all of the common questions from CXOs on the value proposition of FIDO Authentication and how the FIDO2 passwordless framework addresses the authentication needs and challenges of companies for the modern workforce. Read it now at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/</a> and pass it along to colleagues.</p>



<p>Subsequent entries in this educational series will focus on server deployment, authenticator choices, authenticator life-cycle management, and credential acceptance in the enterprise. This series is part of the Alliance’s strategy to provide expert deployment guidance to our community in order to support the rapidly growing number of FIDO implementations across a variety of use cases. Please watch this space as we publish more in this Enterprise Series over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Kingdom of Cambodia in Southeast Asia, three-quarters (78%) of its citizens have no bank account, yet more than half own a smartphone. And even though the native currency—the Khmer riel (KHR)—has been stable for 20 years, most people there use the American dollar. Ever since a major UN mission in the mid-1990s, the price of everything from a cup of coffee to a car has been given in U.S. dollars.</p>



<p>Addressing these challenges and more, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) set out to see if a digital payment system could handle transactions faster and for lower cost than the existing system.</p>



<p>Could it promote wider use of the riel? And could that system run as a mobile app that any citizen with a smartphone could use to shop or transfer money to family or friends?</p>



<p>To find out, NBC partnered with blockchain developer experts Soramitsu on a retail payment system project that would modernize the country’s legacy retail payments with the help of the Hyperledger Iroha blockchain framework.</p>



<p>When most people picture a CBDC, they imagine an entirely new digital asset created out of “thin air.” The problem is, this new asset could distort a country’s monetary policy and affect its exchange rates. To be prudent, Cambodia’s central bank wanted to create a digital token backed by fiat currency stored safely in its vaults. The new payments platform would become a way to move around digitized cash, while preserving the creditworthiness and security of the central bank.</p>



<p>The resulting project, called Bakong, is the first retail payments system in the world using blockchain technology. Individuals can now transfer money and buy from merchants with a simple smartphone app. Merchants gain a fast, cashless, and secure payments system. And banks can do interbank transfers at much lower cost.</p>



<p>The pilot project went live in July 2019 and ran successfully with a network of 14 banks supporting more than 10,000 users, laying the groundwork for a large-scale rollout later this year.</p>



<p>Hyperledger teamed up with Soramitsu on a detailed case study covering the planning and implementation of Bakong, including key goals, milestones, security considerations and core technology requirements, as well as a preview of rollout plans and new features.</p>

<p>In July 2020, Digital Identity New Zealand and Kantara signed an MOU to collaborate on a range of activities for the advancement of the Mission of both organizations.</p>
<p>A month later we asked them to share some thoughts with the wider Kantara global community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What’s the elevator pitch for DINZ?</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are all about trustworthy collaboration on digital identity and personal information.&nbsp; We recognise that our online experience traverses an ecosystem of providers, platforms and technologies, and that effective collaboration and interoperability is key to better customer interactions and increased productivity.&nbsp; We believe that Identity is taonga (a Maori word meaning something precious and valued) – it is a treasure worthy of dignity, respect and care.&nbsp; This principle guides our collaborative efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. How is DINZ &nbsp;and its members experiencing and reacting to the current global situation?</p>
<p>Digital&nbsp;Identity NZ’s 2020 research survey has found that there is a growing&nbsp;awareness&nbsp;of the way in which our personal information is harvested and used by&nbsp;organisations and technology providers, coupled with a high degree of anger and&nbsp;disappointment about the widespread sale and sharing of that information.&nbsp;91% of New Zealanders desire a greater level of control over their&nbsp;identity and personal information, and we are calling on organisations and their technology providers to take a greater share of responsibility.&nbsp; As organisations we have done an excellent job in&nbsp;raising awareness of some of the risks and challenges associated with our&nbsp;highly connected world, yet we are placing&nbsp;too heavy a burden on people to&nbsp;protect themselves without adjusting our systems and processes to make it&nbsp;easier for them to understand and take action.</p>
<p>3. How do you see the effects of the pandemic impacting digital identity beyond 2020?</p>
<p>Our research shows that more and more people are looking to online interactions first, rather than face to face.&nbsp; Two thirds of New Zealanders indicated that their first point of call is now online.&nbsp; Enabling that online interaction is a primary function of digital identity, and it is becoming increasingly important for all organisations to engage online, be they large and small, commercial, academic or community.</p>
<p>4. What’s high on DINZ’s agenda right now?</p>
<p>The management of identity and personal information is increasingly&nbsp;reliant on a trustworthy ecosystem of participants, adhering not only to&nbsp;technical and security&nbsp;standards, but also embracing principles of Kāwanatanga&nbsp;(Honourable Governance), Rangatiratanga (Self Determination &amp; Agency),&nbsp;Ōritetanga (Equity &amp;&nbsp;Partnership) and freedom of choice and&nbsp;expression. Building a trustworthy community of practice is a key activity for us.&nbsp; This is even more pertinent given the New Zealand Government’s emerging work on a legislated Trust Framework for digital identity.&nbsp; We are working closely with the agency responsible for developing the new framework, seeking collaborative action to refine and build a trustworthy ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the second part of our series on nationalism and its threat to digital identity, we analyze China, the chief proponent of cyber sovereignty. We analyze the primacy of nationalism as a tool for maintaining political control in China, as well as the importance of technology for validating the nationalist idea that China is a formidable global power.</p>



<p>The Trump administration’s announcement of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/announcing-the-expansion-of-the-clean-network-to-safeguard-americas-assets/#.XyskRCepNOE.twitter">Clean Network</a> program, in tandem with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/technology/trump-wechat-tiktok-china.html">twin bans of Tiktok and Wechat</a>, has stoked fears of an increasingly fragmented Internet and a brewing Tech Cold War. The underlying current of the burgeoning Tech Cold War is the global rise of nationalism. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/12/coronavirus-killing-globalization-nationalism-protectionism-trump/">COVID-19 has cast doubt on the viability of globalism</a>, as global supply chains have been heavily disrupted and travel bans continue to be the norm. The potential retreat from globalism has only played into the hands of the rising number of nationalist governments around the world; notable examples include the <a href="https://qz.com/1774201/the-global-state-of-right-wing-populism-in-2019/">U.S., Brazil, and India</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 

 



<p>Two key reasons are driving tech to the foreground in the global competition between nationalist ambitions. The first is data as both a weapon for national security purposes and&nbsp;<a href="https://interconnected.blog/data-center-coverage-aws-alibaba-azure-gcp/">a tool for national governance</a>; the second is technological might as a proxy for global power and influence. China’s prioritization of foundational digital identity concepts has helped them succeed in both aspects.</p>



<p>Though China rose to power as the factory of the world, the government has long recognized the importance of technology to their long-term growth. To spur the growth of its own tech industry,<a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-much-cyber-sovereignty-too-much-cyber-sovereignty"> China has been a strong proponent of “cyber sovereignty,”</a> a concept that essentially states that national sovereignty extends beyond physical barriers into cyberspace. Therefore, <a href="https://theasiadialogue.com/2018/09/07/the-chinese-cyber-sovereignty-concept-part-1/">governments, not companies or individuals,</a> have ultimate control over the Internet for its citizens. Cyber sovereignty has traditionally been casted as the diametric opposite to the idea of a free and open internet. These two models of the internet are symbolic for a broader ideological conflict between authoritarian and democratic governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/global-rise-internet-sovereignty/">As is often pointed out</a>, authoritarian governments can weaponize cyber sovereignty to curb citizens’ freedoms on the Internet and influence the tech industry to serve their own means. (Ironically enough, the Trump administration is targeting Chinese tech partly because cyber sovereignty allows the Chinese government undue control over private tech companies, but the administration is <a href="https://qz.com/1889077/us-clean-network-campaign-shuts-out-chinese-apps-from-network/">ultimately adopting</a> China’s vision of the Internet in doing so.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Chinese government has used cyber sovereignty to encourage the growth of juggernauts like Tencent and Alibaba, while also compelling these firms to advance the state’s initiatives (e.g. <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/05/we-chat-they-watch/">censorship on WeChat</a>). However, their methods have become increasingly aggressive under Xi Jinping’s rule, as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-trump-xi-cold-war-asia-conflict-huawei-tiktok-communist-party/2020/08/07/5a6531c4-cc91-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html">Xi uses nationalism to maintain power</a>, especially in light of COVID-19, slowing economic growth and his ambitions for an unprecedented third term in office (which would make him the longest-reigning leader since Mao Zedong). The <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/07/the-world-is-falling-for-chinas-hong-kong-trap/">sweeping crackdown on Hong Kong,</a> <a href="https://www.cfr.org/report/military-confrontation-south-china-sea">gradual encroachment on the South China Sea</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html">detention of Uyghurs to promote ethnocentrism</a> are all examples of how Xi strategically uses aggression to amplify external threats–around which Chinese citizens can unify–and tamp down any and all differences within the nation.</p>



<p>The Chinese government’s nationalist agenda <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/05/how-chinese-nationalism-is-changing/">can be bifurcated</a> by outward-facing diplomatic agendas–e.g. their recent actions against Hong Kong–and inward-facing campaigns to cultivate patriotic pride in their citizens. In matters of data privacy and technological might, these foreign and domestic campaigns are deeply intertwined.</p>



<p>Outwardly, the ambition has been to solidify their status as a global power by becoming a world leader in technology, as suggested by their <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/made-in-china-2025-explained/">Made in China 2025</a> initiative. Mass influence campaigns are another potential route through which the Chinese government seeks to exert power, but there is less evidence supporting this (<a href="https://interconnected.blog/a-framework-to-dis-trust-and-verify-tiktok/">though not none</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, China’s inward-facing tech policy is focused on promoting a peaceful society toward influence campaigns and economic growth via tech advancements. The government uses tech companies to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/07/15/134178/how-wechat-censors-private-conversations-automatically-in-real-time/">crack down on dissent</a> and<a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/05/the-chinese-people-step-up-to-enforce-chinas-nationalist-propaganda/"> imbue patriotism</a> in Chinese citizens. In addition, the Chinese government acknowledges the growth of tech itself is necessary to fuel the continued growth of its economy, and in doing so, keep the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/25/world/asia/china-freedoms-control.html">tacit promise</a> it has with its citizens of ensuring economic vitality in exchange for uncontested control.</p>



<p>Via&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/chinas-data-privacy/">their digital identity regime</a>, the Chinese government has effectively implemented an invasive and sophisticated surveillance system that at once accomplishes both outward and inward nationalist agendas. China is now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/18/us-china-tech-race-beijing-has-strength-to-catch-up-with-us-lead.html">widely-regarded&nbsp;</a>as a world leader in biometric and AI technology, which not only powers their surveillance system, but also has allowed companies like Sensetime, Megvii, and iFlytek to become multi-billion dollar companies.</p>



<p>A digital identity regime that can effectively track all user activity, online and offline, benefits more than just biometric companies and the government though. China’s sophisticated digital identity system essentially creates a data economy that stands to be incredibly powerful because of its ability for this data to be linked with a high degree of accuracy. In this way, their digital identity system is key to unlocking new breakthroughs in tech for China. Such a data economy can train AI algorithms to generate highly-targeted ads, create sophisticated fraud prevention tools, and more. Not coincidentally, Tiktok’s secret sauce is widely considered to be their <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat">AI formula</a> that makes the likes of Facebook’s and Youtube’s look unsophisticated in comparison.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tiktok-and-the-great-firewall-of-america">TechNode</a> notes that China’s new <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/15265-2/">Data Security Law </a>reflects the importance that the Chinese government places on data. In enacting the law, the Chinese government seeks to regulate the data economy to serve its national security and economic benefits. I would also argue that nationalism plays an important role in the law as well. As part of China’s new civil code, the law is presented as legislation to protect citizens, not state interests. Specifically, the laws have a strong personal privacy component that is seemingly in response to rising privacy concerns of Chinese citizens.</p>



<p>As I have argued, the Chinese government does not rule simply by enforcing their will on its citizens. They are in fact highly sensitive to the wills of their citizens, because winning citizen favor is critical for the continued success of nationalist campaigns seeking to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-thinks-patriotic-education-built-a-loyal-generation-but-in-hong-kong-not-so-fast/2019/11/28/80f4d586-0c2c-11ea-8054-289aef6e38a3_story.html">instill patriotism</a> into Chinese citizens.</p>



<p>The Chinese government’s success in promoting nationalist sentiment and, specifically, positioning the Internet as a key battleground for its nationalist ambitions can be seen in Chinese citizens’ responses to the potential sale of Tiktok. While Tiktok battles scrutiny over its roots in China, parent company Bytedance is facing similar criticism in China over their perceived kowtowing to U.S. policy. Bytedance CEO and founder Zhang Yiming hid all his posts on Weibo, a popular social media platform, in response to a <a href="https://qz.com/1888102/bytedances-tiktok-sale-talks-with-microsoft-stir-anger-in-china/">torrent of backlash</a> from Chinese citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, now that other countries are starting to play China’s game of cyber sovereignty, has China actually won? The same policy that has propelled their tech industry is now threatening to undercut its growth. Countries are beginning to erect firewalls of their own against China’s technology. Even some Chinese technologists might argue China’s cyberspace strategy has backfired. The founder of the popular travel booking platform Ctrip <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/cyber-sovereignty-cuts-both-ways">James Liang</a>, in a now deleted post, has called for China to move towards a more open Internet to preserve the prosperity of China’s tech industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The national security concerns expressed on both sides may have legitimacy, but wholesale banning of apps does a disservice to citizens by taking away the freedom of choice and styming economic growth. Instead, strong regulation–such as&nbsp;<a href="https://interconnected.blog/a-framework-to-dis-trust-and-verify-tiktok/">that prescribed by Kevin Xu</a>&nbsp;in his blog– would address both legitimate concerns over data privacy and security, while preserving citizen choice and strengthening digital identity schemas for international cooperation. We will take a closer look into Europe next week, as the region takes the lead in enacting strong regulation to secure data privacy flows and further national interest.</p>



<p>But, as data continues to become an increasingly important tool for national governance globally and tech companies grow in power, it is unlikely that China will back down the escalating tit-for-tat Tech Cold War. To do so would be to run counter nationalist sentiments that sustain power in not just China but, increasingly, in today’s global order.</p>

<p>Florida-based First Citrus Bank provides premier independent community banking services to individuals, professionals, executives and entrepreneurs. With 70 employees in five locations, First Citrus is ranked in the top five Tampa Bay community banks by asset size.</p>



<p>Struggling with costs, complexities and security issues with passwords, First Citrus sought to increase security and usability for its employees logging into its various systems on shared Windows workstations. After testing several alternative authentication methods, First Citrus turned to FIDO Authentication as the best option to provide strong cryptographic authentication with a much easier passwordless user experience.</p>



<p>Eliminating the password</p>



<p>First Citrus sought to move away from passwords as the primary form of authentication for its employees logging on to its systems on shared Windows workstations. Between costly resets and a negative impact on employee productivity, First Citrus’s main objective was to eliminate the need for its employees to have to enter a password while providing secure user authentication.</p>



<p>The bank evaluated several desktop authentication options including smart cards and time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), but found that these options added friction for their employees’ logins, creating a poor user experience while not providing enough additional security. All of the options they reviewed also still required password entry.</p>



<p>Taking a standards-based approach to passwordless authentication</p>



<p>First Citrus then looked to FIDO Authentication, a standards-based approach to strong authentication. The interoperability that comes with taking a standards-based approach fit well into First Citrus’s broader security strategy.</p>



<p>FIDO standards use on-device public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication over passwords and other forms of strong authentication; user credentials are never shared and never leave the user’s device. The protocols are also designed from the ground up to protect user privacy. The protocols do not provide information that can be used by different online services to collaborate and track a user across the services, and biometric information never leaves the user’s device. This is all balanced with a simple user experience that meets passwordless use cases with native biometrics on the user’s device.</p>



<p>It was important to First Citrus to choose an end-to-end FIDO Certified solution in order to roll out FIDO Authentication to all of its access points with assured security and interoperability. The bank chose to work with HYPR, which offers FIDO Certified platforms for FIDO UAF (mobile-based passwordless authentication) and FIDO2 (mobile and desktop passwordless and second-factor authentication) standards. The mixture of these FIDO specifications allows First Citrus to cover mobile and desktop requirements for user authentication.</p>



<p>Simpler, mobile-initiated authentication for all employees</p>



<p>First Citrus deployed HYPR’s FIDO platform to provide truly passwordless authentication for all of its employees logging into Windows 7 and 10 workstations. Deployment was straightforward: within an hour, the bank was able to have computers leveraging FIDO Authentication. After a several-month evaluation period, First Citrus rolled out the FIDO solution to all of its employees in February 2019.</p>



<p>For First Citrus employees, logging in is now mobile-initiated. They simply use the native biometrics on their mobile device (iOS or Android) to log in to any First Citrus desktop workstation, with far higher FIDO security and privacy over the old password model. Employee feedback has been positive; the chief financial officer has joked, “I’ve completely forgotten my password!” HYPR’s FIDO Certified platform has now become a core component of First Citrus’s internal authentication strategy, with the possibility of extending FIDO authentication options to its online banking customers in the future.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Mavennet?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mavennet.com/">Mavennet’s</a> vision is to build a new world of trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We strive to empower large enterprises with better and more effective ways to securely share information and value. We build on technologies such as blockchain and AI to help transform entire industries. Our focus extends to several industries: financial services, supply chain, energy, the public sector and media and entertainment. Our business focuses on challenging the status quo of industries that are in need for disruption, either internally or externally.</p>



 <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/"></a> 



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Identity is at the foundation of any sharing of value or information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional identity management systems are vulnerable to single points of failure, they raise privacy issues for the data they carry and limit the possibility of secure interoperability. In industries with business processes that rely on complex workflows or transactions amongst multiple stakeholders, the need for trustworthy digital identity becomes paramount.</p>



<p>At Mavennet, we are implementing decentralized identifiers to our suite of supply chain products to be able to associate a robust digital identity to actors and assets along a network. In conjunction with verifiable credentials (VCs) we&nbsp;enable cryptographically sound and privacy preserving claims that provide transparency and traceability to value chain participants. Ultimately, this trusted digital history of physical assets enables industries to have reliable provenance of goods and attribute actions to stakeholders. This addresses the most pressing pain points of global supply chains: traceability, auditability, flexibility and stakeholder management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlocking trustworthy digital identity in a way that is easy to implement in existing enterprise environments and can be readily adopted by multiple industries is crucial. It opens new pathways to emerging markets that are vulnerable to lack of trust amongst participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Mavennet address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the lack of responsiveness and flexibility of global supply chains, as evidenced by the spike in closures of manufacturing facilities and the unmet demand for basic commodities. An added concern for international trade is the rise in counterfeiting, which exceeds&nbsp;$900 billion USD annually. These threats to the security and stability of global supply chains can be in part offset by the adoption of digital identities. Their power to unlock fast, secure and trustworthy exchanges, can significantly improve the operational and business process efficiency of industries as a whole. This overhaul of internal traditional processes translates into more globally competitive businesses and positions Canada as an incrementally valuable trading partner.</p>



<p>Mavennet has been deeply involved in the space of decentralized identities and VCs&nbsp;through the deployment of an energy traceability platform that provides end-to-end visibility of assets. This solution, called Neoflow, has laid out new standards for exchange of data in the form of VCs between supply chain stakeholders by identifying them with a unique decentralized identifier. Our goal is to aid the transformation towards digital identities by providing a set of standards and APIs that enable seamless integration with other vendors with the same vision and legacy systems.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada is particularly well poised to act as a leader in this space, given its strong international voice relative to its size.</p>



<p>Canada has a unique opportunity to drive the standards for adoption at an international level, due to its position as a global emerging innovation ecosystem and technology hub. Further, as a top global exporter of crude oil, gold, wheat, aluminum and others, Canada plays a key role in the way that international trade is conducted. The country has the international relevance to coordinate and propagate digital identity initiatives.</p>



<p>5. Why did Mavennet join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Defining identity standards collaboratively is an essential step when you are looking at transforming entire industries. Up to now we have been doing work with decentralized identity and VCs standards applied to the industries we focus on. We hope to leverage our experience and vision to contribute to the work DIACC does and help raise the water level for Canadian technology as a whole.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about Mavennet?</p>



<p>We are currently working on exciting solutions for governments and multinational companies in Canada, US and Europe. The core IP of these solutions involves identity management, asset traceability, digital assets, analytics and artificial intelligence. Some of these are:</p>



  <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/solutions/neoflow/">Neoflow</a> – provides end-to-end digital traceability for energy. In particular we are working with the United States Department of Homeland Security&nbsp; to help with traceability in the oil and gas sector. Multiparty, real-time, immutable data and insights gathered by Neoflow allows governments and key stakeholders to make data-backed decisions on supply/demand, regulation policies and tariffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/solutions/metaltrail/">MetalTrail</a> – traces the steel value chain, including materials’ dependencies, to certify the true origin, quality and environmental footprint of steel products.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.mavennet.com/solutions/qcad/">QCAD</a> – is the first fully-regulated Canadian Dollar Stablecoin. This product was created through Stablecorp, a joint venture between 3iQ and Mavennet.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.mavenstamp.com/">MavenStamp</a> – seamlessly provides “immutability as a service” through an API. It enables non-technical users to timestamp data on the blockchain and obtain&nbsp; evidence of its existence.&nbsp;  



<p>Earlier this year Mavennet launched an EU sponsored multinational blockchain research project funded at $12 million CAD. Mavennet leads the consortium as the technical lead. In this way, we are excited to continue contributing to the digital identity space and to be in such a privileged company with the DIACC.&nbsp;</p>

 Daphne Keller discusses CDA 230, the executive order, and content moderation Daphne Keller (left) joined Oumou Ly (right) for the latest episode of The Breakdown.<p>In this episode of The Breakdown, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly</a> is joined by <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daphne-keller">Daphne Keller</a> of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center to discuss the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, content moderation and Big Tech platforms, and recent events that propelled them into the spotlight in recent&nbsp;months.</p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, or “The Twenty-Six Words That Created The Internet,” provides platforms legal immunity for third party speech — including by their users. It came under fire recently when President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/28/863932758/stung-by-twitter-trump-signs-executive-order-to-weaken-social-media-companies">signed an executive order </a>to limit protections for social media companies.</p><p>Read the transcript, which has been lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to the Breakdown. My name is Oumou; I’m a staff fellow on the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://www.bkmla.org/">Assembly: Disinformation program</a>. Our topic of discussion today is CDA 230, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, otherwise known as “The Twenty-Six Words That Created The Internet.” Today I’m joined by Daphne Keller from the Stanford Cyber Policy&nbsp;Center.</p><p>Thank you for being with us today Daphne, I appreciate it, especially this conversation will help to unpack what has turned out to be such a huge and maybe consequential issue for the November election and certainly for technology platforms and all of us who care and think about this information really critically.</p><p>One of the first questions I have for you is a basic one, can you tell us a little bit about CDA 230 and why it’s referred to as The Twenty Six Words That Started The Internet?</p><p>Daphne Keller (DK): Sure. So first, I strongly recommend <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501714412/the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet/">Jeff Kosseff’s book</a>, which coined that Twenty Six words phrase, it is a great history of CDA 230, and it’s very narrative.</p><p>So Intermediary Liability Law is the law that tells platforms what legal responsibilities they have for the speech and content posted by their users. And US law falls into three buckets. There’s a big bucket, which is about copyright, and there the law in point is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA, and it has this very choreographed notice and takedown&nbsp;process.</p><p>The other big bucket that doesn’t get a lot of attention is federal criminal law. There’s no special immunity for platforms for federal criminal law crimes. So if what you’re talking about is things like child sexual abuse material, material of support of terrorism, those things, the regular law applies. There is no immunity under CDA 230 or anything&nbsp;else.</p><p>And then the last big bucket, the one we’re here to talk about today is CDA 230, which was enacted in 1996 as part of a big package of legislation. Some of which was subsequently struck down by the Supreme Court, leaving CDA 230 standing as the law of the land. And it’s actually a really simple law, even though it’s so widely misunderstood that there’s now a <a href="https://twitter.com/badsec230takes?lang=en">Twitter account</a>, a Bad Section 230 Takes, just to retweet all the misrepresentations of it that come&nbsp;along.</p><blockquote>“Broadly speaking, the Internet could not exist the way we know it without something like CDA&nbsp;230”</blockquote><p>But what it says is, first, platforms are not liable for their users’ speech. Again, for the category of claims that are covered, so this isn’t about terrorism, child, sex abuse material, et cetera. But for things like state law defamation claims, platforms are not liable for their users’ speech. And the second thing it says is also platforms are not liable for acting in good faith to moderate content. So to enforce their own policies against content they consider objectionable.</p><p>And this, that second prong was very much part of what comes Congress was trying to accomplish with this law. They wanted to make sure that platforms could adopt what we now think of as terms of service or community guidelines and could enforce rules against hateful speech or bullying or pornography, or just the broad range of bad human behavior that most people don’t want to see on platforms. And the key thing that Congress realized, because they had experience with a couple of cases that had just passed that happened at the time, was that if you want platforms to moderate, you need to give them both of those immunities. You can’t just say you’re free to moderate, go do it. You have to also say, and if you undertake to moderate, but you miss something and there’s defamation… still on the platform or whatever, the fact that you tried to moderate won’t be held against&nbsp;you.</p><p>And this was really important to Congress because there had just been a case where a platform that tried to moderate was tagged as acting like an editor or a publisher and therefore facing potential liability. That’s the core of CDA 230. And I can talk more if it’s helpful about the things people get confused about, like the widespread belief that platforms are somehow supposed to be neutral, which is&nbsp;—</p><p>OL: Well, would you please say something about&nbsp;that.</p><p>DK: Yeah. Congress had this intention to get platforms to moderate. They did not want them to be neutral; they wanted the opposite. But I think a lot of people find it intuitive to say, well, it must be that platforms have to be neutral. And I think that intuition comes from a pre-Internet media environment where everything was either a common carrier, like a telephone, just interconnecting everything and letting everything flow freely. Or it was like NBC News or The New York Times — it was heavily edited, and the editor clearly was responsible for everything that the reporters put in there. And those two models don’t work for the Internet. If we still have just those two models today, we would still have only a very tiny number of elites with access to the microphone.</p><p>And everybody else would still not have the ability to broadcast our voices on things like Twitter or YouTube or whatever that we have today. And I think that’s not what anybody wants. What people generally want is they do want to be able to speak on the Internet without platform lawyers checking everything they say before it goes live. We want that. And we also — generally — also want platforms to moderate. We want them to take down offensive or obnoxious or hateful or dangerous but legal speech. And so 230 is the law that allows both of those things to happen at&nbsp;once.</p><p>OL: Okay. Daphne, can you talk a little bit about the two different types of immunity that are outlined under CDA 230 we call them shorthand (c )(1) and (c )&nbsp;(2)?</p><p>DK: Sure. So in the super shorthand, (c )(1) is immunity for leaving content up, and (c ) (2) is immunity for taking content&nbsp;down.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>DK: So most of the litigation that we’ve seen historically under the CDA is about (c )(1). It’s often really disturbing cases where something terrible happened to someone on the Internet, and a speech defaming them was left out, or speech threatening them was left up, or they continue to face things that were illegal. So those are cases about (c )(1). If the platform leaves that stuff up, are they liable? The second prong (c )(2) just hasn’t had nearly as much attention over the years until now. But that’s the one that says platforms can choose their own content moderation policy that they’re not liable for choosing to take down content they deem objectionable as long as they are acting in good&nbsp;faith.</p><p>And that’s the problem that does have this good faith requirement. And part of what the executive order attempts is to require companies to meet the good faith requirement in order to qualify for immunities. If someone can show that you are not acting in good faith, then you lose this much more economically consequential immunity under (c )(1) for contents that’s on your platform that’s&nbsp;illegal.</p><p>And the biggest concern I think for many people there is if this economically essential immunity is dependent on some government agency determining whether you acted in good faith. That introduces just a ton of room for politics because my idea of what’s good faith won’t be your idea of what’s good faith, won’t be Attorney General Barr’s idea of what’s good faith. And so having something where political appointees, in particular, get to decide what constitutes good faith and then all of your immunities hanging in the balance is really frightening for companies.</p><p>And, interestingly, today we see Republicans calling for a fairness doctrine for the Internet calling for a requirement of good faith or fairness in content moderation. But for a generation, it was literally part of the GOP platform every year to oppose the fairness doctrine that was enforced for broadcast by the FCC. President Reagan said it was unconstitutional. This was just like a core conservative critique of big government suppressing speech for decades, and now it has become their critique, and they’re asking for state regulation of platforms.</p><p>OL: That is so interesting to me, both that and the fact that CDA 230 in so many ways is what allows Donald Trump’s Twitter account to stay up. It’s really, really interesting that the GOP has decided to rail against&nbsp;it.</p><p>DK: It’s fascinating.</p><p>OL: So just recently, the president signed an executive order concerning CDA 230 pretty directly. Can you talk a little bit about what the executive order&nbsp;does?</p><p>DK: Sure. So I think I wanted to just start at a super high level with the executive order in the day or so after it came out, I had multiple people from around the world reach out to me and be like, this is like what happened in Venezuela when Chavez started shutting down the radio&nbsp;station.</p><p>It has this resonance of like, there is a political leader trying to punish speech platforms for their editorial policies. And that — before you even get into the weeds — that high-level impact of it is really important to pay attention to. And that is the reason why [the] CDT (the Center for Democracy and Technology) in DC has filed a First Amendment case saying this whole thing just can’t stand, we’ll see what happens with that&nbsp;case.</p><p>But, and there again like that’s not a bad idea, but then it leads to things in the executive order that I think don’t work. So then there are also in the executive order for other things that might be big deals. So one is that [the] DOJ has instructed to draft legislation to change 230. So eventually, that will come along, and presumably, it will track the very long list of ideas that are in the DOJ report that came out this week. [Editor’s note: this interview was recorded on June 18, 2020] A second is it instructs federal agencies to interpret 230 in the way that the executive order&nbsp;does.</p><p>This way that I think is not supported by the statute that takes the good faith requirement and applies it in places it’s not written in the statute. Nobody’s quite sure what that means because there just aren’t that many situations where federal agencies care about 230, but we’ll see what comes out of that. A third is that Attorney General Barr of the DOJ is supposed to convene state attorneys general to look at a long list of complaints. And this is like, if you look at it, if you’re an Internet policy nerd, it’s just all the hot button issues… are fact-checkers biased? Can algorithmic moderation be biased? And, well, it can. How can you regulate that? You will recognize these things if you look at the&nbsp;list.</p><p>And then the fourth one, and this is one that I think deserves a lot of attention is that DOJ is supposed to review whether platforms, particular platforms are quote problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, unquote. And then, based on that, look into whether they can carry federally funded ads. This is I think for most platforms the ads dollars part is not that big a deal, but being on a federal government block list of platforms with disapproved editorial policies, just like has this McCarthyist feeling.</p><p>OL: Can you talk a little bit about the role of CDA in relation to the business models that the platforms run?</p><p>DK: Sure. So broadly speaking, the Internet could not exist the way we know it without something like CDA 230. And that’s not just about the Facebooks of the world, that’s about everything all up and down the technical stack DNS providers, CloudFlare, Amazon Web Services is another backend web hosting. And also tons of little companies, the knitting blog that permits comments or the farm equipment seller that has user feedback. All of those are possible because of CDA 230. And if you pull CDA 230 out of the picture, it’s just very hard to imagine the counterfactual of how American Internet technology and companies would have&nbsp;evolved.</p><p>They would have evolved somehow and, presumably, the counterfactual is we would have something like what the EU has, which boils down to a notice and takedown model for every kind of legal claim. But they’d barely have an Internet economy for these kinds of companies. There’s a reason that things developed the way that they&nbsp;did.</p><p>OL: Yeah. Do you think that there’s any, maybe not what you think, but I’m sure that we can all agree this is likely to be the case, if the liability shared with that 230 offers platforms is removed, how would that change the way that platforms approach content moderation?</p><p>DK: Well, I think a lot of little companies would just get out of the business entirely. And so there’s an advocacy group in DC called Engine, which represents startups and small companies, and they put together a really interesting <a href="https://www.engine.is/news/primer/section230costs">two-pager </a>on the actual cost of defending even frivolous claims in a world with CDA 230 and in a world without CDA 230. And it’s basically, you’re looking at 10 to 30 thousand dollars in the best-case scenario for a case that goes away very, very quickly even now. And that’s not a cost that small companies want to incur. And the investors there are all these surveys of investors saying, I don’t want to invest in new platforms to challenge today’s incumbents if they’re in a state of legal uncertainty where they could be liable for something at any time. So I think you just eliminate a big swath of the parts of both the existing parts of the Internet that policymakers don’t pay any attention to.</p><p>You make them very, very vulnerable, and some of them go away, and that’s troubling, and you create a lot of problems for any newcomers who would actually challenge today’s incumbents and try to rival them in serious user-generated content hosting services.</p><p>For the big platforms, for Facebook, for YouTube they’ll survive somehow, they’d change their business model, they probably&nbsp;… the easiest thing to do is, you use their terms of service to prohibit a whole lot more and then just like take down a huge swath, so you’re not facing much legal&nbsp;risk.</p><p>OL: Yeah. It’s hard to imagine living in that kind of a&nbsp;world.</p><p>DK: It is, it&nbsp;is.</p><p>OL: Yeah. Thank you so much for joining me today, Daphne. This was a great and enlightening conversation, and I’m sure our viewers will enjoy&nbsp;it.</p><p>DK: Thank you for having&nbsp;me.</p><p>OL: Thanks.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-daphne-keller-explains-the-communications-decency-act-84c93775f3b0">The Breakdown: Daphne Keller explains the Communications Decency Act</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>2018 was a revolutionary year when it came to data privacy. The rules of GDPR came into effect, including a mandate that storage and retrieval of data be 100% irrefutable.</p>



<p>For Joisto, a well known, highly compliant, multi-tenancy electronic archive and retrieval platform, GDPR meant customers started asking if they could add another layer of trust to their archive solutions. And that was no small task as Joisto specialized in large volume, high speed management and storage of over a 1,000 data and document types with full integrity for many sectors including finance, government and utility.</p>



<p>To solve this challenge, a small team of highly skilled developers created the ultimate solution: a blockchain-enabled archive. Joisto structured the state-of-the-art Blockchain Archive so companies can get the benefits of blockchain technology while still adhering to the GDPR standards, which require a single data controller. Solving the puzzle without a DLT would not be possible; only this technology makes it possible to store immutable records while still being flexible enough to comply with regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The platform, which was launched in January, 2020, was built on Hyperledger Fabric. Working with an open source blockchain was an obvious choice as Joisto is an open source platform, too. The company also needed a framework that supports multi-tenancy and didn’t use Proof of Work, and Hyperledger Fabric fulfilled both requirements.</p>



<p>The Hyperledger team has worked closely with Joisto to capture the drivers for developing a blockchain-enabled archive solution along with the details for this white label offering that is now heading into live beta deployments through the service provider market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DIACC’s Written Submission for the Pre-Budget Consultations in Advance of the 2021 Budget</p>



<p>Ahead of the 2021 federal budget, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Committees/en/FINA/StudyActivity?studyActivityId=10877390">asked</a>&nbsp;Canadians to share their input.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DIACC is pleased to have submitted a brief, calling on the Federal Government to implement the following recommendations:&nbsp;</p>



  Secure adoption of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> by businesses and governments to ensure Canadians are well-protected and supported post-pandemic.

<p>Foreward: This is the first post of a multi-part series where we will analyze the rise of nationalism in Europe and Asia and its implications on international cooperation for digital identity and citizenship. We’ll explore why Europe and Asia have undue influence on multi-national initiatives, and lay the foundational argument for why current challenges of identity in the digital revolution are better solved with international cooperation rather than at the individual country level. And lastly, this series will conclude with understanding why the United States’ failure to establish a federal approach to data privacy, and inability of its institutions to lead the international community towards a unilateral infrastructure of interoperable and secure digital identities is prolonging these challenges.</p>



<p>Part One</p>



<p>Last week, the European Union (EU) announced that it had revoked the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ecj-invalidated-the-eu-us-privacy-71770/">Privacy Shield</a>, a transatlantic agreement that enabled the legal transfer of data between the EU and the United States (U.S.). This landmark case is the latest example of the EU’s prioritization of individual data privacy and its willingness to pressure other countries, including close allies, to comply with data privacy mandates as a requirement to conduct business.</p>



<p>And the EU is not alone in regulating operating companies in how they handle, process, and maintain data. According to the United Nations, 132 of 194, or roughly 66&nbsp;<a href="https://unctad.org/en/Pages/DTL/STI_and_ICTs/ICT4D-Legislation/eCom-Data-Protection-Laws.aspx">percent</a>, of countries around the world have put laws in place to protect their citizen’s data. South and East Asia (including China), is another region following the trend of increased data protection and sovereignty laws.</p>



 

 



<p>Southeast Asia is the most rapidly growing region,<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/DA/WEO"> in terms of GDP</a>, in the world. Countries in this region recognize how attractive their large customer bases are to foreign investment. As a result, <a href="https://theaseanpost.com/article/data-localisation-southeast-asia">China, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam</a> have responded with data localization laws that prevent individual data from leaving their physical borders, and <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/01/24/amazon-web-services-to-build-data-centers-in-jakarta-minister.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Web%20Services%20(AWS)%20will,high%2Dranking%20official%20has%20said.">force companies to store data locally</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, countries in this region are also introducing personal data privacy regulations. In May of this year, for example, the National People’s Congress introduced a draft data privacy bill to parliament that seeks to bolster the country’s formal position on individual privacy rights and protect valuable <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/land-big-data-china-sets-individual-privacy-rights-200526052444041.html#:~:text=China%20back%20to%20business%20as%20National%20People's%20Congress%20meets&amp;text=Data%20collectors%20have%20a%20duty,consent%2C%20according%20to%20the%20draft.">consumer data from being misused by foreign companies</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This demand for individual privacy rights in China was fueled by a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-lawmaking-privacy/in-land-of-big-data-china-sets-individual-privacy-rights-idUSKBN2320EF?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWmpNNE5XTmtNakpsT1RCaSIsInQiOiJJWWtkK1RLczVwMDBXajFTbHAwa2hcL0lCc1pzOTZYSGVod2FYQUJjNXpzdkd4Vk9ub2paVU5mUmZwT0kzZUJpYU1XWVluZitEY1JDcFFFb2pKNXZFblZxMG1kaG0yTkVINTM5a2FuQXl0SkNKOXk1Q0w5UnlWaE5JTjF0YWg4V0YifQ%3D%3D">2017 case where 42 people</a> sued Amazon for wrongful damages associated with a data breach from earlier that year. Yanming, one of the lawsuit participants, lost <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-lawmaking-privacy/in-land-of-big-data-china-sets-individual-privacy-rights-idUSKBN2320EF?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWmpNNE5XTmtNakpsT1RCaSIsInQiOiJJWWtkK1RLczVwMDBXajFTbHAwa2hcL0lCc1pzOTZYSGVod2FYQUJjNXpzdkd4Vk9ub2paVU5mUmZwT0kzZUJpYU1XWVluZitEY1JDcFFFb2pKNXZFblZxMG1kaG0yTkVINTM5a2FuQXl0SkNKOXk1Q0w5UnlWaE5JTjF0YWg4V0YifQ%3D%3D">247,000 Yuan</a> as part of an elaborate phishing scam that he fell victim to because assailants possessed his personal details. However, this lawsuit failed twice in Chinese courts because there was no precedent that established data privacy as a protected right.&nbsp;</p>



 

 



<p>As we are moving into a world where data privacy and sovereignty regulations are the new norm, our OWI analysis identified both the positive and negative implications of our new reality.</p>



<p>On one hand, the advent of increased governance over technology providers has potential benefits. Countries are exerting more defensive barriers to stimulate growth of local businesses, while forcing foreign companies to protect and secure the personal data of their citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, digital identity is a challenge that is best solved through collaboration. When I started at OWI three years ago, our digital identity thesis was that private-sector products and services had developed in silos. This unfortunate series of events resulted in industry-specific identity products and services that were, for all intents and purposes, the same underlying process and technology with product marketing nuances that drove a false sense of differentiation. Our mission, to this day, is to try and break down those figurative walls and support the community in building products that made digital services more accessible for more people and, hopefully, less confusing in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rise of nationalism, manifesting through data privacy regulations, has the potential to stifle the international community’s headway towards a unilateral approach to digital identity, and reinforcing a siloed approach that many experts have been fighting so hard to rectify in the private sector. Should the world prioritize individual data privacy as a fundamental human right and prevent big tech monopolies from taking advantage of an individual’s personal information? Or should we prioritize interoperable digital identity solutions at the network or application layer of the internet to facilitate efficient access to goods and services across borders? Maybe there is a balance between the two? Stay tuned.</p>

   I think the best way that Me2B could help these kind of dialogues would be to demarcate between ‘things that I don’t want to happen around the sharing of my data’ (the defence), and ‘things that I do want to happen when sharing my data’ (the offence).

   I think the best way that Me2B could help these kind of dialogues would be to demarcate between ‘things that I don’t want to happen around the sharing of my data’ (the defence), and ‘things that I do want to happen when sharing my data’ (the offence).  <br>  The word and most of the conversations about privacy are really focused on the former; the defence. Privacy as a word is not well set up to deal with the things I do want to happen. Layer onto that, the information sharing is a fundamental human need that we cannot and should not try to avoid. What we need to do is that offence stack; ie when I want or have to share information (which is many times per day), how do I make sure that happens in a good way, rather than one which acts as a parasite on ones needs to share.  <br>  It is almost impossible to bridge the two major subject areas with the one word without losing the subtlety. In that respect, I for one rarely use the word ‘privacy’ if I can help it. That is also the reason why the original Kantara workgroup in our space was called ‘Information Sharing’; we wanted to build tools that enable information sharing to be done in a good way; as opposed to tools that would seek to prevent or limit sharing.  <br>  Hope that makes sense.  <br>  Apologies, I won’t make the Good Cops call today.  <br>  Iain&nbsp;  <br>

<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched a new microsite,&nbsp;<a href="https://loginwithfido.com/">LoginWithFIDO.com</a>, for high level, non-technical information about FIDO for consumers and service providers.</p>



<p>As part of this project, we wanted to learn more about consumer attitudes and habits around authentication. What are their password habits? What do they think about the FIDO approach? Do they want to see FIDO at login?</p>



<p>To find out, we conducted a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers, and created a research report.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: For the background information on the 2020 Hackathon in Korea, see the April blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-goodbye-password-challenge-in-korea/">2020 FIDO Hackathon: Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea</a>.”&nbsp; To learn more about examples of proposed development ideas, please read the June blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-in-korea-learn-implement-phase/">2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea: Learn &amp; Implement Phase</a>.”</p>



<p>In the afternoon of July 1st, 2020, a Mid-Term Meetup Event for FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge was held at Telecommunication Technology Association (TTA). Originally, the Hackathon Steering Committee had planned a full-day onsite final implementation and evaluation day, followed by a month and a half online training phase.&nbsp; Due to the global pandemic, we had to change our schedules in accordance with school calendar disruptions and summer holidays. We decided to have a half-day mid-term meetup event for participants. This allowed us to help the teams to stay on course while providing a safe environment for people to learn from each other face-to-face.</p>







<p>Nineteen different teams participated in the event, half of them face-to-face with strict public health guidance applied, and the other half virtually. The meeting gave opportunities for teams to share their FIDO protocol-based online service development ideas and current development status, learn from each other and receive valuable feedback from FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members.</p>







<p>In addition to sharing their projects’ current development status, the teams had the opportunity to present the “homework” they have completed after online training.&nbsp; The homework was writing a simple article on the web, with answers to the following questions:</p>



  What is FIDO Alliance?  What are the FIDO protocols?  What are the benefits of implementing FIDO protocols?  (Option) What services/products are you developing for the 2020 FIDO Hackathon and what would be the value of adopting FIDO protocols for online authentication?  



<p>We were very pleased with the articles we received. You can read examples (mostly in Korean) by visiting these following links:</p>



  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/yeocw3/222029532562">No matter how passwords are complicated, they are not safe!&nbsp; Learn FIDO concepts</a>  <a href="https://pongdang-pooh.tistory.com/9">FIDO Authentication: Good security knowledge to learn while you are quarantined at home</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/owjs3901/222030081852">2020 FIDO Hackathon Homework – My Plan to Develop FIDO Based IoT Solution for Home</a>  <a href="https://blog.naver.com/lcwlyw/222032889174">FIDO – New technology standard to solve problems with IDs and Passwords&nbsp;</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/woojim11/222011830343">Let’s learn about FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>  <a href="https://codstice.tistory.com/78">Summary on FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>

The Financial-grade API (FAPI) tests have been Java-based since early 2019 and now we are preparing to finish transitioning the OpenID Connect tests to the Java-based conformance test suite on Monday, August 31, 2020, at which point we plan to decommission the existing Python-based conformance suite. See <a href="https://openid.net/certification/migration/">https://openid.net/certification/migration/</a> for details on the migration.</p>
<p>If you are currently testing your OpenID Connect implementations, please note this transition date and migrate your testing from the Python-based suite to the Java-based suite prior to that. If you are considering testing your OpenID Connect implementations, please include the transition date in your planning.</p>
<p>The transition to a single code base for the conformance test suite will enable the Foundation to more efficiently manage the program and add new profiles for testing. Thank you to those community members who have assisted in “testing the tests” and helping us reach this important milestone in the Certification Program’s history.</p>

 Overview 



<p>Over the past quarter, the Hyperledger Besu team has been hard at work improving performance across many fronts, from adding support for native encryption libraries to tuning our EVM execution code, experimenting with different different JVMs and building more robust benchmarking infrastructure. This has resulted in performance improvements across sync times, transactions per second and requests per second.<br><br>We are excited to share these results as well as the details of future work we have planned around stability and performance.&nbsp;</p>



 Native Encryption Libraries 



<p>When writing Hyperledger Besu (back when it was called Pantheon), we had a principle that the code had to be correct first. If the execution of a block was wrong, it didn’t matter how fast it was because we would fall out of consensus. Combine this with the complexity and specificity of encryption software, and any attempts to optimize performance could have a destructive effect on the whole project if we got even one corner case wrong.&nbsp; To avoid this, we used mostly pre-existing Java-based cryptography implementations.</p>



<p>Starting in Besu 1.4.2, we shifted our model to use external non-Java or “native” encryption (specifically, external libraries called through native OS calling conventions). This opened us up to a large swath of optimized implementations. The first library we added was secp256k1(AKA the Bitcoin Elliptic Curve). This library is heavily used throughout Ethereum, often invoked multiple times in each transaction. The implementation we use is Bitcoin Core’s optimized library (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1">https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1</a>). It is mostly written in C but also features a handwritten assembly loop in the “hottest” parts of the calculation. The second library we use is for the altbn128 curve, a precompiled contract that has seen a significant uptick in use as Eth2 testnets have started popping up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, Hyperledger Besu supports both the native versions and pure Java versions, so they are still usable if a native library isn’t compiled for your target device. We split these specific libraries out into a standalone package to simplify the process of building and packaging them for the various platforms on which they must run. They can be accessed on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-native">https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-native</a>).</p>



<p>This change has led to a noticeable speedup in fast syncing times (and transactions per second, but more on that below!), especially for networks where secp256k1 verification takes a significant part of the sync time, such as testnets or networks with lots of empty blocks. For example, this change reduced our fast sync time on Goerli by 13%, from 92 minutes (Besu 1.4.0) to 80 minutes (Besu 1.5 RC2). The full sync speedup (processing every transaction and storing every block state) was even larger: a 1,571% improvement, from just over six days (Besu 1.4.0) to just over nine hours (Besu 1.5.0)!</p>



 EVM Implementation Optimizations 



<p>Another place we improved performance is in our pure Java implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).&nbsp; There are three significant improvements of note:</p>



  We simplified our exceptional halt detection with simpler language constructs,&nbsp;  We flattened out a series of three calls into one call and removed a lot of duplicate calculations along the way, and&nbsp;  We adopted some low-level optimizations that we upstreamed to Apache Tuweni 1.1.  



<p>To determine where we needed to perform these optimizations, we used a combination of a handwritten tool and off-the-shelf profilers. The Besu community uses a mix of the VisualVM, Java Flight Recorder/Mission Control, and YourKit profilers (provided to Besu under their Open Source Licencing program – <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/README.md#special-thanks">https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/README.md#special-thanks</a>).</p>



<p>We then pointed those profilers at a tool we built called “EVMTool” <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/master/ethereum/evmtool">https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/master/ethereum/evmtool</a>) that was initially written to support cross-client fuzz testing of EVM smart contracts. With very slight modifications, we were able to turn it into a repeated EVM executor. Setting the repetitions up to an absurdly high number, we could point our profiler of choice at the EVM and get some longer term performance numbers. This revealed a large amount of unneeded copying of byte arrays, duplicate calculations, and inefficient call structures.</p>



<p>When compared to 1.4.2, our EVM evaluations (i.e., “gas per second”) have now improved from 78-220% depending on the specific contract structure and state size, with all but one benchmark showing over 100% improvement. While we don’t have raw measurements, we suspect this change is also partially responsible for the sync times improvements mentioned earlier.</p>



 GraalVM 



<p>Since Besu runs on top of Java, we have access to the full range of Java Virtual Machines.&nbsp; Previously, we have recommended OpenJDK 11 as it is a known and stable version of the JVM with many downstream distributions (Corretto, AdoptOpenJDK, Zulu).</p>



<p>Recently we’ve started testing with GraalVM (<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">https://www.graalvm.org/</a>), a JVM implementation that is Oracle’s successor to the HotSpot JVM that’s been at the core of Java for over two decades. It is also at the core of several new projects such as Micronaut and Quarkus. While it has lots of fancy features (such as Ruby support, experimental WASM support, native image generation, AOT compilation), it offers several significant performance advantages while remaining a drop in replacement for the JDK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just dropping in GraalVM Community Edition 20.1 without any additional JVM tuning resulted in a 14% increase in our TPS numbers, from roughly 350 to 400 smart contract calls per second.&nbsp; All the other fancy features it will bring along in the future is just icing on the cake.</p>



 Transactions Per Second (TPS) 



<p>As mentioned in the prior section, we have seen great improvement to Hyperledger Besu’s TPS numbers in a private chain setting. All in all, our efforts have moved us from 300 TPS on Besu 1.4.0 to 350 for Besu 1.5 and 400 TPS when&nbsp; using GraalVM. In order to get repeatable measurements for our TPS improvements, we worked with <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/caliper">Hyperledger Caliper</a>, another project under the Hyperledger umbrella to benchmark our numbers across various Besu versions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The network we used was composed of five nodes. Four of these were validators, and the only non-validator node was used as an RPC node. One of the validator nodes was designated for use as a bootnode.</p>



<p>The network used IBFT 2.0 as its consensus algorithm with a two second block time, an epoch length of 30,000, and a 10 second request timeout value. A very high block gas limit of 672,000,000 was set, and blocks were monitored to be sure that this gas limit was not saturated. The function called to benchmark TPS numbers was a “register” transaction from one of LACChain’s registry contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this was set up using Ansible playbooks we had developed to launch Besu instances.&nbsp;</p>



 Requests Per Second (RPS)&nbsp; 



<p>Another area where we saw notable improvements was in Hyperledger Besu’s handling of JSON RPC requests. Using ethspam (<a href="https://github.com/shazow/ethspam">https://github.com/shazow/ethspam</a>), a library that generates realistic read-only JSON RPC queries to bombard a node with, we saw an 64% improvement in Besu’s request-per-second performance. On version 1.4.0, when sent 100,000 requests, Besu could answer on average 5242.39 per second. Using the 1.5.0 release, that number was up to 8632.75. Even better results were obtained using GraalVM on Besu 1.5.0, with RPS reaching 8988.59, an increase of 71% over the 1.4.0 release!<br><br>For our RPS benchmarks, we used Versus (<a href="https://github.com/INFURA/versus">https://github.com/INFURA/versus</a>), a tool developed by Infura, which can compare the RPS performance across various Ethereum node implementations and, of course, Infura itself.&nbsp;</p>



 Stay Tuned 



<p>While the Hyperledger Besu team is pleased with the progress made, we are continuing to focus on performance and, over the coming months, will make it one of our main priorities for the codebase. Specifically, along with continuing to fine tune various parts of the codebase, we will begin major refactors of two areas of the codebase: the peer-to-peer (P2P) layer and the database.<br><br>Besu’s P2P layer has grown and been extended significantly over the past few releases with the addition of privacy, permissioning and various other improvements. It is now time to take a step back to redesign it so that it is maximally stable and performs well. We’ll also be looking to add even more new functionality, such as enabling the new eth/65 version of the eth networking protocol.<br><br>On the database side, the Ethereum mainnet’s growing state size has made database access reading and writing state&nbsp; a major performance bottleneck. Over the next few months, the Besu team will be experimenting with a new database format that is designed to be more performant for networks with large state sizes. The first “feature” coming out of this work should enable users to more easily backup and restore their network’s state, providing an offline disaster recovery backup.<br><br>Stay tuned!</p>

<p>We interviewed Dia Banerji, one of our UK Ambassadors, to find out more about her passion for innovation and technology.</p>
 What gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Dia Banerji
<p>I am passionate about the power of innovative technology &amp; its potential in creating a better world. As an individual, I enjoy solving problems with technology solutions. I consider myself to be fortunate to be able to pursue my passion in the work I do.</p>
<p>I am the founder of ID4V. It is an early stage start-up focused on building a platform to enable Self Sovereign Digital Identity for Cross-Border Travel Visa Applications using Blockchain Technology. ID4V aims to address the inefficiency in our travel visa application system which affects millions of people around the world. Very few experiences in life can be compared to the joy of creation. I am thrilled to be on this journey.</p>
<p>I also work as a Consultant to the Blockpass identity Lab at Edinburgh Napier University where I advise on commercialization of emerging technology. I help identify industry applications for Blockchain &amp; Privacy Preserving Machine Learning research. Every day I spend at the lab I learn something new. I am surrounded by brilliance and get to work with innovative cutting-edge research. It is truly inspiring.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting time to be in Identity. We are creating a gateway to access the digital economy. What we build today &amp; how we build it, will shape our future. My work in Identity allows me to be part of this incredible evolution.</p>
<p>Roosevelt once said “Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.” To me, working in Identity as an Entrepreneur and a Professional is work worth doing and I love it!</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>The short answer would be ‘CURIOSITY’!</p>
<p>Prior to embarking a career in the technology sector, I spent over fifteen years in the financial services industry and worked for some of the top global banks in the world. Around 2016, within my fraternity there was a lot of noise about Bitcoin. Most of my peers and friends who were in Financial Services were naysayers and opposed Bitcoin with the utmost passion. Wall street greats like Warren Buffet famously called Bitcoin ‘Rat Poison Squared’! This got me curious. I wanted to learn more about Bitcoin to be able to figure out where I stood on the debate. This pursuit led me to studying Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies. I was amazed with the potential of this technology in solving real world problems. I wanted to be part of it. So, I pivoted my career to outlining use cases for Blockchain especially within Financial Services sector. And in that journey, I came to narrow my focus on Digital Identity and got to where I am today.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson that I learned was not to be intimidated by the things I did not know and appreciate the value of stepping outside my comfort zone. I was a financial service professional before I entered the world of Technology and Digital Identity. I have an MBA and not a computer science degree. There will always be somethings that we do not know and that is absolutely fine! Especially when one is working within the Identity Industry which is constantly changing and new standards are being incubated as we speak. Knowledge has a way of demystifying complex concepts. And once you understand something in depth you are no longer intimidated by it. The key thing is to never stop learning. And one of the most enjoyable aspects of my work is that I get to learn something new all the time. This to me this is both inspiring and empowering.</p>
 What should leaders in identity start, stop and continue – and why? 
<p>The concept of identity has been broadly accepted as a fundamental human right. A legal identity enables individuals to participate in society and have access to rights and services. It is a prerequisite to financial &amp; social inclusion.</p>
<p>Identity management is a global problem. The current system does not scale and is in much need for disruption. For, those of us in the developed world we are plagued with inefficiencies of legacy systems, data privacy breaches &amp; leaks leading to trust issues with central authorities. For the citizens of the developing nations many are denied access to financial &amp; social services for lack of verifiable identity. According to World Bank, it is estimated that approximately one billion people across the world do not have access to an officially recognizable identity!</p>
<p>As the world transitions to a digital economy we need to have a more secure, scalable, interoperable and citizen focused digital identity management solutions to ensure inclusion.</p>
<p>So, my advice to the CEO’s in the identity space would be the following:</p>
<p>START: Collaborating with one another and build solutions and platforms which are interoperable. Have diverse teams within the organisation so that the solutions reflect the wider needs of society. Both are imperative for mass adoption!</p>
<p>STOP: Building centralized identity management solutions! Be citizen focused and build applications on the principles of self-sovereign digital identity. Allow individuals to own, control and manage the distribution of their personal identity. This is essential to be able to build scalable and secure systems with no central point of failure and reduce risk of data theft.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: Identifying new uses cases for Identity management solutions and apply innovative technologies to enhance efficiency and security of applications. Digital Identity is a relatively new industry and is constantly changing. We need to continue to fund new research and explore new use cases. This is crucial, for the creation of robust digital identity management platforms for the future.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>I have always looked to nature to find order and to me diversity is the purest form of natural existence and the only way to live and thrive in this world.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>I would recommend the film, The Matrix. It is a beautiful film and the script is almost Shakespearean. If one sees beyond the action-packed computer graphics there is a deep spiritual message and a tale about the constant strife between ignorance and enlightenment faced by mankind. Like most great works of art, it leaves you questioning. Definitely worth a watch!</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>I would advise my teenage self to be ‘fearless’ and ‘take chances’. In order to walk the path that no one has ever walked before requires one to be brave and follow one’s gut. Greatness is seldom achieved by being careful. So, go ‘ALL IN’ and follow your passion and don’t seek external validation. Believe in yourself!</p>

<p>Esme Wardhaugh interviewed Janelle Riki-Waaka, for an interesting discussion on the digital identity sphere.</p>
 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Janelle Riki-Waaka
<p>As Queen Whitney says, I believe the children are our future, teach them well and let them lead the way! Cheesy I know but no truer words were spoken. I am so privileged to work with educators and support them in their professional learning needs.</p>
<p>Education systems world wide originated from the need to prepare kids for the workforce. In the industrial era this meant reflecting the work conditions they would eventually go into – large warehouses became classrooms and the smoko bell became the school bell. In terms of education for young girls, it was often crafted around antiquated expectations of a ‘woman’s work’. In terms of education for indigenous kids, this was primarily designed to assimilate them into the dominant culture. This practice was considered to be ‘in their best interests’ and would ensure a more ‘fair’ and just society for all. The education system wasn’t designed to empower indigenous kids to be deeply connected to their language, identity and culture and we are still feeling the ramifications of the trauma that this caused for indigenous people across the world. Until we actively start to redress that trauma, we will continue to experience inequity in its most harmful forms.</p>
<p>So what gets me out of bed in the morning? It’s the responsibility I feel to be a voice for those indigenous kids who are continuing to experience inequity in our education system. It’s the understanding I have through my own learned experiences that our kids rely on us to be their allies, their advocates and their cheerleaders. They deserve to walk into schools and be empowered to be who and what they are and be secure in the knowledge that they are surrounded by adults who are working really hard to know better and do better.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Pure determination to prove people wrong! I hated the stereotypes about Māori women so becoming a single mother in my early 20’s lit a fire in me to push as hard as I could against those stereotypes and become more than what society expected of me. I worked really hard and I leaned into my support network. I read and learned and listened to people that inspired me and I set goals and just ticked them off one at a time. I went from a high school failure and a young single mother, to a self sufficient, empowered woman with a Masters Degree. At the start of my journey the degree was my aspiration and I was fuelled by wanting to prove a point. But the real reward for me was the self assurance that I could in fact achieve anything I dared to dream about.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Gosh so many! I think the most valuable lesson for me was to learn to trust my gut. Over the years I have come to realize that female intuition is probably the most powerful tool in our arsenal! I’m not referring to that little voice in our head that is most often our harshest critic, I’m talking about that gut feeling you get right when you need to get it! Looking back over things you can often remember a time when your gut warned you this was the wrong path. Or it screamed at you to just have faith. When things are tough in my world and I can’t see the wood for the trees, I always try to block out the noise and tune into my female intuition to allow it to guide me on my journey.</p>
 What’s your advice to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>STOP considering only your learned perspective of what identity is. There are so many diverse definitions of identity and it’s important we don’t narrow the lens here. It would be dangerous to assume there is one definition of identity and even more dangerous to assume the western world view is the correct one! We need to allow diverse perspectives of identity to inform our practice for the future as one size will definitely not fit all and it’s too important to get wrong.</p>
<p>START educating people about digital identity. If you work in this space you might be forgiven for assuming everyone understands it but I assure you this is far from the case. Education should empower people to make informed choices and we must be careful not to educate through fear. We need to start to look at how we can educate our kids about their digital identity and integrate this important knowledge into school curriculum.</p>
<p>CONTINUE exploring alternative ways, processes and perspectives. You know what they say true collaboration is – it’s about the ideas that don’t exist until you get everyone in the room! So as you are continuing to explore innovative solutions to new emerging challenges ask yourselves this – who’s voice is missing in the conversation. And then go engage with those missing voices. They may just have the very solution you’ve been searching for.</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to allow diverse perspectives of identity to inform our practice for the future as one size will definitely not fit all and it’s too important to get wrong.</p></blockquote>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Because everyone should feel important and valued for who they are.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>The Whale Rider is an amazing book by Witi Ihimaera and the film is phenomenal. It gives a great insight into the Māori culture and practices and it’s a go to for me when I need a reminder about having faith and trusting my intuition. It also explores a Māori perspective on identity and the importance of understanding indigenous world views and practices.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Have faith, be present and take it easy on yourself! You’re loved and strong and trust me, it’s all coming to you.</p>

<p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.simbachain.com/">SIMBA Chain</a> was awarded one of the very first DARPA Small Business Innovation Research contracts for blockchain on secure messaging. Dr. Ian Taylor, our CTO, has spent years in distributed computing, but, at the time, Ian and I knew very little of blockchain. I had done some Bitcoin mining in the early years, but had no experience with smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the contract, Adam Brinckman, a senior research programmer at the Center for Research Computing at the University of Notre Dame, wrote the chaincode (the “smart contract”) for an application enabling military agencies to create military interdepartmental purchase requests (MIPR transactions) on a privately shared Hyperledger Fabric distributed ledger for our project with DARPA. The goal of this project was to securely provide full traceability of all provisions as they were awarded through a very complicated procurement process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The initial solution sought to take advantage of the tools provided by Hyperledger, which included&nbsp; Hyperledger Composer, an interface designed to help developers define assets written to the ledger. However, as we developed the application, we were challenged by the sheer complexity of the MIPR acquisition process. The numerous ways in which transactions could be modeled and the different ways each agency had defined MIPR assets presented major challenges. It would be difficult to capture the problem correctly using a written piece of chaincode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We realized quickly that we needed to build an auto-generated smart contract and API based on the assets and transactions to help simplify and capture this entire process. This proved to be a good solution for the challenges we faced. Over time, we developed this solution into a tool that would allow low code enthusiasts and business analysts to utilize blockchain and create adoption outside the normal community of interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rest is history. We went on, and continue, to build solutions for the Department of Energy, the United States Navy, Air Force, and USMC, all utilizing Hyperledger Fabric. Many of these solutions are around supply chain traceability, provenance, risk mitigation, sustainability, and lifecycle management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hyperledger Fabric was the DLT platform of choice because it provides the following:</p>



  Open source!  Supply chain specific capabilities&nbsp;  High throughput  Permissioned membership  Scalability  Levels of trust  Data on a “need to know” basis  Rich queries  Architecture that supports plugins  Protection of keys and sensitive data  Integration with the Fabric EVM that allows us to write Solidity-based smart contracts  



<p>Our extensive work with Hyperledger Fabric and smart contracts has given us the expertise to contribute back to the development effort. Adam recently collaborated with Fabric developers working on the Fabric EVM chaincode to fix a minor bug. The exact problem occurred when attempting to use the Fab3 proxy with web3 python libraries (web3.py). Unlike its JavaScript counterpart, web3.py enforces all input data to conform to Ethereum’s yellow paper specifications, and data returned by Fab3 was failing these validations. Fab3 isn’t the only service that fails these validations; Quorum and other private EVM implementations also fail validation due to the extra bytes they pack into transactions and blocks. Tapping into his experience as an Ethereum Solidity developer, Adam worked with Hyperledger’s development community to make Fab3 compatible with web3.py’s strict validation rules and added new regression tests to ensure that future releases remain compatible.</p>



<p>Adam also developed a <a href="https://info.simbachain.com/hubfs/User-Guide-Install-Hyperledger-Fabric-2.1-EVM.pdf">guide for deploying Fabric EVM onto Hyperledger Fabric v2.1</a>. The official documentation shows examples for installing Fabric EVM onto a 1.4 network so this guide will help developers transition their Fabric EVM chaincode as they begin to upgrade their network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a firm that has benefited from open source development of Hyperledger Fabric and other tools, we recognize the value of contributed code and expertise. We’ve been able to build Hyperledger-powered solutions that add the efficiency and effectiveness of key government services and want to help drive more open source innovation in the blockchain space. We encourage others to get involved.

  Great points. <br>  Some of us here know people on the inside of CRM, CX, customer service and related corporate work—or are there ourselves. What I'm hearing from them is that these fields find themselves in a moment when, finally, they are beginning to realize that the B's need to engage Me's who are independently equipped to deal with B's at scale using tools and methods of their own.&nbsp;  <br>  The B's are also coming to realize that Push isn't enough, and that Pull isn't the whole story on the Me's side. There is also what happens&nbsp;after&nbsp;the sale. Which, by the way, is nearly all the experience we, as me's, have with what we buy. As Estaban Kolsky puts it, the customer journey isn't just one circular cycle. It's a figure-8: a buy cycle and an own cycle. And the latter is far larger, for all of us.&nbsp;  <br>  We visited this at some length on the ProjectVRM blog back in 2013, in&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2013/07/13/turning-the-customer-journey-into-a-virtuous-cycle/">Turning the customer journey into a&nbsp;virtuous cycle</a>. As we see now, it was at least seven years ahead of its time.  <br>  But the time is now. Finally.&nbsp;  <br>  I think it is especially helpful, now that the time is here, to move past the selling frame where adtech and all the bad acting around personal information happens.  <br>  We're making a new future here, where Me's have new power and B's have new contexts and ways of relating to and respecting the Me's of the world. Let's model that, discuss that, organize that, certify that.&nbsp;  <br>  I'd say more but dinner awaits...  <br>  Doc  <br>  <br> <br>

<p>As we pointed out in <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/07/31/iot-deployment-tutorial-part-i-deploying-hyperledger-besu-to-support-hardware-layer">part I of this series</a>, the days when hardware and software were separate entities are long gone. Along with the ongoing worldwide digitization and digitalization, the integration between the virtual and physical worlds is getting stronger – making the Internet of Things (IoT) a real thing. Going further, we can leverage blockchain features like data immutability, distributed character, and exploit the smart contracts it offers to connect it with IoT applications to build a trusted and all-inclusive solution. We’ve created a two-part tutorial to showcase how to deploy and connect all the pieces. In <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Deployment+of+Private+Hyperledger+Besu+on+AWS+with+hardware+layer+for+Externally+Owned+Account">part I of our tutorial</a>, we set up a private Hyperledger Besu network and configured a Raspberry Pi to sign transactions with its own keys. We used this to write a Python program, hosted on Raspberry, sending Ether to other participants of the network. The final solution used quite a broad technological stack: Terraform, Amazon Web Services, MetaMask, and, finally, Raspberry Pi. In <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Ratified+Smart+Contract+for+Constrained+Delivery+with+Oraclized+Data">part II</a>, we don’t want to lower the bar, so here we add some extra technological stack on the top of what we had.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Scenario&nbsp; 



<p>Let us consider a contract between a supplier and a buyer. They both agree on some delivery time, conditions, pick up and drop off locations, and, of course, the price the buyer is willing to pay. Among the conditions, they can agree on some penalty for delayed delivery or that the parcel couldn’t be exposed to a temperature higher than some threshold longer than X minutes. While the delivery time can be verified, the monitoring of the second condition is not that easy to verify. Even if we suspect that the temperature threshold has been exceeded (because, for example, the delivered food is spoiled), how can we prove that transport conditions were inappropriate?</p>



<p>In part II, <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Ratified+Smart+Contract+for+Constrained+Delivery+with+Oraclized+Data">Ratified Smart Contract for Constrained Delivery with Oraclized Data</a>, we created an automated solution covering the entire supply process, including:</p>



  publishing the delivery offer with specified conditions,&nbsp;  acceptance of the conditions by contractor,&nbsp;  starting the delivery by an authorized person (using personalized hardware signature),&nbsp;  monitoring the delivery temperature and contract voiding conditions, confirming the delivery, and&nbsp;  calculating the final payment for the supplier.&nbsp;  



<p>To achieve this, we take advantage of the Hyperledger Besu network that was deployed in part I and now write a smart contract on the top of it that handles the delivery operations.</p>



 Overview 



<p>In the full tutorial, we detail all the steps to designing a smart contract for the presented delivery use case. To do this, we use web-based Remix IDE as an environment for contract development while the contract itself is written in the Vyper language. We opted for this pythonic language for the simplicity and readability of its code. Once the contract is developed, we show how to test the deployment to verify that all the functionalities are working correctly.</p>



<p>Further, we go through the steps required to use the hardware signature (contained in the smart card) to sign the transaction, to configure the temperature sensor and measure the current value of the temperature, and, finally, to integrate all the parts into one program that will serve as “delivery starter” and “temperature measurement provider.”</p>



<p>Our tutorial covers a very concrete use case, and it is only the tip of the iceberg. There’s much more, and the possibilities are endless. We hope that this tutorial will give you the thrill to build your own blockchain application. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us!</p>

 Aakash Solanki, Sandeep Mertia &amp; Rashmi&nbsp;M  Session <p>The session intends to initiate a discussion on digital literacies in the wake of ‘Digital India’ programme drawing on the empirical insights from three different field situations. The discussion will be anchored in the social and material context of Digital India but will not be limited to it. The questions we raise in this specific context may be extended to understand the current conceptual as well as practical deployment of many ICT4D programmes as envisioned by both government and non-government actors. The idea of digital literacy is central to both the conceptualization and the execution of such programmes, and the actors in charge work with their own understanding of the context and needs of the people they aim to empower. There have been very few attempts to systematically understand the concept of digital literacy which leave much scope for either lenient contextual interpretations or context insensitive one-size-fits-all approach towards technological interventions. This session is an effort to begin one such discussion which we hope will refine the prevalent understanding of digital literacy/literacies in&nbsp;India.</p><p>From a glance at the structure of Digital India programme, it is apparent that the programme is designed to achieve digital inclusion and is primarily directed towards the digitally marginalized in spite of having a more comprehensive agenda. The schemes such as National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM) and the way they are conceived are indexical of the kind of target groups which the programme plans to address. A key concern for us is to think through the mismatches between the frameworks of the digital literacy initiatives and the local socio-technical contexts which we observed in our field sites. The objective of the session is not as much to arrive at the definitional fixity of the concept of digital literacy as it is to complicate and problematize the prevalent definitions of digital literacy implicit in both visualization and execution of such initiatives. We plan to meet this objective through empirical insights we have on three different field&nbsp;sites.</p><p>The session will also focus on certain methodological questions that might help us better understand digital literacy. This part of the session addresses questions such as: how can we conceptually define digital literacy/literacies? What parameters should go into the measuring of digital literacy? How should we theoretically understand it — as technical skills or knowledge or some higher cognitive ability? How can we best pedagogically achieve it given the complexity of ground reality? The questions will be directed towards encouraging thought in this area rather than providing answers. The session will also try and discuss various kinds of policy and pedagogical documentation available on digital literacy and critically debate their conceptualization and execution by juxtaposing them against various uses of ICTs on the ground by specific groups of users. This part of the discussion will draw upon scholarly and other kinds of documentation available on the topic and use them to evaluate various government and corporate initiatives to achieve digital literacy in&nbsp;India.</p> Plan <p>In keeping with the spirit of the conference, the three discussants’ will try to put forth empirical insights from their respective field situations and frame nuanced research and discussion questions on digital literacies at the margins of techno-cultural capital and/or access. Further the discussion will be aided by specific readings and the insights drawn from them. The idea is to have a symmetrical, reciprocatory and anthropologically comparative conversation on questions of technology, materiality, access, meaning making, development and literacy, by moving back and forth between different fieldsites and interpretive frameworks.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;I</p><p>The first discussant’s work on social media use in rural Rajasthan discusses socio-technical changes instituted by the introduction of ICTs despite their developmental failures. He claims that these changes have been often viewed from technologically or socially deterministic positions and that there are significant empirical gaps between such technocratic discourses and the grassroots experiences of technology. There is a growing usage of social and digital media in rural areas where ICT4D and e-Governance pilot projects have failed to meet their goals. Based on an ethnographic study of ICTs in two villages of Rajasthan, his work aims to situate social and digital media in a complex rural society and media ecology using co-constructivist approach. Focusing on context sensitive meaning making of ICTs, it will seek to contribute to an empirically sound discourse on media, technology and rural society in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;II</p><p>The second discussant’s work on mobile phones and multimedia consumption among the digitally marginalized users in Bangalore brings into focus the popular usage of ICTs, specifically mobile phones, among the subaltern users. While such popular usage indicates a certain level of literacy already achieved by the digitally marginal groups by mere exposure and peer learning, it is not sufficient to do away with all kinds of guided training required to make such users participate in informationalized environments. Her observations on the mobile phone usage among the subaltern users in Bangalore problematize the notion of digital literacy and invite us to think about it as a more layered and stratified concept. They raise questions such as ‘what constitutes digital literacy?’ — some complex use of gadgets learnt by mere exposure and peer knowledge or an awareness about the social relevance of the technologies and knowledge about their appropriate deployment in different social contexts? While mere access and some nominal training might be helpful in equipping people with some knowledge about gadget-use, her study points out that such initiatives are far from achieving the right degree of digital literacy needed to make these people participate in new media ecologies. Thus it contends the claims of 1. Organic literacy attained by mere exposure and peer sharing of technological knowledge and 2. Literacy attained by current training programmes which might equip the digitally marginalized with knowledge of technological use but not necessarily inform them about the context relevant knowledge needed for their appropriate deployment.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;III</p><p>The third discussant’s work on e-governance initiatives in an Indian state plans to return the gaze on to the bureaucracy itself and takes the conversation from the margins back to the centre. His work moves away from the target groups generally alluded to in programs such as the NDLM. It takes into accounts the struggles, anxieties, hopes and promises of/for a bureaucracy in coming to terms with a gradual but seemingly eventual shift from paper work to digital paper work. The users in this case are staff members tasked by the higher-level bureaucracy-who have little or no clue about it themselves- to learn a new tool and migrate all paper work to the digital domain. Many of e-governance projects are spearheaded by corporate organizations, which in turn dictate the terms of the conversation on Digital Literacy even within the government. What impact does this have on how Digital Literacy is understood, articulated and executed in ICT4D programs within and without the government.</p> Readings <p>Terranova, Tiziana. 2004.

<p>The impact of COVID-19 has been felt across the full breadth of the global economy, causing an estimated 3% contraction in the global economy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/04/14/weo-april-2020">according to the IMF</a>. While industries such as travel, hospitality, and higher education will face a fundamentally different landscape in a post-COVID environment, the digital identity sector has seen acceleration for trends that were beginning to take shape in 2019.</p>



<p>While she’s not necessarily my favorite performing artist, Taylor Swift’s dominance of the music industry over the past decade is indisputable. She has managed to stay on top of the charts with a deft reading of the cultural tradewinds. The recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-folklore-surprise-album-1033102/">midnight surprise “drop”</a>&nbsp;of her latest album&nbsp;Folklore&nbsp;is indicative of the increasing importance of “virality” to the global economy in both the pre- and post-COVID eras.</p>



<p>As consumer attention spans decrease amid a sea of devices, websites, and streaming platforms vying for eyeballs, viral marketing has become a critical tool for reaching mass audiences. The use of algorithms to curate user feeds across platforms underscores the importance of achieving a critical audience mass rapidly, with the velocity of trending content increasing once it starts to build momentum. </p>



<p>The criticality of achieving a rapid audience for your content remains true for all disseminators, regardless of their intention. From brands to nation-states and content marketing managers to cybercriminals, rapid propagation is key to the success of your messages.</p>



<p>This ever-increasing dependence on audience scale for the generation of revenue is, in many ways, a double-edged sword. Reducing user friction is critical to driving user engagement and opens the door for multiple types of fraud. How do we know the audience that our content is reaching is authentic? </p>



<p>OWI’s core thesis illustrates this directly. It places digital identity at the intersection of marketing, payments &amp; the data economy, and cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>When eyeballs equal dollars, there is direct economic motivation to generate fake user accounts and drive inauthentic traffic from real users’ accounts. According to the latest industry data<a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3400937/2018-2019%20Bot%20Baseline%20Report.pdf?__hstc=&amp;__hssc=&amp;hsCtaTracking=bdb34cab-eed6-4c35-8d18-29b29f87cf4c%7C17812a62-49fe-4368-a40c-1526ad8f8f08">&nbsp;released by White Ops</a>, fraud attempts account for an estimated 20-35% of all online ad impressions generated in a given year. Monetizing this traffic can be accomplished in several ways. First, indirectly, unscrupulous website owners spin up bot networks to generate false traffic across their websites and create profitable false impressions paid for by advertisers. Another is by vendors who directly operate bot networks and sell the false impressions themselves. One such vendor, Devumi, is alleged to have had over 200,000 customers, including reality television stars, professional athletes, comedians, TED speakers, pastors, and models, paying for faked social media impressions and “likes.”</p>



<p>To combat increasingly sophisticated vendor solutions dedicated to identifying and neutralizing false advertising and impressions, fraudsters’ methods for creating and utilizing fraudulent accounts continue to evolve. Unfortunately, these methods are also an ideal conduit for perpetuating a full gamut of digital identity fraud from the creation of synthetic identities to money laundering and account takeover.</p>



<p>Today there is no “silver bullet” to defend against the threats mentioned above. But making any progress towards the adoption of digital identity standards will help destroy the economic model that underpins the fraud ecosystem. For too long, the dominant thinking across industry verticals has remained that user friction and high levels of identity assurance must remain mutually exclusive. For social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok, the insertion of steps within the account creation process to ensure that a valid physical person is involved will lead to higher user drop-off rates and, therefore, slower platform growth. This no longer has to be the case.</p>



<p>In the near-term, mobile telecommunications data, user-entity and behavioral analytics, and networked fraud detection platforms offer product managers the tools to pick up on risk signals. This can ultimately identify fraudulent user accounts and provides a high degree of accuracy and no added user friction. While no solution can, or should, claim to be 100% accurate, these technologies continue to increase the time, cost, and effort associated with fraudulent accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This escalation of the cost of creating fraudulent accounts is critical. This is because shifting the fraud equation is the fundamental equation to keep in mind. Eliminating all fraudulent accounts is an admirable goal, but perhaps unattainable. Making it more expensive to create a fraudulent account than the profit generated by a fraudulent account is both achievable. It will go the farthest towards meeting the goals of trust and growth teams alike.</p>



<p>This equation holds across the broader digital identity landscape and remains applicable across payments, cybersecurity, and marketing. Fraudsters have budgets and investors the same as legitimate enterprises. Working to make the cost of successfully perpetuating fraud high enough to make large-scale operations, unsustainable offers the best chance of mitigating risks. The challenge is now, how can businesses do that without fundamentally compromising the experience of your authentic users and compromising growth?</p>

<p>Our highlighted deals also reflect this trend: Prove (previously Payfone) acquired Early Warning Services’ mobile authentication technology (and, with it, 500 financial institutions as clients). Meanwhile, ComplyAdvantage, a company specifically targeting financial risk and crime analysis, raised $50 million to continue the development of its solution. Finally, Equifax acquired Ansonia Credit Data, integrating information from the trucking and transportation industry into its PayNet product.</p>
 The Top Deals Covered by OWI this Week

The company also provides database management, fraud detection, marketing, business credit, employer/income verification, and analytical services. About a fourth of the company’s revenue is generated outside the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company acquired Ansonia Credit Data, a major supplier of information on receivables from the trucking and transportation industry, for an undisclosed amount on July 24, 2020. Data from Ansonia will be integrated into PayNet, an Equifax product that provides credit information for small and medium-sized businesses.&nbsp;</p>

 Special two-part episode delves into BKC’s Assembly program, big challenges with disinformation Jonathan Zittrain joins Oumou Ly for the latest episode of The Breakdown. Photo: Lydia Rosenberg<p>This episode of The Breakdown featuring Assembly Staff Fellow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly</a> in conversation with Professor <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a>, is shared in two parts. Part one delves into the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/assembly">Assembly program</a> — which focused on disinformation from a cybersecurity perspective for the 2019–2020 year — and some of the big challenges that surfaced from Assembly work this year. Part two explores disinformation in the context of trust and platforms, and looks ahead at Assembly in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Read the transcript, which has been lightly edited for clarity and&nbsp;brevity.</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou. I’m a staff fellow on the Berkman Klein Center Assembly: Disinformation Program. Our episode today features our very own Jonathan Zittrain. Jonathan is the George Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard Law School. He’s also a Professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, a Professor of Computer Science at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Director of the Law School Library and Co-founder and Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society. Thank you for joining us today, Jonathan.</p><p>Jonathan Zittrain (JZ): It’s my pleasure. Thank you,&nbsp;Oumou.</p><p>OL: So our Assembly Program is wrapping up for the 2019 through 2020 year and you’ve joined us in your capacity as faculty advisor for the Assembly Program and also as a Co-founder and Director of the Berkman Klein Center of which the Assembly Program is&nbsp;based.</p><p>Can you talk a little bit about yourself, a little bit about the Assembly Program and how it came to&nbsp;be?</p><p>JZ: At one point we had gotten word of one of our fellow universities getting on rather abrupt notice a $15 million grant to improve the state of cybersecurity. We were certainly thrilled for our peers and then couldn’t help but brainstorm, gosh, if we unasked had $15 million appear, which I won’t say has happened yet, what would we do with it and how would we deploy it in a way that did justice to the confidence of whoever would be entrusting us with that much&nbsp;money?</p><p>JZ: What emerged from that discussion was a sense that in some ways the reach of academia is limited. But what if people who weren’t dispositionally inclined to sit down and write 250 manuscript pages could be brought together around these really hard problems that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries?</p><p>What would it look like to gather people around hard problems and work on them? Our first efforts were on cybersecurity and specifically on what we call the going dark problem as framed by law enforcement.</p><p>Our group, which included government officials, civil libertarians, academics, and human rights folks, had really good discussions about that and put a report entitled <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_Making_Progress_on_Going_Dark_Debate.pdf">Don’t Panic</a>. In a way, it said to law enforcement, don’t panic and to the civil libertarians, maybe you should panic because there are a bunch of fronts on which to worry. That’s just an example of the sorts of things our group came together to do in that instance and the intervening years. Most recently, as you know, we’ve taken up the problem of disinformation. How big is it, how bad is it, how would we measure it and know if it’s getting better or worse and who, if anyone, would we trust with an intervention designed to do something about&nbsp;it?</p><p>I should say quickly, the Assembly Program as it’s evolved has roughly now three pillars, three tracks, one of which involves our students at the university. Graduate students looking for thesis topics across multiple departments, including law students looking for meaningful applied experiential work, lend their talents to projects, come together as a cohort to do independent work, and meet faculty from other departments that they normally wouldn’t have a chance to come across. That’s the Assembly student fellowship. We also have Assembly fellows who are people from industry, nonprofits, NGOs, and outside academia.</p><p>It doesn’t mean they’re running a particular company, but they are the people within the engineering rooms of those companies trying to make a difference. By calling them together, having them spend some time on campus here full time, and then scatter again,that can maybe yield something interesting. That was the premise. For now several years, our Assembly fellows have bonded as a group, done multiple projects and presented those projects.</p><p>Then the third pillar is what we call the Assembly Forum. We convene senior officials and senior executives or their representatives and get them talking with one another in the kind of setting that they wouldn’t get in their own natural environment. These are people that might well be thinking about this kind of stuff all the time, and are trying to see things from a new angle. Those are the three pieces of Assembly.</p><p>OL: Were there any issues that we discussed over the course of the year on which you experienced a perspective shift, had your mind changed? Or, did you perhaps change someone else’s&nbsp;mind?</p><p>JZ: I certainly found my own thinking deepened and changed on some things. First off, you certainly can’t just assume that disinformation is a scourge or undifferentiated. Across the board, some of the slicing and dicing that academics want to do and that we found some of the companies are doing too, is them trying to create measurements to counter it where they want to weigh in. It really makes a difference to figure out, “Well, all right. What are we defining as misinformation?” Even… I mean, to some listeners, this may be a kind of new distinction to everybody who’s new at one point, the difference between misinformation and disinformation.</p><p>OL: Absolutely.</p><p>JZ: Misinformation being, “Oh, you just got it wrong”, and disinformation being, “You are wrong. You’re trying to get other people to get it wrong”, with the latter being propaganda. Even that isn’t sufficient because you would think that if some government cooks up a piece of disinformation in a lab and releases it, that is the disinformation. But if somebody repeats it too credulously, they really believe it themselves, they’re engaging in misinformation with the disinformation they got. It might well be that if you’re a platform conveying that or amplifying that speech, you would react to it differently if you know the actor is intending it versus the actor just being a credulous vehicle for it. So being more careful and precise so that we can cut to action that more narrowly addresses the worst aspects of the problem, seems to me really useful in a way that just otherwise makes the problem feel so inchoate and overwhelming that it’s hard to even start with your spoons scooping out the&nbsp;ocean.</p><p>I think that in the particular instance of political mis- and disinformation, there are interesting questions. If you have a platform like Facebook, or you have a government intelligence agency that’s charged with protecting the nation, looking for threats and they see another government trying to salt falsehoods and trying to make those falsehoods are coming from fellow Americans — now what? You would think, well, at least you should disclose what you see. Certainly if I’m on Facebook, I would prefer that if I saw something that was supposedly from a neighbor, and it turns out it’s from somebody thousands of miles away getting paid by their government to pull my leg, I should know about&nbsp;that.</p><p>OL: Right.</p><p>JZ: But it’s very complicated. One of the hypotheticals we entertained as a group was, all right. Suppose the government, the US government, absolutely with great certainty can say, “Here’s disinformation. This is coming from this other country. It’s targeting this political candidate.” Do you tell the candidate? If you tell the candidate, what do you tell them? By the way, it’s like another country has it in for you? Should that be all? Do you say, “Here are the specific posts”, and then do you tell them, “By the way, it’s classified, so you can’t tell anyone&nbsp;else?”</p><p>JZ: If not, why did you tell them? What are they supposed to do with it? Those are real questions and I’m not sure I have answers to them all. But we should be thinking about situations wherein some of us know what’s going on and are prepared to share it, or have an inkling and aren’t certain — and what we would advise the disclosees to do about it. What’s the right course of action that advances the cause against disinformation? That seems to me a better articulated question than I had when I was going into&nbsp;it.</p><p>OL: What concerns you most about the current state of play with regard to disinformation? Is it that the problems are so intractable that we find ourselves at a status quo that seems untenable? What really keeps you up at&nbsp;night?</p><p>JZ: What keeps me up at night is the absence of trust in any referee. Just to take an example from the foundations of a legal system: Two people have a dispute so intractable and important to them that they are willing to endure litigation… they’re ready to go into a courthouse and spend potentially years and tens of thousands of dollars trying to just get an answer from a jury or a judge and an appellate court.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>JZ: It would be nice to know that at the end of that, when somebody wins and somebody loses, although the loser will be disappointed, they don’t feel it’s the case that they were robbed. We don’t want it to be the case that they wonder, “Why did I even have the faith to go into that courthouse?” It is valuable to have a legal system that can settle disputes without the system itself being rightly called into question in every case as to whether it is the&nbsp;problem.</p><p>The fact that we don’t have a significant majority of people trusting anything is a huge problem. There’s a necessity to create more trust and buy in among us. My thought was to have political ads submitted to a platform, then assigned to an American high school class, which under the guidance of their teacher and maybe a school librarian work through whether this ad contains disinformation or misinformation. The class determines whether the ad remains on the platform, they write up their findings, and get graded as to how well they do it. Maybe the decision favored by two out of three classes is the final decision. That’s an example of an idea that I acknowledge is clearly crazy. But I’m hard pressed when I think about it to say why it’s worse than the status quo, which is clearly unacceptable to&nbsp;me.</p><p>OL: Do you think that this lack of trust in traditionally trusted institutions is the result of the disinformation situation that we’re in? Or do you think that there was the sentiment that preceded it and this has just exacerbated it? I talked with Renee DiResta for our <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/q-a-renee-diresta-on-disinformation-and-covid-19-7e285232d6e5">first episode of the series</a> and she said something interesting to me, which is that social media had this democratizing effect in terms of who we consider to be a credible source. At the same time, we’re experiencing disinformation that degrades the credibility of traditionally respected sources. Where do you think that this has come&nbsp;from?</p><p>JZ: It’s likely a sadly mutual cycle. An example is this tale about how 5G relates to COVID. Anybody could sit down and write a page of word salad that invokes a bunch of words having to do with physics to explain how the vibrations actually change the vibrations of the… It’s incoherent. But, the fact that it could have purchase begs the question — all you needed was to have your eyes encounter those&nbsp;words?</p><p>That’s partly the worry about deep fakes. That you see something, you feel like your eyes aren’t lying and you’re already inclined to accept it for various reasons, including just wanting to rationalize what you may already believe or want to have happen in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>OL: Our forum wrapped on May 12th and we had our last two sessions were really heavily focused on COVID. Of course, it’s topical as so much of what we’re seeing online is COVID related or COVID focused. In our last two sessions, platforms, researchers and others in our group talk[ed] about the challenges that they’ve encountered as they work to manage the sheer volume of disinformation surrounding this issue. Then just recently, sustained attention has really shifted to issues of racial inequity, injustice and police brutality.</p><p>As you take stock of the challenges that are mounting in the world at large, and maybe amongst the countering disinformation community as well, are there particular reforms that you hope to&nbsp;see?</p><p>JZ: Well, I think part of the throughline of the examples you’re talking about is disinformation that could contribute to violence or to harm, including self harm in the health&nbsp;context.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>JZ: It makes the stakes real. When it’s disinformation that could lead to violence and conflict and purveyors of disinformation are putting it out exactly for that purpose, it makes it awfully hard to just say this is just too thorny a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>So while acknowledging all of the difficulties that come from figuring out who’s supposed to be the truth police here, having no police here is also the stakes are very real, very immediate. When the denominator of people involved is in the billions and you know that slight tweak to the platform here could greatly change the views of tens of millions of people, it is not a non neutral position. There’s just whether you’re going to be stirring the pot or whether third parties, including state actors will be stirring the&nbsp;pot.</p><p>OL: I completely agree with you. What is on tap for next&nbsp;year?</p><p>JZ: We’ve taken up other issues like cybersecurity and the ethics and governance of AI. This problem of disinformation requires calls for more than just the one academic year’s worth of focused attention. There’s a lot of momentum and I think enough collective feeling within the various groups that the status quo really isn’t working, and that it’s worth pressing on to solve it other than just keeping on with some of the measures already in place. It’s really calling out for new thinking and new experiments.</p><p>I’m also mindful that a lot of the action here, both in understanding the dimension of the problem through access to data and in implementing attempted solutions — that’s largely in private hands. Figuring out the right way to bridge those private companies that happen to shape speech so much with the public interest is a really important role that our group can play and model and work with for the coming&nbsp;year.</p><p>So my sensibility is that we’ll certainly continue through the November US elections, but even beyond with the relationships that have been forged among us and we’ll see if we can bring more to the table as we&nbsp;go.</p><p>OL: Thanks so much for joining me today, Jonathan.</p><p>JZ: It’s my pleasure. Thank you,&nbsp;Oumou.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-jonathan-zittrain-reflects-on-2019-2020-assembly-program-disinformation-8954966648bd">The Breakdown: Jonathan Zittrain reflects on 2019–2020 Assembly program, disinformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable.

 and how today’s most powerful authentication mechanisms can be decentralized <p>It is a mouthful of an acronym: it stands for OpenID Connect — Self-Issued Identity Provider. Unless you are familiar with the terminology of the OpenID community, knowing what the acronym stands for doesn’t illuminate much, but rest assured, this is one of the most exciting developments to support the widespread adoption of Verifiable Credentials across the&nbsp;web.</p><p>This post will explain how it’s exciting and what kinds of adoption it could galvanize. First, we will cover OpenID &amp; OpenID Connect, then touch on how decentralized identity (or “self-sovereign identity”) relates to “authentication” and “user accounts,” and finally how they can work together, with two educational videos along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>While there is substantial and sophisticated <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/blob/master/docs/README.md">prior art</a>, particularly in the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries</a> community, for integrating verifiable credentials with OpenID Connect, using DIDs for OIDC is still emerging and approaching its first stable specification in the coming months. This is the culmination of substantial collaborative work to develop this bridge between the DID Authentication Working Group at DIF and various interlocutors at the OpenID Foundation. This post breaks down key elements of this development and shares more resources if you want to explore it&nbsp;further.</p> What is OpenID &amp; OpenID&nbsp;Connect <p>The first seeds of OpenID were sprouted at the very first Internet Identity Workshop in 2005. All the companies interested in URL-based protocols got together and collaborated together on their various models for designing authentication for users against URLs they controlled, like their personal blogs. This protocol has evolved and the latest iteration is based on sophisticated OAuth (Open Authorization) standards and&nbsp;tooling.</p><p>The basic and most typical flow used by OpenID Connect can be described as follows: an individual, which in this context can be called a “user” of the identity system, first gets a fresh proof of authenticity of their digital identity. This unique proof is minted in the course of an interaction with a service called an “Identity Provider” (IP), i.e. Google or Facebook. This proof usually takes the form of a “token,” a single-use cryptographic access code linked to the corresponding identity record at the IP. The user then takes that token to a second site that they are going to login to, with is called the “Relying Party” or RP, which can then trust they are dealing with the same person identified (usually very strongly) by the Identity provider.</p>OpenID Login&nbsp;Flow<p>The teams of professionals that created OpenID Connect had enough imagination to anticipate more complex use-cases that weren’t immediately needed by the commercialized web of 2005, but for which the technical foundations were still worth laying. Among there, there was a clear idea that users would, in some cases, prefer or need to bring their own identity with them rather than a pointer to a record on an IP’s server. This identity would thus be “self-issued,” a capability they designed into the OpenID core specification.</p><p>The vision of DID-SIOP is a way of bringing decentralized identity concepts into alignment with the ideas of “self-issued” portable identity that the original OpenID innovators had. It was good that they included and preserved this underutilized capability in their immensely popular and internet-powering framework, which is the basis of modern social login (i.e., “Sign on with Google/Facebook/etc”). After all, it would have been simpler not to, but enough of designers and thinkers involved anticipated much of what has developed in parallel, the decentralized identity technology that the DIF serves to&nbsp;support.</p> How do decentralized identity systems&nbsp;work? <p>In this conceptual framework, the “Identity Provider” has been cut down a notch, and is instead referred to as a mere “Issuer” (of credentials and information, perhaps of identities over which it has less control).Similarly, the “user” is defined less by borrowed tools and more by owned ones, assuming the title of “Holder” of information and identity, whether issued or self-issued.. The “verifier” relies less on the identity provider, choosing instead to verify information and identities presented by their holder on their own terms (with some cryptographic assurances about the&nbsp;issuer).</p><p>One interesting difference between traditional OIDC and decentralized systems is that in the latter, all parties have identifiers that make it possible to verify signatures; it is hard to tell from a DID whether it corresponds to an institution, an individual, or an inanimate object, because it could be any or all of those. Whatever it represents, it points to ways of verifying signatures with so-called “key material” (public keys, hints to how to classify and use them). Most often, this happens by looking up the material on a distributed ledger, but this is not, strictly speaking, definitive of the framework..</p><p>The key material from an OIDC issuer proves the veracity of whatever information or identity is being presented in a way that is tied back to that issue by similar key-material guarantees, and a self-issued OIDC token works the same way. (In a self-issued OIDC credential, the holder’s key material is used in the place of an institutional issuer’s).</p> How OpenID and Decentralized ID can fit&nbsp;together <p>One of the big challenges for any new technology that needs an identity system is getting adoption of the needed components so the system can actually work at a sustainable scale. This usually required buy-in from various kinds of actors in an ecosystem: at the very least, it needs critical mass of users/holders, IPs/issuers, and RPs/verifiers, each maintaining their end of the infrastructure and “keeping the lights on,” as it&nbsp;were.</p><p>This is exactly where the two systems can really help each other: achieving and maintaining critical mass of all three, as the distribution of more and less centralized solutions changes, and self-issued credentials come to be accepted in theory and in practice. OpenID Connect has a large “install base”: there are literally millions of websites running OpenID Connect tooling as the authentication mechanism at their “front door” for users. Indeed, while a vanishingly small portion of internet users have ever heard of OIDC, it is the nuts and bolts of the most universal and familiar UX and user flow of the contemporary commercial web, including online banking and government services.</p><p>OIDC-SIOP leverages the code that OpenID Connect relying parties already have in place across all these millions of sites, and the lion’s share of the 10,000 most used websites. Think of the screen that reads, “Log in with Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github / etc.” OIDC-SIOP enables organizations to ask for Verifiable Credentials that an individual holds in their wallet instead of a token from Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github. These can be single-use access codes with cryptography built in, or more reusable credentials, or richer credentials containing various kinds of information otherwise requested from an IP. This mechanism is provided by the Self-Issued OpenID Provider flow described by the core specification:</p><p>If successful, this will be a huge win for decentralized identity, because it addresses the perennial “Relying Party” problem of adoption: how do you get relying parties to adopt a new technology, install and trust a new “doorway,” adapt their security and business processes to a new set of strengths and weaknesses? In the popular imagination and even in much of the technology press, scaling a business or a technology is often imagined as a quest for users, but they are often the easiest shareholder to get on board, particularly for something convenient and powerful. The relying parties (or, in economic terms, the “demand side” of identity) is often a much harder business problem, and in this case, no “big lift” is required of the verifiers or “relying party” consuming a new kind of authentication credentials because they only have to make minor adjustments to the nearly universal OIDC tooling they already&nbsp;have.</p> Further Reading <p>The purpose of the DID Authentication <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">Working Group</a> at DIF is to design, recommend, and implement authentication protocols that rely on open standards and cryptographic protocols tailored to today’s and tomorrow’s systems for handling DIDs and DID documents, the primitives of decentralized identities. In last six months, the group has been actively working on the OIDC bridge, and they presented their latest work at DIF’s June 2020 virtual “face to face”&nbsp;meeting:</p><p>Here is a link to their draft specification, nearing stability and ratification at time of press: <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">https://identity.foundation/did-siop/</a>. For an explanation of some of the design principles and conceptual fine points, see the article “<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">If You Build an Island You Need a Boat</a>” from DIF member Mattr Global&nbsp;(NZ).</p><p>Finally, if you want to go even deeper into the technical nitty gritty (particularly if you are unfamiliar with OIDC best practices), watch this video of a two hour presentation about OIDC-SIOP put on jointly with the DIDAuth group and the OpenID Foundation June 25th&nbsp;2020.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/where-to-begin-with-oidc-and-siop-7dd186c89796">Where to begin with OIDC and SIOP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 ID2020 is proud to announce that Grameen Foundation, one of the world’s leading nonprofits using technology to alleviate poverty and hunger, has joined the ID2020 Alliance. <p>“Over the past 23 years, Grameen Foundation has demonstrated what we can accomplish when we empower women to help their families escape the cycle of poverty and hunger,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “Given Grameen Foundation’s enthusiastic embrace of technology to enhance the delivery of financial and other development services, we are delighted to welcome them to the Alliance and look forward to collaborating with them as they continue to incorporate digital ID into their programs.”</p><p>Grameen Foundation was inspired and encouraged by Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank and a global leader in the fight against poverty. Rooted in the microfinance movement, Grameen Foundation works across Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Middle East to extend financial and other services to the world’s poorest&nbsp;people.</p><p>Today, Grameen Foundation embraces a multidimensional approach to the complex problems of poverty, using technology to strengthen resilience and food security, increase incomes, enhance health, and build financial security.</p><p>Their work is guided by five principles:</p><p>· Give poor women a better way to manage their&nbsp;money.</p><p>· Give poor farmers a better way to grow crop&nbsp;income.</p><p>· Stay data-driven, evidence-based, and human-centered.</p><p>· Use digital as a tool, people will make the&nbsp;change.</p><p>· Design to be scalable and sustainable.</p><p>“We are pleased to join the ID2020 Alliance in support of its work toward ethical implementation of digital identity solutions,” said Steve Hollingworth, president and CEO of Grameen Foundation. “Grameen’s work has long been guided by the principle that digital technologies are our most promising path to empower the poor to break the cycle of poverty.”</p><p>We are excited to welcome the Grameen Foundation to the ID2020 Alliance.</p><p>###</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>Globally, one person in seven is unable to prove her identity through any recognized means. As a result, these individuals lack access to basic legal protections and social services, such as education and healthcare; are unable to participate fully as a citizen and voter; and are systematically excluded from the modern&nbsp;economy.</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.ID2020.org">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About Grameen Foundation</p><p>Grameen Foundation is a global nonprofit whose mission is to enable the poor, especially women, to create a world without poverty and hunger. In collaboration with our partners, we harness the power of digital data to create tech-forward tools for self-sufficiency and deliver them through local Community Agent networks.

<p>Melissa Carvalho, Nicole Landry and Chanda Jackson represented Women in Identity at the 2020 IdentityNORTH annual summit where over 500 people attended a two day conference. While going virtual this year, the IdentityNORTH team was able to produce 3x more content than in previous years and offer a professional development certificate at 1/4 the price of their typical in-person events.</p>
<p>Before committing to the event, Melissa, Nicole and Chanda carefully analyzed the content to ensure that the summit reflects the values held by Women in Identity.</p>
<p>They were very impressed with the diversity of speakers – 46% of sessions featured speakers that are women, Indigenous or people of color. Sessions ranged from public and private sector business to health, democracy and inclusion and representation.</p>
<p>The team is pleased with the feedback obtained from other conference attendees. We’ve met many new people and look forward to building our relationships with those championing diversity in identity. We’re currently working with one of the groups, who would like to sponsor WiD, to launch a co-branded event this fall.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identitynorth.ca/downloads/IdentityNORTH-2020-Annual-Summit-Summary.pdf">IdentityNORTH 2020 Annual Summit event summary</a> can be found online. It’s a great source of information for those looking to learn more. In the summary, you’ll find that the IdentityNORTH team featured Women in Identity in the following excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s so important to understand when you build and deliver something to market, it’s not only going to be used for the purpose that you intended for, but it can be used for another purpose,” Chanda Jackson, Canadian Co-Lead of Women in Identity and Sr. Manager, IAM Planning at Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) reminded participants. There’s a whole world of untapped potential and possibilities out there, Jackson noted – it’s time to open the door to more ways of thinking.</p>

<p>Mountain View, Calif., July 22, 2020 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> has made the decision to transition Authenticate, the FIDO Alliance’s industry conference dedicated to the who, what, why, and how of modern user authentication, from an in-person event to a virtual-only conference. It will be held this November, as originally scheduled. The Alliance will create a digital conference experience that will inspire attendees to embrace a new way to authenticate and present the necessary tools to move past passwords.</p>



<p>“While it’s disappointing we cannot be together for the very first Authenticate, the safety of our community is our biggest priority,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Due to continuing concerns over COVID-19, and in alignment with the information we’re hearing from local officials, we decided to transition to a digital-only format, and focus on giving attendees a powerful and informative virtual experience.”</p>



<p>As FIDO recasts the conference to a virtual-only format, it will expand it to a multi-day November event spread across all time zones to accommodate global participation, including live Q&amp;A sessions with presenters. The virtual format allows for sponsoring companies to showcase their solutions through virtual exhibit booths and other branding and networking opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2020 headlining keynote speakers are as formerly announced: Dr. Whitfield Diffie, the co-inventor of public key cryptography; Joy Chik, corporate vice president of identity at Microsoft; Mark Risher, senior director of product management at Google; and Stina Ehrensvard, CEO and founder of Yubico. A full list of speakers is available on the <a href="https://authenticatecon.com/speakers/">Authenticate website</a>.</p>



<p>The conference agenda will contain informative content on authentication, with a focus on the FIDO approach, including these topics:&nbsp;</p>



  Case studies from service and technology providers including CVS Health, EMILY’s List, Facebook, Google, IBM, Mass Mutual, Microsoft, MITRE Corporation, NTT DOCOMO, PNC Bank, and Target  Sessions on the state of authentication, building an authentication strategy, and how FIDO fits with initiatives like W3C Web Payments, and EMVCo 3DS and SRC  Standards and technical implementation presentations focusing on FIDO for identity verification; bringing FIDO Authentication to IoT; OpenID for open banking; standards and the future of payments; FIDO certification; attestation and more  Policy discussions around PSD2, GDPR and eIDAS; authentication to enable better privacy for citizens; authentication from a regulator’s perspective and more

<p>Esme Wardhaugh interviews Helen Chua, Senior Sales Director with NEC APAC.&nbsp;</p>
 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Helen Chua
<p>I am passionate about the use of biometrics to correctly identify and verify a person especially in the area of digital identity. My interest in biometrics dates back 25 years ago,&nbsp; and has propelled me to be involved in many security-related projects involving governments and nation-wide deployments across multiple countries, particularly at the 9/11 tragedy which saw sudden huge demand and opportunities that humbled me.&nbsp; It gives me great satisfaction to see how biometrics can improve security by identifying individuals accurately and enhance the verification of a person’s physical identity, whether it is in passport issuance, in national identity systems (physical and digital), border control, law enforcement, or finance. Orchestrating a brighter world using biometrics is why I do what I do.</p>
<p>One of the things I enjoy is thinking of creative ideas and solutions that helps to solve a client’s problem. In 1995, automated border control gates were unheard of and, together with Singapore immigration, we introduced the first automated gates using biometrics to reduce manpower while improving accuracy, consistency and speed. I have also helped to pioneer the seamless onboarding process for various financial institutions using biometrics. These represent just a few of the many firsts that I have been involved in.</p>
<p>Being trained in fingerprint, facial and iris technologies with NEC, I am delighted to be part of a company who are ranked number 1 globally by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology for its speed and accuracy in biometrics technologies.&nbsp; NEC technologies, especially facial matching, are developed to be able to identify a person regardless of gender or ethnic group, which ties in to my firm belief that all people are created equal and should have equal opportunities to reach their full potential.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Growing up, my parents were my role models. Each day their lives exemplified their teaching. They told us that the sky is our limit and they installed values of honesty and integrity in us. Dad is a firm believer that every family is a building block of society. Who we are and what we stand for will either give and add to society or otherwise. I am indebted to the mentors whom I can turn to any time, they helped me see my blind spots and oversights. I am very blessed to have forged many friendships internationally and surrounded by so many who have encouraged, inspired, and spurred me on. I am most grateful for my loving family and the friends in my path. These are the people who accept me for who I am and bring out the best in me.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Life’s goals should not be focused on achievements, relationships are just as important, if not more! I learnt much early on in life never to achieve at the expense of others. This has a lot to do with one’s perspective! How to always see the good in others and how together we can do a whole lot more to the betterment of our company and ultimately benefiting our society. Though I must add sometimes&nbsp; I do find myself in sticky situations and how many times I have had to dig deep into myself, bounce off my confidantes, including my supportive husband, and navigate out of them without hurting anyone nor myself. There are a couple of times I have failed regretfully, yet those are the times that have seen the greatest growth in me as a person.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>Start recognising that all people are created equal and to involve a diversity of minds to create the best products and solutions. The biometric technology that I am involved in, we use diverse groups of people to train the engine such that it’s not biased towards a certain color or people group.&nbsp; CEOs should deliberately put in place measures to support every vulnerable group to create a workplace environment where all individuals can fully express themselves without fear of discrimination.&nbsp; Individuality and uniqueness of diverse employees are important as well as a corporate culture where everyone can work and participate to their full potential.</p>
<p>Stop thinking that, by having the best team to create identity products and solutions which recognizes the “elite group” or the “best breed”, they will they find the most profit from it. In fact, they will find the most revenue by having a identity solution which has an inclusive mindset and a diverse group of people creating together. With the diversity, the solution can reach more and expand to more use cases.&nbsp; They should continue hearing the voices of diverse groups for their research and development and not have an echo chamber of researchers that think the same way so as to produce creative and innovative products.</p>
<p>Continue to reach out to a diverse community of partners to forge strong alliances as no company can work on its own.&nbsp; The community needs each other to sustain its business and to expand and diversify into different areas.&nbsp; Business is about networking and reaching out for more, more clients, more use cases, more collaborations, more allies.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do not have an echo chamber of researchers that think the same way so as to produce creative and innovative products</p></blockquote>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the beauty and uniqueness that every individual brings about his/her beauty and strength and together as a group, Diversity is power, and more.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>Hacksaw Ridge is the movie. “Lord, help me get one more” Desmond continued to save one life at a time.&nbsp; One day at a time, one task at a time, one person at a time. It is believing what the Lord will help us achieve our goal one step at a time.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>There is no short cut in life. Every person who is at the top has had to spill their own blood, sweat and tears to get there.&nbsp; Failure is the mother of success! Never let failure drive you to the ground. Instead, get up and grow from these life lessons. When you overcome, you will be bigger and stronger.</p>

<p>Esme Wardhaugh interviews Melissa Carvalho, Vice President of Enterprise and Customer Identity and Access Management for Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Melissa Carvalho
<p>I am the Vice President of Enterprise and Customer Identity and Access Management for Royal Bank of Canada. RBC is ranked as one of the top 25 banks globally and has over 80K employees and ~16 million customers. I am proud to manage the best Identity and Access Management team in the world! My 200+ member team is comprised of some of the most diverse and talented people I have met.&nbsp; While challenges come our way, I’ve discovered that there is no challenge that this team cannot overcome. It is refreshing to work with individuals who are always looking to over deliver and to offer the best solutions to our customers. More importantly, they have taught me their interests go far beyond their role, with their involvement in community events and non-profit organizations. Their example and their spirit is what motivates me daily. They renew my belief that one person really can make a difference and demonstrate how powerful we are when we team together!</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I got to where I am today by setting my goals high, making a plan, and – most importantly – being flexible to take on any challenge that life presents me.&nbsp; My career has been marked with a series of opportunities.&nbsp; In my last year of university while studying to be a teacher, a tech company offered me a role that started after my graduation. While at the time my desire was to go into teaching, the opportunity was one that I decided to try as I could always go back to teaching. Within four months, I went on my first IAM course and then started traveling across North America to deploy solutions. The rest was history. Each meeting and relationship created more opportunities and opened more doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way?&nbsp; 
<p>The most important lesson I’ve learned is that life is short.&nbsp; It was fairly early in my career when I lost my best friend, my mother. In the months and years after her passing it was as if I was watching my life as though it was a series of short films. Going through that loss taught me to look at my interactions differently, more importantly to speak up for injustices and inequalities I was seeing. I’ve noticed that people rarely remember what I’ve said but rather what I’ve done or not done.&nbsp; I didn’t want to be a passenger in this journey but rather the driver of my destiny. I’m a firm believer that every individual matters and together we can make a difference.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every individual matters and together we can make a difference</p></blockquote>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>START: Working with our clients to develop use cases and solutions that meet real-life needs. If we walk hand-in-hand to develop ‘journeys’, the solutions will be more valuable and we’ll create lasting partnerships.</p>
<p>STOP: Creating and deploying solutions and expecting the clients to want them.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: To advocate and ensure the solutions we create offer diversity.&nbsp; Continue to ensure we break down biases.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you?&nbsp; 
<p>I would like to experience in my lifetime what it feels like to live equally without judgement — seems like a lofty goal but I believe it’s possible.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t read or watch many films — my recommendation to fellow members is to volunteer by putting themselves out of their comfort zone.&nbsp; Working with others in a different situation from your own helps change your perspective on life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’?&nbsp; 
<p>Take chances, stop worrying about the small things.&nbsp; If something you’re worrying about now won’t matter in 5 years, don’t give it more than 5 minutes of thought. Life is very short and can change in an instant.</p>

<p>Setting a tone for inclusive collaboration</p><p>An important part of supporting a community where people are coming from all over the world and from a variety of backgrounds is putting in place a code of conduct that provides a baseline understanding about what is ok and what is not. The purpose of DIF’s Code of Conduct is to create an open, healthy and productive culture where members and the community can build and grow together.</p><p>During the DIF Virtual Face-to-Face Meeting in June of 2020, this Code of Conduct was reviewed:</p><p>In lieu of an executive summary, we would here like to offer a few highlights:</p> 1.) Community Advocates <p>One of the innovations in the code of conduct is the creation of a role we call community advocates. Each of these is a community member who takes seriously their power and responsibility as facilitator. We are working to provide formal training to support these advocates and give them a firm foundation on what to listen for and how to speak to conflicts. If you are part of the community and would like to volunteer as a community advocate, please let us&nbsp;know.</p><p>In particular, these advocates can diffuse, mitigate, and failing both, escalate conflicts. See in particular the expanded dispute escalation section of the&nbsp;code:</p><blockquote>Dispute Escalation and Incident Resolution Mechanisms</blockquote><blockquote>We are all here to contribute value and reap the benefits of community collaboration. While it is natural to have disagreements and find situations uncomfortable, DIF believes that resolving any issues should take place within the community via open communication.</blockquote><blockquote>DIF has within it a group of members who have some training and skills in supporting healthy conflict resolution that can be volunteer community advocates.</blockquote><blockquote>If something does happen, open communication and shared, cross community healing is a must. The community should get better as a&nbsp;whole.</blockquote> 2.) Diversity front-of-mind <p>Informed by a substantial corpus of experiences throughout the broader identity technology community where perspectives from marginalized groups were actively or unwittingly excluded, we felt our code of conduct needed to be explicit about the most nefarious and effective tool of silencing: scope management. To this end, we put into our code of conduct the following definitive statement:</p><blockquote>Diversity is never definitively out-of-scope or foreclosed as irrelevant to more urgent business.</blockquote> 3.) Proactive inclusivity <p>Here are some more important excerpts from the code of conduct that cover our statement on inclusivity and diversity</p><blockquote>Inclusive: We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable, threatened, or unheard/dismissed (explicitly or implicitly) is not a productive one. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community, contributing to an atmosphere of inclusion. DIF takes seriously the maintenance of substantive inclusion in which any member feels empowered to contribute; if any do not feel the group’s chairs are doing enough to create this atmosphere, they may go elsewhere in DIF for help achieving this&nbsp;change.</blockquote><blockquote>Diverse: DIF welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone fairly. No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, dis/ability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability. Diversity of perspective, identity and experience should be considered a positive contribution. Diversity and empathetic, pro-actively inclusive ways of stewarding cooperation is an ongoing commitment, not a one-time gesture; DIF’s Steering Committee and Working Group Chairs and Editors concretely support ongoing training or cooperative learning between leaders of working groups, mailing lists, and other&nbsp;venues.</blockquote> A living, open-source document <p>You can read the full code of conduct <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/blob/master/assets/code-of-conduct--ratified-document-june20-2020.pdf">here</a>, or if you would like to suggest edits or open issues, you can do so on github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">here</a>. As Balázs mentions in the video, the code of conduct is licensed for being “forked” and adapted anywhere it can be helpful, and we look forward to contribution and discussion as it continues to&nbsp;evolve.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/difs-updated-code-of-conduct-a0c2d9dce1ad">DIF’s Updated Code of Conduct</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today, secure access to online applications and services has evolved into a framework reliant on devices, public key cryptography and biometrics to replace the shared secrets of aging passwords. Since 2013, the FIDO Alliance has developed open and scalable advancements to eliminate phishing and other security attacks. To introduce these improvements and to educate employees throughout corporate management and IT security, FIDO Alliance has developed a series of best practices and how-to white papers that match the Alliance’s goals with the responsibilities and titles of technology professionals. This work is dedicated to eliminating passwords and securing the simple act of logging on within all companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This white paper answers the most common questions from CXOs about the value proposition of FIDO Authentication and how the FIDO2 passwordless framework addresses the authentication needs and challenges of companies for the modern workforce. The goal of this document is to guide executive leaders within an organization as to why they should invest in FIDO2 deployment for their employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notice of Intent: DIACC is collaborating to develop and publish an Assessment and Infrastructure (Technology &amp; Operations) industry standards as components of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) to set a baseline of public and private sector interoperability of identity services and solutions.</p>



<p>To learn more about the Pan-Canadian vision and benefits-for-all value proposition please review the<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf"> Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Overview</a>.<br></p>



<p>Document Status: These review documents have been approved as Draft Recommendations V1.0 by the DIACC’s<a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/"> Trust Framework Expert Committee</a> (TFEC) that operates under the DIACC controlling policies.</p>



<p>Summary:&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The intent of the PCTF Assessment component is to establish the certification scheme to verify that a process, service, or product conforms with criteria defined in the PCTF.<br></p>



<p>The intent of the PCTF Infrastructure (Technology &amp; Operations) component is to identify the operational policies, plans, technology and technology operations requirements to support implementation of the principles of the PCTF Profiles in the context of a Digital Identity Ecosystem.<br></p>



<p>Invitation: All interested parties are invited to comment.<br></p>



<p>Period: Opens: July 20, 2020 at 23:59 PST | Closes: August 20, 2020 at 23:59 PST</p>



<p>Document: Assessment Draft Recommendation V1.0</p>

<p>When reviewing this draft, consider the following and note that responses to these questions are non-binding and serve to improve the PCTF.</p>



  Is the description of roles and responsibilities clear at this level?  This draft describes a tiered assessment process with varying levels of evidence examination applied depending on risk and usage profile of the service being examined for certification  Are the two processes defined enough? If not, what would be the nature of any additional discrete process? What would it apply to? Would its addition change the nature of either of the two processes defined?  If the two process versions defined are sufficient, do the differences between them meet the goals of application of a less onerous certification process to some applications for certification? If not, then what would you suggest as an alternative?  Keeping in mind the noting of potential adjustment based on the output of the TFEC Working group on LoA, are the criteria for determining which certification process applies acceptable in principle?  A draft definition of classification based on service usage is included. Does this meet the needs of this Profile at this level? If not, what alternative would you suggest?    Are there concepts or terminology that remain unclear or inconsistently applied?  This Overview is meant to define the high level model and process for certification. Development of the significant Programme execution supporting information has been deferred until the model at this level is ratified. Are there any significant omissions from this high level Overview that would preclude you from understanding the model at this level?  Do you agree with the process for certification of Services as described? If not, what specific modifications would you suggest?  Do you agree with the process for certification of Accredited Assessors as described? If not, what specific modifications would you suggest?  The last section of the document identifies a number of required documents to support this certification process. The intent is to capture detailed process-oriented content in these documents after the Certification Assessment Program has been approved in principle. With this in mind, and considering the level of detail appropriate for this document, are there any major elements of the certification program not yet addressed in this draft?  



<p>NOTE that elements of examination for certification may be adjusted based on the finalization of the Working group on LoA, please keep this in mind when commenting on this document.</p>

<p>When reviewing this draft, consider the following and note that responses to these questions are non-binding and serve to improve the PCTF.</p>



  Several feedback items suggest that additional prescriptive detail be added to this Conformance Profile. Some adjustments were made but additional input is sought to identify areas where further detail should be included. Where specific methods or standards are to be expanded upon, please include suggested methods, tools, or plan/policy items that you feel should be added.&nbsp;  The Conformance Criteria are organized into three categories. Are these appropriate and understandable? If not, please suggest an alternate categorization scheme.  Care was taken to try to strike a balance between generic Criteria defined at a high level and being too prescriptive. Do the criteria meet this objective of being prescriptive enough to be useful and generic enough to be applicable to most Digital Identity Ecosystem instances?  Note that there are several instances where cross references to related information in other Profiles. Are there other instances where this would be appropriate?  Are there significant requirements missing from this draft? If so, please identify the requirements you believe should be included.  Care was taken not to identify a specific technology or technology protocol, believing that none applied as a requirement in every instance. Is this correct, or is there a specific technology or protocol that should be included as a PCTF requirement?  



<p>NOTE that the PCTF Working Group on LoA is underway with the objective of defining how LoA will be treated across all PCTF Profiles. Treatment of potential variances in Conformance Criteria based on Service LoA were deferred in this version of the Profile. Please reserve your comments in this area to an enhanced draft of these documents when the LoA Working Group has published their results.<br></p>

<p>Value to Canadians: The PCTF Assessment and Infrastructure (Technology &amp; Operations) components will provide value to all Canadians, businesses, and governments by setting a baseline of auditable criteria to assess business, legal, and technical interoperability. The DIACC’s mandate is to collaboratively develop and deliver resources to help Canadian’s to digitally transact with security, privacy, and convenience. The PCTF is one such resource that represents a collection of industry standards, best practices, and other resources that help to establish interoperability of an ecosystem of identity services and solutions. The DIACC is a not-for-profit coalition of members from the public and private sector who are making a significant and sustained investment in accelerating<a href="https://diacc.ca/2019/02/26/canadas-digital-identity-ecosystem/"> Canada’s Identity Ecosystem</a>.</p>



<p>Context: The purpose of this Draft Recommendation review is to ensure transparency in the development and diversity of a truly Pan-Canadian, and international, input. In alignment with our<a href="https://diacc.ca/principles/"> Principles for an Identity Ecosystem</a>, processes to respect and enhance privacy are being prioritized through every step of the PCTF development process.</p>



<p>DIACC expects to modify and improve these Draft Recommendations based upon public comments. Comments made during the review will be considered for incorporation into the next drafts and DIACC will prepare a Disposition of Comments to provide transparency with regard to how each comment was handled. &nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Thank you for your support and participation in this review period.<br></p>

<p>A process for supporting the emergence of shared language in broad collaborative communities</p><p>by Kaliya Young &amp; Margo&nbsp;Johnson</p> Introduction <p>The identity community focused on user-centric ID gathers twice a year at the Internet Identity Workshop (<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a>), an event at the crossroads of more than a dozen open standards working groups focused on various aspects of digital identity.</p><p>At IIW29 in October of 2019, a session was called to assess the creation of a glossary to support the convergence of meaning around key terms that were being used in relationship to the emerging decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity technologies. The small group convened there was led by Kaliya Young (Identity Woman), Margo Johnson (Transmute Industries), and Drummond Reed (Evernym), and included a variety of perspectives from other contributors like Adrian Gropper (HIE of One) and Juan Caballero (Spherity).</p><p>We considered several sources ahead of beginning the process towards glossary creation. We looked at the past history of glossaries in the community, including the <a href="http://wiki.idcommons.net/Lexicon">Identity Gang Lexicon</a> from 2005, which was created in the very early days of the community that would come together over the following fifteen years (Kaliya and Drummond were active at that time). There was the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/">Sovrin Glossary</a>(2016; 2019; 2019), which in its current form contains 248 terms as a potential source we could draw terms from. We also spoke with Daniel Hardman about his approach to glossary work, where one defines key concepts with a functional description but no name, and then when all the concepts are outlined collectively, names are decided all at once upon firm concepts.</p><p>We also drew on the work of Eugene Kim, who<a href="http://fasterthan20.com/framework/high-performance-groups/"> focuses on high performance collaboration, </a>one of the key elements for which is the social processes of developing “Shared Understanding” and “Shared Language” are social processes:</p>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110812181030/http://blueoxen.net/wiki/Shared_Understanding">Shared Understanding</a> is when two people or groups use different words for the same things or the same words for different things, but because of enough social contact, they can actually understand what is being communicated.  <a href="http://blueoxen.net/wiki/Shared_Language">Shared Language</a> emerges if you have sufficient contact between groups/people such that their word choice becomes decidedly aligned.  <p>We were mindful of this when we chose the process for this glossary work. And we wanted it to be inclusive, so we listened carefully to the current diversity of language that was already being used throughout the community. The meaning of key words wasn’t ours to fix or define; we aimed to establish a composite of the digital identity vernacular as we encountered it.</p><p>Community members urged us to create a glossary, pointing to confusion “in the market” about what key terms meant. Ultimately, we learned that this request represented a variety of impulses, which spawned some confusion about our efforts. It was clear from the beginning that the work should not seek to define terms at the level where they are being used within technical working groups where significant time was being devoted to defining key terms locally within a given technical specification. The energy of the group got behind better understanding how words are used in every day language and conversation in the marketing level documents.</p><p>As such, we aimed to invite alignment around key words, to find the “bell curve of meaning,” and to invite convergence towards the middle of this curve as a result of our research process. Our hope was to maximize the ability to inform and engage business audiences interested in adopting/purchasing this technology. This meant we would not be setting out to define hundreds of terms; rather, we chose to focus on a subset of the most widely used&nbsp;terms.</p> Methodology <p>First, our group created and circulated a survey throughout the broader digital identity community to identify key terms to focus on. The group chairs designed the survey by brainstorming a starting list of terms (based on working knowledge of the space), and respondents also had the option to add their own. Respondents ranked the provided terms from highest to lowest priority. The chairs reviewed these results and chose three of the top-ranked terms as a starting point for the glossary&nbsp;process.</p><blockquote>In the case of this research those terms were “agent”, “wallet”, and “credential.”</blockquote><p>One other term — “self sovereign identity” — was actually rated as the most important by this process. However, the group ultimately decided that this hot-button term would be best approached after a more foundational understanding of supporting terms was in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Having defined three targets for building clarity and consensus, we then created and shared a second survey asking respondents about their working descriptions for each of the three terms, as well as how those terms relate to each other. We worked from an assumption that understanding the relationships between the terms would help us better understand their meaning. Several additional questions about the company business model were also included to provide context about respondents. This survey was distributed via multiple mailing lists to a broad swath of community groups working in decentralized identity, verifiable credential, blockchain, and data privacy&nbsp;space.</p> Analysis <p>After several weeks, the second survey had twenty seven responses from various companies, and our group was able to start with community data analysis efforts. The chairs took some time to consider different analysis options, prioritizing those that were digital, inclusive, participatory, fast, and free. We wanted to minimize any barrier to community members engaging in the process. Finally, we designed a framework in Google Sheets whereby qualitative responses to each question were inductively sorted into emergent groups that we named and modified in real-time, helping us understand common themes as well as areas of divergence. You can picture this as a digital version of hundreds of post-its all over a wall, being moved around by different people until they eventually fall into groups, and those groups are given a big post-it name after an iterative process of redistribution and renaming. This is a creative combination of human-centered design practices such as affinity diagramming, <a href="http://library.ac4d.com/d/AC4D_designlibrary_Design_synthesis.pdf">d</a>e<a href="http://library.ac4d.com/d/AC4D_designlibrary_Design_synthesis.pdf">sign synthesis</a>, and insight combinations.</p><p>Using this analytical framework, the glossary group met weekly for an hour over several months to read through the survey responses together and create groupings. Additional participants rotated in and out throughout the process, offering different perspectives and helping to refine the approach. The approach was messy at times, with responses falling into multiple groups or defying categorization altogether. However we persisted, and noted interesting discussions and reflections that emerged in the process. Once we finished grouping all the responses, we combed through the data once more, cleaning it up a bit, merging groups where there was high overlap and clarifying the final description for each&nbsp;group.</p><p>Upon completing the grouping process we counted the number of responses in each group across each term and relationship type to determine which concepts came up the most frequently, potentially indicating the highest level of alignment across respondents. We also looked at the number of groups per term/relationship as an indication of convergence or divergence in responses.</p><p>Looking at this qualitative and quantitative information, the group took the final step of writing working descriptions for each of the three key terms. This involved looking at the 2–4 groups for each term with the highest number of related responses and constructing a phrase from their group descriptions. This was a surprisingly smooth process for the review team — in particular for the terms “wallet” and “credential” — where there was a higher level of consensus. One notable challenge we faced was with the term “agent” based on the large number of groups included, and while we were able to construct a more complex phrase, the difficulty arriving at that point became a finding in its own right. Interestingly, while the term agent had the highest level of divergence and outlier definitions, it also had one group — “representative of the subject” — with the highest number of relevant responses in the whole survey at 21. This could be interpreted as meaning that the term agent actually has a high level of convergence around this core representation property, and then individual implementations diverge in other agent features.</p><blockquote>Aggregated Descriptions (Agent, Wallet, Credentials)</blockquote><blockquote>Credentials: Credentials provide structured standards for accessing identity&nbsp;data</blockquote><blockquote>Wallets: Provide storage of keys, credentials, and secrets, often facilitated or controlled by an&nbsp;agent.</blockquote><blockquote>Agent:</blockquote><blockquote>SIMPLE: Dictionary definition: “a person or thing that takes an active role or produces a specified effect”</blockquote><blockquote>NUANCED: An agent is a software representative of a subject (most often a person) that controls access to a wallet and other storage, can live in different locations on a network (cloud vs. local), and can facilitate or perform messaging or interactions with other subjects.</blockquote><p>For the relationships between the terms, we found that the simplest way to share the results was to create a diagram showing the relationships (see below) and to list out all of the group titles there. This helped to show the diversity and multi-directional nature of those relationships.</p> Sharing Results <p>Our group built a simple, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gIEPmbtLNVuaHxdawGBe6ZwFqP43m7iqmIEeUUm3sjI/edit#slide=id.g752184a474_0_4">publicly visible presentation</a> to share details of the process, results, and next steps. In this deck, we emphasized descriptive rather than prescriptive results, noting that this was one way of better understanding our shared landscape and taking actions together to build market understanding and product language.</p><p>We presented this deck and answered community questions within the same community groups where the original work was spawned,, as well as running a session at the 30th Internet Identity Workshop (<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Glossary_Results_-_Credentials,_Wallets,_Agents_Defined._%2B_Next_Steps">full notes here</a>). The feedback was generally positive.</p><p>Reflecting on the process, what remains to be seen is how the community will utilize these terms, and whether we will see a further convergence towards shared meaning as a result of this work. We have already seen this work referenced in discussions when shared vocabulary issues are raised, and we know that several publicly traded companies active in the industry are also sharing this internally. We are also preparing to follow up and share the results with respondents to complete the feedback&nbsp;cycle.</p> Conclusion and Next&nbsp;Steps <p>From an information-sharing perspective, the group hopes to continue to share this work out into related communities, and encourage further conversations and actions. We particularly want to encourage conversations at a market level, connecting standards to businesses today.</p><p>Moving forward, the glossary group hopes to do another round of definitions using the same process. We also want to continue to explore specific impacts of this work to gauge its continued value for the broader community.</p><p>We hope that other communities can learn from our experience, and use this process or iterations of it to support the emergence of shared language in their communities. From a research process perspective, we would love to see other groups leverage this methodology, see how it works for them, and offer process and marketing improvements that can benefit everyone. If you do pick up this method and try it, please let us know how it works for&nbsp;you.</p><p>If you are interested in joining the community glossary group please sign up here: Fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJDqcE1hgmx60zISm4uvJdWPuJhji3Y9fJeXCIENMHr-JB7A/viewform">form&nbsp;here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/finding-the-bell-curve-of-meaning-61a1d22b7bdd">Finding the Bell Curve of Meaning</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Verifiable credentials are a kind of signed, tamper-proof digital document that uses cryptography to strongly authenticate the information shared between participants. There are many design and behavioral considerations when building systems for digital information-sharing which affect the privacy and security guarantees between the parties which will exchange data. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Eliminating traceability vectors from data exchanged between participants.  Enabling participants to share only subsets or minimized derivatives of the data a signed credential contains, at the same level of assurance as the whole credential.  Ensuring that routine status checks or revocation mechanisms do not leak information about how often, where, or when credentials have been presented.  <p>One way to limit excess information-sharing and preserve privacy throughout the lifecycle of that information’s usage is a set of cryptographic tools known as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs allow participants to account for the issues listed above using cryptographic schemes that cut off tracking vectors, enable granular capabilities for minimizing the subset of data disclosed, and ensure that the usage of credentials does not leave data trails that third parties can monitor and leverage to compromise user privacy individually or en&nbsp;masse.</p>Photo credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ZsFXXsv5Qi4">Larry&nbsp;Costales</a> Alignment and Standardization <p>There are many ZKP schemes that have been developed over the years and that can already be used in decentralized identity systems, but few that have seen widespread adoption in production systems. There is still substantial work to be done to ensure that the identity community is equipped with all the tools required to address a wide array of use cases. This backlog includes the authorship of specifications for modular components and the auditing of published libraries that ensure interoperability among various ZKP solutions.</p><p>To that end, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">DIF Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group</a> is starting a collaborative initiative to work on a range of ZKP solutions that can address the credential use cases of DIF members, with an eye to building a foundation for ZKP interoperability and cryptographic agility in the wider identity community. This includes:</p>  Work on ZKP cryptographic schemes and primitives  Specifications that ensure interoperable presentation and verification for credentials generated using a variety of different schemes  The libraries and tooling to generate and validate credentials generated with different schemes  Approaches to utilizing ZKPs at scale in low-level DID and VC operations, informed by prior art, such as how ZK-Rollups are utilized to scale token transactions in Ethereum’s <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">Layer&nbsp;2</a>.  <p>A number of organizations with ZKP experience and skin in the game are coming together to participate in this initiative, which will produce specifications, code, documentation to advance interoperability across the community:</p> MATTR <p><a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR</a> has been actively investing in the development of a performant multi-message digital signature scheme supporting selective disclosure via Zero Knowledge Proofs.

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of iProov?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.iproov.com/">iProov’s</a> mission is to make the internet a safer place for businesses and consumers. We provide trusted biometric authentication that is seamless, secure and effortless. Our vision is for all  governments and enterprise institutions to  be confident that the remote user is real and can be trusted. iProov strongly believes that the user and usability should be the heart of any solution and as such must be accessible to all users irrespective of their abilities, literacy and digital capability.</p>



<p>iProov ensures trust online through Genuine Presence Assurance. Governments, financial institutions and other enterprises are using iProov’s Genuine Presence Assurance technology to ensure that an online user is not only the right person, but that they are a real person and authenticating right now. This unique approach protects against impersonation and criminal attacks, providing the highest levels of security alongside effortless usability. </p>



  



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>One of the most significant challenges with digital service is establishing trust. A key element of which is how to bind the digital identity attributes of a person, to the person and assuring only they can assert that identity. As online digital becomes the primary channel to interact with services, customers and citizens are increasingly vulnerable to impersonation attacks from fraudsters compromising their identity. It is crucial to have consented, secure and effortless identity verification and authentication for everyone.</p>



<p>In many economies, parts of the citizen population have no formal identity documentation. Embracing digital identities will enable all members of society to be included, enabling them to unlock access to services previously not possible.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does iProov address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identities are the cornerstone of doing businesses in the 21st century, they offer speed and flexibility in remote interactions which creates greater competition, economical efficiency, and greater citizen empowerment and inclusion.</p>



<p>iProov provides governments and enterprises with a very high level of assurance that the person interacting with their service is the legitimate user while protecting against criminal attacks. iProov Genuine Presence Assurance technology ensures trust by validating and authenticating users online to the highest level of certainty i.e. that a user is a real person, the right person, and authenticating right now.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>DIACC is playing a critically important role in coordinating a national digital identity and framework in a way that is notably lacking in the US and UK. By showing how a liberal democracy can successfully empower citizens with a nationally structured system of digital identity, Canada will exert a very powerful influence on both sides of the Atlantic and help lead the G7 to a better place.</p>



<p>5. Why did iProov join the DIACC?</p>



<p>iProov believes that trust between a provider and its citizens or customers must be achieved alongside two critical objectives:</p>



  Accessibility and inclusion – providing services which offer maximum access, irrespective of their abilities, literacy and digital savviness.  Sustainable security – ensuring a secure environment, business processes and centralized management controls to flexibly evolve and manage future, unknown risks.  



<p>It is this experience and insight that iProov brings to DIACC and can help DIACC in developing digital identity standards. </p>



<p>6. What else should we know about iProov?</p>



<p>The iProov solutions are trusted at national scale levels today with institutions such as:</p>



  The UK National Health Service – iProov provides strong authentication to onboard citizens in the UK to the NHS Login mobile app. With iProov, citizens registering for the NHS app are able to authenticate themselves in real-time with the image on their passport or driver’s license, allowing them to book medical appointments, order repeat prescriptions, and gain access to their patient record.   The UK Home Office – the EU Settled Status scheme is utilizing iProov to assure the genuine presence of remote users and to verify that the applicant is the rightful holder of the validated ID document. Over 3 million EU citizens have used the service to apply for permanent residency status.  



<p>It is this experience and insight that iProov brings to DIACC and can help DIACC in developing digital identity standards. </p>



<p>iProov’s proven, simple and inclusive user experience is critical to the service we offer to our Government and Enterprise customers, and has been a key contributor to our successful engagements with some of the world’s most security-conscious and user-friendly organizations. </p>

<p>Adversarial machine learning (ML), the study of subverting ML systems, is moving at a rapid pace. Researchers have written more than 2,000 papers examining this phenomenon in the last 6 years.

Researchers have used adversarial ML techniques to identify flaws in<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10099"> Facebook’s micro-targeting ad platform</a>, expose vulnerabilities in<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/self-driving/three-small-stickers-on-road-can-steer-tesla-autopilot-into-oncoming-lane"> Tesla’s</a> self driving cars, replicate ML models hosted in<a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/cloudleak-large-scale-deep-learning-models-stealing-through-adversarial-examples/"> Microsoft, Google and IBM</a>, and<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kxp83/researchers-easily-trick-cylances-ai-based-antivirus-into-thinking-malware-is-goodware"> evade anti-virus engines</a>.</p><p>Studying or testing the security of any operational system potentially runs afoul of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the primary federal statute that creates liability for hacking. The broad scope of the CFAA has been heavily criticized, with <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-asks-supreme-court-rule-violating-terms-service-isnt-crime-under-cfaa">security researchers among the most vocal</a>. They argue the CFAA — with its rigid requirements and heavy penalties — has a chilling effect on security research.

United States for the adversarial ML field. This work was published at the Law and Machine Learning Workshop held at 2020 International Conference on Machine Learning&nbsp;(ICML).</p><p>In the paper, we consider two CFAA sections particularly relevant to adversarial machine learning.</p>  First, intentionally accessing a computer “without authorization” or in a way that “exceeds authorized access” and as a result obtains “any information” on a “protected computer” (section 1030(a)(2)(C)). This landscape is particularly complex and confusing given the current circuit&nbsp;split.  CFAA Interpretation By Circuit Court&nbsp;Region  Second, intentionally causing “damage” to a “protected computer” without authorization by “knowingly” transmitting a “program, information, code, or command” (section 1030(a)(5)(A)).   Takeaways from the&nbsp;paper <blockquote>Is the Adversarial ML Researcher violating the CFAA when attacking an ML system? Depending on the nature of the adversarial ML attack, and which US State the lawsuit is brought, the answer&nbsp;varies.</blockquote>  Using the example of a ML service whose rules are based on Google API’s Terms of Service (TOS), we considered a range of adversarial ML attacks in light of the CFAA. We show how taking into account the circuit split on how section 1030(a)(2) should be interpreted, and 1030(a)(5)(A), whether the researcher is committing a violation or&nbsp;not.  Adversarial ML Legal&nbsp;Risks<blockquote>If the Supreme Court follows the Ninth Circuit’s narrow construction when it decides Van Buren, it will lead to better security outcomes for adversarial ML research in the long&nbsp;term.</blockquote><p>2. If ML security researchers and industry actors cannot rely on expansive TOSs to deter against certain forms of adversarial attacks, it will provide a powerful incentive to develop more robust technological and code-based protections. And with a more narrow construction of the CFAA, ML security researchers are more likely to be conducting tests and other exploratory work on ML systems, again leading to better security in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Link to full paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16179">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16179</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/legal-risks-of-adversarial-machine-learning-research-b2e0b8e106ee">Legal Risks of Adversarial Machine Learning Research</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kantara To Share Its Digital Identity Assurance Program Learnings, Schemes, Specifications, Best Practice Guidelines To Support Digital Identity New Zealand’s Mission&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>WAKEFIELD, Mass., USA and WELLINGTON, New Zealand – July 15, 2020 — <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> announced today that it has agreed a Memorandum of Understanding with <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity New Zealand</a> (DINZ) to support the goal of energizing New Zealand’s digital identity ecosystem development, where everyone can prove who they are digitally to organizations in a secure and trusted way.&nbsp; Kantara will share its digital identity assurance program learnings, schemes, specifications and best practice guidelines with DINZ in support of its mission.</p>
<p>With headquarters in the United States and the European Union, Kantara is the leading global consortium improving trustworthy use of identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice.&nbsp; Kantara has similar collaboration agreements in Canada and Europe as well as being <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/800-63-3/">the only organization providing third party assessment and assurance against the US National Institute of Standards and Technology SP 800-63-3 for identity</a> and authentication.</p>
<p>DINZ is a purpose driven, inclusive, membership funded organization, whose members have a shared passion for the opportunities that digital identity can offer. DINZ supports a sustainable, inclusive and trustworthy digital future for all New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Kantara Executive Director and Native New Zealander Colin Wallis said, “For a decade, Kantara has worked with governments and standards-bodies internationally sharing its assurance program knowledge, schemes, specifications and best practices in the digital identity and privacy space with the goal of building trustworthy networks and ensuring people have agency over their data. We’ve worked hard to align these programs for multi-jurisdictional adoption and believe that Kantara’s global mission and DINZ’s national goals are mutually supportive.&nbsp; We look forward to working together and sharing knowledge, not only to drive forward ecosystem development in New Zealand but also to support improved global interoperability of digital identity. The effort will work hand in hand with the public sector digital identity initiatives – the Department of Internal Affairs in New Zealand, the Digital Transformation Agency in Australia and the US Postal Service – all of whom support the Kantara Initiative.”</p>
<p>Andrew Weaver, Digital Identity New Zealand’s Executive Director, said, “Collaboration is at the heart of our work here at Digital Identity New Zealand. We are excited to be working with the Kantara Initiative, drawing from the depth of wisdom and experience they have built up over the last ten years.&nbsp; In return we hope to share some of our digital identity journey here in Aotearoa/New Zealand with the wider Kantara community.&nbsp; Since our establishment late in 2018 we have been introduced to and explored the concept of ‘Identity as Taonga’, Taonga being a Maori word that describes something precious and treasured, worthy of the highest levels of dignity, care and respect.&nbsp; We look forward to exploring these ideas with other communities around the world, learning together what it means to build truly inclusive and diverse identity ecosystems”</p>

<p>The pandemic has changed everything – in small, invisible ways and in big, obvious, and often dramatic shifts. “It is not business as usual. People are rushing to find solutions, and people who were procrastinating are committed to changing,” explained Patrick Drolet, VP, Operations and Product Strategy, <a href="https://diacc.ca/2016/05/05/spotlight-on-notarius/">Notarius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional sectors, like the legal sector, banking, education, and government, are particularly impacted by requirements to stay physically distant. As organizations that are heavily reliant on paper documents, witnesses, and face-to-face meetings, working in a new digital and decentralized format can present challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What has amazed me is the variety of people who want to go digital,” Marc St-Jacques, VP, Sales and Marketing at Notarius said. “Everything from government to industry, health, [and] universities.”</p>



<p>Making the transition to digital isn’t always straightforward. For many of these secure, highly sensitive industries, a foundation of strong, trusted, and protected digital identity is necessary to continue operating. As individuals and businesses shift their focus and, in some cases, scramble to quickly adapt, a delta is opening up between those who were already moving towards digital transformation – and those who were dragging their feet.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“It is not business as usual. People are rushing to find solutions, and people who were procrastinating are committed to changing.” </p></blockquote>



<p>“On the one hand, individuals forced into digital are going now. It also illustrates the disparity between approaches. The shift has made everyone stand out,” St-Jacques explained. Whether it’s because they’re practiced in offering digital solutions or because they’ve been holding off, St-Jacques says it’s easy to see how different businesses operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>, can help close the gap between early adopters and laggards, and ensure everyone has a clear path to operating in an increasingly digital-first world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Notarius, there are two product lines that have been in high-demand in the wake of COVID-19. The traditional “old fashioned identity” that is consistently a big part of their business, and renewed interest in the document part. Secure, remote digital signatures and document execution are presenting a lot of opportunities for their clients to move forward. At the onset of the pandemic, they offered 60-day free trials and special offers, helping make the transition even easier for clients.<br></p>



<p>Witnessing the Shift in Industries</p>



<p>The industries who are showing the most interest are traditional sectors that may have been slow to adopt and adapt to digital technologies. “We are seeing a lot of appetite from the government. It is refreshing to see, as [the sector] has been slow to adopt. The biggest uptake, though, is in the university marketplace, both inside and outside of Quebec. They have moved quickly,” St-Jacques said.</p>



<p>“In many instances, organizations were held back by a department or two,” St-Jacques explained. “Legal departments were often the roadblock.” Those departments, including IT and government sectors, are now transforming rapidly to keep up.</p>



<p>The change is not – and cannot – only happen at the organizational level, though. From provincial to federal governments, the pandemic is accelerating change. “There is a long list of laws that were not ID-friendly. Government used to be so slow. They are moving now, which is super exciting,” Drolet said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One example is the notary bar in Quebec, a completely paper-based line of work. Although digital transformation was under consideration for the past four or five years, in the COVID-19 era, it took just three weeks for a temporary law to be passed so notaries can work in a digital format.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across the board, attitudes are changing and, in many cases, charting a digital path forward is no longer an option – it’s necessary for survival. The <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> ensures businesses from all industries will be able to interact seamlessly with government and other industries, creating more efficiencies and helping all Canadian industries meet a baseline for privacy, security and usability.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Digital ID Helps Maintain Connections Across Closed Borders</p>



<p>In a highly connected, global environment, these tools offer more options to continue connecting internationally. “Foreign students need their transcripts, they want to do their exams. Transcripts are like the identity of organizations,” St-Jacques explained, connecting the trends in education to other sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through Notarius, these identifying documents are connected with a digital signature that it is clear and immediate, appealing to teams around the world. “We’re seeing requests from Europe, Asia, and the US,” St-Jacques shared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For the international part, we are the only one recognized by Adobe. We were the only platform certified with EIDAS, with the highest standards,” Drolet explained.<br></p>



<p>Looking Ahead as Old Barriers Come Down</p>



<p>While the situation has not been ideal for anyone, the speed with which many have had to respond to this serious outbreak has led to some positive changes. “Usually it would be a structured and siloed process. Now, everyone is scrambling and can take initiative,” Drolet shared. “They see the value and what used to take weeks, now takes 15 minutes. Unfortunately, the pandemic was the driver.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what does the future look like?</p>



<p>For digital identity, Drolet predicts a surge in interest and adoption. “Who are your competitors in the ID space? The bad guy used to be the pen, now even that guy is going away,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For industries, St-Jacques envisions lasting change. “I really don’t see people going back,” St-Jacques predicts. Old concerns about security, processes, and reluctance to change are being dissolved, as the rapid changes set precedent for what’s possible.</p>



<p>No matter what comes to pass, digital identity will be an important lever for success. <a href="https://diacc.ca/membership/join-diacc/">Join Canada’s digital identity ecosystem</a> to be a part of leading the change.<br>The <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> ensures privacy, security, and accessibility remain features of our economy as all industries face a global push to go digital.

<p>Rosalie Dowding interviews Natalie Smolenski, Head of Business Development at Hyland Credentials.</p>
 What do you do? 
Natalie Smolenski
<p>I lead business development for Hyland Credentials, which specializes in verifiable digital credentials using blockchain technology. Until the beginning of this year, we were a separate company called Learning Machine. I’m part of the Learning Machine founding team, so I’ve been here since the very beginning.</p>
<p>Learning Machine itself actually grew out of another company that specialised in admission systems for higher education. Blockcerts came out of conversations we regularly had with admissions offices around the world about the difficulties they regularly have verifying official records. We found they were all keen to see a full portfolio package from each applicant: that means fully validated, verifiable credentials, consolidated official records. That technology didn’t exist yet, so we began working with one of our customers – MIT – to build it. We were pulled in on a research project, at the time called Trustless Transcripts, which later became Blockcerts, or blockchain certificates. We released Blockcerts in 2016 under an MIT open source license.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, we’ve been committed to open standards for digital credentials and digital identity. A standards-based future is essential for establishing a successful digital identity ecosystem. It’s really at the core of our mission – there was no way to scale email or the World Wide Web without interoperable and open standards that everyone can use.</p>
<p>In 2017, Learning Machine went to market with the first product for issuing verifiable credentials at scale. We got quite a bit of customer traction, and in 2020 we were bought by Hyland. It’s been a really wonderful journey – focusing on building the open standards as a company, and then personally taking responsibility for making adoption happen as Head of Business Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Learning Machine has recently been acquired by Hyland – what does this mean? 
<p>There’s been a lot of momentum in the digital identity and credentialing space in recent years, and this really validates that market. Credentialing has been the most mature application of blockchain technology outside of cryptocurrency. In fact, a lot of the large players and multinationals have been developing blockchain credentialing solutions, or saying they’re going to, as are a growing crop of startups.</p>
<p>The Hyland acquisition demonstrates that a large, established software player can find a fruitful partnership with a lean start up like Learning Machine, to deliver a leading-edge solution to its vast portfolio of customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 You’ve got a whole range of clients across sectors – so how easy is it to support different companies? 
<p>We were fortunate in when we launched our product back in 2017, as it was the peak of the blockchain hype cycle. That generated a lot of inbound interest from institutions who wanted to learn everything they could about blockchain credentialing. People wanted to see blockchain in action, so I became sort of an educator, explaining the underlying technology, doing demos, and showing how our product could be used for standards-compliant credentialing implementations. All to a really receptive audience. Of course, each institution is slightly different – their priorities will vary, but there’s a lot of commonality in how people learn and metabolise a change in the market like this.</p>
<p>The majority of our customers are in education, because that’s the space we grew out of and where Learning Machine had an established reputation as a brand. However, there are countless adjacent use cases. We’ve grown to having customers around the world, ranging from educational institutions (Higher Ed and K-12) to governments and professional licensing organisations. Ultimately, any document officially issued by a provider could be a verifiable credential; for example, vital records, licenses, passports, and property or land titles/deeds. Right now we’re seeing particular interest from healthcare organisations for things like physician and practitioner credentialing, and even prescriptions or medical records of patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Does that education around blockchain trickle down to the end user? 
<p>There are a number of different categories of end users. For those using the credentialing system (our direct customers), they get trained and onboarded, and then we work closely with them to reach out to the students or civil servants (their “customers”) that are using the credentials. We help our clients educate their end users with anything from emails to webinars to partnering with local organisations or people impacted by the change. There’s a whole range of communication methods that helps all people using or affected by the technology to make sure they understand it.</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a whole range of communication methods that helps all people using or affected by the technology to make sure they understand it.</p></blockquote>
 As someone with paper based education certificates, I feel like I really need this 
<p>Haha! Yes, I love to say that I sell what I want, which makes my job so much easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What does a normal week look like for you? 
<p>It’s kind of a blessing that I don’t really have a normal week. One day I might be in Malta on customer visits with the Ministry of Education – one of the organisations in the country that we work very closely with. Another week I might be in New York doing a workshop with a multinational organisation or working on a proposal for a major US university school system. The great thing about business development is you fly as fast as you can, so each week can be considerably different to the next.</p>
<p>In this role, you have to very adaptive due to the range of challenges each week. One of the things I learned early on is that being “right” actually doesn’t matter very much – it’s all about communicating in a meaningful way to your audience. People respond as much to who you are as to what you say. If they don’t see you as a partner, as someone who is in this process of transformation together with them, it will be hard to build trust.</p>
<p>Another thing that’s critical in a business development role is that you have your own principles and reason from them, adapting to the cultural context of your audience. Listen to people’s concerns and priorities to find a solution that really works for them. As long as you can forge a joint trajectory that you’re both on, then there’s a path forward together.</p>
<p>An essential part of this is that I never assume that someone I’m talking to shares my vocabulary or understands the context for a particular term or value I hold. So there’s a constant stream of diplomacy underlying my work. It’s kind of a social analogue for open standards being fundamental for establishing common understanding. In my previous life, I was an anthropologist and had to learn multiple languages and cultural idioms. This has come in very handy in my current role.</p>
<blockquote><p>Being “right” actually doesn’t matter very much – it’s all about communicating in a meaningful way to your audience</p></blockquote>
 Do you have to explain the fundamentals of blockchain now? Or do you find people are now starting to understand it more generally? 
<p>In the early days, all people wanted to talk about was, “What is blockchain?” Today, some still want to talk about this, but more people want to talk about the value of blockchain; what problems it can actually solve, rather than concerns about what the technology is. In the same way that most people who use other software applications don’t really care about all the details of what’s going on underneath, they just want to know the features of the service and whether it will make their lives easier or not.</p>
<p>Because we’re in a more mature market today, people often have a better sense for what they want blockchain to do for them. From that I can dissect their business problem and then start working through a solution—if there is one. Blockchain isn’t a panacea; there are many problems it can’t solve, but some things it does extremely well. It’s all about finding if there’s a fit. Today, anything having to do with credentialing is something we can address at Hyland—from issuing the verifiable credential to all the case management work that happens prior to the credential issuance. The products we have are extraordinarily flexible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Were you always interested in technology? 
<p>Both of my parents were software engineers, so I was always around it, but my interests and expertise were in the social sciences. I’m a trained anthropologist, so I’m primarily interested in the social origins and impacts of technologies. One of the things I found really compelling about blockchain is how it’s created this space for experimenting with new governance models, in an era when existing institutions are coming under really intense political scrutiny.</p>
<p>Sovereignty is also fascinating, and was one of the areas of social theory I specialized in during my graduate work. I’m currently working on a research paper on sovereignty in general and self-sovereignty more specifically. When we use these words, what do we mean? For example, how does our understanding of sovereignty affect our view of currency? What would it mean for currency to be de-nationalised (i.e. through Bitcoin)? What would be the implications for the sovereign state and ultimately capitalism? What happens to the form of political economy that we currently live in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 If you were CEO what would you make compulsory and what would you ban? 
<p>My answers to both of these questions have less to do with setting rules than with looking for certain qualities in the character of the people that I would bring onboard.</p>
<p>I would ensure that people in my company are skilled in what they do, or demonstrate a capacity to learn, but most importantly that they have a capacity to work closely with others to achieve a common goal. A number of studies of successful organisations have shown that this ability to work well as part of a team has more impact on a company’s long-term success than even the skills that people have. This is because people who feel safe and in solidarity with the rest of their team are able to move mountains; even top performers’ abilities are amplified when they can rely on their colleagues to have their back. That said, if you’re trying to build cutting-edge technology and successfully take it to market, you do also need to be able to attract and retain top talent. That is why leading these kinds of organizations is no easy task.</p>
<blockquote><p>People who feel safe and in solidarity with the rest of their team are able to move mountains</p></blockquote>
<p>The one thing I would ban is bad faith, by which I mean people who demonstrate they’re engaging in anything other than good faith interactions. Bad faith is toxic regardless of where people are in a hierarchy. Each person in an organisation is a pillar that supports the success of that company. Conflict is natural and often healthy, but bad faith is a character issue that is tenacious and quickly spreads to others. It is fundamentally at odds with solidarity and just needs to be rooted out.</p>
 What book/film/music/art would you recommend to others? 
<p>There are so many, but I would have to say the most extraordinary film I’ve seen in recent years is Arrival. I actually wrote an essay about it because it showed how science can be a diplomatic endeavour. In the film, scientists are deployed to be mediators between humans and a completely alien species. Their patient proximity to the aliens enables them to learn a fundamentally new form of language. The courage of the scientists is especially moving—they could have been killed at any point in the encounter, but they persisted—for everyone’s sake. It’s a film that’s deeply inspired me.</p>

 the security checks done in the certification suites (is this just the FAPI suite or do the OBIE tests cover some security checks?) 
 the security advantages of the OB directory model vs eIDAS 
 the apparent conflict between security and interoperability, especially in bank environments 
 how the certification programs attempt to ensure both security and interoperability 
 
<p>OIDF and OBIE continue to collaborate to help drive global open banking initiatives with the following goals:</p>
 
 To update participants on the latest developments in both the OIDF Financial-Grade API (FAPI) profile and the OBIE Standard. 
 To demonstrate the respective conformance tools and the benefits of certification including why conformance and certification is critical to ensuring standards are secure and interoperable. 
 To provide participants with help and support in using these tools. 
 To encourage a greater number of certifications. 
 Ultimately to help grow the open banking ecosystem, enhancing security and benefits for participants and end customers.

 Today, ID2020 announced its newest Alliance partner, the National Cybersecurity Center&nbsp;(NCC). <p>ID2020 was founded in 2016 to ensure that all people have access to better forms of digital ID, bringing together nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>Founded in 2016 by the former Governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC) is a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit committed to promoting cyber innovation and awareness.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to welcome the National Cybersecurity Center to the ID2020 Alliance,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “Because technology is evolving so quickly, many of the transactions that once took place in person and required traditional forms of ID are today being conducted digitally. Cyber threats, whether criminal or state-state sponsored, underscore the urgency and importance of ID2020 and the NCC’s collective efforts. We look forward to sharing our expertise and learning from their world-class team of cybersecurity experts.”</blockquote><p>With a mission to “secure the world”, the NCC has four main initiatives:</p><p>● Secure the Vote seeks to increase voter confidence in the U.S. on the accuracy of vote-counting, and to generate greater awareness of possible solutions to critical gaps in the voting infrastructure. Secure the Vote supports jurisdictions’ efforts to offer a secure, auditable mobile voting option for overseas voters through coordinating, and evaluating pilots across the&nbsp;country.</p><p>● Secure Smart Cities: Hyper-connectivity amongst smart devices and urbanization drive the need for cities to become more efficient in their operations as they continue to grow, but the concern of security impedes the overall advancement of several cities with “Smart”&nbsp;agendas.</p><p>● The NCC’s Cyber Education Program provides cybersecurity leadership, and one of the main pillars is K-12 education. As our nation addresses the critical gap in skilled cybersecurity talent, NCC addresses the importance of cyber education through programs and partnerships that invite students to participate in an ecosystem that encourages them to learn, explore, and build their&nbsp;skills.</p><p>○ The NCC’s K-12 initiative, the National Cybersecurity Center Student Alliance (NCCSA) offers opportunities for middle and high school students to improve technical literacy through fun, interactive, and challenging camps, field trips, workshops, and events. NCC encourages STEM education for all students, with special attention towards creating inviting and collaborative opportunities for girls and other underrepresented groups in the cyber ecosystem.</p><p>● The Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), a separate nonprofit organization, has the mission to facilitate collaboration across the global space industry to enhance our ability to prepare for and respond to vulnerabilities, incidents, and threats; to disseminate timely and actionable information among member entities; and to serve as the primary communications channel for the sector with respect to this information.</p><blockquote>“Digital citizenship is an increasingly critical space as more of our identity is online,” said NCC Director of Business and Government Initiatives, Forrest Senti. “The NCC’s work to secure cyberspace intersects directly with ID2020’s work to protect individuals’ online identity and to ensure that policies created around that protection are fair and equitable and ensure the utmost security for citizens around the world. We look forward to working with ID2020 to pioneer new ways to secure the future of identity.”</blockquote><p>The future of digital ID is at an important crossroads. As policymakers in the US and around the world struggle to confront the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, some are considering plans for digital identity-based health credentials to facilitate a return to work, school, and other social activities. The risks to privacy and security are high, as are the rewards of doing it right. ID2020 is working urgently with its partners and other stakeholders to ensure that privacy and data security are built into the technical architecture of these systems and that the appropriate legislative and regulatory are developed to guide their implementation.</p><p>ID2020 and the National Cybersecurity Center share a common mission to secure our individual and collective privacy and security. We welcome them to the Alliance and look forward to working collaboratively to advance our shared&nbsp;goals.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions. By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.ID2020.org">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About National Cybersecurity Center</p><p>Established in 2016, The National Cybersecurity Center exists to help secure the world using knowledge, connections, and resources to solve global cybersecurity challenges and develop a protected cyber ecosystem. An independent and non-profit think tank based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the NCC provides cyber innovation and awareness and is a leader in cyber education, workforce development, and informing public&nbsp;policy.</p><p><a href="http://www.cyber-center.org">www.cyber-center.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-welcomes-the-national-cybersecurity-center-to-the-alliance-a8af0261e69f">ID2020 Welcomes the National Cybersecurity Center to the Alliance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched a new microsite, LoginWithFIDO.com, for high level, non-technical information about FIDO for consumers and service providers. As part of this project, we wanted to learn more about consumer attitudes and habits around authentication. What are their password habits? What do they think about the FIDO approach? Do they want to see FIDO at login?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out, we conducted a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers – the results of which we’ll be sharing on this webinar. Join us to see the findings from our research and to learn how you may be able to utilize the data for your own FIDO offerings and/or deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to hear:&nbsp;</p>



  How many different passwords consumers really use for their online accounts  What tactics they use for password management and how often they are resetting passwords and&nbsp;  Their familiarity with various types of authentication technologies including SMS OTPs, biometrics and others  The types of apps and services where consumers most want to use FIDO  How consumers want to be communicated with about FIDO at enrollment and login  



<p>We will also give the audience a detailed look at LoginWithFIDO.com and how you can consider using it for your own educational initiatives around FIDO. You’ll learn:</p>



  How to navigate through the microsite and its two landing pages  How you can reference the site and its materials for your own offerings and deployments  Added insights into how to utilize FIDO’s consumer-facing marks

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Peer Social?&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://peer.social">Peer Social</a> is a team of dedicated decentralists who are researching and developing new architectures and technologies to solve some of the most pressing problems of our time—starting with social media. We are committed to eliminating the dynamic of user exploitation, which has become commonplace on the social internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social networks and centralized Cloud service providers require users to agree to terms which include giving up control of their personal data in return for using their network or service. They use this agreement as a blanket authorization to host, track and store, their users’ online activities and behaviours. The <a href="https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/">Surveillance Capitalism</a> business model represents the worst excesses of the social Internet—we are here to change it.</p>



<p>Over the past 2 years we have assembled a super-talented team of security architects, designers, developers, and some of the world’s best academic researchers to build a secure, distributed, mobile networking app, which allows users to create their own private network (using a secure blockchain)—it’s called <a href="https://peer.social/manyone/">Manyone</a>. Manyone is a safe, digital environment where users control their personal information, connections, and unique personas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to fix content moderation, content hosting, and the ownership problems of today’s social Internet by giving users decentralized ownership and control of their data. We want everyone to have a self-sovereign, self-hosted, digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



 <a href="https://peer.social/"></a> 



<p>2. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users having a real, verifiable, trusted, digital identity solution is the ambition of every person, country and every business. Enabling one true digital identity for every human would improve access to services like healthcare, government, and banking by uncoupling this access from traditional identity issuers—this would give the under-privileged and under-banked the ability to establish their own unique digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Economies around the world, including Canada, are going to need to rebuild quickly. Imagine a world where all people had their own self-sovereign digital identity. By establishing immutable links to every citizen at the individual level—we would remove the friction (measured in both time and money) associated with accessing online services/support. Digital access that is efficient, secure, and convenient for everyone is key in helping rebuild and transform economies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. How does your organization address the needs of this&nbsp;transformation? </p>



<p>Peer Social focuses on an increasingly important component to any digital identity architecture by enabling true, verifiable, self-sovereign digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any individual user, business or government wanting to create a self-sovereign digital identity can do so by recording it on a personal blockchain and securely sharing it with other people and institutions over a private distributed network.</p>



<p>We aim to deliver the simplest, yet most powerful, self-sovereign, verified, decentralized digital identity platform we can for our users.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have as a leader in this space?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canada is in a unique position to take a leadership role in the global digital identity market by already possessing a foundation of ‘trust’—essential for any successful solution. Brand Canada has a lot of admirers around the world and it is easy to imagine a robust and cutting edge, Canadian-built digital identity solution gaining wide acceptance at a global level.</p>



<p>In today’s world, Canadians are more likely to trust a self-sovereign, digital identity solution that is architected and built in Canada. In fact, a digital identity solution produced in Canada is more likely to be accepted as a global standard due to Canada’s reputation as a fair and open society.</p>



<p>5. Why did your Peer Social join the DIACC and what else should we know about your organization?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peer Social joined DIACC to become more engaged (at the policy level) in the Canadian digital identity conversation. We live in interesting times, where a lot of attention is being paid to digital identity and how to produce the best solution to meet the needs of traditional identity issuers like banks and governments—while still respecting individual users’ civil liberties. Joining DIACC is a great way to connect and listen to what others have to say—as well as add our voice to the discussion.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on <a href="https://peer.social">Peer Social</a>. We are launching our first generation, decentralized, self-sovereign, digital identity mobile App, <a href="https://peer.social/manyone/">Manyone</a>, very soon— allowing each of us to take our first steps towards a self-sovereign, digital future.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director at the FIDO Alliance, offers an update on the group’s efforts to reduce reliance on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inforisktoday.com/identity-access-management-c-446">passwords</a>&nbsp;and discusses how to overcome barriers.</p>



<p>In the next phase of the effort, developers will start building websites that can support the FIDO2 standards. “The Web authentication protocol and the FIDO2 standards, for the first time, present an open, public API that any developer can use to add FIDO to their site,” he explains.</p>



<p>In a video interview with Information Security Media Group, Shikiar discusses:</p>



  How the alliance is working to reduce the reliance on passwords;  FIDO’s efforts to educate consumers;  The barriers to establishing a password-free environment – and how to overcome them.  



<p>Shikiar is the executive director and chief marketing officer at the FIDO Alliance, a global consortium working to create open standards and an interoperable ecosystem for simpler, stronger user authentication. He previously led market development efforts for the Tizen Association, the LiMo Foundation and the Liberty Alliance Project.</p>

 Getting involved, contributing, and following along will be easier than&nbsp;ever <p>The DIF has an active core of startups and dedicated teams at larger corporations known for their swift co-development within the foundation. Over time, this has led to rapid deployment of several useful specifications, reference implementations, and cross-competitor conversations that have solidified a vision of the broadly-interoperable decentralized identity stack. A healthy and diverse market is coming into focus today, due in large part to these&nbsp;efforts.</p><p>Limiting participation to dues-paying members proved more of a barrier to entry than expected, however, and it is clear that the paywall to participation limits inclusiveness and community-wide discussion. As both of these are critical components for building a solid and lasting foundation for truly decentralized identity solutions, DIF will be shifting to a more open modus operandi.</p><blockquote>Effective 18 June 2020, DIF has opened up participation to all technical working groups for companies under 1000 employees.</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ZbZuNj1j414">Ahnaf Tahsin&nbsp;Rafi</a><p>Going forward, attendance and substantial participation in all DIF-governed working group meetings, including IPR-protected ones, will be free to join as “contributors” for small- and medium-sized interested parties, with these defined as companies with under 1000 employees. Individual/freelance contributors without relevant IPR obligations to their clients will continue to be eligible to participate for free under appropriate legal agreements. Working Groups co-hosted with other organizations will continue to benefit from community-wide free participation regardless of organization type and&nbsp;size.</p><blockquote>More information on how to join&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/join">here</a>.</blockquote><p>Small- and medium-sized enterprises are encouraged to join as DIF full members, which have their logos listed on the site and are highlighted in DIF’s external communications. Other benefits to full membership include programming access to forthcoming special interest groups to guide the formation of industry-focused markets and other non-IPR-protected initiatives within the organization. More information on those initiatives is forthcoming.</p> The Genealogy of the Grand&nbsp;Opening <p>DIF was founded over 3 years ago to create a neutral space for co-developing and co-designing the key elements and protocols of a decentralized interoperable identity stack made up of interchangeable parts. Over the years, the member companies and individual contributors to the foundation have helped to raise the profile of decentralized identity on a global scale. Its contribution-first philosophy, pre-competitive cooperation ethos, and professionalism around IPR protection and recordkeeping have allowed it to make many substantial, useful, and agile contributions to various commercial and non-commercial stacks.</p><p>The shift really began at IIW28, when Oliver Terbu and Rouven Heck convened a session which produced a useful <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-self-sovereign-identity-stack-8a2cc95f2d45">overview</a> of the decentralized identity stack as a more grokkable whole, seemingly visible on the horizon by the end of 2019. A few months later, Daniel Buchner, then Executive Director, co-wrote an <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/rhythm-and-melody-how-hubs-and-agents-rock-together-ac2dd6bf8cf4">article</a> with Sam Curren addressing the false dichotomy between Microsoft’s Identity Hub design principles and the agent-focused architecture of the Aries community. Were there other mirages making practical interoperability seem further away than it really&nbsp;was?</p><p>Then, at the second DIF semi-annual meeting of 2019, traditionally an update meeting where for different workstreams to compare notes and coordinate, executive director Rouven Heck gave a keynote presentation before the updates. He invited DIF’s membership to reflect on how DIF related to adjacent decentralized-identity communities and development organizations. Were we siloing research and risking double-work? How could we bring about greater convergence of the stack, by harmonizing with and optimizing for the work already underway elsewhere?</p><p>DIF might not have changed much in the previous six months, but the landscape was changing. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has finalized the core VC specification and was ramping up to finalize the core DID specification in the coming half-year; what came next? The Hyperledger Foundation’s focus, having restructured and set an ambitious roadmap for interoperability after pushing forward the next iteration of the Indy blockchain at the core of many SSI systems, was getting a lot of attention outside the decentralized identity community with its promises of production-grade systems. If DIF continued on its code-driven, “build it first” trajectory, could we end up competing with, more than complementing, these adjacent projects?</p><p>With his quick slideshow presentation, Rouven started socializing and recruiting support for a vision of DIF that did as much coordination as co-development. A key feature of this strategy was identifying cross-community development work that would benefit from IPR protection and DIF infrastructure and inviting communities to come together in the repositories.</p><p>The first of these joint efforts was the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-starts-didcomm-working-group-9c114d9308dc">DIDComm</a> working group, identifying ways to accelerate the interoperability of wallet-to-wallet communications beyond the Indy stack, a working group that is still doing important and influential work to this day, including sending the first draft proposal to the IETF from a DIF WG. More recently, the Secure Data Storage working group has followed the same co-hosting approach, bringing a work item from the W3C community and an under-socialized contribution open-sourced by Microsoft Research together as the two model implementation inputs to what could well prove to be a widely-usable decentralized standard across all compliant stacks and most web-based contemporary topologies.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/4hcpIbqQM8c">Robert&nbsp;Bye</a> Conclusion <p>In 2020, the co-development of the widely-interoperable decentralized identity stack is turning a corner, and now more than ever it feels like we are in a crucial moment for structured and transparent cooperation to pre-empt any enclosure of the Commons. With the widest possible cooperation, we can build unity and grow the market before dividing it up into fiefdoms and brands. DIF is aiming to return to its roots and pitching a bigger tent than ever to make sure we get this right, together.</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates about new working groups and new ways to get involved.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>At its WWDC, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10670/">detailed</a> that its upcoming release of Safari in iOS and MacOS 14 will enable users to use Touch ID and Face ID for web logins, and we couldn’t be happier. It marks a giant step forward in the industry’s quest to move beyond passwords in favor of cryptographically secure authentication based on FIDO standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The functionality, based on the WebAuthn API in the FIDO2 standard, will make logging in to a website as easy as it is to unlock your iPhone or iPad using whichever biometric option is available. Apple’s built-in support in its stock web browser means that every modern device platform now has built-in FIDO support, which furthers our aim of making FIDO Authentication as ubiquitous as other critical internet protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To that end, we’ve recently provided a resource that shows the latest progress for FIDO support across browsers and platforms.&nbsp; This image (shown below) is permanently hosted on our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">WebAuthn resources page</a>.&nbsp;</p>







<p>It’s been really cool to watch this diagram grow both wider&nbsp; (adding in the Apple operating systems) and greener over the past 12 months or so since Apple ramped up its FIDO support. This rapid maturation and support for WebAuthn is accelerating adoption; with over 85 percent of today’s browsers now supporting FIDO Authentication, many service providers are now actively working to deploy FIDO to their customers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance was founded on a singular mission: To eliminate dependence on passwords by creating and driving adoption of open standards for simpler, stronger user authentication. Today, we’re closer to reaching that audacious goal that the FIDO ecosystem has been working on for the past several years. Thanks, Apple!</p>

 Becca Savory, Sarah McKeever &amp; Shaunak&nbsp;Sen  Session <p>Since its early days the Internet has been conceived in terms of both movement and landscape — from “cyberspace” to the “Information Superhighway” — and in popular perception is often viewed as a boundless space imagined in terms of limitless possibilities. Indeed, across our research fields, from digital media to performance and social activism, we find that the Internet is frequently perceived as a space of mobilisation: where moving bodies are remediated within online content; where the movement of images, ideas and bodies can occur freely, with the rapid transmission of the “viral”; and where movement(s) frequently spill over into physical geographies.</p><p>Yet increasingly the Internet is also a space of fractured and fragmented movement(s): of blockages and blockades, discontinuities and disappearances. Landscapes become territorialized and movement(s) confined or obstructed. On this basis, we propose an interdisciplinary discussion session around the theme of “#InternetMovement(s)”. We ask how we can conceive of movement(s) in relation to the Internet in India, in terms of both mobility and immobility, fissure and&nbsp;flow.</p><p>To encourage fluidity, we propose to structure the session around three “nodes” rather than three separate research papers. Our nodes are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  How can we conceive of movement(s) in relation to Internet research in&nbsp;India?  What are the forms that movement(s) take in our respective fields?  What “stop” or blocks” movement in these&nbsp;cases?  <p>The three co-conveners will each prepare a 5-minute response to each of these nodes, based on our specific areas of research. At each nodal point we will then allow time for wider discussion, enabling inter-disciplinary discussion and flow to underpin the&nbsp;session.</p><p>We perceive the session to speak to the first of the conference’s core questions: “How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?”</p><p>Each of the three co-convenors is approaching this question in their own research, asking how online media and communications mediate, remediate and transform the fields of film-media, social activism, and performance. We also ask the corollary: what are the limits and impediments to those transformations or mediations? The following section outlines the co-convenors’ approaches in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Plan  Statement of Intent&nbsp;I <p>The internet increasingly impresses traces on nearly all media technologies everyday. The once stable film body, gets disaggregated into various new forms of loop videos, GIFS, photo-memes, as clips and stills from disparate films get extracted, re-edited, patched and re-moulded into new user-generated media material. Solitary moments and gestures from films (a menacing wink by Jack Nicholson from The Shining, a clap from Charles Kane, a tear from the Tin-Man in The Wizard of Oz) get completely unchained from the original narrative context and used as discrete independent communicative units (Kane’s a popular Birthday wish gesture, while Nicholson’s Is a common linguistic unit signifying playful flirtation.) One of the primary ontological pegs of cinema — movement, today becomes the center of urgent debate around the status of photographs, movement-image forms like GIFs, and traditional moving images as the basic configuring elements of contemporary cinema. Using the film-GIF form as its primary vector this paper opens up the category of ‘movement’ philosophically as well as a constituent form to understand cinema today within the context of&nbsp;India.</p><p>As the cinematic object disperses into thousands of fragments hurtling through innumerable new online contexts, questions related to stardom also get radically transformed. I will be investigating a particular site of cinematic re-instansiation — the recent Alok Nath meme phenomenon. Long relegated to the margins of films as the venerable Hindu middle class father, the ‘’Alok Nath is so sanskaari..’’ set off a viral maelstrom that suddenly recast his cinematic body and the memory of a whole host of films (the Suraj Barjatya Hindu joint-family films). The paper focus on questions around movement as a philosophical arena as well as radical new form re-inscribing the cinematic in hitherto unprecedented shapes&nbsp;today.</p> Statement of Intent&nbsp;II <p>An examination of social movements with digital components in India begs several questions: What forms do social movements take in the digital world? How do we conceptualise social movements using digital and physical evidence? How does the context of India — as a functioning democracy — allow or restrict digital and physical social movements and define what is an “acceptable” protest movement? Engaging with these questions demands an interdisciplinary perspective, and exploring the interplays between the physical and the digital in regard to social issue protest movements.</p><p>Movement in my particular research area is understood in two aspects: the physical mobilisation of individuals to protest against perceived grievances and the movement of information around specific issue areas. The physical movement of bodies in public places is intimately connected to flow of information throughout digital networks, generating entangled and complex interfaces between the digital and the physical and creating new imagined possibilities of the efficacy of social protest (Castells 2012; Gerbaudo 2012). Examining recent social movements in New Delhi allows us to explore the linkages and disjuncture between the physical and digital, using theoretical developments in social movement theory to anchor the study (Earl, Hunt, and Garrett 2014; Krinsky and Crossley&nbsp;2014).</p><p>Examining the repercussions and strategies of physical/digital mobilisation can lead to a confrontation between the “imagined” possibilities of digital mobilisation and the realities of technological and physical blockages. These blockages can exist at the level of the network — both in digital and physical limitations — but also at the level of digital informational flow and who is allowed to view data? Confronting the “imagined” capabilities with the reality of entrenched power networks contests the notion of the digital as a free superhighway of information into a series of blocks and stoppages, restricting what is possible and feasible. By exploring question of movement(s) in New Delhi, I will explore the disjuncture between the imagined possibilities and the restriction of information — by nature of the algorithms that govern our capabilities and our own social networks — and complicate the triumphal narrative of the affordances of digital mediums on protest movements.</p><p>References</p><p>Castells, M.

Pgs.&nbsp;1–21</p><p>Statement of Intent&nbsp;III</p><p>My research centres on the recent history of flash mob performance in India and analyses the transformations that have taken place within the genre: firstly, as an initially American, then “global,” performance form becomes re-situated and adapted within an Indian context; and secondly, as the form has evolved over time in relation to the transitioning of the Internet from a predominantly text-based medium to a predominantly image- and video-based one (see Strangelove 2010).</p><p>In the field of flash mob performance, we see moving bodies becoming re-mediated as moving images, and mobilised into the flow of global circuits of online reception. My underlying concern when approaching this research is: who is mobile in these contexts? Who becomes visible through movement, and by extension, who may disappear in these same&nbsp;moments?</p><p>I intend to approach this session by examining what is enacted through the movements of flash mob performance, focusing on the more recent phase of the genre in which flash mobs become mobilised through online video-sharing practices. I argue that they perform mediated representations of “New India” for an online national and international audience, valorising the new “non-places” (Augé 1992) of Indian supermodernity, through the acts of a mobilised “digerati” (Keniston 2004). If we consider that performance can play a role in the construction of cultural memory (Roach 1996; Taylor 2003), and that the Internet as an archive can become a repository of performances and thus memories(Gehl 2009), I ask if online performance in these contexts may be seen as an aspect of the processes that structure a “politics of forgetting” (Fernandes 2006) in globalising India. Which narratives are rendered visible and which invisible through these performances? Who appears and who disappears? Movement on the Internet thus becomes a political question concerned with comparative mobilities, visibilities, and participation in the narratives of “India” that are constructed for global circulation.</p><p>References</p><p>Augé, M., 1992.

<p>Banks in Europe have deployed customer authentication solutions for several years. These solutions have served their purpose well and enabled customers to safely log in to their bank accounts. In the world of e-commerce, these solutions, when used, have been successful in combating online payment fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and its associated Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) dramatically change the payment landscape, considering:</p>



  The mandate for strong, multi-factor authentication,&nbsp;  The emergence of Third Party Providers (TPP) accessing accounts via open APIs  



<p>The success of PSD2 will ultimately be determined by how well banks can balance user convenience with security obligations, while maximizing reach. As such, they may want to evaluate how well their legacy authentication solutions meet this new need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication standards have been proposed as a way for banks to meet all requirements in a PSD2 world — but is the change from a legacy method to FIDO worthwhile?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to learn more about FIDO Authentication standards and how they compare with legacy authentication methods used to access an account or secure an online payment. The methods compared are SMS OTPs, hardware OTP generators, CAP readers, and proprietary smartphone and biometrics-based solutions in terms of PSD2 compliance, security, usability and scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join us to find out: Why change to FIDO?</p>

<p>We set up Women in Identity just over a year ago with a mission ‘to inspire, elevate and support a more diverse workforce in the digital identity industry’. We understand the vital importance of representation within our sector. And we are committed to ensuring that the voices of all&nbsp; under-represented groups – whether through their gender, race, age, sexual-orientation, socio-economic status – can be heard.</p>
<p>We’ve made progress. We’re proud of what we’ve achieved so far. But, it isn’t enough.</p>
<p>We don’t pretend to have all the answers; but we do understand the problems.&nbsp; And we want to work together with our industry to find the answers. It’s not about diversity as a general issue. It is about identifying and addressing solutions that fundamentally don’t work for large elements of our planet’s population. When we get it wrong, we deny people access to services that – in some cases – are enshrined in Human Rights and Equality laws.</p>
 To tackle this we need your help. 
<p>You will no doubt have issued a statement in support of Black Lives Matter following the murder of George Floyd. You will also, most likely, have celebrated PRIDE month in your organisation. But what comes next? Words are not enough.</p>
 
 We need allies. 
 Allies who have powerful connections and networks that can help us achieve change. 
 Allies who will walk the walk with us …. 
 
<p>Systemic inequality is deeply ingrained throughout our society and our sector is not immune. More than other areas of technology, we have a moral responsibility to ensure that identity systems intended FOR all are built BY all.</p>
<p>That’s why we have decided to create a D&amp;I Code of Conduct &amp; Implementation Framework specifically for the identity industry. This will offer organisations a toolkit to adopt a more diverse and inclusive approach, particularly in the development of identity products.</p>
 Will you work with us? We need your allyship:

A new global framework for regulating the crypto industry is coming into place this year. One of the most important new rules that businesses interacting with crypto has to implement is what is known as the Travel Rule. The Travel Rule, which is also known as The Wire Transfer rule, requires a business managing crypto on behalf of their user to transfer KYC’d (Know-Your-Customer) Identity Information to a receiving institution. Pelle Braendgaard, CEO of Notabene, will share his insights and explain how his company is tackling this business challenge for the industry.

Complying with this rule provides many challenges for the industry. Several industry groups have already started to invent several new protocols to solve this. Notabene helps financial companies be compliant with new, global anti-money laundering (AML) regulations for crypto transactions coming into effect right now. Pelle believes this is a critical use case for SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity). In this talk, he will go over the rule itself, industry protocols, how he sees SSI can help here, and how they are helping to solve it.

<p></p>
<p>On Thursday 25 June, we officially launched Women in Identity in New Zealand and Australia, hosted and facilitated by Andrew Weaver, Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ. We chose to focus on Digital Equality in Aotearoa (Maori name for New Zealand) and our panel of amazing women brought a wealth of experience and knowledge to the table:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kim Connolly-Stone, Policy Director at Internet NZ;</p>
<p>Pamela Moss, Director of Planning at the University of Auckland;</p>
<p>Janelle Riki-Waaka, Relationships Manager and Kaihuawaere at CORE Education;</p>
<p>Elena Higgison, Principal Advisor on the Digital Identity Transition Programme at the Department of Internal Affairs and</p>
<p>Kaye-Maree Dunn, Engagement Specialist and Founder of Āhau</p>
 What is creating the digital divide? 
<p>We see a lot of digital transformation but rarely does it focus on diversity and inclusion. The panel looked at issues that are widening the digital divide in our country:</p>
 
 Reliable and affordable internet connectivity is essential in New Zealand to narrow the digital divide 
 Access to digital devices and resources is essential if our tamariki (“children and young people”) are to have equitable opportunities to learning 
 A big chunk of those underserved in our communities are indigenous people and our education system has not been designed for them 
 The need to differentiate between diversity (who is in the room) and equity (who is trying to get in the room) 
 The gap between our younger generation’s learning vs their parents’, especially among indigenous people, is creating a digital divide that can lead to a breakdown in bonding 
 A need to focus on broadening our workforce to bring in more indigenous people 
 How to diversify the tech industry by addressing the mathematics literacy gap, starting with schools 
 Learn from community leaders that are addressing digital inclusion and participation 
 
 Education is key … 
<p>We focused much of our discussions on education and home learning (specifically online learning). The gaps that exist today may have a huge impact on the future of our communities.&nbsp; These were my main takeaways from the session:</p>
<p>Janelle highlighted that the education system was not actually designed to be inclusive of, and accessible to, indigenous people, it was designed from a Western perspective and the content and the way we deliver it becomes a barrier. Add in a requirement for access to technology and financial means and we start to pile inequality on top of inequality. The divide between the “haves” and “have nots” is going to have to change at a fundamental level.&nbsp; We cannot afford to allow the next generation to enter the workforce already disadvantaged. Many of those already affected are indigenous people. Inclusion needs to start with&nbsp; them – not see them as an exception. We cannot choose one ’identity’ or one world view on which to build our society.</p>
<p>Pamela noted we could do more to diversify our workforces by improving the levels of mathematics literacy throughout the education system.&nbsp; Many digital products and solutions would benefit from greater diversity in thinking. This can only come from a more diverse workforce. We need to change the pedagogy of teaching and learning. If we want a wider range of people to engage in the tech sector, we need to figure out how to teach them better!</p>
 …. but we also need more, affordable, technology 
<p>On availability of devices, we agreed that the government in New Zealand had moved quickly to get devices out to kids who needed them for home-learning.&nbsp; However, there were discrepancies between top-performing schools and those in lower socio-economic parts of our communities. Janelle has worked to support the Ministry of Education in getting devices out the door; the government ordered the kit for connectivity to support the new ways of learning but these arrived too late. Often the schools had already gone back and, in a large number of cases, users struggled to access platforms and materials due to weak internet connectivity.</p>
<p>On affordability, Pamela shared how this is a further barrier for many students. Some families simply do not have space for home-learning. Many have economic priorities higher than the, often prohibitive, costs of an internet connection. Even at University and College level, students struggled to access the platforms needed for online learning. There is a huge divide between the well-off and the non well-off.</p>
<p>On internet accessibility, Kim highlighted how Internet NZ were pushing for ‘internet for all and internet for good’ whilst trying to address affordability and connectivity issues in Aotearoa. The government needs to invest into this space. Having access to reliable internet should be as common as access to a reliable power connection. As a country we are not there yet.</p>
<p>Elena shared&nbsp;that we need to take an “inside out approach”. We need to reimagine a future state where those that are impacted most by exclusion can work alongside community leaders to design solutions that reflect the needs of all.</p>
 
 Policy and decision makers need to visibly ‘walk the talk’. 
 Encourage our entrepreneurs to do amazing things within the public sector 
 Work closely with the movers and shakers to diversify our workforces 
 Amplify the work and leadership of those already driving change in our communities to drive for greater digital inclusion” 
 
<p>This Meet-Up was a session that sparked immense curiosity among those of us not exposed to the education sector, The conversation wasn’t about ‘how can we get more women into tech/identity’. Nor was it about ‘what is the best digital identity technology out there today’.</p>
<p>It was, at its core, about our communities and how we serve them better. As one attendee commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>This has been an enlightening discussion for me on the wide-ranging considerations around identity.&nbsp; It has made me question my approach to “Digital Identity” which started quite narrowly on the basis of what individuals need to get verified online in a national system, often in order to access basic systems like government services, banking, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Identity is about real people in all their diverse communities and we must ensure that every aspect of their ‘identity’ is considered – not just the elements attributed to them by their government.</p>
<p>A sincere and personal thank you to everyone who participated in this event.</p>

While many are struggling with the effects of social distancing, financial distress, or fear of contracting the virus, here at the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI)</a>, nearly 300 individuals from 100 organizations have united around a cause worthy of our collective efforts: supporting projects that deploy privacy-preserving Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and strengthen our societies and economies.</p><p>We are a global community that shares a vision for the effective use of technology to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. We believe that, when used responsibly, VCs can be great privacy-preserving components of solutions addressing the numerous social and economic challenges caused by this and future pandemics. We are aware that without a holistic perspective from the onset, many COVID-19 technology solutions may introduce unintended results (e.g. surveillance, abuse of personal data, social inequalities). To avoid such outcomes, we have committed ourselves to open collaboration with a diverse range of experts, embracing open standards, and protecting the fundamental privacy and personal data rights of all stakeholders.</p><p>If you lead a project implementing VCs in your local communities and are aligned with our values, we want to hear from you. We also wish to share and discuss our work openly, including its technical, medical, legal, ethical, and business implications. We invite your input on these considerations as well as any other important aspects that can help build responsible, human-centric VC solutions to fight COVID-19.</p><p>If you are ready to contribute or collaborate, please join us at <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">https://www.covidcreds.com/</a>.</p>

 Reflections from an androgynous, ‘out’ gay woman in the world of technology 
Shelley Bryen
<p>Pride month often makes me reflect on how far the LGBTQ+ community has come, but also on how far we still have to go. I have read so many moving often heartbreaking “coming out” stories and have often wondered if I should write my own. Then it occurred to me that I have never read anything about what it is like to be an ‘out’ lesbian in the corporate landscape. In fact, it is only recently that I have met and connected with other gay, bisexual and transgendered women in technology – one of the many benefits of being a part of Women in Identity, I guess!!</p>
<p>Let me start by saying I refer to myself as a “gay woman”. For some reason, the term “Lesbian” just sounds too clinical to me – like a condition for which one may possibly need shots . The term “gay” somehow sounds far more fun and life affirming. Really though, it is a personal thing – all about which one fits with your heart and your head. It’s a core part of one’s own identity. For me, gay fits.</p>
<p>I officially came out at the age of 29, a few years after the birth of my son. Although I always knew I was “different”, no one could ever accuse me of not giving heterosexuality a good ole’ college try! Therefore, it was vital to me to spend the rest of my life “being me” without apology – and that has meant professionally as well as personally.</p>
<p>My formal training was in Fine Art, but my meandering career path eventually led me to technology. For more than 25 years I’ve had various roles from Strategic Alliances and Product Management, to Research and Strategic Marketing. Today, my focus is on Remote Identity, Document Verification and Digital Identity.</p>

<p>I am very thankful to be a Canadian, always have been. Canada has been one of the leaders in human rights and citizen protections through concrete legislation. It is certainly worth celebrating that employment laws and societal acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights have shifted dramatically in last quarter of a century. Even the US Supreme Court just made <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-supreme-court-lgbtq-1.5612327">a landmark ruling</a> forbidding workplace discrimination, protecting gay and transgender employees.</p>
<p>Still, even where there are laws providing protections and legal recourse, there is still a challenge in changing ingrained perceptions, stereotyping and commonplace discriminatory behaviours.</p>
 Starting a new position in a male dominated industry 
<p>Everyone has experienced the nervousness and excitement of joining a new company. Being a woman in an industry that is male dominated is one factor that causes anxiety enough! (In 2018, only <a href="https://smallbiztrends.com/2018/03/women-in-technology-statistics.html">20% of all jobs in technology were held by women</a>.) Now add in being androgynous and gay. It may be intersectionality at its best, but It brings with it nagging questions like:</p>
 
 How do I collectively “come out” in a clear but informal way? Heterosexuals never have to announce their sexuality to their new colleagues. Imagine discussing this casually with your team, your boss, your department, your whole company. You have to either intentionally choose to:
 
 Be vague – changing pronouns, being disingenuous, and not connecting on the same level with your coworkers around the “water cooler” – for your entire career 
 Be true to yourself but understand it may have negative implications 
 
 
 Will my identity affect:
 
 My work environment? 
 My access to visible projects? 
 My road to promotion? 
 
 
 How will my male colleagues treat me?
 
 Like “one of the boys”? This has pluses and minuses.<br>
Plus: You are a “quirky” equal. Which is rare for many women.<br>
Minus: They may make assumptions that you feel exactly the same way as they do – including about women. Not easy when conversations become disrespectful or shift towards sexual harassment. 
 Like a threat or competitor? 
 
 
 How will my female colleagues treat me?
 
 Candidly, I do not fit in well with the ultra view of a powerful businesswoman. I often feel like a different species. 
 What will happen if I have to share accommodation with other female colleagues? Will my status as a gay woman make the situation uncomfortable for everyone? 
 
 
 What happens if I have a problem with a co-worker, a supervisor, a client?
 
 Are there policies specific to LGBTQ+ concerns and redress? 
 
 
 
 A History of Workplace Challenges 
<p>In the late ‘90s, I chose to leave a job as the result of homophobic remarks specifically about me. I demanded an apology from the CEO and threatened legal action but, ultimately, I decided I needed to be in a more inclusive business culture if I were to thrive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trustradius.com/buyer-blog/women-in-tech-report">71% of women</a> have worked in a tech company with a strong “bro culture.” The majority that have worked in male-dominated environments have felt excluded, unsafe, and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At another company, my personal property was destroyed and my workspace violated when a nameless person vandalized my office. The catalyst for this action was not difficult to determine:</p>
 
 An LGBTQ+ Film Festival poster was removed and some kind of liquid poured over it; 
 A calendar with daily LGBTQ+ historical facts had been shredded and thrown in the garbage and; 
 A calendar of Michelangelo art was on the wall, depicting “The Creation of Adam”. 
 
<p>I did what you are supposed to do: I filed a complaint with HR. (The company was suitably shocked and supportive.) But the incident was never resolved nor spoken of again.</p>
<p>No policies were ever changed.</p>
 Lots of room for optimism 
<p></p>
<p>Despite these instances of workplace homophobia, in general, my career through technology has been a successful&nbsp; – and a happy – one. I continue to make important connections and contributions. I feel I have been able to climb the corporate ladder unhindered, especially in this last decade.</p>
<p>Today, I am the Director of Marketing at <a href="https://worldreach.com/about/leadership-team/">WorldReach Software</a>, a Canadian company and leaders in remote identity and document verification. WorldReach not only has truly diversity-driven and inclusive policies, their <a href="https://worldreach.com/worldreach-and-international-womens-day-striving-for-gender-parity/">company statistics</a> prove it:</p>
 
 A woman founder 
 50% of Senior Management are female and have been with the company for more than 20 years 
 40% of all staff are women, including 67% of Technical Team Leads and 
 19 different Languages are spoken by employees 
 
<p>Now I can just be me&nbsp; – at home and at work. It is a blessing. Every now and again, I get called “Sir” or am asked to leave a women’s bathroom when I’m travelling. Given how far LGBTQ+ rights have come, I can live with that.</p>
<p>I am exceedingly grateful for the scores of gay, bisexual and transgendered women who suffered greatly and fought hard for the rights I enjoy today. They have paved the way for the promise of equality for all. I commit to doing everything I can to make it easier for the next generation of LGBTQ+ people to thrive. It is the very least I can do.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;What is the mission and vision of Jumio?</p>



<p>Jumio’s mission is to make the internet a safer place by protecting the ecosystems of businesses through cutting-edge online identity verification and authentication services that quickly and accurately connect a person’s online and real-world identities. Jumio’s automated identity verification solutions fight fraud, maintain compliance and onboard new customers faster.</p>



 <a href="https://www.jumio.com/"></a> 



<p>2.&nbsp; Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>As more Canadians turn to their computers and smartphones to manage their money (and every other aspect of their lives), it’s important for organizations across a broad span of industries to provide a seamless digital experience, and that starts with the onboarding process. Consumers expect the ability to create online accounts in minutes, not days — anytime, anywhere. They aren’t afraid to take their business elsewhere if they encounter unnecessary friction. In fact more than 40 per cent of potential new accounts are sacrificed during the onboarding process because of time-consuming, clunky identity verification processes.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does Jumio address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>As companies evolve to become more digital, more and more interactions with customers will occur on a screen rather than in person. These digital transformation efforts start with creating new accounts online. Digital identity verification is an unsung hero in an organization’s digital transformation strategy because companies must verify that a person’s digital identity matches their physical identity when conducting business online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this in mind, it’s imperative for Canadian enterprises to build in the necessary operational resiliency to survive this new reality. The COVID-19 pandemic has showcased the value of IT and digital transformation, and the need for organizations to accelerate the transition.</p>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200206005047/en/Big-Banks-Raising-Customer-Satisfaction-Effective-Digital">J.D. Power study</a>, nearly one-third (31 per cent) of new account openings are executed through a bank website or mobile app, up from 22 per cent in 2019. Meanwhile, the number of new account openings at branches has declined year over year by 10 per cent, and now comprises just over half of all new account openings. Sadly, many financial institutions still require users to visit a store or branch office to create a new account or to perform routine transactions — increasingly, this is going to be a difficult mandate as many of us are now homebound and social distancing.</p>



<p>This is a wake-up call for organizations that have placed too much focus on daily operational needs at the expense of investing in digital business and long-term resilience. Jumio helps Canadian businesses to digitally transform their KYC/AML and onboarding processes so they can quickly, securely and compliantly onboard new customers.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;What role does Canada have to play as a leader in the space?</p>



<p>Canada is playing a leading role in online identity verification in a somewhat surprising way. In recent years, Montreal has emerged as a major technology hub for artificial intelligence (AI) due to the prominence of AI talent and research support in the city. This has allowed a number of companies, including Jumio, to launch AI labs in Montreal. In Jumio’s case, our goal is to build production AI models that perform three vital functions related to online identity verification: data extraction, fraud detection and risk scoring. In fact, AI has already been productionalized to reduce the time it takes to verify the digital identities of remote users. At Jumio, AI models have reduced the average customer transaction time by more than 50 per cent, with more significant reductions planned in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in effect, Canada is driving the AI-based innovation that is powering faster and more accurate online identity verifications around the globe. </p>



<p>5.&nbsp; Why did Jumio join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Jumio joined the DIACC because we wanted to be part of the conversation and help shape the emerging digital identity ecosystem. Jumio is a global leader in AI-based identity verification and biometric-based authentication and we process close to 300,000 identity verifications each day. As a result of our experience, we have much to offer in terms of best practices, especially given the pioneering work of our AI Labs division based in Montreal. At the same time, we want to learn from other members about best practices and emerging frameworks for digital identification and authentication.</p>



<p>We share DIACC’s mission of enabling Canadians to completely and securely participate in the global digital economy by establishing a robust, secure, scalable, inclusive and privacy-enhancing digital ecosystem. Our industry is evolving quickly and many institutions are relying on yesterday’s technologies, including knowledge-based verification and credit bureau queries which offer low levels of identity assurance and open the door to impersonation fraud and account takeovers. We are playing a valuable role in helping Canadian enterprises, of all stripes, understand the key trade-offs they need to consider and help them adopt more modern, AI-based approaches to digital identity verification and authentication.</p>



<p>6.&nbsp; What else should we know about Jumio?</p>



<p>Jumio is the global leader in online identity verification because of our commitment to innovation and the customer experience. Jumio leverages a unique combination of technologies including AI, OCR, computer vision, machine learning and leading-edge biometrics to set the industry benchmark for identity verification accuracy, fraud deterrence and simplified KYC/AML compliance. Moreover, Jumio has spent the last five years refining and innovating around the customer experience. This includes reducing the number of steps required to verify an ID document or identity. This also includes optimizing the language and graphics used on screen to help maximize online conversions. These types of innovations are no less significant and help our business customers streamline their customer’s online journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jumio has verified more than 250 million identities issued by over 200 countries and territories from real-time web and mobile transactions. Jumio’s solutions are used by leading companies in the financial services, sharing economy, digital currency, retail, travel and online gaming sectors. Based in Palo Alto, Jumio operates globally with offices in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific and has been the recipient of numerous awards for innovation.</p>
