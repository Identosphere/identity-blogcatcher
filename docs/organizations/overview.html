            In April 2022, GS1 Belgium & Luxembourg launched a pilot project on e-CMR together with 7 companies, amongst which AB InBev.
    


            The goal of this pilot project is to optimise the digitalisation of transport with e-CMR and to define standards that everyone can use. One year later, we have already some great insights and asked Andreea Calin from AB InBev to share her findings on e-CMR and our pilot project.
