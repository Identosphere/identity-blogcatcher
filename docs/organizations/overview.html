As technology advances at a rapid pace, proponents of microchip implants for digital identification herald them as the ultimate solution for convenience and security. However, the implementation of microchip implants as a digital ID system raises significant concerns about privacy, autonomy, and potential abuse. This article explores the dangers associated with microchip implants and argues that they are a bad idea for society.
