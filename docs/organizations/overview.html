In the midst of the city of Vancouver, a company stands, unwavering and bold. Lions Gate Digital. The sun rises, casting a golden light on the future they aim to shape. They have a prospectus. It&#8217;s not just any piece of paper. It&#8217;s a promise. A commitment. $2.2 million USD from 10,000 shares. Tokenized. A Security Token Offering (STO). Each share a beacon for what’s coming.

The world moves. Technology advances. We find ourselves standing at crossroads, staring at paths paved by Big Gov and Big Tech. Both promise the same thing: a digital ID for the new age. But the truth? It&#8217;s found somewhere else – in Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Here&#8217;s why.



Big Gov has strength. It has power. But with that power comes weight. The heavy bureaucracy makes change slow, like an old bull trying to keep pace with sprightly calves. Big Gov means centralized con'>Simple Truths: The Case for Self-Sovereign Identity</a>

As technology advances at a rapid pace, proponents of microchip implants for digital identification herald them as the ultimate solution for convenience and security. However, the implementation of microchip implants as a digital ID system raises significant concerns about privacy, autonomy, and potential abuse. This article explores the dangers associated with microchip implants and argues that they are a bad idea for society.

As we move into a future marked by unprecedented digital innovations, it&#8217;s natural to look towards Silicon Valley for the next big thing. Yet, sometimes it&#8217;s the simplest of ideas, from the most unexpected places, that can upset the established order. One such contender is Lions Gate Digital, a seemingly modest concept that could significantly disrupt the Silicon Valley tech giants.
