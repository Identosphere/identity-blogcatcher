Smoot, measuring a mere 5 foot 7 inches (1.70 m), would lay down on the bridge as his associates noted his position. It took a fair bit of time to measure the bridge as Smoot had to be carried by his associates to each new position – but the effort was well worth it. Thus, a playful, unconventional unit of measure was born. Over the years, smoot is rememb'>Meet Smoot: One Framework to Connect All Chains</a>
