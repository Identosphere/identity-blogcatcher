Governance is a cornerstone for open source community management and, ultimately, code. For Hyperledger Foundation, technical governance is the job of the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), which consists of 11 members of the technical contributor community elected annually by maintainers and Governing Board members. (See the Foundation charter for more on TOC elections). As a group, they steer the technical direction for the Foundation.&nbsp;'>Governance Update: A Q+A with the Leaders of the 2024 Hyperledger Foundation Technical Oversight Committee</a>

At the forefront of this change is the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is set to redefine digital identity management. This 1000-word exploration delves into the essence of SSI, particularly its open-source variant, and examines why it is poised to be a cornerstone of our digital future.

Speculation in the cryptocurrency market is nothing new, and the Stellar network with its native currency, Lumens (XLM), has not been immune to it. A recent topic of interest among investors and enthusiasts is the potential for XLM to be backed by silver. This notion stirs up discussions about stability and intrinsic value, aligning digital assets with traditional precious metals.
