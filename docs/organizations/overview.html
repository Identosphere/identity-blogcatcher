Surveillance capitalism is a term that is increasingly becoming relevant in today&#8217;s digital age. Coined by Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff in her 2019 book, &#8220;The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,&#8221; the term refers to the commodification of personal data by tech companies. Essentially, it’s a business model where companies collect, analyze, and sell user data to advertisers for profit.

As we grapple with the global health crisis, several nations have implemented health passports, digital documents showing an individual&#8217;s health status. While they may seem like a practical solution to ensuring public health safety, these passports are not without concerns. In fact, they raise numerous ethical, legal, and privacy issues. Critics argue that such passports are inherently sinister, contributing to surveillance states and perpetuating inequality.
