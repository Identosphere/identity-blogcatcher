We are delighted to unveil the highly anticipated release of Hyperledger Bevel version 1.0, marking a pivotal moment in our journey toward creating an advanced blockchain automation tool. Originating as a labs project in late 2018, Hyperledger Bevel has evolved significantly, gaining acceptance as a Hyperledger project nearly two years ago. This release is a testament to our commitment to excellence and innovation in the realm of distributed ledger technologies (DLT).&nbsp;'>Hyperledger Bevel Release 1.0: Paving the Way for Seamless and Secure Blockchain Deployments</a>

Before diving into the promise of a new year, it’s always valuable to look back on what we’ve accomplished in this journey around the sun. 2023 has been a fulfilling year for our foundation with an amazingly active global community. And that community is the key to the growth of Hyperledger technologies and enterprise blockchain adoption and our goal of Building Better Together.
