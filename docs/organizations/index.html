 <a href="https://summit.digitalscot.live/talks/human-centricity-democratising-data/"></a>Join our <a href="https://summit.digitalscot.live/talks/human-centricity-democratising-data/">upcoming DigitalScot.live webinar</a> with Julian Ranger of Digi.me to learn about the concept of ‘Personal Data Ecosystems’ and how they might be implemented in Scotland. 
<p>As the feature video highlights Digi.me offer an personal data solutions platform, that can be used for any permutation of scenarios, such as <a href="https://consentry.com/">testing and managing Covid-19 risk</a>.</p>
 Web 3.0 – A New Paradigm 
<p>As was <a href="https://digitalgovernment.scot/digital-healthcare-in-scotland-guddle/">reported</a> a year ago Scotland’s Healthcare systems are in a state of ‘guddle’ – Lacking strategic direction and suffering from a situation of disjointed IT as the root issue holding up Integrated Health and Social Care in Scotland.</p>
<p>The cause of this is the predilection of governments for organizing themselves via very rigid hierarchical departmental structures, from which flows equally rigid, departmental-centric IT systems, creating ‘silos’, islands of information that must then be connected to other islands to facilitate the end-to-end processes that span across all of them.</p>
<p>The best way to tackle this situation is not to create these islands in the first place, to instead design and build a holistic, single data environment. The most effective example of this is the Internet, and it will be it’s ongoing evolution to ‘Web 3.0’ that will create a ‘rising tide that floats all boats’ universal solution to the problem that Scotland can harness.</p>
<p>This is defined primarily through the emergence of a decentralized approach to applications and data. Patient records won’t be held centrally in a monolith EHR, but will instead be distributed to and owned/controlled by the users themselves.</p>
 Decentralized Data 
<p>Apps like <a href="https://digi.me/healthy-me/">Healthy Me</a>&nbsp;from digi.me are an example of this new paradigm and how the decentralized approach tackles issues common to IT, like data privacy, by distributing the workload and privacy control to the users themselves.</p>
<p>Initiatives like&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData</a>, of which digi.me plays a key role, are setting out to develop the global movement that will establish the framework for adoption of this approach, defining the methods and governance for regulating this model of data exchange.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://futurescot.com/data-sharing-concerns-raised-by-primary-care-practitioners-at-scottish-parliament-inquiry/">FutureScot reports</a>&nbsp;at a recent parliamentary hearing on Scottish digital healthcare this approach was called for:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What we should be aiming for it a central digitised record that the patient has ownership of. And I think any of the professions that are arguing for increased access to records, increased ability to write into records, we need to be mindful that we need to take patients with us on that journey and consent is absolutely essential.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Scotland’s opportunity is that while these approaches seem futuristic, through vendors like Digi.me they are implementable today.</p>
 Attend <a href="https://summit.digitalscot.live/talks/human-centricity-democratising-data/">Julian’s webinar</a> to learn more about this tremendously exciting field. <p>The post <a href="https://digitalscot.net/personal-data-ecosystem/">‘Personal Data Ecosystem’ key foundation for Scotland’s Digital Economy</a> appeared first on <a href="https://digitalscot.net">Digital Scotland</a>.</p>

<p></p>
 On our DigitalScot.live webinar conference, David Sime talked about the many applications of Virtual and Augmented Reality for education, healthcare, marketing, and business communications. 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsime/">David Sime</a> is the Director of Oncor Reality Ltd and he is a multi award winning AR and VR production manager with over 21 years of digital media experience.</p>
<p>David speaks and lectures all over the world on emerging technology for industrial, educational, marketing and medical applications. A published author of both academic and broader readership publications, David is a regular contributor to magazine newspapers and academic journals including Springer, Forbes and IGI Global.</p>
<p>Before summarizing the video, let’s see what is Virtual and Augmented Reality.</p>
 Virtual Reality 
<p>Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to feel real life experience. VR places the user inside an experience. Here users are immersed into 3D worlds and to some extent can interact too. By simulating as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, touch, even smell, the computer is transformed into a gatekeeper to this artificial world.</p>
 Augmented Reality 
<p>Augmented reality (AR) is almost same to virtual reality but there are many differences as well. It is an enhanced version of the real physical world that is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory stimuli delivered via technology. Augmented Reality or AR is a growing trend among companies involved in mobile computing and business applications in particular.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>David Sime has been working in digital marketing and digital communications for the last 21 years now. Because of marketing is about 70 percent research and only about 30 percent promotion, he moved into digital marketing giving him the ability to see how long people were engaging with content online.</p>
<p>He noticed that it was a very short time in comparison to traditional media and it was getting shorter all the time. As time passed, he started to move in the direction of more image-based marketing because people weren’t reading as long as text as they had been before and more image or picture speaks a thousand words.&nbsp;Attention span continued to shrink as connection speeds went up and there was more variety online.</p>
<p>In the next five years, we will be communicating with technology around us using no physical interface but just our brain waves. It’s already happening and soon those devices will be communicating with us. This is called Direct Brain Interface (DBI). This is likely to become very commonplace within the next five years. Here’s the proof that it is possible:</p>
<p>The XR (It’s a combination of augmented and virtual reality together) was worth $5 Billion back in 2018. The projection for XR in 2023 is to double that, to $11.3 billion, and this projection was made before the Covid-19 situation.</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes that we’re going to have in the short term is that wearable Augmented Reality is going to become commonplace.</p>
<p>The reason for that is what it called ‘form factor’. Form factor is the shape and the size and the usability of the tools that we use in product design. Previously if you wanted to use augmented reality, we had two choices. Either we would point our mobile phone at things which is a clunky and not ideal and it uses up our hands and people feel uncomfortable wandering around like that. It looked ridiculous and there’s absolutely no way we would be walking down the street and in front of public wearing this thing and so that cuts off most of the use cases.</p>
<p>When it comes to marketing navigation and all sorts of other things that we would want to use this for the new slew of around about 20 new devices which hit the market this year.</p>
<p>It means that form factor is going to be akin to these, although it’s not quite there yet but it’s getting there and they’ve done it harnessing the processing power in our phones.</p>
<p>So really the glass has just become a display device and using something called waveform technology which just means that the lens reflects the image back to our eyes from little projectors which are around us. We can see everything around us perfectly fine.</p>
<p>There will be gloves that will allow people who are using augmented virtual reality not only to pick up objects like real life but we will feel it too. So, when we will pick up an object, our fingers will be stopped in place. We will feel the texture and temperature of that object.</p>
<p>Another thing that will change the landscape is SLAM. Slam stands for simultaneous location and mapping. It means the device knows where we are and where we are looking. It takes photos of places using lidar. Lidar is light version of radar. Slam can create three dimensional photos that looks photorealistic.</p>
<p>Virtual Reality is when we are fully immersed in digital environment. Augmented reality on the other hand is seeing the real world around us and we are seeing a digital overlay additional information of maintaining the real world around us.</p>
<p>A Tesla Suit can create a sensory feedback while we are wearing the virtual reality. It can be the sensational touch or temperature. It can restrict our motion and movement whilst at working at our movement range. It’s very good for physiotherapy.</p>
<p>Augmented reality is used in retail. It can i) increase store visitors, ii) better customer engagement, iii) enhance print media iv) reduce product return rate, v) better UX customizable content, vi) break language barriers, etc.</p>

 Reimagining Capitalism Series: An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and&nbsp;Economy <p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p>Photo by <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/field-of-flags-at-national-mall-represents-americans-unable-to-attend-inauguration-day/2545279/">Eric BARADAT</a> /&nbsp;AFP<p>Over the coming weeks, Omidyar Network will expand on our theory of change around ideas, rules, and power and connect it to the five pillars outlined in our recently released <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Point of View</a> on Reimagining Capitalism, and the work being done by our grantees. This is the first contribution to that&nbsp;series.</p><p>Democracy &amp; Capitalism <br>This week, Joseph R. Biden was inaugurated as America’s 46th president, standing on the West Front of the US Capitol that was attacked earlier this month. With that picture still vivid in the minds of many, President Biden swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. In that moment, people across the country let out a sigh of relief; though our democracy has been bruised and battered, it continues. And so too can the American people continue to pursue a more perfect union. <br> <br>At Omidyar Network, we recognize that the strength of our democracy is deeply entwined with the strength of our economy. We believe that we all have a collective responsibility to defend our democracy, and we are recommitting ourselves to ensuring that our economy supports our democratic society in providing opportunity, dignity, and security to all.<br> <br>Democracy and capitalism have long stood as twin pillars under-girding American society. Their modern incarnations were both born in 1776 out of the same intellectual movement, and advance the same vision: for decision-making power to rest with the people. Just as we are united, as Americans by a common faith in the democratic values of equality, justice, and liberty, we value the capitalist promise that those who innovate, compete, and take risks will be fairly rewarded. Ultimately, capitalism is what has made possible American democracy, with its promise of shared prosperity and opportunity.<br> <br>A key debate across American history has been of how to balance the competing rights and freedoms guaranteed in each system. Adjusting this balance has allowed our government and economy to adapt to the changes in our values across centuries. However, it is clear to so many of us that the balance between democracy and capitalism is now in a dangerously precarious position. <br> <br>For years, we have prioritized the protection of capitalist rights to seek growth and profit at the expense of democratic commitment to general welfare, as enshrined in our Constitution alongside liberty and prosperity. We now find ourselves with an economy that is obviously structured in ways that exacerbate inequalities at every level. Despite a soaring stock market and rising GDP, the fundamentals of our economy are as broken as the windows smashed by the angry mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th. Already profound gaps in income, wealth, and opportunity are widening, especially between white and Black families. <br> <br> Most of us are deeply dissatisfied with the status quo, yet feel that we lack the power to change our circumstances. This powerlessness is fundamentally undemocratic and, by extension, un-American. We must change it. <br> <br>Omidyar Network has called for a reimagining of capitalism so that we can once again strike a balance between our democratic and capitalist systems that creates an economy grounded in democratic values. Our goal is to achieve systemic change so that our society is centered on the well-being of individuals and communities, and allows for full economic, democratic, and social participation for all. Our strategy is to transform how economic systems support our society by investing in organizations and individuals working to reshape economic ideas, rules, and power.<br> <br>Replacing Old Ideas<br>Throughout America’s history, we have lived in accordance with a variety of ideas that reflected society’s values at the time — many of which were rightfully discarded as our values evolved. Over the last 50 years, a set of ideas based on individual liberty, the primacy of markets, and a limited role for government have guided our economic policies, and our views of what is possible. Those ideas were built on an even longer history of economic thinking that has perpetually excluded and devalued people because of their race, class, gender, or disability. They are not only outdated, but demonstrably false. <br> <br>We have entered a period of great uncertainty and change, in which ideas and the values that inform them are shifting toward a re-balancing of markets, government, and communities. Our New Economic Paradigm work is experimenting with new ways of thinking and talking about the economy, while seeking to align stakeholders around a coherent new vision for equitable, inclusive, and sustainable capitalism. <br> <br>Rewriting the Rules<br>At its core, our capitalist economy and the ideas that shape it are a reflection of our common values. These ideas are translated into rules which give the economy structure and which govern who can participate in markets, and how. These rules include laws and regulations, as well as norms that govern everything from contracts and property rights, to competition, to employer-employee relationships. Ultimately, the rules that govern and shape markets matter, and they desperately need a rewrite. <br> <br>Our democracy, policies, politics, and markets must be protected and shielded from manipulation and capture by those with the most money,. These rules must be rewritten to direct capitalism toward greater societal outcomes, not the interests of economic or political elites. To that end, we are also exploring ways to rewrite the rules that shape economic structures so that they can support the well-being of everyone in our society. As part of that work, we are looking at opportunities to strengthen market infrastructure, financial systems, and corporate governance norms so that companies and investors can account for their impact on people, communities, and the planet.<br> <br>Reshaping Power <br>Ideas and rules are important, but they become concrete with power. Those who wield power are most likely to see their ideas reflected in the world, to design the economic and social norms governing markets and society, and determine which rules are enforced. This is why democracy, and its ideal of equal power, is so crucial to a capitalist society. Capitalism can certainly exist without democracy, but cannot, alone, guarantee that everyone will have access to opportunities to build a dignified life. We see this around the world, and increasingly in the United States: capitalist, oligopolistic markets are manipulated by the powerful to enrich themselves while exploiting the powerless. Democracy is the critical factor that allows all people equal rights and power to have a say in how capitalism impacts their lives and, more importantly, is the only system ensuring that any person can advocate for change when the capitalist economy is not delivering the basic well-being that is their right.<br> <br>Any true reimagining of capitalism must include checks to balance the power between markets, government, and civil society. So, Omidyar Network is working to reshape how power is distributed across society and the economy. One of our key priorities is to increase worker power and strengthen grassroots movements, since we believe that the economy will only increase the well-being of everyone — businesses, working people, and communities — when working people have individual and collective agency and voice. On the flip side, we are working to ensure that those who have benefited from existing economic structures do not use their economic power to distort either markets or democratic processes. To this end, we are working to curb concentrated corporate power and monopolies, especially in the tech sector, and are exploring strategies to counter corporate influence in our government. <br> <br>Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>The interplay of ideas, rules, and power are ultimately what determine which iterations of capitalism and democracy are possible. Ideas (which reflect our values) guide how we build our society. Rules determine distribution of wealth and power. Power then determines which ideas and rules shape society, and how. It is impossible to create a better form of capitalism or democracy without tackling each at the same time. In doing so, we aim to create a reimagined capitalism that empowers all people to realize their fullest potential as our economy flourishes.</p><p>Last year, we outlined five core pillars that we believe could best support a modern and equitably economy, one committed to values that reflect the inalienable rights of all; built to be not only inclusive, but explicitly anti-racist; capable of exercising true counterweights to economic power; dedicated to fostering a rebalanced relationship between markets, government, and communities; and responsive to the unique challenges we face in the 21st century. <br> <br>We know that we cannot build this alone. It will require deep partnership with a cadre of advocacy organizations and grassroots leaders, intellectuals and academics, business leaders and shareholders, philanthropies, policymakers and concerned citizens alike. We are humbled by the work that has already been done, encouraged by the growing chorus of voices calling for change, and proud to be a part of this effort. <br> <br>Throughout our history, American capitalism and democracy held promise for upward mobility and shared prosperity. Despite the many challenges that lie ahead, we believe we can expand that promise by seizing this moment to reimagine what we can&nbsp;be.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">Reimagining Capitalism Series: An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director, Responsible Technology and Tracy Williams, Director, Reimagining Capitalism</p><a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/11/02/18/google-workers-around-the-world-protest-its-corporate-culture">Photo by Jeenah Moon</a>,&nbsp;Reuters<p>In less than three weeks, nearly 6,000 workers at a fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama will begin voting on whether or not to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. If they vote yes, they will make history as the first American union in Amazon’s&nbsp;history.</p><p>The tech giant, which employs more than 1.1 million people around the world, has so far thwarted all attempts to unionize workers in the United States. The results? “The working conditions are horrible is all I’m willing to say,” <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/amazon-warehouse-workers-in-alabama-they-work-you-to-death/">said one Bessemer employee</a>. “I support a union coming aboard, we need them&nbsp;badly.”</p><p>The efforts to organize the Bessemer warehouse are the latest in a spate of activism by Amazon employees. <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/20/20874497/amazon-climate-change-walkout-google-microsoft-strike-tech-activism">In 2019,</a> more than 1,500 Amazon workers staged a walkout to push the company to lower its carbon footprint. That was followed by a virtual walkout this <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-avoided-unions-25-years-heres-labor-leaders-think-soon-change/">past June</a>, in protest of the firing of several tech workers and warehouse associates who were organizing around social justice and climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>And Amazon workers are not alone. Last summer, software engineer Raksha Muthukumar also found herself in the midst of a battle with a giant tech company. Her offense? She sent her colleagues a GoFundMe list of criminal justice reform groups in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. “The fear of retaliation has always been great, and we’ve seen retaliation, so this is our chance to protect ourselves,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954710407/at-google-hundreds-of-workers-formed-a-labor-union-why-to-protect-ourselves">said Muthukumar</a>.</p><p>On January 4, Muthukumar joined several hundred Google employees in the formation of the <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/">Alphabet Workers Union</a> (AWU) with support from the Communications Workers of America (CWA). Since the announcement, more than 500 additional people have joined the union, and will now be able to protect themselves with a union&nbsp;card.</p><p>Google’s employees aren’t demanding higher pay. They are fighting to overturn the fundamental concept of shareholder primacy — that Google’s primary goal should be to make as much money as possible. “We will use our reclaimed power to control what we work on and how it is used,” <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/principles/mission-statement/">AWU wrote in its mission statement</a>. “We will ensure Alphabet acts ethically and in the best interests of society and the environment.”</p><p>This latest development comes after years of frustrated attempts by workers to unite and confront Google management on critical issues, including sexual harassment in the workplace, ethics and the responsible deployment of technology, and partnerships with controversial customers like the US Department of&nbsp;Defense.</p><p>Successful organizing drives don’t just happen. The formation of the Alphabet Workers Union is the culmination of many earlier efforts by Alphabet employees. In December, Dr. Timnit Gebru, a scholar in the race and Artificial Intelligence (AI) field and co-leader of Google’s Ethics in AI team, was ousted ostensibly due to a disagreement over her team’s research after previously speaking out on behalf of minoritized employees. Dr. Gebru’s termination was a defining moment that galvanized many Google employees on their path to forming the&nbsp;union.</p><p>This is all part of a growing movement to organize in the tech industry. Employees at tech firms Kickstarter and Glitch were able to unionize last year, and hundreds of other workers at large tech companies ranging from Microsoft and Facebook, to Salesforce and GitHub, have increased their activism.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-gm-score-25-billion-for-stockholders-vs-0-for-uaw-members-24fbd959331e">Omidyar Network</a> stands in solidarity with these workers who are organizing for their rights — and what’s&nbsp;right.</p><p>We believe that increased worker power provides an essential counterweight to the rising dominance of corporations. Over the past several decades, we have seen the economic power of major companies spill over into the political arena, leading to a lopsided power imbalance that has damaged not only the fundamentals of capitalism, but of our democracy as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The solution? Empower workers — from warehouse associates to software engineers — with greater power, agency, and voice at work, both individually and collectively. That goal lies squarely at the intersection of two of Omidyar Network’s key priorities: expanding Worker Power and supporting Responsible Tech Workers. In doing so, we can create a much healthier economy, one that is better for employees, businesses, consumers, and&nbsp;society.</p><p>Through our <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology/">Responsible Tech</a> work, we’re helping to <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/why-were-investing-in-the-rise-of-the-responsible-tech-worker-a96e74661cdf">provide tech workers</a> with the tools, resources, and space to ask thoughtful questions about responsible tech so they can focus on building solutions that avoid the potential downsides of technology. To that end, we have invested in organizations ranging from <a href="https://home.coworker.org/">Coworker</a>, a mechanism to helps tech workers organize, both within their companies and more broadly to the <a href="https://www.tspa.info/">Trust and Safety Professional Association</a>, to New&nbsp;Public.</p><p>As part of our efforts to <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagine Capitalism</a> and increase Worker Power, we’re fighting for labor reform policies that increase the power of all workers, and supporting new organizing models that expand worker power to a broader set of working people, whether in the gig economy, in homes, in fields, or in a conventional workplace. Some of our grantees in this area include the <a href="https://www.cleanslateworkerpower.org/">Clean Slate for Worker Power project</a> at Harvard Law School, United for Respect’s <a href="https://www.workitapp.org/">WorkIt app</a>, which uses artificial intelligence to answer workers’ questions about their rights and helps workers organize, and a new coalition focused on advancing worker power in California through policy and advocacy, narrative change, and strengthening organizing, led by the <a href="https://kiwa.org/">Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA</a>). We also work with the <a href="https://www.forworkingfamilies.org/">Partnership for Working Families</a>, and the <a href="http://www.warehouseworkers.org/">Warehouse Workers Resource&nbsp;Center</a>.</p><p>The actions taken by working people to organize at some of America’s most influential tech companies represent a significant step forward in restructuring the social contract between tech giants, the people who work for them, and the society they serve. We’re cheering them&nbsp;on.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-network-applauds-tech-employees-who-are-demanding-a-voice-through-unionization-ebbe3bf2b26d">Omidyar Network Applauds Tech Employees Who Are Demanding a Voice Through Unionization</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>International Consortium Bolsters European Focus on Open Source and Open Standards Development</p> 


<p>Utrecht, The Netherlands; 20 January 2021 – OASIS Open, the international open source and open standards consortium, is pleased to announce the launch of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.eu/">OASIS Open Europe Foundation</a> (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.eu">https://www.oasis-open.eu</a>). The foundation provides a strong and dedicated European focus in setting standards for open collaboration, and allows OASIS to provide long-term sustainability for European Union research projects.</p>



<p>“The OASIS Open Europe Foundation gives us a unique opportunity to work with the European Union and EU Member States to advance open source and standards projects,” said Dr. Martin Chapman of Oracle, who chairs the OASIS Open Europe Foundation. “We will leverage the global experience of OASIS Open to provide a regional focus for the OASIS community and engage in European-specific activities that promote the use of open technologies.”</p>



<p>“We are particularly excited by the diverse group of experts who will be providing leadership on the foundation’s Board of Directors,” said Dr. Carol Cosgrove-Sacks, Senior Advisor, International Standards Policy at OASIS. “They represent a remarkable range of talent from industry and academia with strong expertise in ICT standards, open source projects, innovation, research, and development, along with perspectives in new areas for open technologies such as AI and data.”</p>



<p>The OASIS Open Europe Foundation’s Board of Directors will include:</p>



  Laetitia Cailleteau of Accenture (France)  Martin Chapman of Oracle (Ireland)  Eva Coscia of R2M Solution (Italy)  Gershon Janssen, Independent Consultant (Netherlands)  Janna Lingenfelder of IBM (Germany)  Guy Martin of OASIS Open (United States)  Andriana Prentza of the University of Piraeus (Greece)  



<p>Building on OASIS Open’s European Presence</p>



<p>OASIS Open has a long history of advancing open source and open standards in Europe. OASIS standards and specifications have been used in very large, highly visible initiatives, including Europe’s most widely used standard for electronic invoices, and serve as the basis of the European Commission’s eDelivery building block that is used in some of the world’s largest international data exchanges.</p>



<p>OASIS has a well-established place on the EU’s high-level advisory committee, the Multi-Stakeholder Platform for EU ICT Standardisation (MSP). OASIS standards feature in the Rolling Plan for ICT standardisation and are routinely used in both the private and public sector throughout Europe.</p>



<p>Open source has become increasingly important as a complement or alternative to traditional standardisation. The Open Document Format for Office Applications was originally developed in Europe as a file format of open source office software and subsequently standardized at OASIS Open and in ISO. Today, OASIS Open is hosting open source work in areas like cybersecurity and blockchain. The OASIS Open Europe Foundation aims to support open source initiatives that prefer to operate in Europe with European stakeholders under EU law.</p>



<p>Open data is an emerging area of interest in the OASIS Open community, especially in Europe, due to Europe’s lead in areas such as data protection and its legislation. Like open standards, open data is a key contributor to the Digital Single Market that will benefit from new products and services based on data. Data is also a critical asset for future development of AI. The OASIS Open Europe Foundation will support the OASIS Open community as a global player in the international data space area, leveraging its reputation in areas of security and privacy.</p>



<p>About OASIS Open</p>



<p>One of the most respected, member-driven standards bodies in the world, OASIS offers projects—including open source projects—a path to standardisation and de jure approval for reference in international policy and procurement. OASIS members include major multinational companies, SMEs, government agencies, universities, research institutions, consulting groups, and individuals.</p>

<p>By Jessy Kate Schingler and Primavera de&nbsp;Filippi</p><p>Extitutional theory is an emerging field of scholarship that provides a set of conceptual tools to describe and analyse the underlying social dynamics of a variety of social arrangements, such as communities, companies, organisations, or any other types of institutions.</p><p>Extitutional theory posits that the institutional framework is just one specific lens through which we can make sense of social behaviour. Social dynamics that are not part of an institution are not unstructured, just differently structured. Specifically, institutions focus on the static and inert elements of social structures — the aspects that persist over time — whereas extitutions focus on the dynamic and mutating elements of social structures — the aspects that continuously evolve over time. Both serve as filters to observe different aspects of the underlying social arrangements. This means that if we look at structured social dynamics only and exclusively through an institutional lens, we are only seeing one part of the larger picture. Extitutional theory provides an alternative lens — and the choice to use it is a normative decision to look at another part of the&nbsp;picture.</p>Unknown author; <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=80222262">Public&nbsp;Domain</a>.<p>It is important to note that the extitutional lens is not claiming that there are social dynamics “outside” of an institution, in the Here be Dragons sense of extrapolated but as-yet-unexplored territory; it simply observes the same social dynamics of an institution from another conceptual angle. By relying on the idea that institutions and extitutions are two different interpretations of the same set of social dynamics, we can formalize the characterization of each lens, and begin to examine the underlying structuring logics that distinguish them. Since they represent two different points of view into the same social arrangement, we can also explore the structural relationships that link these two lenses. Extitutional theory attempts to formalize these different ordering logics and the interplay between&nbsp;them.</p><p>For instance, a company is generally composed of a structured set of roles: a board of directors, a series of shareholders, a CEO, a treasurer, etc. — each with their corresponding rights and duties. Instead of these formal roles, the extitutional lens focuses on the social dynamics that animate this structure, which necessarily evolve over time as individuals join or leave the social structure, and as their reciprocal relationships change. The hiring of a new CEO doesn’t mutate the structure from an institutional perspective, yet it could have a significant impact on the social dynamics of the company as whole, because of the different capacities and relationships that the CEO will establish with the other company members. These extitutional dynamics are crucial to the life of institutions, and may impact operational behaviour through culture and more informal principles and&nbsp;values.</p><p>Given that both lenses are looking at the exact same social arrangement — although focusing on different aspects of it — a proper understanding of the underlying social dynamics requires a holistic view, combining both the institutional and extitutional perspective. Indeed, one does not exist without the other: while the operations of a company or organisation are ultimately constrained by the specific rules and roles that constitute the institution, they are fundamentally fueled by the individuals assuming these roles and the corresponding relationships that make up the extitution. Accordingly, the interplay between institutions and extitutions is all the more crucial to explore in the context of complex social arrangements because the two are constantly shaping and influencing each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Extitutional theory is interested not only in the ways that individuals interact and engage with one another through relationships and rhythms, but also in how different practices of institutionalization can create conditions that stabilize and amplify, or erode and suppress, certain extitutional dynamics — and vice versa. Central to the process of institutionalisation is the concept of enclosure: the mechanism through which an institution implements increased control (or coding) relative to a particular domain. Conversely, extitutional theory contrasts enclosure with the concept of exclosure, which recognizes that certain types of enclosures appear to play a different role — that of protecting the activity within it from control and coding. Providing tools to better understand the interplay between these two mechanisms is one of the key contributions of Extitutional theory.</p><p>Extitutional theory does not assign any moral value to institutions or extitutions: neither are good or bad; yet, because of the performativity of these lenses, choosing to look at a particular social arrangement as an institution or an extitution will impact the way we interact with it, as well as the manner in which it will evolve over time. Networked technologies in particular have created dramatic new exclosures giving rise to extitutional dynamics which can’t be understood through the institutional lens alone. Hence, extitutional theory is important not because it is better than institutional theory, but because extitutions are an under-studied phenomena. Understanding extitutional dynamics, and their interplay with the more familiar tools and logics of institutions, can help us respond to the specific, unprecedented demands of human coordination in our&nbsp;era.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/an-introduction-to-extitutional-theory-e74b5a49ea53">An Introduction to Extitutional Theory</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>For the 1.7 billion unbanked adults around the world, access to financial services is extremely limited. Without even a basic savings account, economic opportunity is often limited to informal offerings such as local shopkeepers who extend credit to their customers, microfinance institutions that work to serve the last mile, and community savings and credit associations that are setup by individuals living in the same village.</p>



<p>In the unbanked world, individuals borrow a few hundred to a few thousand dollars at a time, paying back over a relatively short time frame of 12-18 months. But despite excellent credit records, they are unable to receive even similar credit facilities at local banks. This is because the data from their informal transactions is essentially invisible: the banks either do not trust the data sources, or are otherwise unable to verify the provenance of the data. </p>



<p>While this is the state of the world today, it does not have to be our future.  Kiva, a US-based nonprofit organization focused on financial inclusion, has built Kiva Protocol to bridge the data disconnect and help enable universal financial access. In 2019, Sierra Leone, a West African nation of about 7 million, launched the National Digital Identity Platform (NDIP) that used Kiva Protocol to enable fast, cheap, and secure identity verification for its citizens. </p>



<p>Kiva Protocol is built using Hyperledger Indy, Aries, and Ursa, and as implemented in Sierra Leone, allows citizens to perform electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) verifications in about 11 seconds, using just their national ID number and a fingerprint. With this verification, it is possible for the nation’s unbanked to open a savings account and move into the formally banked population.</p>



<p>To find the right platform, Kiva assessed more than 20 software stacks, both centralized and decentralized. Blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies quickly emerged as good solutions for the developing world as they enable data provenance at the protocol level and stakeholders can act relatively independently to enable their various activities in the formal and informal sectors.</p>



<p>After deep consideration, Kiva decided to use Hyperledger’s stack for identity: Indy, Aries, Ursa. While all three projects are closely related, each has a distinct mandate:</p>



  Hyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized ID with transferable, private, and secure credentials;  Hyperledger Aries is infrastructure that supports interactions between peers and between blockchains and other DLTs; and  Hyperledger Ursa is a modular, flexible library that enables developers to share time-tested and secure cryptography.  



<p>In August 2019, Kiva launched the beta of Kiva Protocol with a public event opened by the president of Sierra Leone. Since that launch, global regulators have made significant progress in terms of how they are considering digital identity and eKYC verifications. There is a growing global movement towards user-owned and -controlled data, better privacy, and more universal access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of today, Kiva is focusing on building additional ecosystem applications and services to make it easier for all stakeholders to access and use Kiva Protocol. Much of this is being contributed upstream into the Hyperledger Indy and Aires projects, with the remaining components hosted in Kiva’s repository.</p>



<p>Hyperledger teamed up with Kiva on a detailed case study covering the challenges of the unbanked, requirements for a solution that delivers fast, cheap and secure ID exchange, and plans for expanding Kiva Protocols’ use to other countries and other applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital identity is now a fundamental requirement to function in a world that has shifted to remote-first. To empower individuals and to protect their self-sufficiency, the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) was developed. It grants the individual agency over their interactions and data by putting the data-subject back into the driver-seat.</p> Self-sovereign identity and its use-cases <p>There are plenty of potential use-cases. Our identity isn’t something we can easily explain or which can easily be summarized by single data sets. It highly depends on the context in which it operates and is different depending on the person with whom we interact. One category of use-cases is the proof of certification or qualification of an individual. This proof is required for applications for jobs, grants or the participation in special events. Depending on the requirements, an individual can collect all necessary certificates and present them directly to the relying party. Another big category of use-cases is to enable access to information, buildings or resources. When e.g. information is labeled as “internal only”, the authorized people should be able to access it. Organizations can issue credentials to the right target audience and only approve access for those individuals, which have a valid credential.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Networks <p>Two elemental components of an SSI-ecosystem are the wallets for end-users and the networks for organisations on which issued credentials are anchored to. In this article, we will explain how these relate to each other, what their specific goals are and how they interact with each other by providing the example of the Lissi wallet and the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet <p>In order to store and possess the credential, an individual requires an application with a graphical user interface to receive, store and present these credentials to third parties. A wallet is a key management application, which hides all the complicated technical aspects from the user and provides the required guidance to securely interact with trusted contacts. The Lissi wallet offers an intuitive interface and provides the necessary information and flexibility to navigate through an increasingly complex digital environment. Furthermore, it automatically recognizes the network, which an organisation used to verify the authenticity of the credential. Hence, while organizations can choose a suitable network, the user is informed about the network, but doesn’t need to do anything to receive the credential or interact with the organisation. Lissi is your smart agent, which takes unnecessary workload from you, provides you with the information to make informed decisions while always offering a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>While the Lissi team is also involved in the formation of the <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion network</a> with its main focus in Europe, we recognize that organisations around the world have different needs. The networks, which are necessary to verify the authenticity of issued credentials, need to be adjusted to different regulatory requirements and the specific demands of their target audience. The network is a distributed and publicly readable database, which contains the public identifier of a legal entity. Therefore, we are committed to not only provide individuals with the choice of their favourite wallet, but also organisations with the choice of their network. We are delighted to announce that the latest version of the Lissi wallet also supports the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Indico&nbsp;Network <p><a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio.tech </a>created the Indicio Network to meet the needs of companies and organizations that want a reliable and robust network to build, test, demo, and launch their identity solutions — all the while supported by a team of engineers with extensive experience in decentralized identity, its architecture, and its use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Indicio believes that this “concierge” approach to running a network will accelerate the development, adoption, and use of verifiable digital credentials. This&nbsp;means:</p>  Professional staffing: Indicio’s engineers are among the most experienced in the decentralized identity field and are ready to answer questions, support network operations, and help to get products ready for&nbsp;launch.  Stability for demonstrations: Indicio supports developers at every step of the way from building to testing and public demonstrations.  Cross-network test readiness: Indicio sees the future as one of interoperable credentials and networks. Its network is the perfect platform for testing interoperability by issuing and verifying on multiple networks.  Easy Node Operator onboarding: For those interested in joining a network as a node operator, Indicio has simplified the process, offers training for all levels, and a suite of network tools and resources.  <p>With the Covid pandemic driving urgent need for decentralized identity solutions, Indicio is committed to delivering superlative infrastructure and technical support, and to making decentralized identity as easy to use as possible, whether as a node operator, a developer, an issuer or a verifier.</p> About Indicio <p>Indicio.tech is a professional services firm specializing in decentralized identity architecture, engineering, and consultancy. Indicio provides expert guidance to a global community of clients on the use of verifiable credentials to build digital identity solutions. The decentralized networks and tools created by Indicio make verifiable credentials easy to adopt, simple to deploy, and reliable to use. As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a public good that enables people to control their identities online and share their data by consent. Indicio believes in privacy and security by design, interoperability, and supports the open source goals of the decentralized identity community.</p><p>This article was co-written by the Lissi and Indicio team.<br>Cheers</p>

 Key Event Receipt Infrastructure to expand the reach of DIDs&nbsp; <p><br></p> Introduction <p>Work under the <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> hood continues on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. This new type of digital identifier enables the verification that a DID comes from an authenticable source under the control of a governing entity. A DID is always coupled to a unique DID document that describes how to (i.) interact with a governing entity in a trustable way and (ii.) authenticate a DID controller.</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>This association is defined by a DID method, which can be captured directly through a dedicated namespace in the syntax of the DID. Each method defines the basic chaining and processing requirements - CRUD (create, read, update, deactivate) - for the immutable coupling of the DID and its associated DID document. A DID method specification defines both the DID method and the process of DID resolution, describing how a DID document is to be written and subsequently edited. DIDs come with a unique set of characteristics to provide a prominent solution for digital identity in decentralised networks, but there are cons.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID Working Group</a> has already registered <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">84 different method types</a>, which raises questions about interoperability, scalability, and security of the current DID methodology, such as (i.) How secure are DIDs and specific DID methods?, and (ii.) Can all DID methods be trusted?</p><p>In this blog post, these questions are addressed from the viewpoint of <a href="https://keri.one">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), a novel, simple, and improved DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) solution for digital identity. KERI provides a uniform solution to DID document authentication and resolution that will prove invaluable to use cases where security and interoperability are essential (e.g., for global supply chains and humanitarian applications).</p> Interoperability  DID resolution process, a security weakness <p>Each DID method aims to solve the same problem in a nuanced way by responding to a specific problem or use case uniquely by design. However, from the perspective of the user, this compromises the integrity of the network with a variance of digital trust for each method implementation.</p><p>From the inclusion of standard Central Authorities (CAs) to the implementation of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), each solution comes with its own set of pros and cons when it comes to tackling digital security. Some rely on the human trust factor, while others rely on cryptographic assurance and, through these nuances, the DID resolution process, inadvertently, becomes a “magic box” with each specific implementation relying on different security measures.&nbsp;</p><p>If interoperability is a core requirement for a specific use case, assessing and maintaining an optimal level of security and assurance may become difficult. To achieve strong security between the DID and its associated DID document, regardless of who controls and stores the DID Document, interacting actors must assume that the result can always be cryptographically assured and, therefore, trusted. If a specific method is ever compromised, the negative connotations could be detrimental to the SSI community as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>With the ever-increasing number of DID methods, Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA) and digital wallet implementations would have to support all methods for full interoperability to be maintained.</p> Security  DID resolution process, the rise of the “Magic Box” <p>Digital security is only as strong as its weakest link. The process of obtaining a DID document for a given DID is called DID resolution and, when it comes to the DID, it is the weakest link. To create a DID, a user must first generate a public / private key pair. The DID can then be coupled to a DID document and usually within an infrastructure to enable that process. The cryptographic link enables a strong binding between the key and the DID. However, when it comes to the DID resolution process, most DID methods either rely on external sources of information or provide a limited scope on the capability and content of the DID document. There is no standard way of creating a strong binding between a DID and DID document, which compromises the security of the identifier. An example of weak binding is demonstrated by the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web method</a>, which simply points to a DID document in the public domain with a DNS (Domain Name System) resolver used for the retrieval process, e.g.:</p><p>did:web:w3c-ccg.github.io:user:alice</p><p>The DID method, a dedicated namespace in the DID syntax, currently defines the DID resolution process. As mentioned in this post’s introduction, the number of registered DID methods continues to rise exponentially.&nbsp;</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>With the rapid rise of decentralised authentication solutions appearing on the market, many different DID methods are currently active under the hood of applications and services which, for the most part, remain invisible to the end-user. Thus popularity, rather than security, has become the driving factor behind chosen DID methods. Due to this fragmentation, identifying and resolving weak security points of deployed DID methods continues to be cumbersome. Some of the method types, such as the <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DID method</a>, enable the derivation of a DID document directly from the DID itself. However, most rely on external processing to resolve the document, with the source providing a hidden "magic box" that masks the DID resolution process. To maintain system integrity, any DID method that requires external processing via a “magic box” requires trust from all interacting actors. Trust is a human trait. Cryptographic assurance, a machine trait, can often be overlooked in the presence of trust.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital security stems from the resolution process but, with the current DID methodology, a uniform standard is not available across all implementations, which can lead to fragmentation and security risks across the network.</p> How to maintain interoperability &amp; security <p>The weak binding issue between a DID and DID document can be resolved by a technological solution that provides an immutable link between the two objects. In doing so, a DID document can be cryptographically verified for correctness as there is an immutable coupling to a specific DID.&nbsp;</p> Cryptographic hash&nbsp; <p>Cryptographic assurance is provided by generating a hash of the DID document, to be used as the actual identifier. The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key method</a> works in this way. However, this approach is limited as there is no way of rotating the keys, revoking the identifier, or adding additional information to the DID document.</p> Key Event Receipt Infrastructure 








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p><a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) is a protocol that provides a simple set of rules on how to achieve strong bindings between the controller, identifier, and key pair, without sacrificing the functional capabilities of the identifier. It achieves this through solid security principles in its base architecture. KERI generates a type of “DID document” in the form of an appendable private micro-ledger that contains cryptographically-linked sets of events for transaction verification purposes. In doing so, KERI facilitates sapored data supply chains providing an append-only chained <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0000.md">key-event log</a> (KEL) of signed transfer statements, which account for the source of the identifier and all transactions related to it.</p><p>In current KERI implementations, the genesis state of the identifier is “active” as defined by the Human Colossus model of <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/active-and-passive-identifiers">Identifier States</a>, meaning that a signing key is required to authenticate the controller. As a self-certifying identifier with an event log, KERI provides a strong binding between the DID and DID document, thereby enabling all DID identifier operations (e.g., key rotation, delegation, and interaction) to be tracked and cryptographically verified by any recipient of the identifier information. For instances where a controller's keys are compromised, a pre-rotation mechanism for key recoverability is also available. These security-rich enhancements suggest that a magic box, along with any associated weak binding issues, can be benched in favour of KERI, which promises to provide a simple, yet improved, alternative DKMS-solution for digital identity.</p><p>In the current version of the DID specification, location is identifiable via the method space. For example, the <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">did:sov method</a> assigns a DID to the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin</a> MainNet ledger. Other DID methods define the resolution rules for other unique implementations. In terms of security, this level of tailor-made differentiation between use cases can become an attack vector. Having to maintain an ever-growing registry of DID methods and implementation specifics suggests a scalability issue in the current methodology. These issues are disadvantageous to the whole SSI community.<br><br>To solve these issues, KERI introduces a component called Resolver, which provides a mechanism to discover identifiers. Resolver simply maps identifiers to URLs or IP addresses where users can either obtain (or be directed to) auditable identifier event logs. The resolver relies on a distributed hash table (DHT) algorithm, known for its beneficial characteristics in autonomy, decentralization, fault tolerance, and scalability, a good example being <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (InterPlanetary File System) or <a href="https://gnunet.org/en/index.html">GNUnet</a>.&nbsp;</p> Simple and concise <p>The beauty of&nbsp; KERI is that the user can nominate locations through the event log with full autonomy to make edits or location transfers as they wish. To highlight a prevalent issue with the current DID methodology, a DID method may assign an identifier to the Sovrin MainNet but, after a few months, the controller may wish to move it to a new location such as the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> network or an IPFS location. As it currently stands, there is no restriction on the number of identifiers that can be issued to identify the same object. The generation of duplicate identifiers for the same content despite the encoded part of the DID remaining unaltered is problematic. By removing the method space, the identifier can be used on any network, thus providing a truly interoperable solution for decentralised identifiers.</p><p>With KERI, a cryptographically-verifiable DID document is available to a recipient without requiring prior knowledge of the exact location of the object. In the absence of having to define a specific network or alternative storage location in the DID syntax, the namespace for any “magic box” method becomes redundant, along with any fragmentation issues that have arisen from the current DID methodology. In the future, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax">DID syntax</a> as defined in the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> specification, could evolve from …</p><p>did:&lt;method&gt;:&lt;identifier&gt;</p><p>to</p><p>did:&lt;identifier&gt;<br></p><p>The road ahead may be long, but the effort worthwhile, as the revised syntax could bring about an adoption factor where (i.) security is a primary concern (e.g., humanitarian sector) or (ii.) stakeholders for a given business process are numerous and operate in different jurisdictions (e.g., global supply chains).</p> Conclusion &amp; Further developments <p>The current generation of DIDs has introduced an innovative approach to digital identifiers, which has triggered the SSI movement. However, the inclusion of the method space in the DID syntax has led to fragmentation and weak security properties of the identifier type. These known method-space issues give the community impetus to redress them. In light of these innovative developments, now is the time to embrace KERI as an improved interoperable and secure solution for digital identity.</p><p>KERI is a truly secure network-agnostic decentralised identity infrastructure.</p><p>Within <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, a Linux Foundation Project, trustees of the Human Colossus Foundation have convened an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+and+Semantics+Working+Group">Inputs and Semantics Working Group</a> (ISWG), subdivided into an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+Domain+Group">Inputs Domain Group</a> (ISWG-I) and a <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Semantic+Domain+Group">Semantic Domain Group</a> (ISWG-S).

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce the availability of Financial-grade API (FAPI) conformance tests for banks and fintechs in Australia providing consumer data rights (CDR) compliant solutions.</p>
<p>The Foundation recently updated the FAPI conformance suite to ensure that servers following the CDR standards comply with the underlying FAPI specifications, specifically FAPI-RW. These updates include minor changes relative to the underlying FAPI-RW specification:</p>
 
 private_key_jwt must be used 
 x-v header must be sent to resource server endpoint 
 Refresh tokens must be supported 
 Returned id_tokens must be encrypted 
 For “acr” claims, a CDR-specific value is used: “urn:cds.au:cdr:2” 
 
<p>The Foundation is also announcing the availability of FAPI-RW with Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) conformance tests. PAR is an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-par">IETF standard developed within the OAuth Working Group</a> that is an evolution of the FAPI-RW’s request object endpoint. FAPI-RW with PAR avoids passing the authorization details via the front channel, which is better for privacy and avoids any size limits on URLs. This new certification service also optionally covers the new pushed authorization request (PAR) spec that CDR introduced in November 2020.</p>
<p>A number of Australian organizations have “tested the tests” against their CDR environments, finding a number of interoperability and security issues in the deployments of Data Holders – which were then addressed before they impacted a significant number of Data Recipients.</p>
<p>More information about running the new CDR and PAR conformance tests can be found here: <a href="https://openid.net/certification/fapi_op_testing/">https://openid.net/certification/fapi_op_testing/</a>.</p>

<p>Dear OpenID Foundation Members:</p>
<p>This is to update the OpenID Foundation community on our leadership transition and plans for 2021. We’ve enlisted the support of Women in Identity, IDPro and other groups to insure a broad international search and a diversity of backgrounds for the Foundation’s next Executive Director. Our search efforts are ongoing so please feel free to send your nominations to Vice Chairman Bjorn Hjelm.</p>
<p>Despite the headwinds of 2020, the awareness of the OpenID Foundation’s international technical leadership has translated into adoption momentum across working groups. Many point to the Financial-Grade APIs (FAPI) Working Group diversity of requirements and ongoing technical improvement has driven FAPI’s global adoption. The extensibility of open standards and the increasing importance of international interoperability has been a particular focus area of Don Thibeau’s for the Foundation during this leadership transition.</p>
<p>To maintain this momentum and help guide the OpenID Foundation’s new leadership, we’ve asked Don Thibeau to continue to serve, but in a new role as a Non Executive Director on the OpenID Foundation board of directors. This provides the board and its new leadership the time, continuity and experience needed to transition and grow. And most importantly, is to continue to build on the contribution of those in OpenID Foundation working groups that are the foundation of our success.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support of and contributions to the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

   Defining a Self Sovereign Identity and Blockchain-based system for recognizing academic credentials across Education and Employment.

<p><br><a href="https://digitalscot.live/blockchain/"></a></p>
 Through technologies like the <a title="<h3 class=&quot;wpg-tooltip-title&quot;><span class=&quot;wpg-tooltip-term-title&quot;>Blockchain</span></h3><div class=&quot;wpg-tooltip-content&quot;>A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).<p class=&quot;wpg-read-more&quot;><a href=&quot;https://digitalscot.net/glossary/blockchain/&quot;>Read More</a><p></div>" href="https://digitalscot.net/glossary/blockchain/">Blockchain</a> and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), all aspects of how our currently paper-based economy works will be digitized, forming Scotland’s Digital Economy. 
<p>For example consider key documents like your passport, birth certificate and drivers licence. Most likely you have these in paper form, and for processes like opening a bank account, you must physically present these documents.</p>
<p>Digitizing these documents and the processes that call upon them are the building blocks for creating a digital economy.</p>
 Digital Recognition Networks 
<p>The idea of a ‘<a href="https://digitalscot.net/scottish-common-blockchain/">Common Blockchain</a>‘ is a single platform that enables multiple applications for multiple industries and use cases.</p>
<p>Similarly the core dynamic of SSI is one of multiple organizations sharing identity data, known as credentials, hence why a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/scottish-credential-ecosystem/">Scottish credential sharing network</a> is a key objective.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/10/25/building-shared-digital-identity/">his blog</a> Amit Jasuja explains the core mechanics of this and how multiple organizations can share digital identity services, an ecosystem of ‘relying’ and ‘issuing’ parties.</p>
<p>Another great way of describing this ecosystem is “Digital Recognition Networks” – The ecosystem will be formed through organizations establishing agreements to share data and recognize the digital credentials of partners they work with to fulfill these processes, like opening a bank account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cphrab.ca/how-use-recognition-networks-your-talent-strategy">Writing for the CPHR</a> Terrahub explains the principle through exploring an excellent use case of how this will take shape and the economic benefits it will bring: Education and Employment.</p>
<p>“In a recognition network, skills and credentials are represented by digital badges that organizations use for achievement and an employee can us for permanent external branding during or post-employment.</p>
<p>As brands move global and geographical boundaries dissolve, these recognition networks enable talent to shift and move without having to re-qualify their competency, eliminating frustration for the employee, and inefficiency for the employer by getting the right people to work fast.”</p>
<p>Education and Employment is a great scenario as the core components are easily understood: The credential – Your academic qualification in certificate form, and the recognition – How employers seek that qualification as a requirement for employment.</p>
 Transforming Education on the Blockchain 
<p>This also highlights the value of the Blockchain in this scenario. Via their Medium article UniversaBlockchain explore <a href="https://medium.com/universablockchain/blockchain-in-education-49ad413b9e12">Blockchain in Education</a>, highlighting key problems like the high rates of medical school diploma falsification.</p>
<p>So technology innovations like ‘<a href="https://www.blockcerts.org/">Blockcerts</a>‘ will address this, an open source blockchain project for enabling a Universal Verifier that will verify any Blockcert issued by any institution, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Countries like <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/good-clean-use-case-bahamian-students-graduate-on-the-blockchain">the Bahamas</a> are now issuing Blockchain-based academic certificates.</p>
<p>Digitary is one vendor specializing in this sector, offering a <a href="https://www.digitary.net/products/">suite of features</a>&nbsp;for managing academic credentials and digital badges, and has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitary.net/digitary-evernym-webinar/">teamed up with Evernym</a>&nbsp;to integrate these with Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aruccnationalnetwork.ca/news">this news</a> highlights one of the first customers to harness this capability is the Association of the Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC),&nbsp; choosing Digitary as the solution provider for the Made for Canada National Network.</p>
<p>This initiative means the Canadian higher education community is creating the very first online platform and national credential wallet for post-secondary learners. Once fully operational, the Network will enable 3 million learners across the country to access and share their official digitized post-secondary transcripts and credentials online – anytime, anywhere.</p>
 APPII 
<p>To examine the employment aspect we can highlight a Scottish startup: <a href="https://appii.io/">APPII</a>.</p>
<p>APPII harnesses the Blockchain to enable users to build a ‘<a href="https://appii.io/build-verified-cv-blockchain/">Verified CV</a>‘, a digital resume where your credentials have been validated with the issuing organization. A powerful example of a Digital Recognition Network.</p>
<p>Highlighting the potential of a common platform approach to enable multiple use case solutions, they’ve also applied their technology to offer Covid-19 verified ‘Digital Health Passports’.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>APPII, in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/Coforge_Tech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Coforge_Tech</a>, have developed a "Digitial Health Passport" that verifies Covid-19 testing and vaccinations. A very exciting initiative to be part of that will hopefully open up travel and business in the UK and overseas.<a href="https://t.co/diYLaBSvoE">https://t.co/diYLaBSvoE</a></p>

 2020 — How SSI Went Mainstream <p>January 12,&nbsp;2021</p> An introduction to SSI and where it came from.<br>2020 as a growth catalyst and where SSI is going.<br>A <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> perspective. <p>Written by:<br>Chris Raczkowski — Sovrin Foundation, Chairman of the Board of Trustees<br>Drummond Reed — Evernym, Chief Trust Officer; ToIP, Steering Committee Member</p><p>It goes without saying that last year was transformational for the world. Along with pains felt by many, the challenges of 2020 were also a catalyst for positive growth. The global SSI community, dedicated to privacy-respecting digital identity, has risen to these challenges. Digital identity solutions have been called into action by governments and companies large and small to help mitigate pandemic-related public health challenges. This call to action has accelerated adoption of SSI across many use cases where it brings new standards of truly privacy-respecting digital identity control to all peoples of the&nbsp;world.</p> But first, what is&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI is an acronym for self-sovereign identity, representing the secure, privacy-respecting digital identity model developed around blockchain technology starting in 2016. During the last five years acceptance of this model has grown rapidly. SSI utilizes best practices in open-source cryptography and decentralized computing in tandem with humanistic governance. It also helped drive development of new technology open standards such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>. While SSI incorporates a wide range of complex technology and detailed governance, its essence is captured in the opening chapter of a book that will be published during&nbsp;2021:</p><blockquote>“The best overall analogy for the decentralized identity model (SSI) is in fact exactly the way we prove our identity to each other every day: by getting out our wallet and showing the credentials we have obtained from other trusted parties.&nbsp;... With decentralized digital identity, we just do this with digital wallets, digital credentials, and digital connections.” ¹</blockquote><blockquote>SSI has emerged as a, “simple, neutral, memorable name for this new model for digital identity.” ²</blockquote> Open Source and Open Standards: Growth Engines of&nbsp;SSI <p>SSI is rooted in core principles of privacy-respecting Internet-scale identity architecture first laid out by individuals like Kim Cameron with his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352/#lawsofiden_topic3">Laws of Identity</a>, which were published in 2006. Such governance principles, combined with open-source technology advances in blockchain, cryptography, supporting software and standards, ultimately gave rise to reliable SSI infrastructure starting in 2017. Open-source development of digital identity technology, standards and principles is truly the engine of SSI&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, a not-for-profit corporation, was established in 2016 to promote global adoption of SSI as an open standard for digital identity. Over the past five years the Foundation has operated the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a> as the best-known SSI identity network, helped advanced the most widely used SSI open-source software (Hyperledger Indy, Ursa, and Aries), published the most widely used <a href="https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/">SSI governance framework</a>, and drives SSI thought leadership in areas including data protection, financial inclusion, IoT, and government-issued ID. In its role as an originator and disseminator of open-source SSI concepts and code, the Sovrin Foundation is dedicated to supporting SSI development in cooperation with companies, organizations and governments around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>One of the most important products of this work is the “Sovrin Stack,” shown in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>Figure 1: The Sovrin Stack, developed by the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community, was created in early 2019 and is curated as part of the open-source Sovrin Governance Framework.<p>The Sovrin Stack was the first conceptualization of SSI infrastructure as a four-layer stack, where the lower two layers provide cryptographic trust needed for machine-to-machine communications and the upper two layers provide human trust needed for business, legal, and social interactions.</p><p>The Sovrin Stack also represents the first recognition of the critical role governance frameworks play in bridging the technological innovations of SSI with real-world policy requirements of governments, industries, businesses and individuals. In fact, as the importance of governance frameworks became more widely acknowledged, the SSI community recognized that specialized governance was needed at all four layers of the stack. During early 2020 the Sovrin Stack evolved into the Trust over IP (ToIP) stack, shown in Figure&nbsp;2.</p>Figure 2: The ToIP stack, showing how governance frameworks apply to all four layers of the stack, and also how Layer 4 can support entire digital trust ecosystems.<p>As a model for decentralized digital trust infrastructure at Internet-scale, the ToIP stack was compelling enough that in May 2020 it became the cornerstone of a new Linux Foundation project called the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a>. Rapid growth of ToIP Foundation membership is a testament to how core concepts of SSI architecture are strongly supported by respected governments and companies.</p><p>Emergence of entirely new organizations promoting SSI adoption is evidence of the effectiveness of the Sovrin Foundation’s open-source approach to advancing technology and thought leadership. The Foundation’s success is measured not only in by results it delivers, but in the progress of derivative and novel SSI products and services created by organizations which build on contributions of Sovrin and the global SSI community.</p> 2019: Early success ahead of unexpected crisis <p>Prior to the global public health crisis of 2020, SSI was progressing along a steadily increasing adoption curve. Start-up companies, global corporations, digital identity privacy organizations and a variety of national and regional governments (Canada, UK, US, Germany, British Columbia, Ontario, etc.) were all expanding SSI infrastructure and launching initial use cases. This advancement was based on vigorous technology development (open-source software architecture, code and standards), a robust global public identity utility (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a>), the first comprehensive decentralized digital identity governance framework (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance Framework</a>), and proof of concept use cases produced by a variety of governments and companies.</p><p>Woven throughout this activity, the Sovrin Foundation acted as a convener, facilitator and beacon for the global SSI community. The Foundation’s commitment to the <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">Principles of SSI</a>, open-source technology and identity ecosystem governance, combined with efforts to sow the ethos of SSI across a spectrum of use-cases, helped to create fertile ground for emergent applications. During this course of activities Sovrin and the SSI community unknowingly primed the world for tremendous acceleration of SSI adoption during a most unexpected year.</p> 2020: The SSI Springtime <p>As the world embarked on a new decade at the start of 2020, almost no one could have guessed what their lives and societies would look like 365 days later. Public health challenges of 2020 brought tremendous stress and grief to most corners of the world. Yet, the situation also created opportunity for unprecedented growth of technologies that could address urgent social needs. For SSI, this meant compressing what could have been a five-to-ten-year adoption process for sensitive use-cases into a period of 12&nbsp;months.</p><p>During normal times, new technology standards for critical services such as medical information credentials, travel credentials and critical worker credentials often face regulatory review and approval marathons spanning years or even decades. Fortunately, prior to 2020, the core components of SSI had already been assessed and accepted by respected companies and governments. These organizations understood that trusted digital identity must be privacy-respecting, which is a central requirement for SSI technology and governance. With solutions needed immediately for verifiable proof of medical test results, vaccination status, etc., the standards and technology developed with the support of the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community have been fast-tracked into&nbsp;service.</p><p>Just a few of the SSI implementations that were launched in 2020 or are pending launch in early 2021&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/publications/travel-pass/">IATA Travel Pass</a> will be the first verifiable credential capable of providing proof of COVID-19 test and vaccination status at airports around the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/covid-19-nhs-to-trial-digital-passports-to-free-up-staff-movement/">NHS Staff Passport</a> is the first portable digital identity credential for doctors and nurses in one of the largest public healthcare networks in the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about/this-is-gleif">GLEIF</a> (the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation), based in Switzerland and the only global online source that provides open, standardized and high quality legal entity reference data, is <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/lei-corporate-digital-identity-verifiable-credentials-did/">committed to following the SSI model</a> for digital identity credentials for companies.  <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/DE/Standardartikel/SchaufensterSichereDigIdentProjekte/sdi-projekt_ssi.html">SSI4DE</a>, co-funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs, supports showcases for secure digital identities in Germany, and <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/e-personalausweis-alternative-zu-google-und-facebook-merkel-macht-digitale-identitaet-zur-chefsache/26684942.html?ticket=ST-22324660-c75hUhsrgC4moLTe3uGj-ap3">Chancellor Angela Merkel declared digital identity as a priority</a> matter during December&nbsp;2020.  <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a> brings SSI to financial services with Credit Union customer identity verification,  <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/">Farmer Connect</a> is realizing is vision to “Humanize consumption through technology” by enabling and empowering individual coffee farmers to more easily work with global enterprises, and reducing costs and inefficiencies for large companies to work directly with small and often remote&nbsp;farmers.  <a href="https://www.lumedic.io/perspectives/introducing-lumedic-connect">Lumedic Exchange</a> is the first network designed exclusively for patient-centric exchange of healthcare data using SSI-based verifiable credentials.  <p>While scientists and professionals in the fields of biology, genetics, immunology, medicine and public health are the superstars of 2020, SSI is also in a position to make a major contribution. Reliable digital credentials for medical test results and vaccination status, in the form of W3C Verifiable Credentials backed by privacy-respecting governance, can help societies more safely return to normal levels of social interaction and restart economies. At the same time, the SSI model will be establishing new standards and expectations for person identity data management and control by individuals.</p> 2021: Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>Unexpected urgencies that accelerated broad acceptance of the SSI digital identity model during 2020 will continue into 2021. Ongoing challenges of the global pandemic can be mitigated by expanded use cases and public acceptance of trusted digital identity. In the most forward-thinking and dynamic jurisdictions, SSI progress is anticipated in the following areas:</p>  Verifiable digital vaccination credentials to facilitate safer operations at some workplaces, medical facilities and senior care&nbsp;centers,  International travel enabled by vaccination and medical test results quickly and easily proved with the power of verifiable digital credentials,  Rollout of government-issued ID such as driver licenses in the form of digital credentials conforming to SSI standards and securely stored in privacy-respecting digital wallets on smart&nbsp;phones,  Expansion of SSI digital identity networks, along with demonstrated interoperability of digital credentials and their verification across multiple networks using smart phone apps (digital ID wallets),  Laws and regulations implemented at state, provincial and national levels which support the use of digital Verifiable Credentials for medical, financial and other&nbsp;uses.  <p>While the wellbeing of individuals and societies during this historic time rests largely on the clear thinking and actions of responsible scientists, business leaders and government leaders, SSI is also playing a significant role. The Sovrin Foundation is dedicated to supporting global adoption of SSI to help mitigate challenges of this pandemic, while advancing its mission of Identity for&nbsp;All.</p> Notes   Alex Preukschat, Drummond Reed.

<p>Release Date: January 5th 2021</p>



<p>Today, the IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) and FIDO Alliance announced that they are collaborating to improve the status of IoT security.</p>



<p>The main aims of the collaboration are to raise awareness on the limitations of passwords for IoT devices and provide practical alternatives for product manufacturers. The goals of the collaboration will be achieved by joint messaging and providing publicly accessible materials to help industry implement password-less authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s the problem with passwords?</p>



<p>Passwords are a traditional and simple method for authenticating a user and allowing access to resources. In the past this may have been sufficient, but passwords dramatically fall short in many ways when billions of devices are expected to be connected to networks to collect and share data or provide automation – the era of IoT.</p>



<p>Although this is not a new problem, users are still finding it a challenge to manage and keep track of different accounts and app login credentials. The result is that many take shortcuts – using easy to remember (and guess) passwords, or using the same password across many accounts1. This weakens security. Now consider the growing number of home, business, medical, industrial and national infrastructure uses of IoT which bring efficiency, innovation and user benefits. IoT devices are everywhere and the trend is set to continue as <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-iot-devices-are-there/">this article</a> illustrates. For IoT-class products such as routers and webcams, traditionally manufacturers have opted to have factory universal default passwords2 and whilst these can be changed, a significant number remain set to the default. This makes them prime targets for botnets which weaponize devices for DDOS attacks such as the famous Mirai and its many variants.</p>



<p>This means that the sheer volume of devices is only going to exacerbate the issues experienced with passwords today. In summary, passwords are not a good solution to the requirements of IoT authentication now, or in the future.</p>



<p>How can this be addressed?</p>



<p>New standards and forthcoming regulation are helping to drive change. The ETSI 303 6453 baseline requirements for consumer IoT cyber security standard published mid 2020, has a provision for “no universal default passwords” and this standard is now being used as a basis for regulation and certification schemes internationally4.</p>



<p>Whilst “no universal passwords” is a good start for regulation5, it does not go far enough. The good news is that there are good alternatives to passwords, so they can be eliminated, and they are also better and simpler to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How are IoTSF and FIDO Alliance working together?</p>



<p>Both organisations will work together to promote the awareness and use of password-less forms of authentication and link working group activities to ensure industry can access publicly available materials when designing new products.</p>



<p>The IoT Technical Working Group of the FIDO Alliance aims to build a comprehensive authentication framework for IoT devices which provides detailed technical specifications for password-less authentication.</p>



<p>The IoT Security Foundation publishes best practice cyber security advice for product manufacturers and users of IoT systems. Its IoT Security Compliance Framework Working Group is dedicated to the creation and maintenance of the framework which guides developers through a structured process of questioning and evidence gathering. This helps companies make better products with security by design. It is in this area where both organisations intend to collaborate at the technical level to complement the advocacy of passwords alternatives.</p>



<p>John Moor, Managing Director IoTSF said, “The use of passwords for security is an outdated and outmoded security practice for the digital age. There are solutions which are stronger from a technical perspective and better from a user’s perspective. We are delighted to be working closely with the FIDO Alliance to help eliminate the use of passwords and drive better practice for our manufacturing members.”</p>



<p>Christina Hulka, executive director and COO of the FIDO Alliance said, “The FIDO Alliance mission is to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords with simpler and stronger authentication, including in IoT which unfortunately continues to rely on default or weak password authentication. We look forward to working with the IoT Security Foundation to accelerate our path toward bringing passwordless authentication to IoT.”</p>

				 <p>In 2020 aNewGovernance, Onecub, and Visions have participated with Capgemini in a report for the French Banque des Territoire on the state of the art for Self-Data, and personal data sharing:</p>
<p>In the context of strong digitization of activities and services, the question of control and protection of personal data is a key issue. With this in mind, in 2018 the DPMR was created to provide a framework for the collection and use of data. Also, for a trusted digital world, a new concept is beginning to emerge: self-data.</p>
<p>Self-data can be defined in a few words as «&nbsp;the production, exploitation, and sharing of personal data by individuals, under their control and for their own purposes&nbsp;» (definition given by the New Generation Internet Foundation).</p>
<p>At the crossroads of data governance and digital trust, the control of personal data by each individual is a challenge for the digital projects of European public and private players. However, the construction of such a model also depends on the ability to remove obstacles on the technical, political, legal, and economic levels. This is why the Bank of Territories is publishing a study that proposes an inventory of the ecosystem of self-data actors.</p>
<p>This document aims to provide a clear and updated vision of the actors who propose solutions to implement self-data, the brakes and levers that need to be taken into account, and initiatives that can serve as an example to embark in turn on such a project.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation plays an important role in the interoperability of Internet identity. This is to announce the OpenID Foundation individual community board members 2021 election schedule. Those elected will help determine the role the Foundation plays in facilitating the creation and adoption of open identity standards.</p>
<p>Per the Foundation’s bylaws, three individual community board members are elected. Nat Sakimura’s and John Bradley’s two-year terms are expiring this year. (George Fletcher has an additional year remaining on his two-year term.) I want to thank Nat and John for their service to the OIDF and the community at large. Nat and John are eligible to be re-elected, should they choose to run again.</p>
<p>The individual community board member election will be conducted on the following schedule:</p>
<p>• Nominations open: Friday, January 8, 2021<br>
• Nominations close: Friday, January 22, 2021<br>
• Election begins: Monday, January 25, 2021<br>
• Election ends: Monday, February 8, 2021<br>
• Results announced by: Friday, February 12, 2021<br>
• New board term starts: Thursday, February 18, 2021</p>
<p>All members of the OpenID Foundation are eligible to nominate themselves, second the nominations of others including those who self-nominated, and vote for candidates. If you’re not already a member of the OpenID Foundation, we encourage you to join now at <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/registration">https://openid.net/foundation/members/registration</a>.</p>
<p>Voting and nominations are conducted on the OpenID Foundation web site: <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/elections/46">https://openid.net/foundation/members/elections/46</a>. You will need to log in at <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/members/">https://openid.net/foundation/members/</a> to participate in nominations and voting. If you experience problems participating in the election or joining the foundation, please send an email to <a href="mailto:help@oidf.org">help@oidf.org</a> right away.</p>
<p>Board participation requires a substantial investment of time and energy. It is a volunteer effort that should not be undertaken lightly. Should you be elected, expect to be called upon to serve both on the board and on its committees. If you’re committed to open identity standards and work well with others, we encourage your candidacy.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to publicly address these questions in your candidate statement:</p>
<p>1. What are the key opportunities you see for the OpenID Foundation in 2021?<br>
2. How will you demonstrate your commitment in terms of resources, focus and leadership?<br>
3. What would you like to see accomplished in 2021; how do you personally plan to make this happen?<br>
4. What other resources can you bring to the foundation to help the foundation attain its goals?<br>
5. What current or past experiences, skills, or interests will inform your contributions and views?</p>
<p>Candidates can address these questions in their election statements on various community mailing lists, especially <a href="mailto:openid-general@lists.openid.net">openid-general@lists.openid.net</a>. Please forward questions, comments and suggestions to me at <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a>.</p>

   Tech giants like Stripe, Square and Shopify are pioneering the future of finance: 'Embedded Banking'.

<p></p>
 As Vilve Vene, CEO of ModularBank, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-banking-embedded-vilve-vene/">writes on Linkedin</a>, the Future of Banking is ‘Embedded Banking’. 
<p>Vilve describes the inflection point the industry is going through. Previously banks would sell their products like loans and payments directly, now they can be ’embedded’ into the services of non-financial organizations, from retailers to utility companies.</p>
<p>Open Banking provides the technical foundations for building these integrated models but even more so consumer demand is accelerating the trend. Customers are less concerned with staying loyal to their primary bank and more driven by the immediacy and convenience of the buying process.</p>
<p>This is especially compelling when you consider the integrated nature of the transaction context. When dealing with an estate or travel agent, having the financial component of the service come as part of a packaged service makes for an improved customer experience, such as a better <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/open-banking-holds-the-keys-to-unlocking-a-better-mortgage-journey/">mortgage journey</a>.</p>
 From Startups to Starbucks – The Embedded API Opportunity 
<p>At the heart of the trend is the use of APIs to interconnect businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/from-startups-to-starbucks-the-embedded-api-opportunity/">TechCrunch writes</a> about the evolving landscape of tech giants moving into this field, such as Google’s banking and payments announcement along with IPO bound companies such as Airbnb, DoorDash and Affirm all mentioning “financial services” in S-1 filings.</p>
<p>“Imagine if you are a global airline company and the benefit of not having to staff a know-your-customer compliance or fraud detection team. Or for lenders who can minimize risk and increase speed by not having to request a pay stub or personal information verification?”</p>
<p>They highlight recent news such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/">Stripe’s launch of Stripe Treasury</a>, a Banking-as-a-Service API. A developer can take advantage of Stripe Treasury to open bank accounts directly from their service by triggering Stripe’s API, and you can move money or pay bills using API calls. Combined with&nbsp;<a href="https://stripe.com/issuing">Stripe Issuing</a>, you can also issue a virtual or physical card and connect it to a bank account.</p>
<p>Examples of digital businesses building on this capability include <a href="https://betakit.com/shopify-balance-to-be-powered-by-stripe-evolve-bancorp/">Shopify</a>, who will be utilizing it to power their Shopify Balance service – a bank account, card, and rewards program for Shopify merchants.</p>
<p>The move represents a major expansion into the FinTech vertical for Shopify and put the company in competition with homegrown FinTech startups like Koho, Wealthsimple, and Borrowell, as well as global players including Revolut and Monzo.</p>
<p>The FinTech Times <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/value-added-services-and-the-flip-side-of-embedded-finance/">writes about Square’s strategy</a>:</p>
<p>“The payments company known for its point-of-sale dongles turned itself into a sprawling financial apparatus by adding traditional services like small business loans through Square Capital, but it’s also been able to hook merchants with its array of add-ons like email marketing and payroll support. These are tools that small business merchants need, and the ability to access them from within a platform they are already on is invaluable.”</p>
 Weavr.io 
<p>Naturally given it is such a hot sector there are startups emerging to specialize in enabling the trend, such as <a href="https://www.weavr.io/embedded-banking/">Weavr.io</a>, founded and led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-mifsud/">Alex Mifsud</a>&nbsp;and specializing in enabling ‘<a href="https://www.weavr.io/sector-digital-businesses/">Financially Integrated Digital Businesses</a>.’</p>
<p>Their solutions include <a href="https://www.weavr.io/product-mono-overview/">Mono</a> – issue cards and IBANs for your business, and manage all your banking activity via API, <a href="https://www.weavr.io/product-multi-overview/">Multi</a> – issue cards and IBANs for your customer via a white labelled API, and <a href="https://www.weavr.io/product-meta-overview/">Meta</a> – their platform for creating and deploying embedded banking products.</p>

<p>Newark, NJ, January 5, 2021 – Edge, the region’s nonprofit research and education network and technology partner, has announced a partnership with <a href="https://www.grmdocumentmanagement.com/">GRM Information Management</a> (GRM), a leader in enterprise content management (ECM) solutions. Via its <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgemarket/">EdgeMarket Cooperative Pricing System</a>, Edge has awarded a procurement contract which will give EdgeMarket participants the ability to efficiently and affordably procure GRM’s solutions and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This contract award and resulting partnership is the result of a thorough RFP process, designed to meet members’ needs related to digital transformation and content management. Via its cloud-based platform, GRM provides a set of solutions and capabilities such as document management software, workflow automation, iForms (GRM’s proprietary intelligent forms technology), business process management, machine learning, and intelligent data capture, all coupled with the cutting-edge security features.</p>
<p>GRM’s comprehensive offering allows organizations to harness data and processes in order to deliver dramatic improvements in efficiency, savings and insights into data.</p>

 Internet Shutdowns in&nbsp;2021  Rethinking advocacy strategies <p>It’s that time of the year again when expert analysts take a gaze into the future and proffer an outlook for the year ahead. In international affairs perhaps there is none as eminent as The Economist magazine’s “<a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2020/11/16/ten-trends-to-watch-in-the-coming-year">The world in 2021</a>’’ — insights that leaders in politics, business, and finance draw from to shape personal, institutional, and national agendas for the incoming&nbsp;year.</p><p>In digital rights, it is perhaps also apt to take a look at the incoming year to prepare for whatever it might throw up. An important trend to anticipate in the coming year is Internet shutdowns, and their impact on freedom of expression, political participation, and societal development, particularly in the global&nbsp;south.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/background-data-network-web-3228704/">Pixabay</a><p>Internet shutdowns have become a common tactic deployed in the past decade by authoritarian regimes to restrict human rights and citizen mobilization, particularly around political events such as elections and mass protests. The digital rights organization AccessNow documented at least <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/keepiton/#problem">213 shutdowns</a> in the year 2019 across 33 countries. In 2020 some of the countries that shut down the Internet include <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ethiopia-enters-3rd-week-of-internet-shutdown-after-unrest/2020/07/14/4699c400-c5d6-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/31/end-internet-shutdowns-manage-covid-19">Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar</a>. For the year 2021, we get the sense it is simply a question of when, rather than if there will be Internet shutdowns. However, there is no escaping the fact that this blunt tool of human rights repression is largely a feature of countries in the global south. In Africa, <a href="https://cipesa.org/2019/03/despots-and-disruptions-five-dimensions-of-internet-shutdowns-in-africa/">research</a> by the digital rights organization CIPESA revealed a correlation between government styles and the incidence of Internet shutdowns. Internet shutdowns occur less frequently in real, functioning democracies, and more in <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1576745/african-dictatorships-shut-down-the-internet-the-most/">authoritarian regimes</a>, the research&nbsp;noted.</p><p>The persistence of Internet shutdowns in authoritarian regimes despite perennial advocacy efforts by civil society organizations perhaps suggests the need for a shift in advocacy strategies to combat it. The first evolution of advocacy strategies to combat Internet shutdowns focused on the human rights angle — appealing to the governments and corporate actors who implemented shutdowns to see that shutdowns amounted to trampling on human rights of freedom of opinion, expression, and association. No other document encapsulates this approach as <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/un-passes-resolution-condemning-internet-shutdowns/">the resolution</a> by the UN Human Rights Council stating that human rights enjoyed offline also apply&nbsp;online.</p><p>This approach did not always work, necessitating the second evolution of advocacy strategies targeting shutdowns. Rather than focusing only on the human rights angle, these strategies also highlighted the economic losses shutdowns foist on economies. Examples of this approach include research by the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/intenet-shutdowns-v-3.pdf">Brookings Institution</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/kr/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/the-economic-impact-of-disruptions-to-internet-connectivity-report-for-facebook.html">Deloitte</a>, and <a href="https://cipesa.org/?wpfb_dl=252">CIPESA</a> detailing in figures the losses accruing to the economies of nations that implement shutdowns. Given that some of the countries which implement shutdowns are also among the poorest in the world, this advocacy approach held some promise. This promise was however disappointed, as it emerged that the regimes which implemented shutdowns were more swayed by the survival of their regimes than economic considerations. Occasionally there was the counter-argument proffered by some of these states that although Internet shutdowns resulted in economic losses, they were nevertheless implemented to prevent even bigger losses and the collapse of&nbsp;states.</p><p>All these bring us to a third way. If these two illustrious approaches to Internet shutdown advocacy have not been effective, there has to be a better way. In the observation that Internet shutdowns persist in authoritarian regimes and are rare in functioning democracies perhaps lies a path to effective advocacy strategies. As has been touted in recent years in development circles, what if the future of digital rights advocacy lies in its participation in broader advocacy efforts that target broader societal reforms in the electoral process, government accountability and transparency, and development? This can be achieved, for instance, by digital rights advocacy <a href="https://www.apc.org/en/news/internet-shutdowns-africa-it-being-cut-world">organizations collaborating</a> with the broader human rights community.</p><p>Internet shutdowns and other digital rights abuses do not spring out of a vacuum. Instead, they proceed from broader dysfunctional societal systems needing reform. If, in general, societies heal and reform in the broad areas of electoral processes, accountability and transparency, and development, in time this progress will seep into better digital rights standards. This approach takes time but is sustainable. The new year 2021 is another opportunity to intensify our efforts in adopting new methods in advocating against Internet shutdowns.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">Internet shutdowns in 2021</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Rinku Lamba, Rajarshi Dasgupta, Mohinder Singh, Valerian Rodrigues &amp; Shefali&nbsp;Jha  Session <p>Indian politics had witnessed the entry of new social movements in the 1970s, adding a whole set of new issues, actors, and ways of activism to the older nationalist tradition. We suggest a similar change is now taking place, as different ways of governance and interventions aided by latest technologies are emerging in the social media. Websites, blogs, tweets, emails and online petitions are creating a new virtual space for politics, through information, propaganda, debates, appeals and mobilizations.</p><p>The proposed session will discuss this emerging field of power, critically considering its democratic potential and interrogating the political issues and ideas at stake in it. The aim is to tackle the new forms of civic and public-political engagements witnessed in the domain of social media, and analyze their implications for the theory and practice of democracy. In the process our papers would explore conceptual notions such as agency, political act and participation as well as notions of selfhood and subjectivity.</p> Plan <p>We will present four papers, with a question-answer and discussion session at the end. The papers will be addressing broadly three kinds of concerns.</p>  The first concern is to identify novel understandings of the political and political acts in the social media. We ask the following questions in this regard: What are the political issues and ideas at stake and how do they affect conventional understandings of democracy? Who are the new actors outside the fray of party-centered politics and how do they see what is political in the acts of internet-users? How are political institutions including parties reacting to the phenomena?  The second concern relates to probing the new forms of political subjectivity that are emerging in this process. The questions here include: What kind of political actor is getting shaped by the forms of political participation engendered by the social media? How does the virtual nature of practice impact on questions of location and identity as determinants of political membership and political action? Is this nature of virtual participation too fluid for the state to&nbsp;control?  The third concern relates to the forms of exclusion and inclusion that virtual participation entails. This involves questions like: What kind of social capital is necessary for talking part in the process and does it cut across cultural and economic divisions? What kinds of interest drive the social media? How does it shape the meaning of political concepts like representation and rights, accountability and political agency?  <p>It is likely that we will raise more questions than we can answer at this point. However, we think it is important to raise them all the more in keeping with the questions that make up the focus of the conference, especially, the first question of how do we conceptualize, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India.</p> Readings <p>None.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2.PoliticsOnSocialMedia">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Politics On Social Media : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Rinku Lamba is Assistant Professor at the Centre for Political Studies in<br>Jawaharlal Nehru University. She was educated in Delhi, Oxford and Toronto, and has a strong interest in modern Indian political thought, democratic theory, the history of western political thought, and contemporary political theory (especially secularism, liberalism and multiculturalism). Her published work includes essays on state power, nationalism, Ambedkar’s views on the reform of religion, and on the discourse about socio-religious reform in colonial India.

<p>Latest Recognition Further Demonstrates Company Protects Customers’ Identity and Personal Data by Complying with NIST 800-63 Standard</p>
<p>HERNDON, VA, January 6, 2021 – <a href="https://www.exostar.com/">Exostar</a>, the leader in trusted, secure business collaboration in <a href="https://www.exostar.com/industry/aerospace-defense/">aerospace and defense</a> (A&amp;D), <a href="https://www.exostar.com/industries/1-life-sciences/">life sciences</a>, and <a href="https://www.exostar.com/solution/electronic-prescribing-of-controlled-substances-epcs/">healthcare</a>, today announced it has been named a full service credential service provider by the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>.&nbsp; Kantara granted the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/">Identity Assurance Trust Framework certification</a> at Level of Assurance 3 (LOA 3), allowing Exostar to seamlessly continue to align with mandates issued by the Drug Enforcement Agency for the electronic prescribing of controlled substances (EPCS) by healthcare providers using Health IT systems.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to award Exostar the Kantara Full Service Trust Mark of Approval signifying conformity with the <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__kantarainitiative.org_trustoperations_classes-2Dof-2Dapproval_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=Y-5k_vZqOdvZLAvUWnOKiF8H-wGp2ZYOUWXyn-twYHo&amp;m=7aFEaxwRdN-cHjPtQzVAjKqkQznOoDVjt0kzw3sXi3s&amp;s=5KkOB3BTk19SoVDd0inBhscVfraiJgqiJ_HIe8V20Yk&amp;e=">Kantara Classic Class of Approval</a> for digital identity requirements at LOA 3,” said Colin Wallis, executive director, Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; “This is a significant achievement and market differentiator for Exostar.&nbsp; The Kantara assessment and review process is rigorous and approval demonstrates a company’s care and respect for its customers.”</p>
<p>With this additional <a href="https://www.exostar.com/company/affiliations-certificates/">identity-based certification</a>, Exostar becomes 1 of only 3 companies to achieve Kantara’s full service designation for its <a href="https://www.exostar.com/solution/identity-credentialing-and-access-services/">identity proofing, credentialing, and authentication</a> capabilities.&nbsp; The accreditation follows an audit by a Kantara-approved third-party assessor spanning nearly 700 questions and requirements from the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s 800-63 standard and beyond, across categories including security, governance, infrastructure, operations, and finance.</p>
<p>The certification remains valid for 3 years.&nbsp; With it, Exostar qualifies to work more closely with Kantara to define the future of identity and access management technology, specifically as it impacts highly-regulated industries like healthcare, life sciences, A&amp;D, and banking, financial services, and insurance.</p>
<p>This newest recognition comes as Exostar continues to extend its market leadership by leveraging its identity and access management platform and products to support critically-important secure business collaboration use cases in life sciences and healthcare.&nbsp; The firm’s <a href="https://www.exostar.com/product/secure-access-manager/">Secure Access Manager</a> anchors a community of over 15,000 life sciences organizations (including 10 of the 20 largest global pharmaceutical companies), connecting 400,000 users to more than 70 applications used in the conduct of clinical trials.&nbsp; Health IT vendors serving 75,000 physicians and other healthcare providers now rely on Exostar’s <a href="https://www.exostar.com/product/providerpass/">ProviderPass</a> as part of the EPCS process for 2 million prescriptions per month and over 80 million prescriptions since the product’s inception.</p>
<p>“The Full Service Trust Mark of Approval from Kantara offers yet another independent validation of the quality, security, and compliance of our products and solutions.&nbsp; Our prospects and customers can connect their employees, partners, and applications to our communities with even greater confidence,” said <a href="https://www.exostar.com/company/executives/">Sudeep Dharan</a>, Exostar’s Chief Technology Officer.&nbsp; “As a result, we anticipate more rapid acceleration in the growth of our communities in the months ahead.”</p>

 An upcoming DigitalScot.live talk is&nbsp;<a href="https://summit.digitalscot.live/talks/radical-thinking-public-services/">Learning from Heart FM: How Radical Thinking can Preserve our Public Services</a>. 
<p>Mark Thompson is a Professor of Digital Economy in INDEX (Initiative for the Digital Economy) <a href="http://business-school.exeter.ac.uk/about/people/profile/index.php?web_id=Mark_Thompson">at the University of Exeter</a>.</p>
<p>He holds a BA in Human Sciences from University of Oxford, an MSc in Development Studies from SOAS, and a PhD in Information Systems from University of Cambridge.&nbsp; Mark’s research draws on practice-based theories to investigate the intersection between emerging digital business models, and organisational innovation and transformation.</p>
<p>He is acknowledged in the public domain as one of the architects of Digital service redesign within the UK public sector, and blends the roles of academic, practitioner, and policy commentator. He has chaired several of the large annual conferences on Digital in the UK public sector including the annual National Digital Conference, and contributes to&nbsp;Computer Weekly&nbsp;and a range of other practitioner publications.</p>
<p>Mark combines his University role with other roles as Board Member of TechUK, and Strategy Director for Methods, Methods Analytics, and Core Azure.&nbsp; He has held previous roles as Senior Lecturer in Information Systems at Cambridge Judge Business School, and Change Management Consultant at Accenture.</p>
 Government as a Platform 
<p>For a sense of his expertise on the topic, check out his wealth of <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Mark-Thompson">contributions to Computer Weekly</a>.</p>
<p>Mark is one of the world’s foremost experts on transforming the public sector through Internet-centric architecture that learns from the successes of the commercial sector, headlined under a theme of ‘Government as a Platform’.</p>
<p>In previous articles he asks ‘<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/What-is-government-as-a-platform-and-how-do-we-achieve-it">What is Government as a Platform and How Can We Achieve it</a>?’ where he examines the key principles and how they might be implemented. In another he explores the distinction with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Government-as-a-platform-or-a-platform-for-government-Which-are-we-getting">Platforms for Government</a>, one being still the traditional ‘cathedral’ mode of organizing government, versus the truly disruptive approach of ‘bazaar’ marketplaces.</p>
<p>Setting the scene for his upcoming talk his article <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Real-digital-modernisation-a-once-in-a-generation-opportunity-for-the-new-UK-government">Real Digital Modernization – A once-in-a-generation opportunity for the new UK government</a> explores how the public sector might emulate the approach of business leaders like Heart FM, transforming public sector services through a Cloud technology-enabled platform architecture, ultimately achieving a scenario where:</p>
<p>“Government benefits from <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/73864/1/Venters_Appraising%20the%20impact_2017.pdf">platform economics</a>. This includes huge economies of scale, crowdsourcing from an ecosystem of innovation/investment attracted by consolidated demand and data, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Getting-it-right-this-time-Why-the-strategy-is-not-about-delivery-for-NHSX">significant infrastructural benefits for UK economy</a>.”</p>

 Startups like Netflix, Uber and Airbnb ushered in a new era of digital businesses, ventures that scaled to massive levels of global customers and web site traffic. 
<p>Of course the Cloud has been the key to achieving this scale, and not just that, but also an entirely new enterprise software architecture to best exploit it: ‘Cloud Native’.</p>
<p>Pioneered by Netflix, this breaks up ‘monolith’ software designs into a network of small ‘microservice’ components, implemented across container technologies like Kubernetes and updated frequently through Continuous Delivery practices.</p>
 Skyscanner 
<p>An exemplar of this approach in Scotland is Skyscanner, a travel-booking service that sees 100 million unique users a month.</p>
<p>AWS offers <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/skyscanner-case-study/">this case study</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99nNHsbwBpg">this AWS tutorial video</a>, featuring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulgillespie/">Paul Gillespie</a> from Skyscanner, walks through their architecture.</p>
<p>This provides a short, detailed synopsis of the Cloud Native approach. The building block is Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>
<p>Paul walks through their implementation of Kubernetes on AWS, with a view to demonstrating how highly available systems are achieved, for very large-scale traffic web sites like Skyscanner.</p>
<p>What’s the secret to making this reliable at scale? Diversification—multiple Availability Zones, multiple Regions, multiple clusters, and multiple Amazon EC2 instance types.</p>
<p>He highlights that the busy regions of their infrastructure will reach&nbsp;between 60 to 70 thousand queries per second, and explains the architecture they have implemented to handle that level of traffic.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalscot.cloud"></a>From the <a href="https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/home-office-signs-120-million-deal-with-aws/">Home Office</a> to <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252493378/Thomson-Reuters-completes-large-scale-migration-of-mission-critical-workloads-to-the-AWS-cloud">Reuters</a> and the <a href="https://www.contino.io/case-studies/migrating-30-apps-in-50-days-at-national-australia-bank-contino-and-aws-professional-services">National Australia Bank</a>, enterprise organizations are now wholly embracing the Cloud and migrating their legacy IT estates. 
<p>The size of the deals, like £120m for the Home Office, demonstrate that the scale of the projects is a key part of the challenge. It’s not just about the specific Cloud migration skills but also managing this enterprise level of complexity.</p>
<p>Furthermore as the Home Office describes in <a href="https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/09/15/what-are-we-doing-in-devops-at-the-home-office/">their blog</a> it’s also not just an exercise in ‘lifting and shifting’ IT from in-house to hosted services, it’s also about transforming how organizations develop and deploy software.</p>
<p>Implementing DevOps for one team is a relatively straight forward exercise, but for enterprise organizations they face a much larger magnitude of complexity, as they typically have multiple teams, spanning multiple geographies and suppliers, with hundreds of developers all contributing to the same software development process.</p>
 Building a Cloud Centre of Excellence 
<p>As we describe in a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/building-a-cloud-coe/">previous blog</a> best practices like Scaled Agile (SAFe) offer a framework for addressing and managing this complexity, through establishing a Cloud Centre of Excellence. Our goal with the DigitalScot.cloud series of webinars is to create a set of resources for underpinning the development of a Scottish Cloud COE.</p>
<p>The first of these presentations is from Jon Gasparini – <a href="https://summit.digitalscot.live/talks/migrating-to-the-public-cloud-lessons-from-the-trenches/">Migrating to the Public Cloud – Lessons from the Trenches</a>.</p>
<p>From his experiences as CTO of Brightsolid as well as working with public and private sector organisations across the UK, Europe and North America, Jon Gasparini will share valuable insight into the key challenges and risks that most organisations will typically need to address to successfully adopt, and migrate existing services to, public cloud.</p>
<p>Migrating to public cloud is not just a technology transformation. As the first in an ongoing series, Jon will provide an overview of the wider organisational considerations and challenges that need to form a core part of any organisation’s cloud journey including target operating model, skills development and retention, security and compliance controls, and budget / cost management.</p>
<p>Brightsolid <a href="https://www.scotlandis.com/blog/brightsolid-launches-cloud-control-framework-to-build-cloud-confidence/">recently launched</a> a new cloud compliance framework to help businesses strengthen their data security measures as the growth of cloud and digital transformation continues to accelerate. The Cloud Control Framework, part of the company’s Professional Services division, is believed to be one of the first-to-market services in this area.</p>
<p>In subsequent follow-on talks Jon will drill down into the detail of each, providing business and technology executives with an ongoing series of Cloud adoption best practices that will prove invaluable in forming a Cloud strategy for your organisation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://digitalscot.net/scottish-cloud-coe/">Webinar Series: Building a Scottish Cloud Centre of Excellence</a> appeared first on <a href="https://digitalscot.net">Digital Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>The fourth review of this draft specification ends January 6th</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that STIX Version 2.1 Committee Specification Draft 05 from the OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC [1] is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence. STIX enables organizations and tools to share threat intelligence with one another in a way that improves many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.</p>



<p>STIX v2.1 adds new objects and concepts and incorporates improvements based on experience implementing Version 2.0. The objects and features added for inclusion represent an iterative approach to fulfilling basic consumer and producer requirements for CTI sharing. Objects and properties not included in this version of STIX, but deemed necessary by the community, will be included in future releases.</p>

<p>The invitation to comment on this specification ends January 27th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC are pleased to announce that Specification for JSON Abstract Data Notation Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for this specification.</p>



<p>JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is an information modeling language. It has several purposes including defining data structures, validating data instances, informing user interfaces working with structured data, and facilitating protocol internationalization. JADN specifications consist of two parts: abstract type definitions that are independent of data format, and serialization rules that define how to represent type instances using specific data formats. A JADN schema is itself a structured information object that can be serialized and transferred between applications, documented in multiple formats such as text-based interface definition languages, property tables or diagrams, and translated into concrete schemas used to validate specific data formats.</p>

 Social Movements &amp; the Limits of the&nbsp;Law <p>By <a href="https://www.zahrastardust.com/">Zahra Stardust</a>, <a href="https://www.rsatchel.com/about-roslyn">Roslyn M. Satchel</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/afsaneh-rigot">Afsaneh Rigot</a>, <a href="https://kendraalbert.com/">Kendra Albert</a> and <a href="https://www.geekylegal.com/">Micaela&nbsp;Mantegna</a></p>The Revolution card from <a href="https://www.croadcore.org/">Cristy C Road</a>’s <a href="https://croadcore.bigcartel.com/product/next-world-tarot-card-deck">Next World Tarot</a>&nbsp;deck.<p>Ten years ago, trans activist, writer and teacher<a href="http://www.deanspade.net/"> Dean Spade</a> published a piece <a href="https://legalleft.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/3.Spade_.final_.pdf">for those considering law</a>, setting out ‘what every activist should know before going to law&nbsp;school.’</p><p>In the article, Spade discusses the complicated relationship between law and social movements (including how law is used to maintain rather than undo systems) and asks what role can lawyers play in social movements, through demystifying the law to resist indoctrination and by linking legal service provision to transformative change strategies.</p><p>Inspired by this piece, 5 lawyers, ex-lawyers and legal practitioners from the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</a> speak about their vexed relationship to the law, tensions in their practice, their strategies and tactics, and the kinds of futures they are trying to&nbsp;build.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/roslyn-satchel">Roslyn M.&nbsp;Satchel</a> <p>Media, Law, Ethics, &amp; Social Movements</p><p>Principles of justice, equity, mutual aid, and self-determination animate my&nbsp;work.</p><p>Law is content for courses I teach, as well as organizing and policy advocacy I do in communities. I teach that the law can be helpful as both a guide for protecting the vulnerable and for challenging unethical practices/laws. Simultaneously, however, I often use history to reality-test slippery slope harms created by laws that are inconsistent, cause confusion or lack predictability — particularly in relation to race, gender, sexuality, ability, national origin, language, socio-economic status, or other caste&nbsp;markers.</p><p>The relationship between law and social justice movements is one of tension and boundary challenging. The law could be an instrument to help people live in security and dignity, but instead those in power use it to entrench and fortify their power via status quo. These competing interests require juxtaposition to avoid dominant group tyranny. Those pushed to the margins must exert pressure by all necessary means. For 20 years, I’ve pushed&nbsp;back.</p><blockquote>Sometimes law is not the answer; it’s the&nbsp;problem.</blockquote><p>Sometimes law is not the answer; it’s the problem. The difficulty I often see arises when law enables/permits money and power to corrupt movements. The non-profit industrial complex has a political economy that retains power with elite gatekeepers through funding grants. These foundations broker grants to address certain social problems but rarely change social conditions or the law. As a result, Non-Government Organisations/Community-Based Organisations compete for grants (scraps) — often abandoning the mission or programming for the preferences of grantors — in order to make payroll or provide healthcare benefits for staff. Meanwhile, the government either fails to act or enacts laws that tie activists’ hands (e.g., U.S. Patriot Act). Currently, this divisive dynamic is at work in popular social movements, and we must question whether splintering is the purpose; and if so, who benefits?</p><p>Having experienced these problems professionally as a non-profit executive (as well as hating disempowering adversarial courtroom practices), I opt for alternative uses of my legal skills that shift power by prioritizing research and interventions with practical benefits to marginalized communities. I am trying to build a future where children of the African diaspora have futures as bright as (or even brighter than) they did before colonization and enslavement.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/afsaneh-rigot">Afsaneh Rigot</a> <p>Resistance and the Power of the&nbsp;People</p><p>I never wanted to study law. It wasn’t for us. Coming from Iran, moving to the UK as a refugee and living in the UK in a struggling working-class family (in a predominately immigrant BIPOC town) l quickly realised, the law was not for us. The law was about us. It was for us to bypass and navigate and not fall into the traps&nbsp;of.</p><p>In Iran the law served as a tool for a theocratic dictatorship that surveilled, imprisoned, tortured and exiled its residents, our friends, my family. In the UK it was the structures that worked to keep people like us out — on the outskirts of borders or in the margins of&nbsp;society.</p><p>The law meant barriers to jobs, financial support and opportunities to exist. It meant the police, immigration control, access issues. The law meant: you’re not safe; this isn’t for&nbsp;you.</p><p>That changed as I grew. I didn’t know about Movement Lawyering per se — but came to admire those who I now know employed it: legal aid lawyers that helped us get status when all other hope was lost; the fearless lawyers in Iran who used their in-depth knowledge against the legal system itself; those I’d read about in books who used the law as a tool to contain its own power, to cripple the structures confining groups most oppressed, marginalised and targeted. Then I was intrigued. I wanted to learn how to wield the same tool for our communities.</p><p>My favourite movement lawyering quote is from <a href="http://www.law4blacklives.org/respond">Law for Black Lives</a>: “It means building the power of the people, not the power of the&nbsp;law.”</p><p>I didn’t continue with traditional legal practice (I was working towards becoming an immigration and human rights barrister). These days, I use my access and knowledge to support communities in my region. I follow their leadership on how to build strategic movements and support their safety. I use the language of law to leverage power and hold companies accountable for harm. Most of the time the law itself isn’t useful, but my knowledge of how to navigate it&nbsp;is.</p><p>The law might not be for us, but we can do our best to stop it from being used against&nbsp;us.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Kendra Albert</a> <p>The Limits of&nbsp;Law</p><p>I’ve always had a weird relationship to my role as a lawyer. I didn’t go to law school because I believed in the majesty or dignity of the law, but because I wanted software engineers to listen to me. Law felt like a way to accomplish that. And somehow, at the end of law school, people expected me to be a lawyer. Turns out a law degree isn’t just humanities finishing school, it’s a professional degree. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p><p>Fortunately, while I was in law school, my peers radicalized me. Specifically, Derecka Purnell, Kidist Keaton, and the other Black women who led the student protest movement at Harvard Law School called <a href="https://reclaimharvardlaw.wordpress.com/">#Reclaim</a>, radicalized me. I saw how lackluster the institutional response to racism was. I also saw how easy it was for White folks who the institution worked for (even self-professed liberal ones) to underestimate their own power to make change. At the same time, I was processing my own identity as a transgender person who wasn’t out (or even totally sure of their gender), and I could see all the ways in which law failed trans&nbsp;folks.</p><p>As I’ve gotten further into my legal career, I am more and more aware of the limits of law. As an attorney, I’ve embraced my role as a demystifer of legal systems (to use Dean Spade’s words). I’ve also been taught by friends and comrades, like Danielle Blunt of <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/">Hacking // Hustling</a>, how to use the power that comes with institutional affiliations for rebellion.</p><p>As a teacher, I hope to help my students understand the limits of law as a tool. I support my students by building spaces for them in hierarchical institutions with unwritten rules, while challenging them via the material I teach to think bigger about systemic oppression, violence, and our duty as people to make change. Through my teaching, I aim to pass along, at least in part, the gift I was given by #Reclaim.</p><p>Ultimately, my legal work pales in comparison to the hard work of building movements and supporting communities. So now I play a small part in making the law less of a barrier to those who are making what John Lewis called “good trouble”, and I hope to train the next generation to push further and imagine&nbsp;more.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/micaela-mantegna">Micaela Mantegna</a> <p>Law in 8-bits: Finding Joy and Creativity in the Legal Profession</p><p>My relationship with the law is ambivalent to say the least: I went to law school because I wanted to make a positive impact in the world, and becoming a judge seemed the proper way to do so. Spoiler alert! It was&nbsp;not.</p><p>Years as a Court clerk taught me a fair bit about how bureaucracy shapes organizations, preventing them from effective action and meaningful change. I come to the unsettling place of a non-conforming legal practitioner buried in one of the most archaic, formal and change-averse institutions: the judiciary. If you don’t fit, you must not acquit, but make&nbsp;room.</p><p>Law is a loose corpora of building blocks that interact to create solutions, a duality of limits and spaces for freedom. In that sense law is as much a tool as is code, and both could be equally inaccessible and esoteric for the uninitiated. Wide and open knowledge is crucial as a catalyst for change, that can be achieved by involving the communities affected by law’s frameworks before they are set in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Being lectures, podcasts or streamings, in divulgation and advocacy I found my call. And through pop culture and video games, the language to translate law and policy into something relatable and&nbsp;fun.</p><p>When presenting myself, I used to be in a “too many hats” conundrum: Should I speak as a policy researcher or from my place as a diversity activist through <a href="http://www.womeningamesar.com/">Women in Games Argentina</a>? Videogames or artificial intelligence? Media or attorney?</p><p>Before, all these facets seemed antagonistic to being a legal professional. Now I settle on defining myself as the mind of a scholar, the heart of an activist and the skillset of a lawyer, trying to use all of them for&nbsp;good.</p><p>Through an unconventional journey I came to peace of mind with my purpose: trying to inspire the rogues and the misfits to embrace the whimsical weirdness of being different and to find our place in Law and its intersections: you are welcomed and you are needed&nbsp;here.</p> <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/zahra-stardust">Zahra Stardust</a> <p>Sex, Law &amp;&nbsp;Protest</p><p>When I was admitted to practice, I was advised by colleagues to disclose my sex work experience so the Legal Profession Admission Board could consider whether I was a ‘fit and proper person’ of ‘good fame and character’. Sex work is often seen as some kind of reputational risk. But in my view, sex work is a more dignified profession than law. And sex workers have plenty to offer in legal analysis, including robust critiques of criminalisation, licensing, border patrol, policing practices and the carceral&nbsp;state.</p><p>Law makes us preoccupied with incremental change and symbolic victories. My auto-ethnographic research on pornography taught me about the perils of reformism and my background as a policy advisor taught me that an ‘evidence-base’ will only get you so far before it is trumped by political expediency and self-interest.</p><p>In law reform, wins for some mean losses for others. And it is consistently the most marginalised who are left off the agenda with the promise that legislators will return for them ‘later’, a date that never&nbsp;arrives.</p><p>Where I live, on the unceded Gadigal land of the Eora Nation, our government refuses to enter into a treaty with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait people, anti-protest legislation is on the rise and there is political backlash against trans youth. Yet the law maintains a delusion of progress.</p><p>My work has involved various strategies and interventions, from demystifying the law to legal accountability to strategic litigation. I’ve been a Legal Observer during protests for Black Lives Matter and Mardi Gras to document and record police brutality. I began the <a href="https://www.zahrastardust.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quick-Guide-to-Strip-Searches-171220.pdf">Illustrated Law Project</a>, collaborating with tattoo artists to create accessible guides to police powers, protests and strip searching. I am working with <a href="https://www.scarletalliance.org.au/">Scarlet Alliance</a>, Australian Sex Workers Association and the <a href="https://www.iclc.org.au/our-services/sex-worker-legal-service/">Inner City Legal Centre</a>, to prepare a class action of sex workers against payment processors for financial discrimination.</p><p>As lawyers, we should be thinking about how we can use our skills to further social movements. Law speaks to itself in inaccessible jargon and maintains a profoundly unjust system of race, class, gender, sexuality and ability. The real legal experts are not lawyers or academics, but the communities who witness the brunt of its operation. I want to help build a future where marginalised communities drive social, cultural and economic change and eventually dismantle institutions of law as we know&nbsp;them.</p><p>For more on movement lawyering, see <a href="https://www.law4blacklives.org/">Law for Black Lives</a>, the <a href="https://movementlawlab.org/mission">Movement Law Lab</a>, the <a href="https://advancementproject.org/movementlawyercon/">Movement Lawyering Conference</a>, or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOxihoQVfUg&amp;feature=youtu.be">Spotlight on LGBTQ Advocacy in Lebanon</a> as part of a series on Movement Lawyering and Social&nbsp;Change.</p>The Seven of Wands from <a href="https://www.croadcore.org/">Cristy C Road</a>’s <a href="https://croadcore.bigcartel.com/product/next-world-tarot-card-deck">Next World Tarot</a>&nbsp;deck. <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/movement-lawyering-for-alternative-futures-404ba2010bf2">Movement Lawyering for Alternative Futures</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Fatema Pirone, Senior Director, Enterprise Innovation for CIBC
<p>I have the privilege of leading the Enterprise Innovation team at CIBC, shaping and transforming our bank’s stance on how we approach emerging trends and technologies. Our team is built of data scientists, designers, UX researchers, strategists and collectively we have created comprehensive projects, frameworks and a culture of innovation across our lines of business at CIBC. My role is to ensure we do not overinvest or underinvest in emerging technology and have built our innovation frameworks to tackle the banks most compelling opportunities and problems. I also have the privilege to elevate the people on my team to recognize their strong skills, provide opportunities for them to continue to grow and develop those skills, all while being able to set the vision and develop strong partnerships and sponsors from leaders in our organization.</p>
<p>I am constantly motivated by the various mindsets of the people around me, the depth of experience that everyone is able to bring to the table, and the great work that is the outcome of all of that combined! What gets me out of bed every morning is a strong cup of coffee, but also the curiosity of seeing what that day brings. The only standard on this team is that you can guarantee no two days will be the same. And that is what I love most about it.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I follow a couple of key principles:</p>
 
 Be open to new experiences. This career path was never in my plans but I happened upon it and took various roles and training to figure out what I was passionate about and where I wanted to apply myself. 
 Align yourself with great people, leaders that are willing to share their experiences and give you advice, and colleagues and employees you will take along on the journey. 
 Lastly, never turn away from a complex project – I have grown the most doing the work others found unattractive. There are always lessons to learn which I embrace. I think this is at least part of the reason why I received WXN Canada’s Top 100 Most Powerful Women’s award this year. 
 
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>It’s got to be the value and importance of advocating for yourself. I’ve been fortunate to have leaders who have supported and mentored me as I have developed throughout my own career, and I think that because of this I have seen the outcomes that are possible when you trust yourself. It can be easy to get caught up in imposter syndrome, but if I have learned anything, it is that if you can learn to believe that you have earned where you are today, that will transpire into better tangible outcomes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important lesson I have learnt is the value and importance of advocating for yourself.</p></blockquote>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>Digital Identity is the single most important emerging tech that will allow us to provide end to end digital servicing for our clients in the most secure and transparent (to the client) way. We need to start ensuring we embed Digital ID into every flow where client’s data is moving – internally or externally. We need to stop creating siloed solutions and rather take an holistic approach. We need to continue to make the client the center of our solutions and services.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity matters to me because it is the only way we create a future that is unique, that is better for all and is simply not like our history. Diversity is truly representations of all, that includes ethnicity, sexual orientations, belief systems, experience, skills, education and so on. When you have representation of all with a diverse group of people, the best outcomes are possible ~ that is where the magic lies.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
“From the Ashes” by Jesse Thistle
<p>I am an avid reader so its really hard to just recommend one – so I’ll go with one recently read called “From the Ashes”&nbsp; a memoir by Jesse Thistle. I think this book is a heart wrenching memoir and testament to inter-generational trauma that Indigenous people of Canada have experienced and are still battling. It is not the duty of the marginalized to drive the change that our society needs, rather the job of the privileged. So it is all of our duty to gain better understanding of what has happened, what the different experiences of the Indigenous communities and people are and advocate to do better. This book is a good start.</p>
 
 
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“There is no need to grow up so fast!” I jumped in the deep-end of adulthood really quickly, I was working full-time by the time I was 17 and got married when I was 19.&nbsp; Although I do not regret any decision I made,&nbsp; I would tell my younger self to be kinder to myself and enjoy that short time one has a teenager.</p>

<p></p>
 The <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/what-is-digital-transformation">Enterprisers describe</a> Digital Transformation as: 
 “the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how you operate and deliver value to customers.” 
<p>This is a goal that is simple in principle but difficult in implementation. Larger enterprises especially face many challenges including the complexity of their existing IT estate, and many organizations both large and small wrestle with the primary issue of successfully linking their IT investments to their business strategy.</p>
<p>Simply redefining that challenge under a new heading of Digital Transformation won’t address this underlying problem. Organizations need a structured, repeatable process for doing so, and the imperative for Digital Transformation can act as the catalyst to establish such a structure.</p>
 Mapping Business Strategy to Technology 
<p>The Digital Transformation People describe the <a href="https://www.thedigitaltransformationpeople.com/channels/the-case-for-digital-transformation/digital-transformation-pyramid-business-driven-approach-corporate-initiatives/">Digital Transformation Pyramid</a>, a visual way to define the structures for connecting top level business model strategy through corporate change management and ultimately technology implementation, to understand what key corporate patterns may be weak or missing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s often the case that organizations are overly focused on level three ‘Enabling Technologies’, wholly associating Digital Transformation with one or more particular technologies, such as <a title="<h3 class=&quot;wpg-tooltip-title&quot;><span class=&quot;wpg-tooltip-term-title&quot;>RPA</span></h3><div class=&quot;wpg-tooltip-content&quot;>Robotic process automation&nbsp;(or RPA) is a form of&nbsp;business process automation&nbsp;technology based on metaphorical&nbsp;software&nbsp;robots (bots) or&nbsp;artificial intelligence (AI) workers. In traditional&nbsp;workflow&nbsp;automation&nbsp;tools, a&nbsp;software developer&nbsp;produces a list of actions to automate a task and interface to the back-end system using internal&nbsp;application programming interfaces&nbsp;(APIs) or dedicated&nbsp;scripting language. In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's&nbsp;graphical user interface&nbsp;(GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.<p class=&quot;wpg-read-more&quot;><a href=&quot;https://digitalscot.net/glossary/rpa/&quot;>Read More</a><p></div>" href="https://digitalscot.net/glossary/rpa/">RPA</a>, Chatbots or CRM.</p>
<p>These are of course the methods of implementation but without factoring in the whole pyramid and establishing affecting relationships between them, there is nothing to guide them towards specified business outcomes, and without that, they can easily become an expensive exercise that achieves very little benefit for the organization.</p>
 Enterprise Architecture 
<p>Credit Suisse offers a presentation that explains a detailed approach for establishing these relationships, and through their own case study explains how they are applied.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?basig/2016-03-06">Design Reviews Using the Business Capability Model</a>&nbsp;is an OMG presentation, given by Siddesh Mahadik, VP IT Strategy and Business Architecture division at Credit Suisse, which details their ‘eBCM’, a blueprint of enterprise architecture activities that plan and manage strategic technology implementations.</p>
<p>Slide 7 describes the headline message, the linking role Business Architecture plays in connecting Business Strategy to IT implementation, in a referenceable, measurable form.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note the two-way direction of the information flow – This means it works as a ‘closed loop’ feedback mechanism, an ongoing review process cascades the goals of Strategy down through the Business and then the IT design, and it ripples back up in the form of project plans and investment requirements.</p>
<p>The remainder of the presentation then provides a detailed walk through of how this expands out across their enterprise architecture designs and activities, how they manage this cycle of work.</p>
 Digital Transformation Roadmaps 
<p>Overall Credit Suisse documents a set of blueprints and an activities model for how to define and implement Digital Transformation Roadmaps, made up of the following main streams:</p>
  Business Architecture – Slide 9 lays out how they utilize Business Architecture, in particular it is tailored to their requirements through their ‘eBCM‘ model. Slide 11 shows the reporting teams and process. 
 A Feature Flow of Requirements – Slide 14 describes the core design process, a process of ‘front to back’ overlaying of the Logical model across the Physical one.&nbsp;Slide 13 shows how this produces a Features List, for example T1 – A Trade Store Abstraction Layer. 
 A Decision Tree – Slide 15 explains how they walk through a decision tree review of applications. Slide 16 is the list of criteria they apply, and Slide 20 shows how they escalate the feedback from these to the relevant application owners. 
 Custom Tooling – Slide 21 shows how they set up a governance portal, with help guides and implementation blueprints, including their Business Architecture Blueprints, like the central BCM – Business Capability Model. 
 Communications – Slide 22 follows on from this to show how this powered successful, and accurate, reporting of how adoption of program changes were being understood and actioned. 
 Timescales Roadmap – Slide 23 demonstrates how they map and manage all of these activities through a timeline planning roadmap.

			<p>The technological changes affecting the academic science community are happening at a rapid pace, causing the roles of advanced cyberinfrastructure and big data to evolve on a global scale. As the Senior Director of Advanced CyberInfrastructure, Office of the Vice President for Information Technology, and Senior Research Scholar, Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>, Dr. Jack Brassil is witnessing this extraordinary shift in scientific research. “The cyberinfrastructure and collaboration that researchers need to conduct their work is an important driver of this change. The role of commercial cloud technologies is growing. Work that is conducted at a relatively modest scale in laboratories or in campus research facilities is shifting to include larger collaborations between many universities with increased reliance on shared infrastructure and access to massive datasets.” The transition from an older model of scientific research to a new model is occurring across the academic community, including Princeton, with many opportunities arising to leverage the Cloud to advance innovation and discovery.</p>
<p>Expanding the Reach of IT</p>
<p>Princeton is home to world-class facilities that are available to researchers across many departments and disciplines. Throughout his career, Brassil has worked at many top-notch institutions and says his role at Princeton is both an honor and a privilege. “Princeton has a commitment to excellence and advancing teaching and research. My position is unique to this institution in that the role bridges both Advanced CyberInfrastructure and the Department of Computer Science. I’m able to expand the reach of the IT organization deeper into the departments and elevate the boundaries of the service that is normally provided. Through this hybrid role, I’m embedded within various departments as they explore new programs, research infrastructures, and instruments.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brassil says closing the gap between an IT organization and academic units is vitally important to an institution. His dual-role at Princeton allows him to see university operations from both vantage points and helps him gain a better understanding of university-wide thinking, including how that aligns with the institution’s goals and objectives. Brassil spent 25 years in industrial research, primarily working with universities and start-ups, and came to Princeton three years ago from the National Science Foundation (NSF).“This experience was instrumental in preparing me for the kind of innovative work I’m doing at Princeton,” shares Brassil. “I was able to learn more about the overall national and international research enterprise and the inner workings, including policy development and fundraising associated with science research. This experience gave me a greater understanding of not just a single university, but the vast differences between universities. Now at Princeton, I’m helping the University meet the growing needs for complicated infrastructure and instruments that academics are increasingly calling for to complete their research.”</p>

		 
	 
   
			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	  
		 
			 
				
	 
		 
			  “My hat is off to Dr. Forough Ghahramani for having the vision and insight to bring together people from different institutions to lead collaborations between universities and the State. Edge taking a leadership role is terrific, council members will help inform each other of what’s going on at the different institutions in New Jersey. By doing so, we’ll gain a collective understanding of group economic development and important technologies and how we can help support each other in our teaching and research missions — driving success for all.”

			<p>The Future of Cloud Technology</p>
<p>With extensive knowledge of cloud technology and the future of cloud-based research facilities, Brassil was approached by NSF to conduct a workshop at Princeton. The NSF-1934704, Workshop on Next Generation Cloud Research Infrastructure, brought together members of the academic community and industry from around the country to investigate the future of cloud computing research infrastructure. Academic members of the workshop use clouds to conduct their research, publish papers, and study datasets. The group also included service providers and cloud platform developers.</p>
<p>“Cloud research platforms have multiple uses, but the underlying intent is to allow researchers to think about how we build clouds and guide the development of future commercial clouds,” explains Brassil. “Existing commercial clouds, like Microsoft® Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS), are designed to provide services to enterprises who want to expand their offsite computing needs. They do a great job at this, but they are not perfect vehicles for academic research. Institutions need sandboxes to determine what future commercial cloud technology should look like and try to pinpoint the specific services that are required of an academic cloud.”</p>
<p>An additional project Brassil is involved in is NSF-1923692, CloudJoin: Migrating CISE Computing Research Infrastructure to the Cloud, which investigates the integration of novel architectures into campus research computing and commercial cloud platforms. Like the workshop, this project focuses on how to build cloud computing infrastructure that is tailored to academic scientific research. “Academic research institutions host a central IT research computing organization to provide researchers with the campus tools, storage, and computing requirements they need to do their job,” says Brassil. “Those services struggle to meet&nbsp; the demands of today, especially with the need for massive computing jobs and datasets.”</p>
<p>“Academics are at a place of transition,” Brassil continues, “Moving from using extensive, local equipment on campus to shared instruments, shared computing, and commercial cloud resources.” CloudJoin is exploring hybrid clouds, which integrates on campus computing resources with commercial cloud resources. “A hybrid model provides researchers with the comfort of working with familiar, local tools, combined with the scale, reach, and collaboration opportunities of a commercial cloud.”</p>
<p>Supporting Education and Innovation</p>
<p>Princeton, in conjunction with Edge and Rutgers University, created New Jersey’s first Internet2 GigaPOP access point earlier this year. Internet2 is the nation’s premier backbone for conducting research that supports education and innovation. The Internet2 GigaPOP is the first in-state connection to the national and global research infrastructure. “Edge created a community that facilitated collaboration and helped New Jersey create a top-tier statewide network,” shares Brassil. “GigaPOP is a tremendous opportunity to consolidate resources in the state, which in the long run, will lead to better economic development and help facilitate more collaboration between universities and community colleges and the State.”</p>
<p>With the creation of this access point, Princeton, a long-time Edge member, is now connected to an advanced technology community. “This opportunity ties back to Princeton’s desire to be fully connected and engaged in local communities,” says Brassil. “As seen in other regional networks in the country, I think the potential impact on both workforce and economic development is fantastic and will help further drive innovation and discovery. This collaborative environment also creates a center of knowledge for institutions to call upon for support as they develop new cyberinfrastructure.”</p>
<p>Princeton, Rutgers, and Edge are also key participants in a NSF-funded network research infrastructure called FABRIC. The four-year project is intended to support exploratory research in computer networking, distributed computing systems, and next-generation applications. FABRIC involves network elements that are equipped with large amounts of compute and storage that are interconnected by high speed, dedicated optical links.

<p>EdgeDiscovery Advisory Council</p>
<p>Edge is dedicated to forging pathways for innovation and engagement among researchers and other stakeholders in the scientific discovery domain. Through EdgeDiscovery, members can pursue their research goals by accessing the advanced computing, support, training, and community engagement they need for success. The EdgeDiscovery Advisory Council was created to bring together fellow forward-thinkers and visionaries and provide a forum for supportive and informative collaboration. “Edge taking a leadership role is terrific. My hat is off to Dr. Forough Ghahramani for having the vision and insight to bring together people from different institutions to lead collaborations between universities and the State,” says Brassil. “Council members will help inform each other of what’s going on at the different institutions in New Jersey. By doing so, we’ll gain a collective understanding of group economic development and important technologies and how we can help support each other in our teaching and research missions — driving success for all.”</p>

				 <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>We all agree 2020 is not a year we’ll regret. Still, we shall all remember it!</p>
<p>This pandemic has been devastating for individuals, families, health professionals,&nbsp;cities, countries, the world at large. Still, we found the way to adapt our lives through&nbsp;technology and data, while keeping human relations alive, sometimes reinforcing&nbsp;them. It led to imaginative solutions and technical leaps in many areas. It enabled&nbsp;an unprecedented mobilization on a global basis which delivers as we speak<br>efficient vaccines in a record time. This pandemic has silver linings!</p>
<p>Let’s push it further and make 2021 the year fair, human-centred and&nbsp;trusted data becomes a reality and the norm.</p>
<p><br>Happy Holiday Season and together we shall build the best in the New Year in&nbsp;Europe and beyond!</p>

			<p>Graduating with an Engineering degree from New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in 2004, Christian Hartman’s plan was to dive into the world of project creation and design. While immensely enjoying the collaboration with peers and working with his fellow engineers, the self-described extrovert began to find less enjoyment with the laboratory work, testing, and diagnostics associated with some of his earlier roles. Conversely, he found quite a bit of joy in presenting and face-to-face human interaction. “I found I’d rather be the person giving the presentation and sharing the design concepts to our clients,” Hartman says. Fortunately, following a few of his internships, Hartman found opportunities to combine his technical and interpersonal skills with several companies in the private sector. He enjoyed building up franchises and teaching the businesses about technology. “My positions were all about working with people and showing the teams how technology could change and improve their businesses,” he adds.</p>
<p>These experiences brought forth connections at <a href="http://www.allianceforaction.com/">New Jersey Alliance for Action</a> (Alliance for Action). Hartman began conversing with one of Alliance for Action’s officers, who shared the organization’s mission to transform New Jersey’s infrastructure. “Alliance for Action’s positive impact on the state and its residents interested me immediately. Their mission fit in with what I wanted to do and how I wanted to move my career forward. I felt like I would be able to give back because I love this state,” he shares. Hartman began working at Alliance for Action in 2014, initially as the Assistant Vice President. In 2018, he was named Vice President and was placed on the Executive Team.</p>
<p>Hartman’s technical expertise and ability to connect with Alliance for Action’s clients was also one of the reasons for his recent invitation onto <a href="https://njedge.net/board-of-trustees/">Edge’s Board of Trustees</a>. “When Edge asked me to be a part of their Board, the invitation was an honor and seemed like a natural fit,” he said. “Our organizations often work together with research and development and many Edge members are also members of the Alliance.”</p>
<p>Providing Leadership Through Advocacy and Education</p>
<p>As Vice President, Hartman oversees several key strategic areas at Alliance for Action, devoting significant time to the areas of advocacy, education, infrastructure, capital construction, economic development, and working to unite three industries: business, government, and labor. “We bring together the big three—entities that may not traditionally see eye to eye,” he explains. “Our job is to carve out the projects and the initiatives that we believe are important economic drivers for those three sectors.” While working diligently to align the big three, Hartman also aims to grow Alliance for Action’s membership and develop fresh networking opportunities for current members. “All of our members, whether they are from business, government, or labor, are constantly seeking to expand their respective networks, so part of my job is to connect members to individuals who could potentially become a new contact which, in turn, enables both parties to grow both their bases.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>With many important strategic tasks on his plate, Hartman also finds time to be the resident technical geek on staff, guiding Alliance for Action into the 21st Century through digital and virtual interactions, communications, and interactive conferences. “We have to change the way we communicate whether the mechanism is through social media, more traditional online interactions, or via digital communication,” he explains. “I don’t think the technology evolution will ever truly end, but fortunately, I relish the concept of constant innovation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The New Jersey Connection That Works”</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, Alliance for Action’s overall mission has been to improve New Jersey’s economy through the promotion of capital construction and infrastructure investments, calling themselves “The New Jersey Connection That Works.” With thousands of New Jersey’s top corporate, labor, professional, academic, and governmental representatives as members of the non-partisan organization, the group has been an important advocate regarding the completion of countless initiatives and projects within the state. While not always visible to the general populous, Alliance for Action plays a vital role in bettering the state’s communities, including spearheading the creation of a better transportation infrastructure, the development of 5G, all the way down to making sure there is sand on the beaches and clean drinking water flowing through the pipes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hartman says their goal is to identify areas of need in New Jersey and then direct resources to devise a solution. “No one thinks about when the light switch is flipped on or the heat is turned on in the winter, people simply expect both utilities to work seamlessly. Families aren’t necessarily concerned about where their energy is coming from; they just want their family to be safe and comfortable,” Hartman says. “Our job is to make sure everything is working behind the scenes, so the lights can come on, there is clean drinking water, working utilities, and functional transportation.”</p>

			<p>5G Becoming a Game Changer</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the term 5G has become better known and the possibilities the technology provides have become known game changers. Alliance for Action has partnered with Edge’s network to strengthen the state’s infrastructure and provide instantaneous access. Hartman believes Edge’s connections to research institutions, healthcare organizations, higher education, and non-profits, as well as their broadband backbone, provide untapped potential for 5G in New Jersey.</p>
<p>With COVID-19 accelerating trends like remote learning, research collaboration online, and working from home, many member institutions are reaching out to Edge and Alliance for Action for connection, so these necessities can be sustained and improved. “I believe our members will learn how to leverage Edge as a resource as time moves on, because they’re learning how important things like broadband and connectivity are in the real world right now, especially because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Hartman explains. “You either are going to have to change or you are going to be left behind.”</p>
<p>Continued Partnership with Edge</p>
<p>Since youth, Hartman has been a communicator and enjoys the times he can interact with like-minded individuals. He especially appreciates Edge events and his ability to network and grow in technological education. “At the several Edge events I attended, the material was focused on cybersecurity, which is something I believe, especially in the construction industry, we need to start looking at more,” he says. This sector has incorporated wireless tools, CAD programs, and the ability to create blueprints and schematics in real time at the job sites. If these components aren’t protected, hacking can occur, and material lost.</p>
<p>Hartman also appreciates the ability to network at Edge events, which is something he immensely enjoys and is a necessity in his position at Alliance for Action. “There is enjoyment in meeting new people, because you never know when the next person could open the door for you or open your eyes to something you didn’t know about before – basically opening up a whole world for you,” he adds. Most importantly, Hartman said the value of making new connections with a diverse group of people can have enormous impact in the future. He then takes these networking opportunities and connects his members to resources. “If by going to these different events and meeting all these different people, I can break down those walls, or I can learn something about a new connection and I can help one of my members, all I’m doing is making the network that much stronger and that much better,” Hartman shares. “These connections not only help me, but will also help my members and Edge’s members. They’re getting a new contact, my member is getting a new contact, and hopefully the two of them are learning something new. Then they can move forward, and their businesses can grow from there.”</p>
<p>The connections Hartman has developed was another reason for his invitation onto Edge’s Board of Trustees. With his role at Alliance for Action, he can become a collaborative resource for both parties and increase the overall value proposition of the two organizations. As part of the Edge Board, two of the areas he will be focusing on include connectivity and security. “Protection must be provided against ransomware and viruses, and hackers have increased their efforts across the board.” Many towns, smaller institutions, and municipalities find themselves ill-prepared against the onslaught. Hartman finds comfort in the fact the Edge network provides another level of protection and additional resources to aid these groups. “I think Edge has some very interesting solutions when it comes to cybersecurity, especially the new <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgesecure/cybersecurity-health-check-program/">EdgeSecure Cybersecurity Health Check</a> program,” he says.</p>
<p>Full Circle Assistance</p>
<p>Almost twenty years ago, Hartman was a student at NJIT and now he serves as a peer to the institution, which is also a valued, connected member of both Alliance for Action and Edge. He feels the preparation and real-world experience NJIT provided has played an enormous role in his own life. “I don’t know if there are many schools out there that prepares their students for the real world as well as NJIT, especially as an upperclassman and no longer just looking at the books, but you’re working in a lab and collaborating with others,” he shares. “Their ability to prepare students to transition to the workforce is unparalleled.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hartman says the transition from student to peer is strange in some ways, explaining. “When you’re a student, you look up to these folks, especially those in the administration. In my mind, they represented the true embodiment of innovation and the creation of new methods to conduct business using the latest technology,” he added. “It’s a strange thought to put yourself as a peer to Dr. Henderson or Dr. Rose—people I always looked up to. However, I finally understand the challenges these administrators face on a day-to-day basis, and I understand how groups like Alliance for Action and Edge can help their members navigate the world as universities adapt to changing students’ needs, wants, and desires—what they need in order to adapt and to survive.”</p>
<p>Now, Hartman has a seat at all these tables, using the leadership and interpersonal skills he began crafting in classrooms at University Heights, Newark, NJ. In many ways, he has come full circle, using his gifts to help members of both Alliance for Action and Edge to become game changers in the world.</p>

<p>Yuriy Ackermann, Certification Technical Manager, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>With the advancement and modifications to specifications and program requirements, certification processes and policies will need to be modified from time-to-time. With the recent changes and publication of the FIDO Authenticator Certification program as they relate to V1.4 of the Security Requirements, and the current FIDO Registry of Values specification, we are recommending currently certified servers make necessary changes.</p>



<p>It is strongly recommended that you update your FIDO2 and UAF servers in order to correctly process current and future metadata statements based on the latest updates to the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/common-specs/fido-registry-v2.1-ps-20191217.html">FIDO Registry of Predefined Values</a>.</p>



<p>The spec changes are as follows:</p>



  All previous USER_VERIFY methods have been post-fixed with _INTERNAL to identify them explicitly as INTERNAL user verification methods&nbsp;  Example: USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE → USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE_INTERNAL.<br>    New USER_VERIFY methods have been added: USER_VERIFY_PASSCODE_EXTERNAL (0x00000800) and USER_VERIFY_PATTERN_EXTERNAL (0x00001000)<br>  RS1 or ALG_SIGN_RSASSA_PKCSV15_SHA1_RAW (0x0010) IANA ALG_KEY_COSE “alg” identifier has been changed to -65535  



<p>Servers should make the following updates to support these changes:</p>



  FIDO2 servers: Update pubKeyCredParams to contain -65535 alg<br>  FIDO2 and UAF servers: Change old user verification methods values to the new post-fixed values. Example: USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE → USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE_INTERNAL<br>  FIDO2 and UAF servers: Run the conformance tools to verify support for these changes  



<p>The latest FIDO Registry of Predefined Values is now available in <a href="https://github.com/fido-alliance/conformance-test-tools-resources/blob/master/snippets/registry.js">JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>IT departments are asked to balance the demands of keeping the lights on, security and risk mitigation, and innovating for the future, all while working within shrinking budgets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An effective cloud strategy can meet all of these challenges while providing enhanced capabilities to enable business continuity and improve IT performance. In this session, you’ll learn how you can leverage existing investment and expertise in virtualization to accelerate a transition to the cloud, build a cloud-based business continuity plan, and generate positive ROI in the process.</p>



<p>This session will feature the team at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), who will share their journey to the cloud. TCNJ is leveraging VMware Cloud (VMC) on AWS to modernize their disaster recovery and business continuity approach. You’ll learn how TCNJ:</p>



  Identified the need to modernize their disaster recovery/business continuity approach  Leveraged VMC on AWS to make use of existing VMware investment  Retired an on-site backup datacenter, which they anticipate will save over $200k per year in operating expenses in addition to alleviating the need for future hardware refreshes

 Introduction <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a protocol for building applications with user-centric, interoperable data. In <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity/">a previous post</a>, we described what IDX is and the benefits of building applications in this way. This tutorial will walk through the creation of a simple note-taking web app using decentralized technologies for authentication and data storage, allowing users to have complete ownership over their contents.</p><p>In this tutorial, we will use the following technologies:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">React</a>: a popular framework for building web applications  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">IDX</a>: a JavaScript/TypeScript framework for user-centric data management  <a href="https://www.ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a>: a decentralized network for storing mutable, verifiable documents  <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">DIDs</a>: a W3C standard for decentralized identifiers  The finished product ✨ Environment setup <p>To get started using IDX, we'll first need to install the IDX CLI using <code>npm</code>. You'll also need to have <code>node</code> installed.</p> <code>npm install -g @ceramicstudio/idx-cli</code>  Project setup  Initial dependencies <p>We'll use Create React App with the TypeScript template to setup our project:</p> <code>npx create-react-app idx-demo-app --template typescript --use-npm
</code> <p>Then we'll add the first dependencies:</p> <code>cd idx-demo-app
npm install @ceramicnetwork/cli @ceramicnetwork/http-client @ceramicstudio/idx-tools key-did-provider-ed25519 uint8arrays</code> <p>Let's also edit the <code>package.json</code> file to add the following <code>scripts</code>:</p> <code>"bootstrap": "node ./bootstrap.js",
"ceramic": "ceramic daemon",</code> <p>Finally, as the <code>uint8arrays</code> package does not provide TypeScript definitions, let's add them to the <code>src/react-app-env.d.ts</code> file:</p> <code>/// &lt;reference types="react-scripts" /&gt;

declare module 'uint8arrays' {
  export function toString(b: Uint8Array, enc?: string): string
  export function fromString(s: string, enc?: string): Uint8Array
}</code> src/react-app-env.d.ts file Local Ceramic node <p>Let's start a local Ceramic node using the script defined, and keep it running for all the steps of this tutorial:</p> <code>npm run ceramic</code> <p>We'll also need to bootstrap the local node with the IDX documents, using the IDX CLI previously installed:</p> <code>idx bootstrap</code>  Data model <p>By using Ceramic and IDX, we can create a data model for our application that is user-centric (instead of application-siloed), &nbsp;globally available from any client on the Ceramic network, and publicly discoverable and shareable across any application(s) that a user interacts with. This is all made possible thanks to public schemas, data definitions, and the user's IDX document. Thus, by storing your application's user data in the IDX framework, it becomes truly user-centric and portable across app domains and contexts.</p>  A schema is a <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON-schema</a> document created by a developer which can be used to validate the contents of other documents simply by including the unique document identifier (DocID) of the schema.  A definition is a document created by a developer which provides metadata about the data that they want to store with the user. The DocID of the definition acts as a unique key within the user's IDX document, and is used to identify a reference (the actual contents) associated to a specified schema.  An IDX document is a document owned by a user which maintains an index of all of their data in a single place. It is a key-value store that stores mappings from definitions to references.  <p>For this notes management app, we'll use two types of documents and therefore two schemas:</p>  <code>Note</code>: this document will store the contents of a single note  <code>NotesList</code>: the entry-point document to index the list of notes with metadata  <p>We will need to create and publish these schemas to the local Ceramic node, along with a definition which allows us to interact with the notes list using IDX. This will allow our app and others to access the notes via the following path:</p> <code>User DID —&gt; IDX index —&gt; notes definition —&gt; notes list —&gt; note 1
                                                        -&gt; note 2
                                                        -&gt; ...
</code> <p>Let's create a <code>bootstrap.js</code> script that will create and publish the schemas and definition to our Ceramic node, and store the Ceramic document ID (DocID) of the definition to a JSON file that will be used by the app:</p> <code>const { writeFile } = require('fs').promises
const Ceramic = require('@ceramicnetwork/http-client').default
const { createDefinition, publishSchema } = require('@ceramicstudio/idx-tools')
const { Ed25519Provider } = require('key-did-provider-ed25519')
const fromString = require('uint8arrays/from-string')

const CERAMIC_URL = 'http://localhost:7007'

const NoteSchema = {
  $schema: '&lt;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&gt;',
  title: 'Note',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    date: {
      type: 'string',
      format: 'date-time',
      title: 'date',
      maxLength: 30,
    },
    text: {
      type: 'string',
      title: 'text',
      maxLength: 4000,
    },
  },
}

const NotesListSchema = {
  $schema: '&lt;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&gt;',
  title: 'NotesList',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    notes: {
      type: 'array',
      title: 'notes',
      items: {

        title: 'NoteItem',
        properties: {
          id: {
            $ref: '#/definitions/CeramicDocId',
          },
          title: {
            type: 'string',
            title: 'title',
            maxLength: 100,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  definitions: {
    CeramicDocId: {
      type: 'string',
      pattern: '^ceramic://.+(\\\\?version=.+)?',
      maxLength: 150,
    },
  },
}

async function run() {
  // The seed must be provided as an environment variable
  const seed = fromString(process.env.SEED, 'base16')
  // Connect to the local Ceramic node
  const ceramic = new Ceramic(CERAMIC_URL)
  // Authenticate the Ceramic instance with the provider
  await ceramic.setDIDProvider(new Ed25519Provider(seed))

  // Publish the two schemas
  const [noteSchema, notesListSchema] = await Promise.all([
    publishSchema(ceramic, { content: NoteSchema }),
    publishSchema(ceramic, { content: NotesListSchema }),
  ])

  // Create the definition using the created schema ID
  const notesDefinition = await createDefinition(ceramic, {
    name: 'notes',
    description: 'Simple text notes',
    schema: notesListSchema.commitId.toUrl(),
  })

  // Write config to JSON file
  const config = {
    definitions: {
      notes: notesDefinition.id.toString(),
    },
    schemas: {
      Note: noteSchema.commitId.toUrl(),
      NotesList: notesListSchema.commitId.toUrl(),
    },
  }
  await writeFile('./src/config.json', JSON.stringify(config))

  console.log('Config written to src/config.json file:', config)
  process.exit(0)
}

run().catch(console.error)</code> bootstrap.js file<p>Now to run this script, we'll need to provide a 32 bytes base16-encoded string as an environment variable:</p> <code>SEED=&lt;your seed&gt; npm run bootstrap
</code> <p>If you need a simple way to create such a seed, you can use the following command:</p> <code>node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
</code> <p>Running the bootstrap script will create a <code>config.json</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder, that will be imported by our app. The schemas and definition DocIDs contained in this <code>config.json</code> file are globally unique and can be shared with other apps wanting to interact with the notes associated to the user.</p> Interacting with our data model <p>Before moving forwards with implementing our app, let's first check we can interact with our data model using the IDX CLI.</p><p>First, we'll need to create a local DID that will be used by the CLI:</p> <code>idx did:create --label=local</code> <p>The <code>local</code> alias can be used to reference the DID in the following commands, rather than having to provide the full DID string.</p><p>Now we can create a note with some text using the <code>Note</code> schema URL added to <code>src/config.json</code>. In my case this URL is <code>ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw14atxo8ax0mrknm7xfh8pxqy24hbdrxi9nagtwoa3la5s4hf32qr</code> but it will be different when using another seed, so don't forget to change it in the example below:</p> <code>idx tile:create local '{"text":"My first note"}' --schema=ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw14atxo8ax0mrknm7xfh8pxqy24hbdrxi9nagtwoa3la5s4hf32qr
</code> <p>Successfully running this command will display the document ID of the created note, that we can then add to the list of notes using the <code>notes</code> definition key added to <code>src/config.json</code>:</p> <code>idx index:set local kjzl6cwe1jw14almqh93rmt1mpv8h6zvyeyhh7jzlqp95kgv38c0jb5yuo8mo7w '{"notes":[{"id":"ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw147xhyjemd6r38812gzhhexw9mj3gz2vvkimotu5xktssik2cbzp","title":"First"}]}'
</code> <p>Make sure to replace the definition key (<code>kjzl6cwe1jw14almqh93rmt1mpv8h6zvyeyhh7jzlqp95kgv38c0jb5yuo8mo7w</code> in my case) and the created note URL (<code>ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw147xhyjemd6r38812gzhhexw9mj3gz2vvkimotu5xktssik2cbzp</code> in the code above) by the values created in your environment.</p><p>We can now check the created note and notes list can be loaded:</p> <code>idx index:get local kjzl6cwe1jw14almqh93rmt1mpv8h6zvyeyhh7jzlqp95kgv38c0jb5yuo8mo7w
idx tile:get ceramic://kjzl6cwe1jw147xhyjemd6r38812gzhhexw9mj3gz2vvkimotu5xktssik2cbzp
</code>  Application dependencies and IDX setup <p>Our app is going to use the following additional dependencies:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/idx-web">IDX</a>, to interact with the list of notes  <a href="https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui">Material UI</a> for UI components and icons  A <a href="https://www.stablelib.com/modules/_random_random_.html">random bytes generator</a>, to generate a seed   <code>npm install @ceramicstudio/idx @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @stablelib/random</code> <p>Then, let's create an <code>idx.ts</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder, implementing the logic to authenticate using a provided seed and load notes with IDX:</p> <code>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'

import { definitions } from './config.json'

const CERAMIC_URL = 'http://localhost:7007'

export type NoteItem = {
  id: string
  title: string
}

export type NotesList = { notes: Array&lt;NoteItem&gt; }

export type IDXInit = NotesList &amp; {
  ceramic: Ceramic
  idx: IDX
}

export async function getIDX(seed: Uint8Array): Promise&lt;IDXInit&gt; {
  // Create the Ceramic instance and inject provider
  const ceramic = new Ceramic(CERAMIC_URL)
  await ceramic.setDIDProvider(new Ed25519Provider(seed))

  // Create the IDX instance with the definitions aliases from the config
  const idx = new IDX({ ceramic, aliases: definitions })

  // Load the existing notes
  const notesList = await idx.get&lt;{ notes: Array&lt;NoteItem&gt; }&gt;('notes')
  return { ceramic, idx, notes: notesList?.notes ?? [] }
}</code> src/idx.ts file Application state and actions <p>In this section, we'll implement the core logic of our app based on a state, synchronous actions mutating the state, and high-level handlers performing one or more actions.</p><p>First, let's create a <code>state.ts</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder with the following initial contents:</p> <code>import type { Doctype } from '@ceramicnetwork/common'
import type Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import type { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'
import { useCallback, useReducer } from 'react'

import { schemas } from './config.json'
import { getIDX } from './idx'
import type { IDXInit, NotesList } from './idx'

type AuthStatus = 'pending' | 'loading' | 'failed'
export type DraftStatus = 'unsaved' | 'saving' | 'failed' | 'saved'
type NoteLoadingStatus = 'init' | 'loading' | 'loading failed'
type NoteSavingStatus = 'loaded' | 'saving' | 'saving failed' | 'saved'

type UnauthenticatedState = { status: AuthStatus }
type AuthenticatedState = { status: 'done'; ceramic: Ceramic; idx: IDX }
export type AuthState = UnauthenticatedState | AuthenticatedState

type NavDefaultState = { type: 'default' }
type NavDraftState = { type: 'draft' }
type NavNoteState = { type: 'note'; docID: string }

export type IndexLoadedNote = { status: NoteLoadingStatus; title: string }
export type StoredNote = {
  status: NoteSavingStatus
  title: string
  doc: Doctype
}

type Store = {
  draftStatus: DraftStatus
  notes: Record&lt;string, IndexLoadedNote | StoredNote&gt;
}
type DefaultState = {
  auth: AuthState
  nav: NavDefaultState
}
type NoteState = {
  auth: AuthenticatedState
  nav: NavDraftState | NavNoteState
}
export type State = Store &amp; (DefaultState | NoteState)</code> src/state.ts file<p>Here we are importing types and dependencies from React (the <code>useCallback</code> and <code>useReducer</code> hooks) and defining the valid shapes the application <code>State</code> can have.</p><p>Next we'll define an <code>Action</code> type that includes all the possible synchronous actions that can be performed to mutate the <code>State</code>:</p> <code>type AuthAction = { type: 'auth'; status: AuthStatus }
type AuthSuccessAction = { type: 'auth success' } &amp; IDXInit
type NavResetAction = { type: 'nav reset' }
type NavDraftAction = { type: 'nav draft' }
type NavNoteAction = { type: 'nav note'; docID: string }
type DraftDeleteAction = { type: 'draft delete' }
type DraftStatusAction = { type: 'draft status'; status: 'saving' | 'failed' }
type DraftSavedAction = {
  type: 'draft saved'
  title: string
  docID: string
  doc: Doctype
}
type NoteLoadedAction = { type: 'note loaded'; docID: string; doc: Doctype }
type NoteLoadingStatusAction = {
  type: 'note loading status'
  docID: string
  status: NoteLoadingStatus
}
type NoteSavingStatusAction = {
  type: 'note saving status'
  docID: string
  status: NoteSavingStatus
}
type Action =
  | AuthAction
  | AuthSuccessAction
  | NavResetAction
  | NavDraftAction
  | NavNoteAction
  | DraftDeleteAction
  | DraftStatusAction
  | DraftSavedAction
  | NoteLoadedAction
  | NoteLoadingStatusAction
  | NoteSavingStatusAction</code> src/state.ts file<p>To handle the state transitions, we'll use a reducer function, as presented in <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer">React's documentation</a>:</p> <code>function reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {

  }),
) 
</code> src/App.tsx file<p>Now we'll create our first component: <code>NotesList</code>. This component displays the list of notes in a side menu, and a button to open a draft note.</p><p>This component will get the <code>State</code> and needed actions injected:</p> <code>type NotesListProps = {

      &lt;List&gt;{notes}&lt;/List&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}
</code> src/App.tsx file<p>Another component we will need is <code>AuthenticateScreen</code>, that will display the authenticated ID or seed prompt as needed:</p> <code>type AuthenticateProps = {
  authenticate: (seed: Uint8Array) =&gt; void
  state: AuthState
}

function AuthenticateScreen({ authenticate, state }: AuthenticateProps) {
  const [seed, setSeed] = useState('')

  return state.status === 'done' ? (
    &lt;Typography&gt;Authenticated with ID {state.idx.id}&lt;/Typography&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Typography&gt;
        You need to authenticate to load your existing notes and create new ones.
      &lt;/Typography&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;TextField
          autoFocus
          disabled={isLoading}

          label="Seed"
          onChange={(event) =&gt; setSeed(event.target.value)}

      &lt;Button
        color="primary"
        disabled={seed === '' || isLoading}
        onClick={() =&gt; authenticate(fromString(seed, 'base16'))}
        variant="contained"&gt;
        Authenticate
      &lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;Button
        color="primary"
        disabled={isLoading}
        onClick={() =&gt; setSeed(toString(randomBytes(32), 'base16'))}&gt;
        Generate random seed
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}</code> src/App.tsx file<p>Next, let's add the <code>DraftScreen</code>, allowing users to create and save a new note:</p> <code>type DraftScreenProps = {
  save: (title: string, text: string) =&gt; void
  status: DraftStatus
}

function DraftScreen({ save, status }: DraftScreenProps) {
  const classes = useStyles()
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  const textRef = useRef&lt;HTMLTextAreaElement&gt;(null)
  const titleRef = useRef&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;(null)

  const handleOpen = () =&gt; {
    setOpen(true)
  }

  const handleClose = () =&gt; {
    setOpen(false)
  }

  const handleSave = () =&gt; {
    const text = textRef.current?.value
    const title = titleRef.current?.value
    if (text &amp;&amp; title) {
      save(title, text)
    }
    setOpen(false)
  }

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Dialog
        open={open}
        onClose={handleClose}
        aria-labelledby="form-dialog-title"&gt;
        &lt;DialogTitle id="form-dialog-title"&gt;Save note&lt;/DialogTitle&gt;
        &lt;DialogContent&gt;
          &lt;TextField

            type="text"
            fullWidth

        &lt;/DialogContent&gt;
        &lt;DialogActions&gt;
          &lt;Button onClick={handleClose} color="primary"&gt;
            Cancel
          &lt;/Button&gt;
          &lt;Button onClick={handleSave} color="primary" variant="outlined"&gt;
            Save note
          &lt;/Button&gt;
        &lt;/DialogActions&gt;
      &lt;/Dialog&gt;
      &lt;Paper elevation={5}&gt;
        &lt;TextareaAutosize
          className={classes.noteTextarea}
          placeholder="Note contents..."

          rowsMin={10}
          rowsMax={20}
        /&gt;
      &lt;/Paper&gt;
      &lt;Button
        className={classes.noteSaveButton}
        color="primary"
        disabled={status === 'saving'}
        onClick={handleOpen}
        variant="contained"&gt;
        Save
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}
</code> src/App.tsx file<p>We will use another component, <code>NoteScreen</code>, for displaying an existing note as the logic is a bit different from a draft, notably that we have to first load the document from Ceramic before being able to display the note contents:</p> <code>type NoteScreenProps = {
  note: IndexLoadedNote | StoredNote
  save: (doc: Doctype, text: string) =&gt; void
}

function NoteScreen({ note, save }: NoteScreenProps) {
  const classes = useStyles()
  const textRef = useRef&lt;HTMLTextAreaElement&gt;(null)

  if (note.status === 'loading failed') {
    return &lt;Typography&gt;Failed to load note!&lt;/Typography&gt;
  }

  if (note.status === 'init' || note.status === 'loading') {
    return &lt;Typography&gt;Loading note...&lt;/Typography&gt;
  }

  const doc = (note as StoredNote).doc
  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Paper elevation={5}&gt;
        &lt;TextareaAutosize
          className={classes.noteTextarea}
          defaultValue={doc.content.text}
          placeholder="Note contents..."
          ref={textRef}
          rowsMin={10}
          rowsMax={20}
        /&gt;
      &lt;/Paper&gt;
      &lt;Button
        className={classes.noteSaveButton}
        color="primary"
        disabled={note.status === 'saving'}
        onClick={() =&gt; save(doc, textRef.current?.value ?? '')}
        variant="contained"&gt;
        Save
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}

			<p>With an evolving suite of learner-centric technology solutions, <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgelearn/">EdgeLearn</a> provides member institutions with the tools and platforms they need to create an engaging and dynamic student experience. This unique Edge solution offers products and services that not only help enhance the teaching and learning process in the classroom, but also supports the educational services of the institution. “We offer several best-in-class educational technologies, including a learning management system (LMS), video collaboration via Zoom, and a Digital Asset Management (DAM) solution that can be used in a variety of teaching and learning processes,” says Chris Markham, Vice President for Information Technology &amp; Economic Advancement at Edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the significant impact of COVID-19 on the education community, many institutions have had to adapt to online learning quickly. Through EdgeLearn, members can access instructional design and educational technology support to help create a powerful digital learning environment. “We offer member institutions the expertise and guidance they need to make a seamless transition to online learning,” says Josh Gaul, Executive Director, EdgeLearn. “Whether the goal is moving a large amount of face-to-face courses online or an organization needs expertise in program development, online course development, digital learning, instructional design, and technology, we can help create a successful strategy. In addition, Edge provides professional development resources and training through <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgepro/">EdgePro</a> to help faculty be successful and understand new technology. Our professional development services include sharing best practices and pitfalls to avoid when designing and facilitating an online course.”</p>
<p>Navigating Digital Transformation&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choosing a technology stack, whether traditional or non-traditional, is an important component of forming the foundation of an online campus or program. “Traditional online learning is an LMS with little synchronous communication between the students,” explains Gaul. “Students are self-directed learners with several online quizzes, papers, and threaded discussions. This approach is seen with many hybrid instruction models which have different forms of assessment and evaluation. Non-traditional online learning involves more innovative methodology, finding creative ways to use Zoom, virtual lab software, and academic research network systems. This technology allows a level playing field for all students, where a local student can have the same experience as a distance learner. No matter the technology you choose, the success of an online program is not strictly the tools. The key is the people and the processes that are built to fit all the pieces together.”</p>
<p>The services and solutions offered through EdgeLearn aim to help institutions navigate the ins and outs of digital transformation and create a learning environment where everything connects. “Our products and services allow member institutions to adapt to a different style of learning and teaching,” says Gaul. “We are being faced with a new reality, with hybrid and fully online classes becoming part of the norm. There are different steps students can take to be successful online learners and ways for faculty to ensure their students have a successful and engaging experience in these online courses. EdgeLearn can help an organization understand these steps to further build confident students and ensure they are receiving a high quality education from their chosen institution.”</p>
<p>Customized Technology and Design</p>
<p>Understanding how educational technology tools can work together to support the learning and teaching goals of an organization are essential to every digital transformation strategy. Edge offers instructional design and instructional technology as a service options, both customizable to support the individual teaching and learning goals of an institution. Instructional design as a service involves the creation, conversion, or expansion of online courses and programs that both enhance instruction and learner engagement and collaboration. “An instructional designer understands learning theory and pedagogy and works with faculty developers to design courses, curriculum, and objectives that meet specific assessment requirements for certain courses,” explains Gaul. “An instructional or educational technologist understands the learning theory and can apply their expertise to how technology can be used to achieve the outcomes being designed by the instructional designer and the faculty member.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gaul says EdgeLearn has expertise in both realms and can help fill in the gaps within an institution, while finding ways for members of both groups to work together to create the best online learning experience for faculty and students. “The delivery of these services is completely tailored to an institution, with built-in flexibility and adaptability. We can customize to the current products already in use that support teaching and learning at a campus or we can select additional products and customize these options to accomplish the institution’s goals.”</p>

			<p>Empowering Faculty Members</p>
<p>For institutions transitioning to online education, ongoing faculty development is essential to providing a long-lasting superior learning experience. “To create an institutional resource for faculty development and academic leadership, faculty members must understand the value of this resource and how ongoing training can help improve your organization and your ability to deliver online instruction,” says Gaul. “You also need a framework of understanding based upon your academic strategic goals and the resources faculty members need to ensure online instruction meets all the academic requirements.”</p>
<p>A faculty development framework doesn’t necessarily have to be a standalone division within the institution. Rather, this resource can serve as a place where instructional designers, faculty, and IT professionals work together to build a storefront that provides the channels for faculty to get necessary resources. “This framework is a way for faculty to feel confident and comfortable about teaching online and offers access to the support they need to deliver quality instruction to online students,” says Gaul. “Edge can help create a framework that includes a series of workshops and training resources that help faculty better understand the pedagogy behind digital learning.”</p>
<p>Through ongoing conversations with member institutions, including Georgian Court University (GCU), New Jersey City University (NJCU), Rowan University, and William Jewel College, Edge gains valuable insights that further enhance the technology products and instructional design services of EdgeLearn. “We want to ensure educational technologists, instructional designers, technology support personnel, and faculty members have the tools and platforms they need to succeed,” says Markham. “Edge is continually finding new ways to help organizations accelerate the development of a unified online campus, improve instructional design and technology, and effectively enrich the teaching-learning process.”</p>

<p>XHE facilitates transfer of business documents</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) Version 1.0 from the OASIS Business Document Exchange (BDXR) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>The Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) has been developed jointly by UN/CEFACT and OASIS as the successor to the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) version 1.3 and the OASIS Business Document Envelope (BDE) Version 1.1.</p>



<p>XHE defines a business-oriented artefact either referencing (as a header) or containing (as an envelope) a payload of one or more business documents or other artefacts with supplemental semantic information about the collection of payloads as a whole. An exchange header envelope describes contextual information important to the sender and receiver about the payloads, without having to modify the payloads in any fashion. This vocabulary is modeled using the UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification Version 2.01.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

 BKC affiliate drafted Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence in&nbsp;Colombia Armando Guio Español at a Berkman Klein Center&nbsp;event.<p>Increasingly, the public and private sectors alike are working on guidance and principles for artificial intelligence (AI) development, deployment, and regulation. The Colombian government, for example, recently published a draft <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2020-12/Colombia_AI_Ethical_Framework.pdf">AI ethics framework</a>, “Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence in Colombia.” AI policy expert <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/armando-guio-espanol">Armando Guio Español</a>, an alumnus of Harvard Law School, an affiliate of the Berkman Klein Center (BKC), and consultant for the Development Bank of Latin America — drafted the framework for the Colombian government.</p><p>On November 24, Armando participated in an expert roundtable discussion on Colombia’s AI ethical framework and its implications for young people. The <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-artificial-intelligence">BKC Policy Practice on Artificial Intelligence</a> hosted the roundtable in collaboration with the Colombian government. BKC Policy Practice: AI is a public interest-oriented program, led by BKC Executive Director <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a>, that helps governmental, nonprofit, and private sector organizations implement AI best practices and turn AI principles into operational realities.</p><p>We spoke with Armando about Colombia’s Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence, the recent roundtable discussion focusing on youth, and how working at BKC informed his experience creating the framework. Responses were lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>You authored Colombia’s Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence, which creates a foundation by which Colombia’s public and private sectors can embrace AI while respecting core values such as protecting human rights and privacy. Could you briefly summarize the main&nbsp;points?</p><p>The Ethical Framework for AI describes ten principles for designing, developing, and deploying trustworthy AI systems in Colombia. Some of these principles are transparency, explainability, privacy, human control, social benefit, and the prevalence of children’s and adolescents’ rights, amongst others. Each of these ethical principles is considered from a tri-dimensional perspective: data, algorithms, and practices. When we have discussions about transparency and AI, we have different considerations when we talk about being transparent: on the use of data, on the modeling of an algorithm, or in the practices we undergo to implement this technology. Likewise, the framework also carefully considers the algorithmic chain and how principles will be applied in the design, development, or implementation of this technology. Creating the framework has been quite interesting because it has allowed us to discuss the ethical consequences of implementing this emerging technology in Colombia, pointing out that ethics are not only a matter of designing this innovation.</p><p>Additionally, the framework serves as an ethical toolkit. It provides a series of options to operationalize these principles in entities from the public and private sectors. We have proposed different methodologies such as algorithm assessment, algorithm auditing, data cleansing techniques, ethical training in coding courses, legitimacy evaluation for AI projects, and the implementation of Codes of Ethics, amongst others. We present a range of options that all entities can adopt per their convenience and own internal procedures.</p><p>Finally, the ethical framework sets a series of recommendations for the Colombian government to develop these ethical principles further. The main proposal was for the government to use this framework as a first draft to mobilize the discussion we must have as a society about using such disruptive technology.</p><p>What was the process for creating such a framework? What factored into your thinking?</p><p>The ethical framework is part of a bigger effort I have been working towards: implementing Colombia’s AI Strategy. In 2019, for example, I led the design process of Colombia’s AI strategy with Victor Muñoz, the Presidential Advisor for Digital Transformation in Colombia. This opportunity allowed Colombia to create one of the first AI Strategies in Latin-America. We defined a series of guidelines, one of them being an ethical framework. Therefore, having this framework is just one step towards properly implementing this policy that Colombia has&nbsp;adopted.</p><p>With the support of the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), I started the task and, I must say, the challenging experience of preparing this first draft. For me, it was essential to look at the existing academic work that supported many of the principles being proposed around the world. I will highlight that the work and literature developed by BKC, especially from the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/topics/ethics-and-governance-ai">Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative</a>, was essential for this purpose. Additionally, I looked into the evidence that was developed in the last few years about the possible risks arising from the use of this technology. Case studies around the world showed the risks of using AI without proper ethical considerations. The study published by BKC about <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2018/artificial-intelligence-human-rights#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20(%E2%80%9CAI%E2%80%9D),the%20world%20before%20our%20eyes.&amp;text=Our%20project%20seeks%20to%20advance,six%20current%20uses%20of%20AI.">AI and Human Rights</a> was exceedingly relevant to this&nbsp;point.</p><p>Once I was convinced about the importance of having ethical principles, I started thinking about those principles that could become the most relevant for Colombia and our technology ecosystem. I tried to think through this from different perspectives so it could become a national framework. My experience working in different sectors allowed me to consider the interests and needs of other entities. From academia to the private sector and public entities, I wanted these principles to have a horizontal view. I have had, and still have many discussions, but this was a helpful exercise to work on a document that was convincing enough for different stakeholders. I also considered that such an effort required proper research and a quality document that allowed us to have a high-standard discussion. That was one of my main motivations.</p><p>You joined the BKC community as a fellow in 2018 and remain active as an affiliate. How did your time at BKC support your work on AI and ethics, and specifically your thinking about AI and&nbsp;youth?</p><p>Without a doubt, I would not have been able to work on this project without being part of the BKC community. When I arrived at BKC in 2018, AI was becoming a very relevant issue, but still, in countries such as Colombia, the topic was not seen as a priority. Additionally, there were many myths about this technology and its real potential. My time at BKC allowed me to understand the real features of AI, its characteristics, and how it could impact Colombia and the region. Sharing time with such an exceptional group of individuals through fellows hours, coffee breaks with colleagues from all around the world, Urs’ office and “un-office hours,” were essential for learning, questioning myself, and going beyond my initial thoughts. There were many challenging conversations, and that is only part of the Fellow experience. At the same time, I was able to discuss with many of the authors of some of the papers and research that I was reading at the time, and who were impacting my approach to these topics. That was a great privilege.</p><p>I also had the opportunity to work in the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/youthandmedia">Youth and Media</a> office, which was very helpful for the work I was going to develop. Not only were <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/scortesi">Sandra Cortesi</a> and <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ahasse">Alexa Hasse</a> very welcoming, but they also shared with me their research ideas, their perspectives about these topics, and the interesting and innovative things that I could do. I had never considered how important it was to design spaces to discuss with children about AI systems and how to get the most from their approach to this topic. Sandra’s advice also inspired me to explore my creativity, appreciate a multidisciplinary approach, and consider the relevance of design features in the produced documents. I also shared my desk with Youth and Media’s designers, who did an exceptional job and showed me how relevant their work was to prepare an impactful proposal. Rarely have I been as comfortable being challenged and motivated as I was during my time with the Youth and Media team. Sandra always encouraged me to think that many of these ideas were possible in Colombia, and that also motivated me to return to Colombia with this&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>BKC’s AI policy practice hosted the recent roundtable discussion about AI and its impacts on youth. What key insights did you gain from that discussion?</p><p>The first roundtable we had about the ethical framework was a very interesting discussion. From my perspective, one of the most important points is that experts from all around the world appreciated the effort of including an ethical principle specially dedicated to prioritizing the needs of children and adolescents in the way AI is being developed and implemented in Colombia. I think the Colombian framework will keep this principle and show other countries in the region and the world how important this&nbsp;is.</p><p>The discussion also showed me that the impact of AI in the future of education is tremendous. We should be aware of the potential benefits and risks and promote inclusion in AI implementation. AI can accelerate existing disparities and inequalities in this sector and in a country like Colombia, this is something we should definitely avoid.</p><p>Finally, there was also a call to consider the need for regulatory measures about AI. I find this interesting because there is no doubt the framework will impact the policy and regulatory proposals we have on this area. At the same time, prioritizing children’s rights and interests will have to be harmonized with existing regulations and international treaties that already developed this same&nbsp;concept.</p><p>What advice would you give to someone interested in policy and&nbsp;AI?</p><p>I think that someone interested in working in AI policy issues should prepare to be constantly challenged. Not only because concepts are still being developed, but the technology itself is also constantly changing. At the same time, there are high interests at stake that must be considered in every policy analysis. There will be constant pressure for something to be done, and a person working on these areas should be prepared to handle it. I will add that resilience to rapid changes is also a great skill to master if you want to work in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>Governments want to show themselves as proactive in this area. When you act as an advisor and say that there is not enough evidence to support a policy or regulatory measure, you will be questioned. Trying to convince decision makers on how important it is to wait, or to develop evidence-based policies, is not an easy task, but it is highly appreciated when this approach provides positive&nbsp;results.</p><p>Finally, I think that a multidisciplinary approach is highly desirable. Advising on AI policy requires individuals who can interact with different stakeholders and with technical experts. Presenting yourself as someone with policy expertise but who also understands the technology is helpful. I am a lawyer, and it is interesting to see after a talk or event how some people approach me and consider me a data scientist or computational engineer. I am glad that they see I have this potential and feel confident I understand what they are doing and their motivations.</p><p>Are there any resources or additional reading you would recommend to&nbsp;them?</p><p>I think that a person interested in these issues should understand the power dynamics involved in this process, the patience that is required to have an impact after a long process of deliberation, and the way policy-making process has been changing in the last decades. Therefore, I recommend them to read these three&nbsp;books:</p>  <a href="https://www.aisuperpowers.com/">AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order</a> by Kai-Fu&nbsp;Lee  <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300225679/delayed-response">Delayed Response: The Art of Waiting from the Ancient to the Instant World</a> by Jason&nbsp;Farman  <a href="https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/cost-benefit-revolution--cass-r.-sunstein?variationCode=9780262038140">The Cost-Benefit Revolution</a> by Cass R.&nbsp;Sunstein   <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/q-a-armando-guio-espa%C3%B1ol-on-ai-ethics-and-policy-9aabb756ec13">Q&amp;A: Armando Guio Español on AI Ethics and Policy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Some Reflections on the Role of Government in Trustworthy AI  Shared at the Launch Event of Colombia’s AI Ethics Framework <p>I had the honor of participating in Lanzamiento de la Ética de la Inteligencia Artifical en Colombia (“Launch of Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Colombia”) on November 25, 2020, alongside Colombian President Iván Duque Márquez. My remarks highlight the different roles governments can (and should) play in promoting trustworthy AI. The reflections are informed by the Berkman Klein Center’s work on the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/topics/ethics-and-governance-ai">ethics and governance of AI</a> as well as ongoing learnings in the context of BKC’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-artificial-intelligence">Policy Practice on AI</a>, in addition to the great and vast literature on trust, technology, and&nbsp;law.</p><p>Here is the transcript of my&nbsp;talk.</p><p>Thank you very much, dear Mr. President, dear colleagues, and Colombian friends. It’s an honor to speak to you today. First, let me congratulate you on the AI ethics framework, which is an important milestone in the implementation of the national policy for digital transformation and AI. It’s been a real pleasure working with your team, Mr. President, on some of these issues that you’re talking about today. And I’ve been impressed by your leadership and your office’s expertise and wisdom. So thank you very much for all this collaboration that you’ve supported.</p><p>Please let me use the next few minutes to reflect on the role that the government can, and I would argue should, play as we work together in this multi-stakeholder fashion towards trustworthy AI. I can build upon the excellent contributions by my colleagues and previous speakers when highlighting the crucial role trust and trust-building play in this particular moment in time. If you take two steps back, I will argue that AI — as a relatively new set of technologies, at least in terms of the application areas — poses a number of trust problems or trust challenges.</p><p>I would like to highlight only two such challenges and share them with you. The first challenge is one that we are actually familiar with as a society: the moment when new technology becomes more widely available. When we introduce a new piece of technology, there is often a risky gap between what we know and what we don’t know about the technology and its interaction with society, including the unknown unknowns. And in some interesting ways, trust is a social coping mechanism to bridge this gap of uncertainty, to enable people to take a leap of faith, if you will. And indeed, as I reviewed again <a href="https://colaboracion.dnp.gov.co/CDT/Conpes/Econ%C3%B3micos/3975.pdf">Colombia’s national policy</a>, you’ve highlighted this lack of knowledge, this problem of information gap as a key barrier to the adaptation of digital technology.</p><p>Now when we look at this trust issue, one key role of the government becomes immediately clear when it comes to trust-building. Like at this event today, governments can serve the role of a convener, of an educator to inform citizens. But of course, it’s more than just sharing information about the promise of AI. Yesterday we hosted with the president’s office a roundtable, a workshop to zoom in, quite literally, we were using Zoom, on children and young people to discuss the ways how we can use the power of education through skill-building to empower the next generation, to use these technologies in meaningful ways as they navigate their lives and building their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>In addition to the role of an educator, there is a second role that has become visible already today in our conversation: governments can promote trust by setting norms. And of course, the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2020-12/Colombia_AI_Ethical_Framework.pdf">ethics framework</a> that we’re celebrating today sets the background norms upon which expectations can become stable across the many stakeholders in the ecosystem and trust can crystallize around these expectations.</p><blockquote>Building upon ethics, legal norms are needed to enable&nbsp;trust.</blockquote><p>But of course, the Colombian government also understands that ethical norms are not sufficient. Building upon ethics, legal norms are needed to enable trust. And here again, we can learn from history when we look at the role of law in promoting trust. Law can actually help to build a bridge across the knowledge gap I mentioned at the beginning. For example, by introducing transparency requirements, as previous speakers highlighted, or by introducing monitoring obligations. It is in this context, as my colleague from the World Economic Forum mentioned, why the right to explanation or the idea of explanation within AI systems is such an important trust enabler. There is another angle to law as a tool to build trust, which is perhaps less intuitive. One of the magics that law can bring to us is actually to enable trust by anticipating that sometimes trust is disappointed, and already putting into place norms and rules that should apply once trust is disappointed. And think about sanctions or liability through that lens, and suddenly you may see law is functioning in building trust in different ways and not the dominant paradigm that law is bad for innovation, suddenly a richer narrative.</p><p>Now let me move quickly to AI’s second trust problem, which is more specific to AI. I think unlike previous technologies, trust in AI doesn’t only require that the technology works. In the past, think about trains or airplanes, or whatever technical system that was innovative at some point. What was a key thing to build trust for people was that a train brings you from A to B quite safely and so does an airplane. But what we see with AI is probably a novel trust challenge. And that has to do with what AI applications do. They are involved in decision-making unlike a train. Probably closer to modern airplanes. And the question becomes whether our AI is making sound decisions that are in our interests as users. In other words, we may move from a role of functional trust, like in the age of trains and locomotives, that is mostly a cognitive matter, to a world where it’s about fiduciary trust. This form of trust actually requires trust not only cognitively, but also emotionally. And to me, this kind of trust in technology is much harder to achieve. It’s actually harder to&nbsp;earn.</p><p>And so the key question becomes again what are the roles that governments can play? I would just like to highlight two. First, I would propose that governments can serve the function of a seismograph and an amplifier. In my view, going forward, it’s important to capture the real-world feedback from how AIs are used in their specific social context — What issues emerge from these interactions? — and create a learning ecosystem within the government, and within society, to learn from these often weak signals in real-time, upgrade and revise, and adjust laws and policies dynamically. And that’s a real challenge, as we all know, for those doing work in the policy space. How can we create learning by design and build that into our governance systems?</p><p>Second, governments are themselves trust proxies. As users of AI technology, which governments often are, they can demonstrate how AI indeed can support sound, yes, better decision-making. Now, unfortunately, this is a high bar. As we know from many negative headlines these days, some of the early stories when governments started to adopt and use AI have been the opposite of a success story. So I think that means we have to choose very wisely and ensure that we can demonstrate how AI serves this fiduciary role.</p><p>Now taken together a few things become clear. Governments can and do play many different roles when it comes to AI. Governments are promoters of AI, regulators, educators, users, coordinators, researchers. And that’s good news. And I see all these roles described also in Colombia’s national strategy. It means that we have many different tools, a broad toolkit for AI governance available and the Colombian government is embracing it. But there are also challenges that may immediately affect the trust equilibrium.</p><p>First, given that AI and AI applications are so contextual, and given that so many different government agencies are involved in decision-making, it’s very hard to maintain coherence in decision-making and in communication within the government. And we know, particularly now looking at COVID, that mixed signals from government agencies have a great potential to harm trust immediately. And I think that’s a particular problem in such a complex policy area where AI transcends through restrictions and plays a role in transportation, education, health, you name it. How can we create and maintain a certain coherence in both policymaking and communication?</p><blockquote>It’s not only what decisions will be made, but also how we arrive at these value judgments […] that will be key for trust outcomes.</blockquote><p>A second complication emerges from the fact that some of the roles I mentioned may be in tension with each other. There may be even the risk of role conflict. For instance, sometimes the interests of the government as a user may be different from the interests of the government as a regulator. Now these conflicts, or at least tensions, are often not addressed in ethics frameworks or national policies. But any resolution will of course benefit from proactive dialogue. And I would argue and emphasize, it’s not only what decisions will be made, but also how we arrive at these value judgments in case of some of these roles trade-offs or tensions, that will be key for trust outcomes.</p><p>So in conclusion, and perhaps paradoxically, I think a healthy dose of skepticism towards the promises of AI might be the most productive and sensible way to work together towards trustworthy AI. I am personally and together with the BKC team, looking forward to being part of this journey of trust-building with all of you. Thank you very&nbsp;much.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/some-reflections-on-the-role-of-government-and-trustworthy-ai-7972db1aa6ab">Some Reflections on the Role of Government and Trustworthy AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.ernrp.org/">Eastern Regional Network</a> (ERN) is a consortium of network providers, universities, and industry partners who are dedicated to advancing data and compute intensive research. Led by a coalition of the willing, which includes <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (Rutgers)</a>, the ERN aims to provide layered and transparent access to shared data and computing facilities to a broader research community. This regional research and education platform allows each campus to benefit from collaborative multi-institutional resources, providing their students and faculty with new and exciting opportunities and helping to further advance research initiatives.</p>
<p>The ERN had a virtual meeting in June with over 170 attendees, where representatives from 28 colleges, nine regional network providers, and five industries came together to discuss regional cyberinfrastructure and how to achieve the consortium’s mission. “During our meeting, we learned that two ERN-related proposals that we submitted to the National Science Foundation (NSF) had been funded, which was really exciting,” says Dr. James Barr von Oehsen, Associate Vice President of the Office of Advanced Research Computing (OARC) at Rutgers. “One proposal focused on creating a cyberinfrastructure team that provides support to schools across the region and helps educate those interested in getting access to cyberinfrastructure.”</p>
<p>The other proposal submitted to the NSF is a planning grant that collects information from research and education groups located at partner campuses about the challenges faced when sharing resources and data within multi-institution collaborative projects. “This grant will allow us to formalize seven different working groups focused on various parts of the ERN and tie them together to give us a clearer direction,” shares von Oehsen. “As a collaborative group, we can lay a foundation for where we want to go and how we can better support the research community.”</p>
<p>Identifying the Challenges </p>
<p>The ERN will continue to have conversations with key stakeholders within the community to learn about the challenges they are facing when conducting collaborative research. Based on this knowledge, the consortium will build services and capabilities that help solves these problems. “The planning grant includes talking to researchers, CIOs, Vice Presidents of Research, provosts, deans, chairs of departments, and IT organizations,” says von Oehsen. “We will run a series of workshops that conduct a deeper dive into topics that resulted from the all-hands meeting, collect information, pull together position papers and lessons learned, and create action items to share with the community. Once we gather all this information, we can create several grant proposals that we plan to submit for future funding of the ERN.”</p>
<p>One working group, Broadening the Reach, includes researchers, educators, regional network providers, and senior administrators from under-resourced campuses, including MSIs, HSIs, HBCUs, and EPSCoR institutions.This NSF-funded project aims to learn directly from this community on how best to support their research and education needs through access to research computing and data, core facilities, and expertise. “There are well over 2,000 colleges and universities in the northeast, and most of them are under-resourced,” shares von Oehsen. “Broadening the Reach is focused on gaining a better understanding of these institutions and what resources their students need access to in order for them to become more competitive within the workforce. The goal of the group is to bring people together from both the administrative and the research and education side of the university along with members of the ERN community and exchange experience and insight. Even amid the challenges brought on by COVID, we’re finding virtual meetings are allowing more of the community to attend and interact, helping in fact, to broaden the reach to a greater number of institutions.”</p>
<p>Gathering Input and Insight</p>
<p>As the ERN further expands distributed federated services that span multiple campuses, an understanding of data sharing policies is essential. Among the ERN working groups is one focused on campus policies and agreements. “This group makes us stand out from other organizations because policy is often an afterthought,” says von Oehsen. “We’re inviting people from the community to share with us the policies they have in place. We meet with those who are responsible for writing these agreements and use this information as we build out services to connect our campuses.”</p>
<p>Among the working groups, one committee concentrates on architecture and federation and collecting information from all the other working groups. They then use this compiled information to create a design of what the ERN infrastructure will look like going forward. “This process is a very daunting task, but the group of highly intelligent, technical people is successfully working through the details,” says von Oehsen. “We have made a lot of headway on the design and building our workflow diagrams of how certain systems will be connected.”</p>
<p>Above all else, von Oehsen says the people using the environment are the most important part of further advancing the ERN and creating a next-generation platform. “Three of our working groups are focused on research and education including structural biology, materials discovery, and computer science. We felt that if we understood the challenges related to these areas, we could develop solutions that have the broadest impact in helping researchers be more productive in conducting their research by offering a collaborative environment that benefits the greater community.”</p>
<p>The computer science working group will lead experimentation and cutting-edge innovation, helping the ERN build effective and transformative test beds within their environment. The structural biology and materials discovery working groups will learn from these research communities on challenges they face with collaborative research, including accessing core facilities and research computing and data services. “These groups generate incredible amounts of data and they are a very well-connected community,” says von Oehsen. “They struggle with how to share their data, both nationally and internationally, and giving other researchers access to their instruments. We believe if the ERN can create solutions for these three research communities, all disciplines across the community will benefit.”</p>
<p>The seventh working group advocates for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the research community and attracting a wider group of individuals to STEM fields. “We are looking at how different universities are promoting diversity and inclusion on their campuses and using that as a foundation to build upon in our own community,” shares von Oehsen. “We also want to educate and excite students about STEM and the career paths available to them. This group will have a huge impact on the future of the ERN and we’re excited to see the positive change that we can accomplish as a larger community.”</p>

		 
	 
   
			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	  
		 
			 
				
	 
		 
			  “Edge’s commitment to advancing research and education is clear, especially with Dr. Forough Ghahramani joining the team. Not many RENs have a person dedicated to research in the community. Dr. Ghahramani coming on board was perfect timing for all of us, since so much is changing across the industry. Having somebody on the team from a research background is so beneficial and she has been a wonderful partner in facilitating conversations across the state. Other RENs have reached out to Edge to better understand her role and how they can replicate these responsibilities, because many are realizing they have been more focused on education than on research.”

			<p>Expanding Network Connectivity </p>
<p>The ERN leverages the special relationship between researchers and the people who build and support research cyberinfrastructure in the region that it serves. Within the ERN, ten research and education networks (REN) play an important role in connecting institutions across the region. “The RENs are on the frontline and are vital to helping us connect to our region’s schools,” explains von Oehsen. “By leveraging the relationships that RENs have with many of the colleges and universities, especially the under-resourced institutions, the ERN can better understand how to interact with non-R1 research institutions within our area.”</p>
<p>As the ERN moves forward, the consortium is exploring ways to improve connectivity between RENs to build a faster network layer that expands to other areas of the country. On board with helping achieve this mission, Edge is dedicated to creating access to advanced computing resources and expanding research connectivity to institutions in the area and beyond. “Edge’s commitment to advancing research and education is clear, especially with Dr. Forough Ghahramani joining the team,” says von Oehsen. “Not many RENs have a person dedicated to research in the community. Dr. Ghahramani coming on board was perfect timing for all of us, since so much is changing across the industry. Having somebody on the team from a research background is so beneficial and she has been a wonderful partner in facilitating conversations across the state. Other RENs have reached out to Edge to better understand her role and how they can replicate these responsibilities, because many are realizing they have been more focused on education than on research.”</p>
<p>Enabling Cutting-Edge Discovery</p>
<p>After meeting Jack Brassil from Princeton University at a conference, von Oehsen kept in touch with him as they developed research platforms at their individual campuses and discussed how they could connect their two test bed environments to create a New Jersey-wide advanced networking and edge test bed. “The test bed we built at Rutgers is a 100-gigabit, fully programmable network that spans all our campuses, we now have advanced networking that extends down to Camden, Piscataway, and New Brunswick, and up to Newark,” explains von Oehsen. “With Princeton and Rutgers both being partnered with Edge, this collaboration allows us to find a way forward in connecting our experimental research network and edge testbeds at our two universities and have this network span more of the state.”</p>
<p>Both Princeton and Rutgers are partners in a newly-funded project, FABRIC, to help create a nationwide research infrastructure that enables the computer science and networking community to develop and test novel architectures. “Rutgers campuses connect through a mix of Rutgers-owned fiber and Edge fiber, with Princeton having the same set-up,” says von Oehsen. “With Edge as a central piece, tying together Rutgers and Princeton’s research networks will be much easier and we can ensure the enterprise network on our campuses is kept separate from the research network—allowing more cutting-edge discovery and innovation.”</p>
<p>Finding New Opportunities </p>
<p>Similar to countless industries around the globe, the research community has been greatly affected by COVID-19 and the constraints the pandemic has put on their day-to-day activities. “Our workload at Rutgers has tripled as we try to help our researchers maintain the momentum of their projects prior to the pandemic,” shares von Oehsen. “Our faculty members who tend to conduct experimental research were not allowed access to their labs to run experiments, so we helped them transition from experimental research to using mathematical modeling and simulation in order to continue with their research activities. This was challenging for both the researchers and the OARC team and required a lot of training and education on how best to use our research computing and data resources.”</p>
<p>As campuses closed, many students were also struggling to access computers and the software needed to complete their coursework. “We received close to a thousand student requests for accounts on our high-performance computing resource,” says von Oehsen. “The system was designed for research, not education, so this was a real clash between services; the students trying to do their homework were taking away from the people conducting research. Finding a solution that served both communities was a huge undertaking, plus students required training as well to understand the environment.”</p>
<p>Like many campuses, Rutgers moved to virtual learning and had to quickly adapt the network and infrastructure to accommodate increased activity. “As the University moved to remote classes, our faculty members moved much of their classwork into our compute environment and because they liked the virtual desktop environment that we created for the research community. Unfortunately, this environment was not designed for a classroom,” explains van Oehsen. “We’ve had to quickly streamline our processes to meet these new demands. Working through such a stressful situation is difficult, but communication and transparency between all of our teams and the education community was key to meeting the challenge. Sometimes a crisis forces change. The question is, do we give up or do we see this challenge as an opportunity? Our institution has chosen to view this time as a chance to positively change how we do things and discover new ways to better serve and support our students, faculty, and researchers in the months and years ahead.”</p>

<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dLij9K4ObYY">Joe Shields</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dLij9K4ObYY">Unsplash</a><p>Everyone is talking about self-sovereign identities (SSIs) and how they allow users to control their data and identity. We at Energy Web believe that this is only the first step in the journey to a decentralized application landscape.</p><p>Indeed, being able to authenticate with a certificate has been possible for a long time now but it has never been widely adopted due to technical limitations. Until recently, there’s been the need to create centralized public key infrastructure systems—with a key shortcoming being that one certificate would only give you access to one application. So while the identity might remain self-sovereign to the ID owner, it still lacks the efficiency of a more-decentralized system in which a master ID ‘passport’ could be used seamlessly across multiple&nbsp;apps.</p><p>This is because most implementations of SSI focus on the authentication portion. This is the first step and a mandatory one. But as long as there is no standardized manner to exchange profile data, this will only be a global certificate system, allowing passwordless login but not permission management. This is what we want to change with <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">Energy Web Switchboard</a>, our <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-unveils-ew-switchboard-2f71bc82daa0">recently released</a> one-stop solution for access management.</p> Requirements <p>A permission management system—or Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)—is the basis for every Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. It fulfills three basic functions:</p>  Authentication: Verify that the user is in possession of the credentials (in our case, the private&nbsp;key).  Authorization: List the roles that have been assigned to the user in order to do Role-Based Access Control&nbsp;(RBAC).  Accounting&nbsp;: Keep a log of the operations performed by the&nbsp;user.  <p>In order to create a decentralized version of IAM we have to enable the above functionality, while at the same time make sure our system has the following properties:</p>  Censorship Resistance: A user can use their credentials whenever they&nbsp;want.  Data Confidentiality: It must not be possible to list the users who have access to a specific&nbsp;system.  Decentralized Infrastructure: Nodes must not be able to misbehave; either they perform correctly or not at&nbsp;all.  <p>Let’s look at each one of these requirements in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Censorship resistance <p>When using a centralized system like Google or Facebook, these entities have complete control over the data that your application receives. They have little incentive to withhold information from you specifically but they could if they wanted to. And as we don’t know their motives, it is difficult to assess the probability of this occurring. Even in a system like OpenID, there is an administrator for the database and unless that administrator is you, their interests might diverge from&nbsp;yours.</p><p>Being resistant to censorship means that there is no actor in the system that has the power to selectively limit the information other actors have access to. In other words, everyone has access to the same information at the same time and there is nothing the creator of the information (or anybody else) can do about&nbsp;it.</p><p>This matters because there are a few data points that you do not want to be withheld from you when using an IAM system. You must know as soon as possible:</p>  If a permission has been revoked. You would not want to give access to someone who should not have&nbsp;it.  If a key has been invalidated. If a key has been compromised, all the permissions granted by it should be revoked or it should not be able to authenticate anymore.  If a permission has been granted. Once a permission has been granted, it must be possible to verify it every time it is presented.  <p>A blockchain fulfills these requirements by design. Since the state is kept in sync over all the participating nodes, once something has been published, it is either known to all or none of the nodes. Additionally, the cryptographic proofs contained in the transactions allow the offline verification of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>This is why all the permissions are anchored on chain. The descriptions of roles are held in an ENS smart-contract; the successful granting of a permission is noted in the DID document of the user. Each user holds their credentials and is the only one to have unrestricted access to that&nbsp;data.</p> Confidentiality <p>As an application developer, I don’t want the world to be able to make a list of my app’s users and even less, a list by roles. It is therefore crucial that when a user is granted a role, this event not be made&nbsp;public.</p><p>Centralized systems are not terrible in this use case, as they will not disclose your information to third parties but they themselves will record all the activities of your users. This is a feature of the platform. It is a tradeoff you’re willing to make in order to give convenience to your&nbsp;users.</p><p>In the EW Switchboard solution, no third party has the full list of users of an application. This is guaranteed by the permission-granting process:</p><p>What we’d like to highlight in this simplified process is the fact that it is the user who stores the claim and anchors it on chain. Also, because it is a private claim, the contents are provable but not disclosed. The user can therefore prove that they have been granted a certain privilege, but unless they elect to disclose this information, it is impossible for a third party to find&nbsp;out.</p><p>And as the users must anchor the claim on-chain themselves, there is no opportunity for an observer to make a list of the addresses added to a particular smart contract or any other indirect way to observe the activities of the IAM. The only information an observer can garner is that the user has added a claim to their DID document but not the content, origin, or nature of the&nbsp;claim.</p> Decentralized infrastructure <p>We have mentioned the Energy Web Chain and <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, which are both peer to peer networks and lack a central point of control. There is one piece of infrastructure we have not mentioned yet: the message transport between&nbsp;users.</p><p>How the user and the role admin in the above sequence diagram exchange information is through a service bus: the EW-DOS messaging component. This component is decentralized in the same manner IPFS is: there is no centralized control but there is no consensus either. Each client must pick the service node they want to connect to and if this service node does not deliver the expected service, it is the responsibility of the client to connect to a different service&nbsp;node.</p><p>As every message must be signed by the sender there is no opportunity for the service provider to alter messages in transit. Either messages are delivered as received or they are rendered invalid by the update and the recipient would notice immediately. The messaging service therefore fulfills the requirement of not being able to misbehave. It either fulfills its duty correctly or not at&nbsp;all.</p> Conclusion <p>With Switchboard, we provide application developers an alternative to centralized authentication and authorization systems like OAuth with Google and Facebook or Azure Active Directory. Obviously we still have a lot of features to add in order to compete with these established services, but EW Switchboard is the first fully decentralized IAM solution.

 How Switchboard Tackles the Challenge of Enterprise Identity Management <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPxOowbR6ls">Matthew Henry</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPxOowbR6ls">Unsplash</a><p>By Ian Kelly and Nitin&nbsp;Gavhane</p><p>Nearly a decade has passed since Marc Andreeson <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">wrote</a> that software was eating the world, by which he meant that software — and ultimately the services that software and the Internet could provide — would increasingly capture value in the economy from traditional firms producing things. A list of the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">world’s largest companies by market cap</a> suggests Andreeson was right: three of the top five — Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet — are software-centric digital enterprises.</p><p>This digitalization of the global economy has spurred a new wave of Big Data, including data associated with identities. Yet for enterprises around the world, managing identities remains a major information technology challenge.</p> Challenges in enterprise identity management <p>In traditional enterprise identity management, identity data is typically highly siloed both within and across organizations, even with respect to individual business processes. Anyone who’s had to separately on-board with two more departments at a single company—such as accounts receivable, a membership department, a software tech team, and maybe a parallel business unit located in another country—knows what we’re talking&nbsp;about.</p><p>Enterprises must aggregate, share, and synchronize identity data across databases and directory services. Despite their best efforts, this is cumbersome and inconvenient at best. Plus, managing identities with traditional enterprise IT architectures like these often leads to high administrative and maintenance costs, privacy and security risks, and high compliance costs to mitigate those&nbsp;risks.</p><p>We see four key problems with the traditional approach to enterprise identity management:</p>  Low Interoperability: Centralized systems with information silos increase friction for would-be collaborators due to proprietary processes and architectures.  Expensive Verifiability: Sharing verified attributes about users and assets (such as energy market participants and distributed energy resources like electric vehicles) is time-consuming and&nbsp;costly.  Data Protection: Policymakers globally are regulating customer data privacy and ownership via new regulations such as the EU’s GDPR and the California Privacy Act. Complying with these policies using traditional IT architectures and processes—which were not designed with customer data ownership in mind—is increasing operational costs for many companies.  Security: Even when enterprises attempt to manage data responsibly, vulnerabilities in traditional software and infrastructure systems can result in compromised data.  <p>Taking a smarter approach to identity management using traditional enterprise architectures can address these challenges in part. However, a new approach to enterprise identity management that fully embraces the concept of self-sovereignty can unlock significantly more&nbsp;value.</p> Benefits of a self-sovereign approach <p>We at Energy Web believe that an enterprise identity management architecture based on <a href="https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identities</a> (SSIs) enabled by decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) presents the best solution to these challenges.</p><p>We believe that DIDs should have four essential characteristics:</p>  Decentralized: The DID-based system has no central issuing authority.  Persistent: The DID does not require the continued operation of any underlying organization.  Cryptographically verifiable: One can prove control of the&nbsp;DID.  Resolvable: One can discover metadata about the&nbsp;DID.  <p>Using DIDs and VCs to build a SSI system should address the main challenges of centralized IT approaches we described above: interoperability, verifiability, data protection, and security.</p><p>Here’s what this could look like applied to a simple example in the energy sector: managing lithium-ion batteries from cradle to grave. The system could assign a DID to each battery when manufactured and the manufacturer could issue claims regarding the battery’s model, serial number, and specifications like capacity and energy. Next, the installer of that battery could add claims related to its purchaser and location. The owner of the battery could add a claim about the transfer of ownership and, at the end of its life, the recycler of that battery could issue a final claim about its retirement. Meanwhile, during its operating lifetime, the battery could enroll via its DID in various energy markets, such as to provide grid flexibility services.</p> How EW Switchboard brings this architecture to&nbsp;life <p>We are building this system, which we call <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">EW Switchboard</a>. It allows anyone to create a decentralized identifier based on a public-private keypair, and it provides a way for application owners to manage <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digging-deeper-into-self-sovereign-identity-and-access-management-e6eefbac631e">authentication, authorization, and accounting</a> for their own apps. Like everything we do at Energy Web, it is not a product for sale but an open-source tool, designed for the needs of the energy sector but also sufficiently abstract to be applicable for any user or app owner — even those apps and services that do not use blockchain technology at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Switchboard is compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C v1.0 decentralized identifier and verifiable credentials standards</a> and is intended to accommodate a variety of approaches to digital identity. It uses a decentralized architecture, meaning that no one person or organization stores sign-in information or other user data or controls authentication or authorization. Each user remains in control over their own data and who has access to it. Thanks to WalletConnect, users can select from a <a href="https://walletconnect.org/wallets">large variety of existing wallets</a> to create their&nbsp;DIDs.</p><p>Let’s see how Switchboard works.</p><p>We host Switchboard at <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">our own website</a>, meaning that anyone can access Switchboard and use it to create and manage their own DID, enroll in applications, create a DID for their devices, or perform other tasks. Developers or owners of applications can integrate Switchboard into their own apps, using it to manage user authentication, authorization, and accounting (without the user leaving the primary app) so that they need not develop these functionalities from scratch. This latter option means that users could use their DID as a single sign-in for a variety of apps, similar to how many people use their Google or Facebook accounts for single sign-in today, but remaining in control of that DID for life and independent from any one platform. It also means that application developers can focus on other functionalities in their apps and therefore deploy&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Once a user has authenticated with Switchboard, they can then use their DID to enroll in applications. This terminology is intentional: the user registers a DID once and owns it for life, and therefore that user need not re-register a new DID every time they want to use a new application. Instead, that user authenticates with their DID and then takes on specific roles in applications.</p><p>As the owner of an application, how do you ensure that users take on the correct roles? For example, what prevents an unknown user (i.e., a DID) from enrolling as the owner of a rooftop solar PV system in your app, especially if the architecture is decentralized (meaning neither you nor any other single authority dictates who has what&nbsp;role)?</p><p>To do this, Switchboard employs a system of VCs and provides an interface for you to set the roles and role governance for your application (role governance leverages <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ethereum-name-service-ens-is-now-available-for-the-energy-web-a8d884138790">Energy Web’s Ethereum Name Service</a>). In our example above, you could use Switchboard to specify that your app includes the roles PV owner and PV installer, and that in order for a DID to enroll in your app as a PV owner that DID must have proof from a PV installer that the DID does in fact own a home with a PV system on the roof. The DID requests the installer to cryptographically sign a statement that the installer installed a PV system on that DID’s roof, and when the installer signs this statement then the DID can then present it to your app. Your app can verify that the cryptographic signature must have been added by that installer and thus allow the DID to enroll as a PV owner. Of course, you can use Switchboard to set whatever roles and requirements you wish (e.g., “a PV owner must have signed claims from the installer, the PV OEM, and from the PV owner’s distribution utility in order to enroll”).</p><p>This approach also benefits from network effects, because the verified claim is specific to the DID but not specific to the application. Continuing our example, imagine a user with a rooftop PV system wanted to enroll in someone else’s application and therefore obtained verified claims from the installer, the OEM, and the distribution utility relating to the specifications, location, and ownership of the rooftop PV system. You can, as the owner of a different application, set your app to allow any DID with those same claims to enroll as a user in your app — if the user can present the verified claims you require, it is not necessary that the user obtained those claims specifically to enroll in your app. The user does not lose the claims in the other app owner’s system, but retains them and can simply present them to your&nbsp;app.</p><p>We are releasing an <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">alpha version</a> of Switchboard now, for initial use and feedback from our community. Our intent is then to release a beta version in Q1 of 2021, with a final production version to follow. These future versions will add functionality related to asset management and incorporate Energy Web’s concurrent work with key management solutions and distributed messaging and&nbsp;storage.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/how-switchboard-tackles-the-challenge-of-enterprise-id-management-b26f995caefa">How Switchboard Tackles the Challenge of Enterprise ID Management</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The new open-source tool offers identity and access management for users, assets, and app developers in a self-sovereign era <p>Zug, Switzerland — 17 December 2020 — Today Energy Web unveiled <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">EW Switchboard</a>, the latest addition to its open-source technology stack, the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS). Switchboard is a first-of-its-kind identity and access management (IAM) tool for users, assets, and application developers in today’s growing self-sovereign approach to digital solutions. Although Energy Web developed Switchboard with a focus on the global energy sector and its foundational Energy Web Chain, Switchboard can be used in any sector and on any blockchain-based or non-blockchain digital solution.</p><p>To date, IAM solutions have been centralized, fragmented, and siloed. This presents challenges with respect to data privacy and security, lack of interoperability across systems, concerns about data persistence and censorship, and bloated administrative (e.g., reconciliation, KYC) and compliance (e.g., privacy, security) costs. Consumer-focused solutions such as Google or Facebook single sign-on and enterprise-focused solutions such as Google OAuth or Azure Active Directory have attempted to address some of these challenges. But a decentralized self-sovereign identity (SSI) approach offers a superior experience.</p><p>“This is a major landmark, not just for Energy Web’s ecosystem but for the future of open-source, decentralized technology,” explained Micha Roon, chief technology officer for Energy Web. “Universal self-sovereign identity is at the core of tomorrow’s digital solutions, from tracing an energy asset or megawatt-hour of renewable generation throughout its entire lifecycle to managing energy market and application access for enterprise users.”</p><p>SSI creates master identities for users and assets, avoiding constant duplication and always remaining in control of the user or asset owner (rather than third parties). An SSI comprises decentralized identifiers (DIDs) supported by verifiable claims (VCs). For example, a residential battery energy storage system manufacturer may create a DID for each battery that rolls off its production line. The manufacturer then might transfer ownership of a particular DID to a homeowner that installs a battery system at their residence, while the battery installer and the local grid operator both might attest to VCs about the battery’s capacity, location, and other&nbsp;details.</p><p>But until EW Switchboard, no organization had developed a full IAM solution that leverages SSI, DIDs, and VCs for authentication, authorization (such as for role-based access management in applications), and accounting (for logging user activity history).</p><p>“In the 20th century, an analog switchboard allowed an operator to plug and unplug various inputs and outputs, interconnecting a variety of users and endpoints. EW Switchboard is the modern, 21st century equivalent. We’ve replaced the operator with a decentralized system of autonomous self-sovereign identities, interconnecting various users, assets, and applications,” said Mani Hagh Sefat, solution architect at Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>For users, Switchboard enables them to manage their core identity and associated verifiable claims, their assets (such as solar panels, thermostats, electric vehicles, and batteries), and their enrollment in various applications and digital services (such as messaging and storage). For application developers, Switchboard enables them to define user roles and associated permissions, authorize users and assets, and log user operations.</p><p>The alpha version of EW Switchboard is <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">available now</a>, for initial use and feedback from the community.

<p>Standard terminology for emergency events developed for use in alerting systems to help with interpretation and interoperability</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce publication of Event Terms List Version 1.0, a Committee Note from the members of the OASIS Emergency Management TC [1].</p>



<p>The variety of practices employed regarding &lt;event&gt; types in Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) messages makes it difficult to compare messages from different sources. The problem has been presented as an interoperability issue where some consumers of CAP struggle to compare differences in language and meaning of the terms used in the &lt;event&gt; element in CAP.</p>



<p>The &lt;event&gt; element is the focus for this Committee Note, as it is the only required element in CAP directly associated with the subject event for a CAP message. Aligning practices surrounding this element, as opposed to other possible candidate elements, is the choice adopted in this work product for addressing this interoperability concern.</p>

<p>Public review of latest version of UBL runs through December 29th</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.3 from the UBL TC [1] is now available for public review and comment. This is the fourth public review for Universal Business Language v2.3.</p>



<p>UBL is the leading interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes. The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:</p>



  A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.  A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.  A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.  



<p>UBL v2.3 is a minor revision to v2.2 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 91.</p>

<p>By Simone Hill, Senior Manager, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>.<p>In June, <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">Omidyar Network committed $500,000 to organizations fighting on the frontlines for racial justice</a> because we firmly believe that this work is core to our ability to create inclusive, equitable societies. While the funding is an essential step toward our vision, the way we invested was also critical to developing thoughtful partnerships with organizations already building or scaling innovations.</p><p>What does it mean to invest in justice? It begins with a clear-eyed recognition of the systemic racism that manifests within all of our systems to undermine the safety of Black and Brown people. Investing in justice means attacking the many resulting symptoms of white supremacy at their root by finding organizations working to innovate and advance holistic ways to create lasting change. It means being strategic and careful about ensuring that while we are looking for ways to address the wrongs that pervade our societies, we are not inadvertently causing more harm. With that, an awareness of our own limitations as a funder is required –– financial investments are a step at the beginning of a long-term journey towards holistic, strategic action. Finally, investing in justice means continuing to integrate racial justice with our firm-wide focus to reimagine systems: building an economy that works for all — an anti-racist economy is a <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">key pillar of our point of view</a>; realizing the promise of responsible technology; and fostering a more pluralistic society.</p><p>We searched around the country for Black-led organizations whose work combined economic, civic, or criminal justice reform with narrative shift or movement building towards racial justice. Among many organizations doing incredible work, the following five are achieving impact in ways that align with our current strategic focus.</p> Large Scale Change, Powered by Deep Networks: <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a> <p>Spearheaded by three dynamic women of color, the Insight Center for Community Economic Development has developed the <a href="https://medium.com/economicsecproj/centering-blackness-the-path-to-economic-liberation-for-all-f6c2c7398281">Centering Blackness Initiative</a>; a lens to identify how and where economic policies, practices, and institutions harm Black&nbsp;people.</p>Graphic illustration from Insight Center’s Power Learning Community<p>A multi-pronged approach to systemic change, the Initiative is a new framework for examining and reimagining systems. It is accompanied by a set of tools, currently in development, to encourage multiracial, progressive organizations to adopt the framework. Not only will organizations be supported to develop new internal operations through this lens, but they can also adopt it for their policy advocacy campaigns.</p><p>Because narrative shift is a critical component of the Centering Blackness Initiative, the Insight Center has also launched the <a href="https://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">Black Thought Project</a> to create safe spaces in cities that center, celebrate, and protect Black thoughts and expression.</p>Black Thought Project installation <a href="http://www.blackthoughtproject.com/">www.blackthoughtproject.com</a> Systems Change in the Informal Economy: <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> <p>“Black informal workers are resilient and creative, and they have constructed an informal economy to acquire a means of subsistence,” — Richard Wallace, founder, and director of <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">Equity &amp; Transformation</a> (EAT).</p>(Right) Richard Wallace, Founder and director of&nbsp;EAT<p>Founded in 2018, EAT is the only organization in the United States, specifically focused on protecting and uplifting Black workers operating in the informal economy. Defined as a set of unregulated economic activities, the informal economy includes street vending, childcare, auto-mechanic, and moving services — activities which allow people who cannot find standard employment to make a living, but without the protection of formal labor standards.</p><p>While EAT’s work includes research and policy development to destigmatize the informal economy, the organization also educates workers about their protections. EAT spearheads and collaborates on campaigns across Chicago to improve the lives of Black workers in the informal economy. The Guaranteed Income Project, for instance, provides previously incarcerated individuals with $500 per month to help cover their bills, find homes, and ultimately, reduce recidivism.</p>EAT <a href="http://www.eatchicago.org/">www.eatchicago.org</a> Building Power through Black Leadership: <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> <p>Black leadership is critical to the success of racial and economic justice movements, but while BIPOC are often the implementers of social change campaigns, they rarely drive the strategies that energize these movements. The <a href="https://www.jwj.org/our-work/absi">Advancing Black Strategists Initiative</a> (ABSI)—a joint project led by The Jobs With Justice Education Fund, in collaboration with the Black Worker Initiative at the Institute for Policy Studies and Morehouse College—is raising a cohort of Black economic-justice and labor-focused strategists to lead, develop, and advance policies and campaigns.</p><p>ABSI will provide the tools and knowledge to equip Black strategists to work from the strength of their lived experiences, to inspire participation and engagement around polices that center Black economic justice. As this new generation of Black leaders takes on bigger roles and builds and wields power across movements, they will ultimately strengthen Black institutions, advance economic democracy, and change the socio-economic conditions of the Black community.</p> Narrative Shift at the Intersection of Race and Technology: <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet&nbsp;Enquiry</a> <p>While technology permeates our everyday lives, it is another system where built-in white supremacy limits both usage and accessibility by Black&nbsp;people.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet Enquiry</a> (a newly-founded interdisciplinary research center at UCLA) aims to use art and storytelling to reimagine technology, and in the process, champion racial justice, reframe our understanding of the role of technology in our lives, and strengthen democracy by holding those who create unjust systems and technologies accountable.</p><p>Over the next year, artist-in-residence, film-maker <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7307049">Oge Egbounu</a>, will work alongside the center’s co-directors and racial justice lead, to translate the center’s work into cultural artifacts that can resonate with a broad audience. This project creates a unique opportunity to develop cultural artifacts grounded in the center’s research that can shift narratives for mass audiences and tech workers alike, to more intentionally use and create technology in ways that do not harm&nbsp;others.</p> A Clear Path Forward: <a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black&nbsp;Lives</a> <p><a href="https://m4bl.org/">Movement for Black Lives</a> has a courageous vision: a long-term plan to shift the consciousness toward racial reckoning, and an ability to chart a clear path towards their goal. Fiscally sponsored by the Common Counsel Foundation, the Movement for Black Lives’ Black Power Rising: Vision 2024 seeks to build the social, political, institutional, and collective power of Black people by harnessing the collective power and creativity of Black people. Grounded in Black culture, the initiative aims to bring an informed electorate to the table to drive anti-racist policy&nbsp;shifts.</p><p>This strategic five-year plan will guide the coalition’s programmatic and campaign efforts to build mass support for progressive policies that center the needs of Black people. A core part of this work will equip local leaders with tools and strategies to build power within and between their organizations, scale engagement around political participation, and attack white supremacy by ensuring political representation and leadership, especially in Black communities.</p>Illustration by <a href="https://www.tiphughes.com/">Tiffany&nbsp;Hughes</a>. Restorative Justice Requires Restorative Investment <p>Why invest specifically in narrative shifting, and power-building in the intersections between movements, institutions, and Black leadership? Why look for spaces that prioritize economic justice in underfunded regions? Because we believe that this is where organizations are creating innovative, holistic solutions to specific problems that will generate the most significant returns.</p><p>In the course of identifying these organizations, we collaborated with five of our sister organizations within <a href="https://www.omidyargroup.com/">The Omidyar Group</a> —<a href="https://democracyfund.org/"> Democracy Fund</a>, <a href="https://flourishventures.com/">Flourish</a>, <a href="https://humanityunited.org/">Humanity United</a>, <a href="https://www.imaginablefutures.com/">Imaginable Futures</a>, and <a href="https://luminategroup.com/">Luminate</a> — to jointly fund two regranting organizations focused on supporting grassroots racial justice groups. Emergent Fund (a fiscally sponsored project of Amalgamated Charitable Foundation) quickly moves no strings attached resources to communities of color under attack by federal policies and priorities. Liberated Capital Fund of the Decolonizing Wealth Project (fiscally sponsored by Allied Media Projects) provides unrestricted resources through a reparations model to Black and Indigenous-led organizations to shape a future where we can all heal from generations of colonial trauma. As a result of the substantial work we’ve seen around the country, we will have exceeded our initial goal and invested a total of $1,050,000.</p><p>We believe that these investments are a significant step towards creating the world we are advancing toward in our mission as an organization. But this is only a first step. We are committed to building true partnerships with these organizations, putting our relevant resources at their disposal, and amplifying their work to a broader audience of both practitioners and funders. Investing in justice means much more than dollars; it is a whole-hearted commitment by our institution.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/an-investment-in-justice-bad462284f27">An Investment in Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Sexual Ethics, Tech Design &amp; Decoding&nbsp;Stigma <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/zahra-stardust">Zahra Stardust</a>, <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/about/directory/itp/140841747">Gabriella Garcia</a> and <a href="https://anthro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/egwuatu2">Chibundo Egwuatu</a> <br>With thanks to <a href="https://livia-foldes.com/">Livia Foldes</a> &amp; <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/">Danielle Blunt</a>. Images by <a href="https://decodingstigma.tech/">Decoding&nbsp;Stigma</a>.</p><p>What would tech look if it was designed by sex workers? What values would be embedded into the&nbsp;design?</p><p>A new collective, <a href="https://decodingstigma.tech/">Decoding Stigma</a>, is hoping to find the answer by bridging the gap between sex work, technology, and academia. The goals are twofold: to prioritize sexual autonomy as a necessary ethics question for researchers and technologists and to design a liberatory future in which sexually stigmatized voices are amplified and celebrated.</p><p>Decoding Stigma is the continuation of research presented by Gabriella Garcia at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University. Garcia’s thesis, <a href="https://itp.nyu.edu/thesis2020/students/gabriella-m-garcia">Shift Control, End Delete: Encoded Stigma</a>, which she explains in detail <a href="https://vimeo.com/425306305">here</a>, explores how whorephobia becomes encoded in tech design, despite the historically co-constitutive relationship between sexual labor and the development of digital&nbsp;media.</p><p>The <a href="http://patchenbarss.com/major-works/the-erotic-engine/">distribution of sexual material fiscally supported</a> the historical development of communications technology, from the emergence of photography, home video, to even cable TV as the sexual revolution of the 1970s collided with more affordable means of film production and the birth of public-access television. Money made in the erotic market of 1980s proto-internet bulletin board systems (BBSs) literally paid for the material infrastructure that paved the path toward the world wide web before mainstream consumer adoption could even be taken into consideration.</p><p>As necessary innovators, sex workers are consistently early adopters of new technologies, designing, coding, building, and using websites and cryptocurrencies to advertise. In our time of internet ubiquity, sex workers often <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2020/09/rich-famous-onlyfans-changing-sex-workers-left-behind-bella-thorne-caroline-calloway-beyonce">build up the commercial bases of platforms</a>, populating content and increasing their size and commercial viability, only to later be excised and treated as <a href="https://theconversation.com/sexual-subcultures-are-collateral-damage-in-tumblrs-ban-on-adult-content-108169">collateral damage</a> when those same platforms introduce policies to remove sex entirely.</p><p>Now, overarching policies that prohibit sexual communication, expression, and solicitation are commonplace. While some have responded to legislation such as <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SSRN-id36638982.pdf">FOSTA/SESTA</a> that prohibits the promotion or facilitation of prostitution, many of these policies go far beyond what is legally required. When Apple, the first company to “put the internet in everyone’s pocket,” <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#physical-harm">prohibited explicit content</a> under its “Safety” conditions for third-party app developers, it fundamentally equated erotic material with torture, bigotry, and physical harm. As growing numbers of people are accessing their news and information via mobile (and thus via app), content must increasingly pass Apple’s Terms and Conditions as a point of market viability.</p><p>With algorithms to detect sexual content by picking up particular words, emojis, and hashtags and recognition software that scans for nudity, body parts, and skin patches, sex is under increasing surveillance. And yet algorithms are notoriously poor at understanding sex in context. Algorithmic bias and regulatory overreach <a href="https://saltyworld.net/algorithmicbiasreport-2/">disproportionately affect sex workers</a>, even where the activities may be&nbsp;lawful.</p><p>With a lack of forums to openly advertise, share safety and screening tips, to discuss harm reduction materials or simply to find community, these policies can put sex workers in danger and have a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-70660-3_9">chilling effect</a> on the kinds of sexualities that are visible and critical sexual conversations that are speakable.</p><p>Algorithmic profiling has resulted in account shutdowns and <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/posting-into-the-void-content-moderation/">shadowbanning of sex worker activists</a>. Malicious flagging is also employed as a user strategy to deplatform and displace sex workers. Suspensions, bans, digital gentrification, and lack of access put sex workers in precarious positions and acts as barriers to participation in online space and digital economies, posing a threat to our livelihoods. Barred from using marketing tools like other workers, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html">financial discrimination</a> is rife, where payment processes ban sex workers entirely or deemed sex work at ‘high risk’ of fraud and chargebacks.</p><p>At the same time as this erasure, surveillance technologies are capturing sex workers’ data and misusing it. Legal name policies, requirements to upload photographic identification, the use of facial recognition software by payment processors, and social media functions that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/facebook-sex-workers-stalkers-risk-danger-social-media-online-a8004446.html">‘out’ sex workers</a> to clients all heighten risks for sex workers. The mining, sharing, and sale of data pose risks for sex workers being detected by law enforcement or facing increased immigration scrutiny, detention, or deportation.</p><p>Early tech exploitation of sex workers as internet infrastructure builders has now been surpassed by the development of carceral technologies to monitor sex worker behaviour. To Big Tech, the sex worker is as indispensable as they are disposable.</p><p>It’s with all this in mind that Decoding Stigma formed. Joining up with <a href="https://livia-foldes.com/">Livia Foldes</a> of Parsons School of Design at the New School and Danielle Blunt of autonomous collective <a href="https://hackinghustling.org/">Hacking//Hustling</a> as the group’s core infrastructure, Decoding Stigma have mobilised a group of critical sex thinkers — an interdisciplinary, cross-institutional mix of folk across tech, design, law, public health, gender studies, computer science, anthropology, and clinical social work — to deconstruct and re-generate the relationship between sex and&nbsp;tech.</p><p>Part of this agenda involves cultivating an ongoing <a href="https://decodingstigma.tech/resources.html">open-source syllabus</a> that serves as a ‘living learning hub of readings, resources, citable research, articles, and teaching toolkits’, for which the group plans to hold a live edit-a-thon.</p><p>Since its inception this Fall, Decoding Stigma has also been participating in workshops on <a href="https://cscw2020datafeminism.wordpress.com/">data feminism and equitable participatory design</a> and presenting to students as part of Melanie Hoff’s <a href="https://cyberneticsofsex.melaniehoff.com/2020/10/19/syllabus/">Cybernetics of Sex</a> class, which explores what automatic control systems teach us about&nbsp;sex.</p><p>In November, the group held its first interactive workshop ‘<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fighting-surveillance-tech-with-trademark-transparency-tickets-126905819723">Fighting Surveillance Tech with Trademark Transparency</a>’ in collaboration with <a href="https://www.levendowski.net/">Amanda Levendowski</a> and <a href="https://kendraalbert.com/">Kendra Albert</a>, which explored how sex workers could search trademark disclosure databases to identify the development of new surveillance technologies that could threaten sex worker privacy, safety, and livelihoods.</p><p>In December, Decoding Stigma will host a workshop with <a href="https://www.schock.cc/">Sasha Costanza-Chock</a> of <a href="https://www.transfeministech.codingrights.org/">TransFeministTech</a> and J<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/joana-varon">oana Varon</a> of <a href="https://www.codingrights.org/">Coding Rights</a> for its first “<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/freedom-to-fcking-dream-designing-a-sex-worker-friendly-future-tickets-132323022723">Freedom to F*cking Dream</a>” workshop, which will invite sex workers and allies to envision a future where technology is built by sex&nbsp;workers.</p><p>This will be a jumping-off point for a series of conversations led by <a href="https://anthro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/egwuatu2">Chibundo Egwuatu</a>, whose doctoral research centers black sex worker activism, de/criminalization, and liberation. Because of the global and growing nature of displacement, exclusion, and disappearance of sex workers from digital space, these conversations will connect activists working and organizing around the futurity of tech and sex work across the digital divide and across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>These are just some of many steps Decoding Stigma is taking towards achieving a future of tech where sex workers can see ourselves, each other, and our communities thrive.</p><p>Taking a sex worker lens to tech is not simply about involving more sex workers in tech design, although the infiltration of sex workers into this space will no doubt shift the kinds of technologies that are imagined and built. These are fundamental questions about ethical design, participation, access, privacy, surveillance, violence, and re-visioning new&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>What would tech look like if it was designed by sex workers? Stay tuned and you might just find&nbsp;out.</p><p>To donate finances, skill-sets or other resources, propose a collaboration or workshop, or simply to join the conversation, visit <a href="http://www.decodingstigma.tech/">Decoding&nbsp;Stigma</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/what-can-tech-learn-from-sex-workers-8e0100f0b4b9">What can tech learn from sex workers?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the last DINZ newsletter of the 2020 (Gregorian) calendar year. Recognising that as with ideas of identity, our marking of time and seasons is very much based on our cultural and sometimes geographical context.&nbsp;We’ll avoid the temptation to contemplate fake snow and warmly-clothed grey bearded characters, and instead focus on things such as the beautiful pōhutukawa bringing colour and joy to our Aotearoa landscape.<br>&nbsp;<br>Reflecting on the theme of international diversity and context, we welcome you all to appreciate and share the video session&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/biasmlopes/?originalSubdomain=dk">Bianca Lopes</a>&nbsp;prepared for our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/12/07/aotearoa-digital-identity-hui-taumata-2/">November Aotearoa Digital Identity Hui</a>.&nbsp;In it she explored how five different countries have tackled the opportunities and challenges of developing digital identity ecosystems. It’s a great reminder of the importance of cultural context, and was a perfect springboard for our kapa kōrero session exploring identity from a Te Ao Māori perspective.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the same&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/12/07/aotearoa-digital-identity-hui-taumata-2/">link</a>&nbsp;you can also watch an up-to-the minute update of the work of the Digital Identity Transition Programme, featuring Director Alan Bell and Emma O’Connell.&nbsp;We are excited about the ecosystem potential as a New Zealand Trust Framework and accreditation system starts to take shape.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our Annual Meeting was last week, and we had the pleasure of congratulating and welcoming our newly-elected Executive Council members Russell Craig (Microsoft), Sat Mandri (JNCTN) and John Evans (TSB), and the re-elected Luke McIntyre (Mattr).&nbsp;You can view the full Council&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Looking ahead to 2021<br>A number of you have been participating in our workshop sessions on AML Reliance and Trust and Identity Research and Education. We will be continuing with this collaborative, initiative-based approach into the New Year, phasing out our old working group structure.&nbsp;<br><br>We are very conscious that there is a big information gap between those on the ‘inside’ of all things digital identity and those at the other ends of the solutions. This includes&nbsp; individual and community service users, as well as a raft of commercial and community businesses and organisations for whom information and identity management is critical. Closing the gap will be a major focus for us in 2021, and we will be asking you to join us in that endeavour.<br><br>Introducing the New Zealand Tech and Innovation Story<br>I’d also like to make a mention of an exciting new programme that NZTech is leading. The New Zealand Tech and Innovation Story is a marketing initiative that will be designed to promote and enhance our international reputation for delivering world-class solutions and present New Zealand as a compelling place for tech talent and investment.&nbsp;But to get started, we need your help!<br><br>If you could take 10 minutes to complete&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/THJJXNN">this survey</a>&nbsp;it would be greatly appreciated (please feel free to share amongst your network also).</p>



<p>By completing the&nbsp;survey, you are playing a part in helping shape the narrative and the way we promote New Zealand’s tech and innovation capabilities internationally. The survey findings will be shared and will help form an integral part of developing the story we tell to the world.<br><br>A Christmas wrap<br>Finally, some Christmas good-giving inspiration for you from the&nbsp;<a href="https://thegoodregistry.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=b6e92d96f6ff002bd992c7de3&amp;id=3f391eb51d&amp;e=ea906af905">Good Registry.</a><a href="https://thegoodregistry.com/pages/why-good-gift-cards">Good Gift Cards</a>&nbsp;are a wonderful way to unlock the joy of generous giving to Aotearoa charities, a beautiful gift of giving!</p>

 How do we build a world we’ve never seen before? We must change who drives the&nbsp;future. Illustration by Superside<p>By Eshanthi Ranasinghe and David Hsu, Exploration &amp; Future Sensing, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Every day we take steps which carry our attitudes and assumptions about the future. Our steps can be fearful and cautious. They can also be bold leaps made out of clear-eyed hope and raw necessity.</p><p>In this year of concurrent crises and collapses, when many ways forward seem possible, the challenge is to critically discern between pathways which wind up leading back to a broken “normal” and pathways which lead us into a future we have never seen before — one that is more equitable, just, and beautiful.<br> <br>At Omidyar Network, this kind of discernment is vital to our mission of <a href="https://omidyar.com/#focusareas">reimagining systems that shape our daily lives</a>: building an economy that works for all, realizing the promise of responsible technology, and fostering a more pluralistic society. We launched the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/exploration-and-future-sensing-ac4ef4ae302e">Exploration &amp; Future Sensing</a> unit in 2019 to help achieve this mission. Building upon years of prior experimentation, the unit peers beyond what we know and see today by scanning for signals of change, investigating emerging trends, using scenarios to shake old patterns of thinking, and activating new collaborations. <br> <br>Much of our exploration revolves around the question: When uncertainty abounds, how do we move beyond our own biases and blind spots to build a world we’ve never seen before? <br> <br>The short answer is that we turn to community. We must center people with experience living in between worlds, or on the margins, who have honed an extraordinary capacity for imagining and building futures that are more beautiful and resilient. They’re people who have crossed cultures, borders, and identities. They have learned to live in the future and navigate its uncertain terrain often out of necessity.</p><blockquote>When uncertainty abounds, how do we move beyond our own biases and blind spots to build a world we’ve never seen before? We turn to community. We must center people with experience living in between worlds or on the margins, who have honed an extraordinary capacity for imagining and building futures that are more beautiful and resilient.</blockquote><p>In the process of engaging with a variety of foresight methods, creative approaches, and practitioner communities, we’re finding a growing group of partners and collaborators who embody a new wave of future thinking for social change. Their talent for exploring alternative futures comes from asking not just what the future could hold but also who thrives in it and how we will take action to get there together. Instead of simply extrapolating from existing systems, these alternative futurists are rooted in transformative visions of equity, access, belonging, and justice.<br> <br>It’s never been more critical to support and partner with people who are thinking more courageously and hopefully about the future. Here are four such efforts Omidyar Network Exploration &amp; Future Sensing is honored to&nbsp;support.</p> Radical Imagination with Angela Glover Blackwell <p>This podcast is a window to a more equitable future where guaranteed income, reparations, and open borders, are real possibilities.</p><p>Angela Glover Blackwell doesn’t call herself a futurist. She doesn’t issue forecasts about what 2030 and 2050 will hold. Instead, she has a remarkable track record of sensing what we need today to achieve a more equitable tomorrow, and telling stories that invite more people into that new world of possibility. After founding and leading <a href="https://www.policylink.org/">PolicyLink</a> for the past 20 years, Angela launched the <a href="https://radicalimagination.us/">Radical Imagination</a> podcast. Now entering its third season, Angela features bold innovators who remind us that change is already happening. Past episodes include conversations with Chief August Creppel on climate migration; Mélisande Short-Colomb and Ana Lucia Araujo on reparations; Walidah Imarisha on storytelling and organizing; and Tiq Milan on&nbsp;gender.</p>Angela Glover Blackwell, <a href="https://www.policylink.org/">PolicyLink</a> Founder-in-Residence and host of the <a href="https://radicalimagination.us/">Radical Imagination</a> podcast.<p>The podcast has grown as a beacon this year. “We all need the hope that comes from two things,” Angela says in one episode. “First, envisioning our way out of this pandemic; and second, seeing ourselves emerge with the collective resolve and communal spirit to create a better society than the one we had when COVID-19 hit. A society that rejects fear, divisiveness, and the perverse idea that greed will save us. A society in which we all stand together and take care of one another. This isn’t daydreaming, it’s radical imagination.”</p><blockquote>“We all need the hope that comes from two things. First, envisioning our way out of this pandemic; and second, seeing ourselves emerge with the collective resolve and communal spirit to create a better society than the one we had when COVID-19 hit. A society that rejects fear, divisiveness, and the perverse idea that greed will save us. A society in which we all stand together and take care of one another. This isn’t daydreaming, it’s radical imagination.” — Angela Glover Blackwell</blockquote> Next Generation Foresight Practitioners <p>This network of younger future-alert activists aims to influence how foresight is done…and by&nbsp;whom.</p>The<a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/"> Next Generation Foresight Practitioners</a> Program at <a href="https://soif.org.uk/">School of International Futures</a> released their “<a href="https://soif.org.uk/blog/ngfp-futures-manifesto-covid-19/">Futures Manifesto</a>” amidst the pandemic.<p>Foresight, the practice of investigating the future, has traditionally been dominated by a relatively small group of practitioners in Western countries with long careers in foresight methodologies. The <a href="https://soif.org.uk/">School of International Futures</a>, founded by Cat Tully, is addressing this imbalance with the <a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/">Next Generation Foresight Practitioners</a> (NGFP) Program, which believes that foresight empowers all changemakers to build a better future. The program supports emerging voices across underrepresented geographies with a fellowship award; connects them to a network of future-alert activists spanning 68 countries; and amplifies their influence by partnering with critical decision-making institutions.</p><p>For example, NGFP worked on a project this year helping the World Health Organization’s Western Pacific Regional Office to identify younger people’s visions and priorities for the future beyond COVID-19. As Pupul Bisht, NGFP’s Creative Lead and Network Weaver (winner of an inaugural award in 2018), explains, “We believe that when it comes to thinking about post-pandemic futures, supporting bottom-up agenda setting is critical.”</p> Guild of Future Architects <p>This cross-disciplinary community is remixing the art and science of collaboration to build tomorrow’s systems.</p><p>What would a water cooler for a different kind of future thinking look like? That’s one of the questions that spurred Sharon Chang to create <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a>, led by Executive Director Kamal Sinclair. Unlike how future thinking is tethered to commercial or geopolitical objectives, Guild of Future Architects seeks to “make the world more beautiful for more people” and intentionally nurtures collaborations across a diverse array of disciplines to get there. Founding members include artists, technologists, writers, as well as practitioners in health, economics, and urban planning.</p><a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a> members Madebo Fatunde and Thomas DeBass hatching early concepts for Institute of African&nbsp;Futures.<p>At a recent event, teams engaged virtual audiences around <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/shared-futures/profiles">Shared Futures</a> projects incubated by the Guild, including Embodied Intelligence, a framework to help people reclaim physical agency in the age of technology and surveillance; Abundant Health, a model of health care that empowers communities to restore wellness; Institute for African Futures, a dream tank for the future of the African continent; and The Gift, a multimedia experience bridging astrophysics and social transformation. All four prototypes pointed to a future that doesn’t see today’s limitations.</p> Comuzi <p>This design studio believes minority communities must have power to shape emerging AI and algorithmic systems before harm is&nbsp;done.</p><a href="https://www.comuzi.xyz/info.html">COMUZI</a>’s Akil Benjamin, Richard Fagbolagun, and Alex<br> Fefegha.<p>Who gets to shape the future? London-based for-profit design studio <a href="https://www.comuzi.xyz/index.html">COMUZI</a> believes in a more democratic vision where minority voices have the power to influence emerging algorithmic systems rather than being erased by them. Leveraging backgrounds at the nexus of technology, design, and social justice, COMUZI’s project “Beyond Tools of Resistance” will engage community members to prototype tools for holding governments and corporations accountable as AI innovations rapidly reshape how economic safety nets, health services, and transportation systems work. <br> <br>That people should have influence over these systems should not be a radical idea, but when it comes to historically marginalized communities having that power, this thinking is often far outside of the proverbial box. “The process of petitioning and pressuring government officials for change can be very fragmented. It usually takes a moment to infringe the rights of minority voices and many months or years to seek justice,“ COMUZI’s Akil Benjamin notes. “With AI this problem increases tenfold, but imagine if communities had modern tools to accelerate or even get ahead of this process. That’s what we’re aiming to&nbsp;create.”</p><p>The Radical Imagination podcast (powered by PolicyLink), Next Generation Foresight Practitioners (program of School of International Futures), Guild of Future Architects, and COMUZI are grantees of Omidyar Network’s <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/explorations/home">Exploration &amp; Future Sensing</a>&nbsp;unit.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">Listening to the Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/1527pjeb6jg">Samuel Ferrara</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/1527pjeb6jg">Unsplash</a><p>Zug, Switzerland — 15 December 2020 — Today, Energy Web announced that the Good Energies Foundation has awarded a grant to commercialize <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">EW Zero</a>, a digital, open-source, global market hub for renewable energy. EW Zero provides a single digital entry point for renewable energy buyers — from multinational corporations to small- and medium-sized enterprises — to discover and purchase renewable energy that meets their financial, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility requirements.</p><p>Such search/find/procure functionality is already ubiquitous online for air travel, hotels, and tour bookings. But it is almost non-existent for renewable energy procurement. There is no digital, global solution available today to buy or sell renewables directly online, making modern-day renewable energy procurement akin to the travel industry pre-Internet, with travel agents acting as gatekeepers (much like brokers and consultants act today in renewable energy markets). Energy Web intends for EW Zero to usher in a new era of renewable energy procurement.</p><p>Energy Web first unveiled EW Zero in September 2020 in a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">joint announcement with Ripple</a> to decarbonize the XRP Ledger, the world’s third-largest blockchain network <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/">by cryptocurrency market cap</a>. The Good Energies grant will enable Energy Web to bring EW Zero to market over the next year by commercializing the software and releasing tools that enable suppliers (e.g., renewable energy developers, owners, and operators) to post renewables for sale on EW Zero. Such integration protocols will enable companies to connect commercial renewable energy platforms — including but not limited to the various marketplace platforms built over the past two years with various Energy Web member organizations such as PTT, Foton, and Mercados Eléctricos — to ensure sufficient renewable supply is made available for&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>“Even in today’s day and age with major renewable energy commitments popping up left and right, it remains surprisingly difficult for small to medium enterprises and governments to purchase renewables,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “The Good Energies grant is a testament to the promise of open-source technologies to help solve market challenges. This funding makes it possible for EW Zero to connect local renewables marketplaces together in a single digital hub, much like Google Flights or Skyscanner does for air travel, and make it easier for renewable energy buyers to achieve their specific goals for renewables procurement.”</p><p>Renewable energy markets and underlying energy attribute certificate (EAC) markets are fragmented, with 30+ tracking systems for guarantees of origin (GOs) in Europe, 10+ tracking systems for renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the United States, 1 overarching tracking system for International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-RECs) in 35+ developed countries, and several independent national tracking systems. There are also emerging standards to support new projects in off-grid contexts and conflict zones that EW plans for EW Zero to support. One example includes the recently announced “Peace-REC” (P-REC) standard — also funded by the Good Energies Foundation — which was applied to <a href="https://www.3blmedia.com/News/First-Ever-Peace-REC-P-REC-Transaction-Drives-Renewable-Energy-Development-Africa">a first-of-its-kind transaction</a> between Microsoft and renewables sourced from emerging and fragile economies, in this case the Democratic Republic of&nbsp;Congo.</p><p>These standards and markets often depend on outdated technology and analog processes, which add cost and complexity, third-party dependencies, and overall market opacity that makes it difficult for buyers to find available options. EW Zero will help solve these various market pain points by streamlining the EAC lifecycle and providing buyers an integrated, transparent discovery platform for their renewables procurement. Initially, EW Zero is focused on renewable electricity procurement using EACs. Over time, EW Zero’s development will evolve to support bundled electricity products (e.g., power purchase agreements) and transactions of other forms of renewables including but not limited to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/green-gas-aleapfrog-opportunity-for-a-new-low-carbon-industry-e551caf2326f">green hydrogen, green gas, and a new generation of carbon&nbsp;offsets</a>.</p><p>“Our Foundation focuses on two levers to reverse climate change: clean energy and healthy forests,” said Stephanie Jones, Programme Manager at Good Energies. “We are excited to support Energy Web for a project with transformational potential for global renewable energy markets. We hope our grant for EW Zero will help scale investments in new renewable energy projects, particularly in developing countries, by reducing market friction and streamlining I-REC and other energy attribute certificate transactions between buyers and sellers to expand clean energy access to more communities across the&nbsp;globe.”</p><p>The Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA), RE-Source Platform, International REC Standard Foundation, and EKOenergy have all agreed to serve as EW Zero Advisors to provide input that guides Energy Web’s development of EW Zero over the next&nbsp;year.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by unleashing the potential of decentralized, digital technologies. EW focuses on our open-source technology stack — the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) — to enable any device, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>EW launched the Energy Web Chain, the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector and the anchor of the EW-DOS tech stack. EW has also fostered the world’s largest enterprise ecosystem focused on open-source, decentralized, digital technologies. They comprise utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://energyweb.org/">https://energyweb.org</a>.</p><p>About Good Energies Foundation<br>Good Energies Foundation is a Swiss-based private foundation. It was established in 2007 as an integral part of Good Energies Inc., a private equity company specialised in investing in the renewable energy and energy-efficiency industries. Good Energies works in partnership with Porticus, the international organisation that manages and develops the philanthropic programmes of charitable entities established by Brenninkmeijer family entrepreneurs.</p><p>CONTACT<br>Peter Bronski, Energy Web<br>+1.201.575.5545 | peter.bronski@energyweb.org</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-awarded-good-energies-foundation-grant-for-new-global-renewables-marketplace-794eaa7e14e0">Energy Web Awarded Good Energies Foundation Grant for New Global Renewables Marketplace</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>A DLT/blockchain independent platform to Issue and Verify certified attributes and claims, under different formats, and for any SSI system</p>
<p>With the introduction of notified eID schemas, thanks to eIDAS regulation, Europe made a big step forward in the identity management interoperability field. Yet these systems rely on centralized standard models and protocols (SAML being the most spread).</p>
<p>The enrichment of identity attribute with other types of attestations and claims, as of today, remains an unfulfilled promise: Federated Identity Model, upon which the whole eID system is based, isn’t enough agile to let new player come in and provide certified attributes services.</p>
<p>Italy is one of the main exemplifications: tough systems like SPID and CIE are gradually taking over the eID scenario, Attribute authorities, which should have provided attributes and claims about identities are, as of today, completely absent.</p>
<p>With the advent of SSI we have an extraordinary opportunity to deploy new technology standards to enrich eID: verifiable credential. Yet, we need to perfectly fit the regulatory trust model while still being compliant to eIDAS schemes.</p>
<p>But still SSI is a very complicated subject, both from the theoretical and technical point of view, mainly because it requires a deep understanding of blockchain and cryptography concepts.<br>Further on, each SSI project tends to propose its own solution as a closed platform, with no particular attention to interoperability and blockchain-independent solution approach.</p>

				 <p>An eIDAS bridge, which is a component that proposes to enhance the legal certainty of any class of verifiable credentials</p>
<p>The eIDAS bridge is a component that proposes to enhance the legal certainty of any class of verifiable credential, by incorporating the issuer’s advanced or qualified electronic signature (if the issuer is a natural person) or seal (if the issuer is a legal person).</p>
<p>Basically it allows Issuers to issue credentials that incorporate the issuer’s advanced or qualified electronic signature (if the issuer is a natural person) or seal (if the issuer is a legal person).</p>
<p>Trustworthiness in a Verifiable Credential is linked to the issuer’s DID: Verifying the identity of the issuer is paramount, since there is no binding of a DID to a real-world natural or legal person per se.</p>
<p>The main role of the eIDAS Bridge is to assist:</p>
 
 Issuers, in the process of signing/sealing a verifiable credential, and 
 Verifiers, in the last mile of the verification process, to help identifying the natural or legal person behind an issuer’s DID. 
 
<p>Its functions are:</p>
 
 Assist in setting up the Issuer’s qualified certificate. 
 Assist in signing or sealing Verifiable Credentials with the private key of a qualified certificate. 
 Assist in the verification process of a Verifiable Credential to retrieve the Qualified Certificate and verify it against the EU Trusted Lists.

				 <p>Online password less authentication based on SSI and FIDO2</p>
<p>Self-Sovereign IDentity Online (SSIDO) is an online passwordless solution for SSI users’ authentication through the standard Fast IDentity Online (FIDO2) protocols. SSIDO is aimed at consolidating both two technologies related to the Identity and Access Management (IAM). As a result, emerging SSI-enabled solutions can be seamlessly integrated with the existing FIDO2 applications.</p>
<p>The Web Authentication ceremony begins at the Application Layer between a user (Holder) and a Relying Party (Verifier) and implies an authentication assertion about the presence and consent of that previously registered user using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p>
<p>SSIDO extends this PKI-based approach by introducing the Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) built upon the concepts of SSI, Distributed Ledger, Agent, DID Record (DID and DID Document), as well as Verifiable Credential (VC) and Verifiable Presentation (VP).</p>
<p>To proceed with the Authentication ceremony at the Agent Layer, SSIDO incorporates the following two components:</p>
 
 SSIDO Authenticator, an edge-side agent (Holder’s Agent) designed for both mobile devices and desktop environments. 
 SSIDO Validator, a server-side or cloud-side agent (Verifier’s Agent). 
 
<p>SSI Authenticator responds to a challenge generated by SSI Validator (VP request) with the assertion signed by the user’s private key (VP). While attesting the received assertion (VP verification), SSI Validator employs the user’s public key retrieved from the DID Document.</p>
<p>The SSIDO solution is compatible with different schemes of verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations, and it can be generalized on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p>

				 <p>Open sourcing Evernym’s credential exchange platform</p>
<p>At Evernym, we have a history of open sourcing our work. Until now, we have kept the top layer of our SSI architecture proprietary. This layer provides a much easier to use SDK and platform for developers to create compelling SSI deployments compared to the lower level Hyperledger Indy/Ursa/Aries stack.</p>
<p>We want to encourage anyone to develop SSI solutions. For this reason, we will use our ESSIF-Lab grant to convert our proprietary software into repositories covered by a business source license, which itself will convert to an open source Apache 2.0 license after 36 months.</p>
<p>This will enable anyone to use and develop on our code, with all non production use permitted as well as production use up to a limit.</p>
<p>We believe this will accelerate SSI adoption, removing technical and commercial barriers to entry, by providing the world with access to the best SSI technology available.</p>
<p>Evernym’s products that are the target of this open sourcing initiative cover enterprise and consumer uses:</p>
 
 Verity: our enterprise SSI SDK and server to operate on-premise or as Saas. This performs all enterprise functions that are needed in an SSI ecosystem including forming DID connections, authentication, credential issuance and verification. 
 Mobile SDK: our app SDK to allow anyone to build Android or iOS based apps with full SSI wallet functionality. 
 Connect.Me: our mobile app that provides SSI wallet capability for making DID connections, holding credentials and sending proofs.

				 <p>TRAIN (TRust mAnagement INfrastructure): Trust Management Infrastructure Component for the ESSIF-Lab Architecture</p>
<p>Our component aims to extend the ESSIF-Framework through a global trust infrastructure that can be used to verify the trustworthiness of involved parties in an electronic transaction. The trust layer enables actors using the ESSIF-Framework to verify the root of trust of certificates used to sign credentials. In addition, the component allows for the definition, consideration, and verification of Trust Schemes compliance (e.g. eIDAS including LoAs or other Trust Schemes that can also be application/industry-specific) of involved parties. It is not dependent on a hierarchical CA infrastructure. The component builds on the infrastructure developed in the EU project LIGHTest (2016-2020, G.A. No. 700321). The trust layer is flexible, individual parties can define their own trust policies, manage and publish them. TRAIN is fully in line with the open and decentral SSI approach and complements other approaches.</p>
<p>The trust management architecture that is made possible by TRAIN enables secure, trustable digital interactions. At the same time a classical hierarchical CA-type structure is avoided – so is fraud, chaos and the pure dominance of the economically strongest actors in the system.</p>
<p>Individuals or groups (industry organizations, NGOs, etc.) of validators can define for themselves the trust standards they require. Issuers can publish to what standards they comply. The system is open, but standards for trust are transparent, as the Trust Schemes and Lists can be published.</p>

<p>By Subhashish Bhadra, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Regulators, governments, and courts have struggled to catch up with today’s rapid technological progress. That’s why Omidyar Network is exploring what it takes to reimagine our institutions.</p><p>Circa 2011, the internet was hailed as a bastion of freedom. A man in Egypt even named his newborn daughter “Facebook,” in honor of the pivotal role the social media company played in the Arab&nbsp;Spring.</p><p>Today, countries in the Global South have a litany of complaints against tech companies: privacy breaches, domestic tax evasion, inadequate content moderation, lack of free speech online, data extraction to outside the country, and much more. So, what’s changed since 2011? And why didn’t we see this&nbsp;coming?</p><p>Technology has evolved in ways we didn’t imagine, so we didn’t plan and prepare accordingly. Tech has transformed into new business lines, using the data at its disposal to create sprawling commercial empires. It has permeated governments, with law enforcement using facial recognition and other surveillance technologies. And it has fell into the hands of bad actors who used AI, for example, to create deep fake pornography.</p><p>Governments, courts, and regulators — the institutions we created to protect us — have failed to catch up; oftentimes they simply lacked the tools to counter these new&nbsp;threats.</p><p>We must catch up and look ahead. Omidyar Network believes we must reboot our institutions to set them up for success in the data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Many consequences of technological progress are unknown — and will remain so for years to come. Therefore, our institutions need to serve as “safety valves” that can identify and act as soon as harms become evident. Western democracies took centuries to develop such institutions for the industrial age; we don’t have that luxury for this digital era. Our institutions need to either move fast or risk undermining digital progress by exacerbating digital&nbsp;harms.</p><p>We have urgent concerns that public and private tech implementers must address now — like misinformation and privacy — but we must proverbially walk and chew gum at the same time. We need to tackle the immediate needs while building robust institutions for the long-term. The latter is critically important for three reasons. First, technology will keep throwing new challenges at us and we shouldn’t always be playing catch up. We need to get ahead of the curve and tackle issues in their infancy. When institutions like Parliament and courts work well, they provide forums for individuals to question how tech is rolled out. Second, most of today’s solutions originate in the US and Europe, but the same solutions may play out differently in different socio-economic contexts. Citizens need forums in which they can discuss what is best suited for them, rather than have a solution thrust from the Global North. Third, it is not just where we land that matters, but also how we get there. The path countries take on tech needs to be based on democratic norms and a respect for constitutional principles like individual liberty and non-discrimination. Those that don’t will risk being unsustainable because of possible tech lash by the people or&nbsp;courts.</p><p>That’s the “easy” part. The more difficult question is where to even start. Here’s the approach Omidyar Network is experimenting with:</p><p>We are seeking to better understand the existing laws and institutions, and how they are performing, including the entire mosaic required for a thriving digital economy: data protection, competition, taxation, transparency, cybersecurity, speech regulation, consumer protection, and more. Many of the underlying principles are context-agnostic, although their application to a country requires nuance and caution. To help guide our learning, we have commissioned multiple cross-country analyses of data protection <a href="https://omidyar.com/data-protection-and-digital-infrastructure-before-during-and-after-a-pandemic-2/">laws</a>. We have also recently funded the <a href="https://africafoicentre.org/">Africa Freedom of Information Centre</a> in Uganda to evaluate whether open contracting norms are applied effectively to government procurement of tech systems. We are curious about issues surrounding surveillance and online free&nbsp;speech.</p><p>Concurrently, we are exploring ways to strengthen the capacity of institutions that uphold these laws. Across the globe, we see that regulators struggle with low budgets and headcounts, wait for years for cases to wend their way through the courts, and for governments to belatedly apply ineffective band-aids on issues that require fundamental re-thinking. As such, we are working in different institutional contexts to understand which types of capacity-building efforts are most effective. For example, we recently funded the <a href="https://digitalrightslawyers.org/who-we-are/#:~:text=Digital%20Rights%20Lawyers%20Initiative%20is,exercisable%20in%20the%20digital%20space.">Digital Rights Lawyers Initiative</a> in Nigeria to train lawyers in digital rights litigation in the hopes it will improve the quality of technology rulings.</p><p>Finally, we are supporting digital rights organizations throughout Africa to act as checks on technological excesses of both governments and corporations. We partnered with the <a href="https://nextgenforesight.org/">Next Generation of African Foresight Practitioners at the School of International Futures</a> to generate a set of insights, signals, and scenarios that look out to 2030, and explore their implications for African institutions.</p><p>Our hope is that these investments will help us — and our many partners — answer critical questions: Which laws do we need? Which institutions can uphold them? And how can we hold institutions accountable?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/institutions-matter-60c819d32e2a">Institutions Matter</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

What information have you shared, with whom and&nbsp;when?<p>The Lissi wallet offers individuals to receive, store, manage and present identity information as an application running on a mobile phone. You can find more information about it <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/introducing-the-lissi-mobile-wallet-b2af9bccaf03">here</a>. However, this article details how it creates transparency for the&nbsp;user.</p> Your credential, information and transparency <p>When owning a credential it’s not only important what information it contains as attributes, but&nbsp;also:</p><p>1) When it was issued and presented, <br>2) Who issued it and to whom it was presented and <br>3) Which attributes were presented.</p>The Lissi wallet offers a clear overview of shared information.<p>The Lissi wallet illustrates the information of the credential (the attributes) within the info section. The activities section displays the interactions in which the credential was involved (e.g. an issuance or a proof request / verified presentation). It states all three of the above mentioned points. The Lissi wallet protocols all these interactions to increase transparency and help to stay informed.</p> Further developments <p>A protocol of interactions to monitor one’s activities is a good first step. However, the next topics, which we need to address are consent, sharing policies and the execution of GDPR&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Consent is a permission granted by an individual to a third party for a certain activity. In order to make an informed decision an individual e.g. needs to know: Who asks? Has the party the right to ask? What is done with the data? Where is it stored? All this information needs to be easily accessible for the user in order to grant or revoke consent for the use of his:her data. However, this should not be a vendor specific integration and instead needs to be discussed and formalised with other stakeholders. We are actively involved in such discussions in the Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF) and other relevant communities.</p><p>Cheers<br>The Lissi&nbsp;Team</p>

			<p>Earning a college degree is a significant accomplishment in a person’s life, creating new opportunities both personally and professionally. A college education often opens doors to higher wage-earning potential and success in the workforce, as well as improved long-term financial stability.</p>
<p>“Even though the price of higher education continues to increase, the data still shows that without post-secondary credentials, your chances of succeeding in the labor force are a lot less than they would be with a degree,” says Martin Van Der Werf, Associate Director, Editorial and Postsecondary Policy, <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW)</a>. “To gain financial independence, a college education is almost essential in this economy, and looking at future projections, this credential will be mandatory for much of the workforce—with 65 to 75-percent of all jobs requiring a college degree.”</p>
<p>The CEW studies the link between education, career qualifications, and workforce demands, and analyzes the education requirements for jobs across many industries. “CEW examines how effective colleges and universities are at educating students, since these institutions are the de facto training ground for the labor force of the future,” says Van Der Werf. “Much of our research is focused on equity and trying to determine pathways for more people to have access to higher education, particularly first-generation individuals, students from low income households, and racial or ethnic minorities. The higher education system tends to replicate the divides that we already have in our society, favoring students who are already well prepared, so much of CEW’s research is about trying to break those barriers and improve the overall success and health of our society and labor force.”</p>
<p>Education in an Online Era</p>
<p>In a matter of months, institutions across the country have had to quickly realign priorities and resources to meet the increasing demand for virtual instruction and remote learning. “Prior to the pandemic, there had been a growing acceptance of online learning in post-secondary education,” says Van Der Werf. “Now, many schools are supercharging these efforts and trying to provide quality online education that is equal to in-person instruction. The downside to this shift is that online learning is not for everyone. If you are not a self-starter, not particularly organized, and need others to push you, online classes are probably not a good fit to your learning style. The value of going to class on campus not only includes earning a degree, but meeting peers and faculty members who will potentially serve as a network for the rest of an individual’s life. Colleges and universities are trying to address this disconnect and are learning what works in person and what works online.”</p>
<p>Van Der Werf says many institutions are fundamentally rethinking their instruction model and taking a closer look at how today’s students prefer to learn. “Leaders in education have always emphasized the primacy of in-person learning, but the pandemic has created a permission slip for colleges to explore other options. During this experimental period, many models are emerging and schools are trying to choose an option that is going to work best for them.”</p>
<p>The Changing World of Higher Education</p>
<p>As a former reporter and editor at The Chronicle of Higher Education, Van Der Werf has an extensive background researching the business and financial management of colleges and universities, and continues to track trends relating to higher education finances. “I’ve been interested in the financial stability of colleges for decades and what drives consumers to invest their time and money in an institution,” shares Van Der Werf. “We’re finding that applicants need to have confidence and trust in the stability and future of the institution they are choosing to attend. Colleges and universities must be transparent about their finances and engage in two-way conversations that reassure consumers about the financial health of their organization.”</p>
<p>Another emerging trend in higher education is an increasing number of adult learners pursuing degrees. “Students age 18-25 will still be a large market, but more and more colleges are realizing there is a growing number of working adults seeking continuing studies,” says Van Der Werf. “Institutions must recognize that people understand that they are engaged in lifelong learning and may wish to go back to school throughout their careers to burnish their credentials. This focus on lifelong learning should be an important part of the business model going forward.” For many professionals, the industry they enter following graduation can significantly change, where opportunities are not as numerous as years ago. “This transformation is becoming common for many workers,” says Van Der Werf. “Perhaps as you get older, you have a family, have more responsibilities, and your current career just doesn’t pay the bills anymore. This reality forces many people to change their focus and aspirations and realize that continued learning may be necessary—they can no longer fall back on the degree they earned thirty years ago.”</p>

			<p>The College Return on Investment&nbsp;</p>
<p>As tuition and student loan debt continue to rise, many people are questioning if pursuing a degree is worth the time and money.&nbsp; Among CEW’s research initiatives is assessing the return on investment (ROI) of specific degrees and credentials in higher education and helping individuals make informed decisions on where they should pursue their degree and what discipline to study. “Higher education research in this country is shifting from inputs to outputs,” shares Van Der Werf. “Most of the college rankings focus almost solely on inputs, such as class sizes, how many professors have terminal degrees, and the SAT scores and high school class ranks of incoming students. Measuring outputs is completely different. Output focuses on the graduates and asks the questions: what jobs did they get, were these good paying jobs, and are these positions in the industries for which they studied? As a society, we are shifting to take a closer look at these lifetime outcomes, which many people are finding to be more interesting and important in their decision-making process.”</p>
<p>As a presenter at <a href="https://njedge.net/edgecon2021/">EdgeCon 2021</a>, Van Der Werf will be exploring the topic of college ROI and how the College Scorecard is delivering new details on costs and benefits of college credentials. His discussion will also explain how institutions can use the data to differentiate themselves from their competitors and make decisions about future spending priorities. At the event, Van Der Werf will also be joining Edge’s CxO Exchange members to discuss the research trends that are emerging from this current period of experimentation in higher education. “Right now institutions must identify who they are and what their competitive position is in the market,” says Van Der Werf. “This is a time of creative destruction and real introspection in higher education. You must define your institution more sharply than you have in the past. While this exercise is not necessarily new, the assessment will become increasingly important, both internally and externally. Leadership will need to take a closer look at each discipline and the associated estimates for employment and determine if they wish to continue to invest in the program; will this be an area that will continue to grow? Is this something we still believe in? Should we coordinate with another institution to offer this program?”</p>
<p>Van Der Werf says the emerging data is galvanizing how people are seeing the value proposition of higher education and that institutions must embrace this trend. “While this period in time can feel threatening, I think these challenges are also offering an exciting opportunity for change. By recognizing their place in the competitive sphere, colleges and universities can better market their individual strengths and showcase the value of pursuing a college education at their institution.”</p>

<p>This tutorial will demonstrate how to allow users of your application or platform to encrypt secrets with a DID and store them in their <a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a>. Apps and libraries can use this pattern to easily store and recover seeds, secret keys, personal information, application data, and credentials that they may need for their own systems, simply based on the ability to authenticate a DID. </p><p>Because IDX allows any data to be associated to a DID in a decentralized manner, the secrets and information stored in IDX are secure, 100% owned by the user, and can easily be discovered and accessed by any application or platform allowed by the user. (Interop!) Under the hood, IDX uses <a href="https://www.ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> as a decentralized data storage protocol.</p><p>In this tutorial we will use the following technologies:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">DIDs</a>: a W3C standard for decentralized identifiers  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516">JWE</a>: an IETF standard for encrypted content  <a href="https://docs.ceramic.network/modules/_ceramicnetwork_http_client.html">Ceramic HTTP client</a>: a JS client for interacting with a remote Ceramic node over HTTP  <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/libs-idx">IDX</a>: a protocol for user-centric data management based on DIDs  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519/">Ed25519 Key DID provider</a>: a library for using the Key DID method  <a href="https://github.com/achingbrain/uint8arrays">uint8arrays</a>: a utility library for converting between binary and text data   Environment setup <p>To get started using IDX, we'll first need to install the Ceramic and IDX CLIs using <code>npm</code>. You'll also need to have <code>node</code> installed.</p> <code>npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli @ceramicstudio/idx-cli</code> <p>Then we'll start the Ceramic daemon to run a local Ceramic node:</p> <code>ceramic daemon
</code> <p>We will also need to make sure the Ceramic node supports IDX documents, using the following command:</p> <code>idx bootstrap</code> <p>Now let's create a DID and give it the label <code>local</code> so we can more easily reference it throughout the rest of this tutorial. We will use this DID for authentication when interacting with the CLI as a developer (not an end-user):</p> <code>idx did:create --label=local</code>  Data model <p>To store our encrypted secret using Ceramic and IDX, we will need two things:</p>  A JSON schema for the encrypted payload (JWE)  An IDX definition to uniquely identify our encrypted secret in the user's IDX index   JWE schema <p>We will use the following JSON schema to validate that the encrypted payloads match the JWE specification when storing them on Ceramic:</p> <code>{
  $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#',
  title: 'JWE',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    protected: { type: 'string' },
    iv: { type: 'string' },
    ciphertext: { type: 'string' },
    tag: { type: 'string' },
    aad: { type: 'string' },
    recipients: {
      type: 'array',
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          header: {
            type: 'object',
            properties: {
              alg: { type: 'string' },
              iv: { type: 'string' },
              tag: { type: 'string' },
              epk: { type: 'object' },
              kid: { type: 'string' },
            },
            required: ['alg', 'iv', 'tag'],
          },
          encrypted_key: { type: 'string' },
        },
        required: ['header', 'encrypted_key'],
      },
    },
  },
  required: ['protected', 'iv', 'ciphertext', 'tag'],
}</code> <p>Using the DID previously created, we can publish the schema to the local Ceramic node. Use the <code>idx schema:publish</code> command as shown below:</p> <code>idx schema:publish local '{"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#","title":"JWE","type":"object","properties":{"protected":{"type":"string"},"iv":{"type":"string"},"ciphertext":{"type":"string"},"tag":{"type":"string"},"aad":{"type":"string"},"recipients":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"header":{"type":"object","properties":{"alg":{"type":"string"},"iv":{"type":"string"},"tag":{"type":"string"},"epk":{"type":"object"},"kid":{"type":"string"}},"required":["alg","iv","tag"]},"encrypted_key":{"type":"string"}},"required":["header","encrypted_key"]}}},"required":["protected","iv","ciphertext","tag"]}'</code> <p>Successfully running this command will display the schema URL, which will be used in the next step. In my case the URL is <code>ceramic://k3y52l7qbv1fryd65pd3dyu9dim46vx39z4bgzrrligbi5sfd0e3mwump2p6pdn9c</code> but when you run the command with your own DID, it will be different.</p> Encrypted secret definition <p>Now that we have a generic JWE schema, we need to create a unique definition for the secret data we want to store using the <code>idx definition:create</code> command. Multiple definitions can use the same schema, but each definition functions as a unique key in the user's IDX index.</p> <code>idx definition:create local --schema=&lt;schema URL from previous command&gt; --name="my secret data" --description="encrypted payload"</code> <p>Running this command with display the unique document ID for the definition, which we will need in the following step. In my case this ID is <code>kjzl6cwe1jw14adxazb6clhiiniffhkedz69mrkvi4i1miad62iwazktfiy8rgm</code> but it will be different for you.</p> Using our definition <p>Let's create a simple script that uses our definition to check if the encrypted secret is present in a user's IDX index, or create and store a new one if needed.</p> Dependencies <p>We'll need to install the following dependencies from <code>npm</code>: <a href="https://docs.ceramic.network/modules/_ceramicnetwork_http_client.html">Ceramic HTTP client</a>, <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/libs-idx">IDX</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519/">Ed25519 Key DID provider</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/achingbrain/uint8arrays">uint8arrays</a>.</p> <code>npm install @ceramicnetwork/http-client @ceramicstudio/idx key-did-provider-ed25519 uint8arrays</code> <p>Now let's create a simple script in a <code>secret.js</code> file, importing these dependencies along with <code>randomBytes</code> from the <code>crypto</code> module:</p> <code>const { randomBytes } = require('crypto')
const Ceramic = require('@ceramicnetwork/http-client').default
const { IDX } = require('@ceramicstudio/idx')
const { Ed25519Provider } = require('key-did-provider-ed25519')
const { fromString, toString } = require('uint8arrays')</code> secret.js file Ceramic authentication <p>In order to allow a user to encrypt their secret and store it in their IDX index, we will need our Ceramic client to be authenticated. Here we will use the <code>Ed25519Provider</code> requiring a 32 bytes seed that we will either get from the environment, or by generating a random one:</p> <code>function getSeed() {
  let seed
  if (process.env.SEED) {
    seed = fromString(process.env.SEED, 'base16')
    console.log('Using provided seed')

    seed = new Uint8Array(randomBytes(32))
    console.log(`Created seed: ${toString(seed, 'base16')}`)
  }
  return seed
}</code> secret.js file<p>In order to access secret data already associated to a DID, we will need to use the same seed by setting the <code>SEED=&lt;base16-encoded string&gt;</code> environment variable, otherwise a new DID will be created.</p><p>Now let's use this <code>getSeed()</code> function to authenticate our Ceramic client:</p> <code>async function getCeramic() {
  const ceramic = new Ceramic('http://localhost:7007')
  await ceramic.setDIDProvider(new Ed25519Provider(getSeed()))
  return ceramic
}</code> secret.js file Encrypted secret interactions <p>We will now create two functions to interact with our encrypted secret: one to encrypt and store, and another one to load and decrypt, using the definition we created from the CLI. Note, make sure to replace <code>kjzl6cwe1jw14adxazb6clhiiniffhkedz69mrkvi4i1miad62iwazktfiy8rgm</code> in the code below with the definition ID you created:</p> <code>const KEY = 'kjzl6cwe1jw14adxazb6clhiiniffhkedz69mrkvi4i1miad62iwazktfiy8rgm'

async function uploadSecret(idx, payload) {
  const jwe = await idx.did.createJWE(payload, [idx.did.id])
  await idx.set(KEY, jwe)
}

async function downloadSecret(idx) {
  const jwe = await idx.get(KEY)
  return jwe ? await idx.did.decryptJWE(jwe) : null
}</code> secret.js file<p>We provide our own DID <code>idx.did.id</code> when calling <code>idx.did.createJWE()</code> so that only the authenticated DID can decrypt the created JWE payload. It's not the case in this example, but if you would like to allow other DIDs to decrypt the payload you would include them here.</p><blockquote>As an alternative to <code>createJWE</code> and <code>decryptJWE</code>, we could use the <code><a href="https://ceramicnetwork.github.io/js-did/classes/did.html#createdagjwe">createDagJWE</a></code> and <code><a href="https://ceramicnetwork.github.io/js-did/classes/did.html#decryptdagjwe">decryptDagJWE</a></code> methods to encrypt JSON data instead of binary as we are doing in this example.</blockquote> Interaction logic <p>Finally, let's create a function to implement a simple flow of checking if the encrypted secret exists and display it, or create and store a new secret:</p> <code>async function run() {
  const ceramic = await getCeramic()
  const idx = new IDX({ ceramic })
  console.log(`Connected with DID: ${idx.id}`)

  const existing = await downloadSecret(idx)
  if (existing == null) {
    const secret = new Uint8Array(randomBytes(32))
    await uploadSecret(idx, secret)
    console.log('Created secret:')
    console.log(secret)
  } else {
    console.log('Found existing secret:')
    console.log(existing)
  }
}

run().catch(console.error)</code> secret.js Running our script <p>Let's run our script a first time, this will generate both a random seed for the DID and a random secret:</p> <code>node ./secret.js</code> <p>This will log the created seed, DID and created secret.</p><p>Now let's run the script again but providing the created seed as logged above:</p> <code>SEED=&lt;base16-encoded string&gt; node ./secret.js</code> <p>The script should log the same DID and decrypted secret.</p> Full script <p>Here is the full <code>secret.js</code> script for convenience, don't forget to change the <code>KEY</code> value with your own definition ID before running it:</p> <code>const { randomBytes } = require('crypto')
const Ceramic = require('@ceramicnetwork/http-client').default

run().catch(console.error)</code> secret.js file Use case: Encrypted seeds <p>There are many exciting use cases for storing and retrieving encrypted secrets using IDX. Let's walk through a very important one – storing encrypted seeds.</p><p>Many decentralized systems rely on public key cryptography for performing authenticated transactions, such as signing and encrypting information. In these systems, a private key (seed) is used to sign a message which can then be validated against the corresponding public key (identifier) belonging to the user. Public key cryptography allows the decentralized system to verify that an interaction has originated from a given user without requiring the use of servers. Most of these types of systems require users to manage a dedicated seed for their system, which means that as users use more systems, they have and ever-growing list of keys to manage.</p><p>This model poses many challenges to users and application developers. Here are some common questions that arise when using decentralized technologies dependent on seeds for authenticated transactions: </p>  How should I securely store this seed to make sure only the intended user can access it?   How can an app or library check if an account (seed) has already been created for a given user?   How can my app make use of multiple decentralized technologies without requiring users to manage a different seed for each one?  <p>As we have demonstrated throughout this tutorial, storing encrypted seeds directly with users on IDX using their DID can solve all of these challenges. And as the number of decentralized systems that users will need to interact with is only increasing, the need to simplify secret management in a platform-agnostic way is becoming ever more valuable. </p> What's next? <p>The examples in this tutorial were intentionally kept simple but more complex schemas could be created, for example, to store public data along with encrypted secrets to support more specific use cases.</p><p>Learn more about IDX by visiting the <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX website</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">documentation</a>.</p><p>If you need any help or just want to say hi, join the <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">IDX Discord channel</a>!</p>

Airbus is <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/airbus-air-fp-bets-on-hydrogen-to-deliver-zero-emission-planes">betting on green hydrogen</a> to reduce aviation emissions. Even oil giant Saudi Arabia is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201112-the-green-hydrogen-revolution-in-renewable-energy">now making big plans</a> for green hydrogen.</p><p>Industry analysts are bullish on the potential for green gases because these products are expected to help decarbonize industry segments that are harder to electrify, such as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201127-how-hydrogen-fuel-could-decarbonise-shipping">shipping</a>, <a href="https://www.irena.org/publications/2017/Feb/Biofuels-for-aviation-Technology-brief">aviation</a>, and heavy industry. Case in point: <a href="https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/m1/en/reports/2020/the-dawn-of-green-hydrogen/the-dawn-of-green-hydrogen.pdf">PwC estimates</a> that green hydrogen will displace about 37% of pre-COVID-19 global oil production by 2050 and <a href="https://www.wri.org/publication/renewable-natural-gas">World Resources Institute research</a> suggests that biogas could replace 15% of all diesel consumed by heavy-duty trucks and buses in the&nbsp;U.S.</p><p>Like the green electricity sector before it, this rapidly growing industry will need to coalesce around an agreed-upon method for tracking and tracing green gases. We see two primary paths: 1) Follow precedent set by the renewable electricity space over the past 20 years to track and trace green attributes, or 2) Leapfrog legacy methods by jumping straight to a global, open-source, digital-first architecture for green gases—unlocking significant business and carbon value along the&nbsp;way.</p> A familiar challenge from renewable electricity markets: tracking green attributes <p>Similar to global markets for renewably-generated electricity — which includes a variety of energy attribute certificates (EACs for short), such as guarantees of origin in Europe, renewable energy certificates in the United States, and international renewables energy certificates (I-RECs) in 35+ developing countries — green hydrogen and sustainable biogas markets will ultimately require an agreed-upon accounting system to prove just how low-carbon each unit of green gas&nbsp;is.</p><p>Like renewable electrons joining the generic generation mix of a power grid, green gases become ‘invisible’ once they flow — metaphorically and literally — into the fuel mix. Renewable electricity markets and green gas markets both face the challenge of retaining specialized, differentiated information in what used to be pure commodity markets. EACs provide a critical instrument for tagging the environmental attributes of these specialized products, distinguishing them from non-renewable electricity and hydrocarbon fuel sources, and tracking progress toward policy targets and voluntary sustainability goals&nbsp;alike.</p><p>In practice, EACs operate as a de facto voluntary market subsidy because companies must obtain and claim EACs to prove the impacts of their renewable electricity and green gas procurement. So, for example, companies like Airbus will depend on green gas EACs to prove the sustainable attributes of their fuel use in a credible&nbsp;way.</p> The green gas conundrum: copy proven yet imperfect renewable electricity markets or chart a leapfrog path to pure digitalization <p>Putting aside the various open questions around EAC market design, standards, and regulations specifically for green gases, there are two main routes available for implementing and managing green gas EAC&nbsp;markets:</p>  Copy the combined use of closed, siloed, legacy business and software processes from existing EAC markets, where: each EAC issuing body operates a national EAC registry that most of the time is not interoperable with other markets or countries; market participants go through registration and issuance processes that are at times manual and cumbersome; and where third-party companies facilitate trades between EAC buyers and sellers and update EAC issuer systems based on completed trades.  Take a fully integrated, digital-first approach from the outset, where: all green gas facilities, registries, and marketplaces share an open-source, underlying digital infrastructure to unlock seamless integrations with any current or future regulatory standard — enabling direct green gas EAC trading, greater market transparency, and reduced administrative costs.  <p>Given <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/digitalisation-and-energy">vast digitization efforts and growing digitization investments under way</a> across the energy sector, we at Energy Web encourage market participants to prioritize a digital-first approach during this nascent time for green gas markets. We believe such an approach will help green gas markets avoid repeating the pain points of renewable electricity markets and better meet <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/the-next-era-of-corporate-renewables-procurement-is-here-1d98dd123b8b">clean energy buyers’ needs</a> from day&nbsp;one.</p> How an open-source, open-architecture tech stack could support green gas&nbsp;markets <p>To develop digital solutions for green gases, market participants can take advantage of multiple collaborative technology development efforts already under way. Using open-source standards and technologies such as <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/middleware/did-explainer/">decentralized identifiers</a> paired with blockchain technology, we can deploy an interoperable digital infrastructure that makes it possible for any trusted asset (e.g., an electrolyzer or fuel refinery), customer, and organization (e.g., regulatory bodies) to seamlessly participate in the market for green&nbsp;gases.</p><p>In the case of green gases, such an approach leapfrogs digital solutions by:</p>  Simplifying the registration and identity management process of green gas facilities and market participants through the use of decentralized identifiers that make it easier to track and find key details about green gas facilities;  Streamlining verified green gas production tracking, trading, and environmental reporting by digitizing each part of green gas EAC issuance, trading, and cancellation lifecycle with robust, accessible audit trails (for an example, various applications in the electricity sector use this approach via the open-source <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Origin</a> toolkit); and  Enabling a global market for green gas procurement through emerging renewables buyers tools like <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, where green gas sellers can directly post EAC supplies and sell directly to&nbsp;buyers.  <p>For a deeper dive into Energy Web’s perspective on the role of digitization and decentralized technologies in green gas markets, please review our contribution to the recently published <a href="https://www.regatrace.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/REGATRACE-D2.4.pdf">investigative Renewable Gas Trade Centre in Europe (REGATRACE) study</a> of IT system options for EU green gas&nbsp;markets.</p><p>On our side, Energy Web is hosting conversations with market participants, including various Energy Web Members, to clarify what features should be added to our technology roadmap in order to address the technical and business requirements of digitized green gas solutions.

 Abstract 

<p>XDI (XRI Data Interchange) is a new service for generalized distributed data sharing and mediation using XRIs (Extensible Resource Identifiers), a URI-compatible abstract identifier scheme developed by the OASIS XRI Technical Committee. The goal of XDI is to enable data from any data source to be identified, exchanged, linked, and synchronized into a machine-readable dataweb using XML documents just as content from any content source can linked into the human-readable Web using HTML documents today. Because the controls needed to mediate access and usage of shared data can be built right into every XDI link, the emergence of a global Dataweb has the potential to do for trusted data interchange what the Web did for open content exchange.</p>

<p>This white paper presents several examples of classic cross-domain data sharing problems, explains how the Dataweb model can provide a generalized solution, and describes the key objectives of the newly formed OASIS XDI Technical Committee <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xdi</a>.</p>

"I would not give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity, but I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity."<br>

<p>The Web has dramatically simplified information access. Never in history has content been so readily available or richly linked. Furthermore, this model for distributed systems has become so compelling that the next wave has already broken: Web services—the promise of distributed applications talking to each other in XML and SOAP as easily as Web browsers and servers talk in HTML and HTTP.</p>

<p>Yet with cross-domain applications comes another complex problem: the need to share instances of the same data across multiple domains, directories, databases, and applications. There are many facets to this challenge: identification, authentication, authorization, mediation, and synchronization; all problems that were minimized on the Web because it dealt primarily with presentation of data rather than interchange of data.</p>

<p>Recently a new approach to this set of needs has emerged called the Dataweb. The Dataweb combines the key principles of Web architecture with core concepts from Web services and the Semantic Web into a solution that can be “the simplicity on the other side of complexity” for distributed data sharing.</p>

<p>This white paper presents several common distributed data sharing challenges and then explains how the Dataweb model can be applied to solve them. It then provides more details about how the Dataweb model builds on principles of Web, Web Services, and Semantic Web architectures. It closes by summarizing the mission of the OASIS XDI Technical Committee.</p>

 THREE EXAMPLES OF DISTRIBUTED DATA SHARING CHALLENGES 

<p>When talking about generalized solutions, it can be very helpful to have concrete examples of the problems they address. This section presents three examples of well-known distributed data sharing challenges that have a daily impact on personal, business, or community productivity.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 ELECTRONIC BUSINESS CARDS AND DYNAMIC ADDRESS BOOKS 

<p>One of the oldest rituals in business is the exchange of business cards when forming new relationships. One of the second oldest rituals in business is trying to update this information across your entire contact network when it changes. It is a fact of business life: people move, companies reorganize, and relationships change.</p>

<p>So it was inevitable that the rise of the Internet would spur the development of electronic business cards and “dynamic” address books—address books that accept new contacts and updates to contact data automatically, much the way Internet email servers send and receive messages automatically. In the last decade there have been no less than a dozen attempts to start Internet business card sharing networks. From PlanetAll to Plaxo, each of these has introduced a new system for exchanging and updating electronic business cards. And each has faced the same fundamental problem; like Internet email, they need to become nearly ubiquitous before their full value can be realized.</p>

<p>Typically this means standardization, and numerous efforts have tried to standardize contact data representation and interchange formats. An entire industry consortium, Versit, came together to create the vCard, a set of IETF RFCs now managed by the Internet Mail Consortium<a>^1</a>. More recently, the OASIS Customer Information Quality (CIQ) Technical Committee has been working since 2000 to develop XML vocabulary for describing customer and contact data.<a>^2</a></p>

<p>However many business card sharing networks use these open formats, so agreement on a data
representation format has not been the gating factor for their success. Rather the challenge is to make electronic business cards dynamic—self-updating across the network. Doing this interoperably means addressing three additional dimensions of complexity:</p>

 
   Agreement to a standard data interchange protocol, so that dynamic address book clients and servers can all talk to each other the same way Web browsers and servers talk to each other in HTTP. 
   Agreement to a common data synchronization model for sending updates to shared contact data, similar to that which SyncML provides for mobile devices. 
   Agreement to a common trust model for cross-domain authentication and authorization so dynamic address book servers can propagate updates across trust domains. 
 

<p>With this Rubik’s cube of interoperability challenges, is it any wonder that the problem of global business card sharing has not been solved?</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 CALENDAR SHARING 

<p>Business card exchange generally happens only at the initiation of new relationships, or when contact data is updated. But coordination of events between the contacts is ongoing throughout the lifetime of a relationship and happens across all spheres of activity—work, home, school, friends, etc. Therefore any Internet-based solution to calendar sharing must be cross-domain just like Internet email and the Web.</p>

<p>On the dimension of data representation, calendar sharing is easier that business card sharing. The element of time is common to all applications and networks, and a great deal of value can be provided even with the most limited event description vocabulary (e.g., Subject, Location, Start Time, End Time, etc.) Many standard formats have been developed to express this data, including the Versit complement to vCard called vCal<a>^3</a> and Microsoft’s format for sharing of calendaring data from MS Outlook.<a>^4</a></p>

<p>However even if data representation for shared calendaring is easier, the other three dimensions of dynamic data sharing requirements are not. To interoperate on the same scale as Internet email or the Web, calendar servers need an interoperable data interchange protocol, an interoperable and scalable synchronization model, and an interoperable trust model for protecting access to shared calendar data.</p>

<p>This last dimension is particularly crucial. Mere knowledge that a meeting or phone call is taking place between certain participants can be highly sensitive information. This aspect of calendar sharing intersects one of the hottest issues in the wireless industry: presence and availability management (PAM).<a>^5</a> Allowing one wireless user to instantly check the location and/or availability of another wireless customer is one of the most promising new features of wireless data networks. Yet it comes with an equally vexing problem: how to control the privacy and security of this data. Users must be confident they have complete authorization and access control over sharing of PAM data or they will turn this feature off altogether.</p>

<p>Therefore an interoperable trust model may emerge as the pre-eminent requirement for calendar sharing and PAM. However if this hurdle can be overcome, the payoff in personal and business productivity is enormous. The labor savings for administrators and participants in countless daily calls, meetings, conferences, and other events would be on the order of the labor savings that Internet email brought to
message delivery or the Web brought to information retrieval.</p>

 TRUSTED SEARCH 

<p>Internet search services like Google, Yahoo, and MSN are tremendous utilities for finding information. However they all suffer one universal limitation—they are limited to public data, the data that can be retrieved by automated robots from the public Web. Although these same technologies can be implemented within private networks to build private search indexes that are only searchable by authenticated users of each network, this effectively divides the universe of information into one very large public library and many very small private libraries and nothing in between.</p>

<p>This is not, of course, how access to protected information works in the real world. Some of the most valuable information comes through trusted data sharing networks that span multiple personal or business communities. Asking your network of friends for a local car mechanic they recommend, or contacting your school for the phone number of an old classmate, or searching a network of business partners for contacts to a prospective customer, are well-established patterns of trusted information sharing.</p>

<p>Precisely because such information is so valuable, some distributed communities of interest are now seeking to apply Web search technologies across their networks. Global organizations such as the Impact Alliance<a>^6</a> , the Interfaith Community Network<a>^7</a> , and the international law enforcement community<a>^8</a> want to enable searching for high-value non-public information across the network of individuals, groups, or enterprises with which they have the necessary trust relationships. In doing so they face major obstacles with currently available technologies. Specifically:</p>

 
   How can the identity of a user in one community be shared across the other communities in the network? 
   How can users control the availability of their personal profile or relationship data for searches by other communities, or by specific subgroups of a community? 
   How can trust relationships between members of a community, or between communities, be formed quickly and easily? 
   How can data sharing permissions be managed dynamically by all members of the network? 
   How can new and updated information propagate to all interested parties without being mistaken for spam? 
 

<p>Again these issues illustrate that distributed data sharing is much more than just a technology problem. The fourth dimension of this challenge—the need for an interoperable trust model—is primarily an issue of being able to quickly and easily map real-world trust relationships onto the network.</p>

 HOW THE DATAWEB PROVIDES A GENERALIZED SOLUTION 

<p>None of the distributed data sharing problems described above are new; they are simply growing more apparent with the advent of Web services. Yet Web services alone do not appear to offer a solution. For example, even if the members of a major standards body could agree on Web service definitions for a dynamic address book service, a calendar sharing service, or a trusted search service, how would it be adopted? Would every service provider need to implement each of these Web services separately? How would each of these Web services share data between each other? What would happen if there were competing Web service definitions from different standards bodies?</p>

<p>These questions highlight the fact that distributed data sharing is a generalized problem. Certain types of data (e.g., contact data, profile data, ontology data) need be shared almost universally across domains and applications. In this context, one of the core tenets of Tim Berners-Lee’s original design for the Web stands out: it was not specific to any particular type of content, application, or usage domain. Rather it was a simple, generalized model for sharing and linking documents over the Internet that could be used
for any type of content by any type of author in any information-sharing context.</p>

<p>In short, the Web was the “simplicity on the other side of complexity” for cross-domain sharing and linking of content. It solved the general problem by providing three simple standards for:</p>

 
   Globally identifying documents (URIs). 
   Representing and linking documents (HTML). 
   Exchanging documents (HTTP). 
 

<p>The Dataweb applies this same approach to distributed data sharing. The Dataweb model proposes to solve the general problem by providing three simple standards for:</p>

 
   Globally identifying data and data authorities using XRIs (Extensible Resource Identifiers), a new URI-compatible scheme developed by the OASIS XRI TC for abstract identifiers that are independent of a specific location, application, directory, or domain. 
   Representing and linking data using the XDI meta-schema, a simple XML schema that uses XRIs to identify, describe, and link distributed data in a domain-independent format called an XDI document. 
   Exchanging data using XDI service, a generalized service for sharing and synchronizing XDI documents with bindings to HTTP, SOAP, SMTP, and other transport protocols. 
 

<p>There is also a fourth element to Dataweb architecture does not have a direct corollary in today’s Web. This is the element that addresses the most challenging “fourth dimension” of cross-domain data sharing described above: human trust relationships. This element is called XDI link contracts, and to understand them, we must delve a little deeper into the structure of the Dataweb.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 DATAWEB LINKS: PIPES VS. STRINGS 

<p>Web and Dataweb architectures are so similar that the primary difference lies in one feature: while Web links can only be one-way "strings" between HTML resource representations, Dataweb links can also be two-way active "pipes" between XML resource representations. This is illustrated graphically in Figure 1:</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 1: Web “strings” vs. Dataweb “pipes”.</p>

<p>How exactly is a Dataweb pipe different from a Web string?</p>

 
   Two-way data flow. A Web string (URI link) can only "pull" linked resources. By contrast, a Dataweb pipe can both pull and push data in either direction. 
   Persistence. A Web string is either working (it retrieves a resource) or broken (it produces an error). By contrast, Dataweb pipes can use persistent XRIs that allow the link to re-establish itself even if the target resource moves, changes its name, or changes owners. 
   Data control. Access to a Web resource is either public (uncontrolled) or private (credential-protected). By contrast every Dataweb pipe can have a "valve" on each end^an XDI link contract^that allows comprehensive, fine-grained control over all data flowing through the pipe.<a>^9</a> 
 

<p>(<a>^</a>9) Note that XDI link contracts are not required on every Dataweb link—they are only needed when it is necessary to control the flow or caching of shared data.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 DATAWEB LINK CONTRACTS: DATA FLOW CONTROL VALVES 

<p>This last feature of Dataweb links is critical to building Dataweb trust relationships. On the Web, links are "one-dimensional", i.e., they use the HTML "A" (anchor) tag to specify a single URI for a target resource. On the Dataweb, links can be full three-dimensional resources, i.e., active XDI documents that reference other XDI documents just like a real-world contract might reference items of real property.</p>

<p>This three-dimensional approach to Dataweb links can provide:</p>

 
   Active identification. A Dataweb link can contain any number of XRIs for the target resource (different XRI synonyms can be used for different identification, resolution, and data protection purposes—see below). And these XRIs can change as the target resource's context evolves. 
   Active data interchange control. A Dataweb link contract can describe the controls on all facets of the data interchange relationship between the source and target resources (see below.) 
   Active data caching. Due to the simple structure of the XDI meta-schema, a Dataweb link can optionally cache linked data just by "cutting-and-pasting" XDI documents. 
 

<p>What types of controls can XDI link contracts define? Any policy necessary to mediate a data interchange relationship. They are as flexible and extensible as real world contracts (e.g., non-disclosure agreements).</p>

<p>For example, link contracts can mediate:</p>

 
   Authentication. How are communications with the target resource authenticated? If XML digital signatures are to be used, where is the public key certificate? 
   Authorization. What privileges to which resources is the target resource granted? 
   Access control. What access permissions are granted to what data? 
   Privacy and usage control. For what purposes and under what policies can this data be used? 
   Distribution and forwarding control. To whom can this data be redistributed and for what purposes? 
   Synchronization. How will the link cache be updated if data changes in the target resource? 
   Termination. What will happen to the data when the data sharing relationship is ended? 
 

<p>Furthermore, since link contracts are themselves XDI documents, they can (like real-world contracts) govern their own revision, amendment, and deletion.</p>

<p>In sum, Dataweb link contracts permit fully distributed peer-to-peer data mediation the same way Web links permits fully distributed peer-to-peer content access. They are a solution that models (and scales to) the real world of data sharing.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 DATAWEB ADDRESSING: XRIS AND XRI SYNONYMS 

<p>After link contracts, the second most important contrast between the Web and the Dataweb is addressing.</p>

<p>Both architectures have the same fundamental premise: 100% addressability of every resource. However on the Dataweb this applies to every single item of data, down to the smallest individual attribute.</p>

<p>This is an example of how the addressing requirements for Internet-scale data sharing are more stringent than for content sharing. These requirements are covered in detail in XRI Requirements and Glossary 1.0,<a>^10</a> published by the OASIS XRI TC.<a>^11</a> A brief summary is provided in Table 1:</p>


  
    Requirement
    Web (HTTP URIs)
    Dataweb Addressing (XRIs)
  
  
    Persistence
    No standard solution for addresses that do not break when a resource moves or changes names (the Web equivalent of a database global foreign key).
    Must support both persistent and reassignable identifiers at any level.
  
  
    Unlimited delegation &amp; federation
    Supports delegation only in DNS names (e.g., the first segment of an HTTP URI —"www.example.com").
    Must support delegation of both persistent and non-persistent identifiers to any depth.
  
  
    Global contexts
    DNS top-level domains provide limited global context for an identifier. (Exceptions are restricted TLDs like ".name" for individuals and “.pro” for professionals.)
    Must support four global contexts ^ personal, organizational, general, and special.
  
  
    Cross-references
    URIs cannot be nested in other URIs to permit sharing of identifiers across domains.
    Must allow XRIs (and URIs) to be nested within XRIs to any depth.
  
  
    Self-references
    No syntax for referring to "the concept represented by an identifier" rather than an actual resource to which the identifier resolves.
    Must provide standard syntax for self-references.
  
  
    Internationalization
    Partially internationalized. IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) in progress.
    Must be fully IRI compliant.
  
  
    Extensibility
    Extensible through new URI schemes and resolution protocols.
    Must be extensible within the XRI scheme and resolution protocol.
  

<p>Table 1: The requirements for Dataweb addressing.</p>

<p>In addition to the new capabilities of XRI syntax, XDI also supports XRI synonyms. An XRI synonym is established whenever two or more XRIs—regardless of their syntactic equivalence—are asserted in an XDI document to represent the same resource. XRI synonyms are the way XDI can maintain both human-friendly reassignable XRIs (e-names) and machine-friendly persistent XRIs (e-numbers) for the same resource at any scope—global, local, or relative. So a resource can have both multiple e-names (e.g., in different languages) and multiple e-numbers (e.g., for different data sharing and privacy contexts)—all managed automatically by how the XRIs are assigned and shared using XDI link contracts.</p>

<p>In short, XRI addressing is how XDI can solve one of the most challenging problems in enterprise application integration (EAI): mapping and translating data between domains. With XDI you can finally, "Map once, link everywhere".</p>

 DATAWEB REPRESENTATION: THE XDI META-SCHEMA 

<p>HTML was a breakthrough in network hypertext because it provided a simple, application-, domain-, and language-independent format for content representation. Without it, the Web could never have achieved ubiquity. To emulate this vital feature, the Dataweb must do the same for data representation in XML.</p>

<p>On the surface this would appear to be an immense challenge due to the enormous variety of existing XML schemas and schema languages. However the purpose of the XDI meta-schema is quite the opposite: to provide a simple, universal, “schema-neutral” format for exchanging, linking, and synchronizing other XML-encoded data (or references to other URI-addressable data). In essence, XDI is an XML "wrapper" or “descriptor” for instances of XML defined in any schema language.</p>

<p>Thus the proposed XDI meta-schema (see Appendix A) has only four XML elements (and no XML attributes) as shown in the UML relationship diagram in Figure 2:</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 2: UML model of the XDI meta-schema.</p>

 
   Resource elements represent the authoritative copy of any XRI-identified resource. They must contain at least one XRI, but can contain any number of additional XRI synonyms. They contain only one data element, but they can contain any number of link elements, and can recursively contain other resource elements. As containers, resource elements express UML composition relationships, i.e., “ownership” of the contained resource. 
   Link elements represent a “proxy” of a resource element, i.e., a non-authoritative cached copy (partial or complete) of the original resource element. Link elements express UML aggregation relationships, i.e., “membership” rather than “ownership”. Like resources, a link must always have at least one XRI associating the resource it represents, but it can have any number of additional XRI synonyms, all of which also identify the linked resource. This is the key to building dynamic XDI data maps. 
   XRI elements represent UML association relationships. They can contain only valid XRI values (which include all valid URIs, since XRIs are a superset of URIs). 
   Data elements are the "primitives" of XDI—the edge nodes of the XDI graph. They carry the actual data payload—anything from a literal XML character string to an entire XML document. The data element uses the XML Schema "Any" content model so it can contain any well-formed XML. 
 

<p>Like HTML, the purpose of the XDI schema is to reach "the simplicity on the other side of complexity" for distributed data sharing. Despite its simple structure, the expressive power of XRIs allows instances of the XDI meta-schema to identify, exchange, link, and synchronize any XML-encoded or URI-referenceable data between any two locations or applications on the Internet.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 DATAWEB SERVICES: THE XDI SERVICE DEFINITION 

<p>Of all the components of Dataweb architecture, the one that most resembles its Web ancestry is the proposed XDI service definition. Although defined abstractly using WSDL, it is proposed to consist of the same four basic operations as HTTP:<a>^12</a></p>

 
   GET is the same universal workhorse as in HTTP, i.e., it retrieves an XDI document using an XRI. 
   SET is the equivalent of HTTP PUT, and is used to write XDI documents. 
   DELETE is identical to HTTP and is used to delete XDI documents. 
   POST serves the function of invoking any XRI-identified operation upon the posted XDI document and optionally receiving an XDI document in response. 
 

<p>The advantage of defining XDI service abstractly in WSDL is that it can be bound to any transport protocol. So even though XDI can be used "natively" over HTTP, it is equally at home using the full XML enveloping and messaging capabilities of SOAP. XDI can also be bound to SMTP/MIME as a simple way to extend structured data interchange to Internet email.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 APPLYING THE DATAWEB MODEL 

<p>Having described the Dataweb model, now let’s illustrate how it can be applied to our three distributed data sharing problems.</p>

 BUSINESS CARD SHARING USING THE DATAWEB 

<p>The first challenge is to share and link electronic business cards between dynamic address books—and do so in a way that is interoperable across domains like Internet email and the Web. As explained above, the Dataweb approach to this problem is just like the Web. Specifically, once Web servers and browsers were available, all an author had to do to begin sharing information over the Web was:</p>

 
   Obtain a Web address (if the author didn’t already have one); 
   Put up a Web site with the content (HTML pages) the author desires to publish; and 
   Start publishing the Web addresses (URIs) of these pages. 
 

<p>To begin sharing and linking data such as a business card over the Dataweb, the process is nearly identical, with the addition of one more step:</p>

 
   Obtain an Dataweb address (if the author doesn’t already have one<a>^13</a> ); 
   Put up a Dataweb site with the data (XDI documents) the author wants to share; 
   Create the Dataweb link contracts describing the terms under which this data may be shared; and 
   Start publishing the Dataweb addresses (XRIs) of these link contracts. 
 

<p>Note these last two steps: on the Dataweb, controlled resources are never addressed directly. They are always addressed through the link contract that establishes the data sharing relationship between the publisher and any subscriber. (This is sometimes called the “rights path”.)</p>

<p>Let’s illustrate this in the context of a business card sharing relationship. Say Alice and Bob want to begin sharing XDI business cards, and both of them have XRIs for their home pages at an XDI service provider. From a Dataweb perspective an XDI business card is simply an XDI document containing instances of contact data.<a>^14</a> And a dynamic address book is simply a Dataweb site (or a branch of a site) devoted to sharing and linking XDI business cards.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob can each use a Dataweb editor<a>^15</a> to create an XDI business card containing the contact data they would like to share. This is published to their respective Dataweb sites as shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 3: Two Dataweb sites containing electronic business cards as XDI documents.</p>

<p>Alice must next choose a “template” link contract for sharing business cards. Typically this will be similar to a real-world contract template—a standard form with different customization options.<a>^16</a> For example, it may let Alice set a default permission to permit contacts to forward her XDI business card directly to others (“introduction permission”), vs. needing Alice’s permission first. In any case, when Alice is finished customizing this template, she publishes it to her Dataweb site as shown in Figure 4.</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 4: Alice adds a link contract for sharing her business card.</p>

<p>To share this business card with Bob, Alice sends him the XRI for the link contract. This is where XDI service comes into play. When Bob clicks this link, Alice’s XDI service provider asks Bob for the XRI of his own XDI home page. After authenticating Bob with his XDI service provider, Alice’s XDI service provider sends him Alice’s link contract. Providing Bob agrees, Bob’s XDI service provider returns a signed version of the contract<a>^17</a> and keeps a copy for Bob. Finally Alice’s service provider returns a copy of Alice’s business card to be cached by Bob’s site, as shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 5: Both sites have a copy of the signed contract and Bob’s site has a cached copy of Alice’s business card.</p>

<p>Providing Alice has a persistent XRI, Alice and Bob have just created a lifetime link—one that won’t break no matter how many times Alice moves, changes jobs, or even changes XDI service providers. And if Alice’s contract includes data synchronization permission, updates to Alice’s contact data will automatically flow across to Bob’s site (via an XDI update message sent from Alice’s XDI service provider to Bob’s XDI service provider).</p>

<p>Bob can share his XDI business card with Alice the same way. This mirrors the exchange of XDI documents shown in Figure 5, and sets up a second “pipe” between their two Dataweb sites to keep Bob’s business card synchronized with Alice’s cache.</p>

<p>The advantage of this model for business card sharing is that, like the Web, it is the same for all Dataweb relationships—person-to-person, person-to-business, business-to-business. The types of data and the terms of the link contract may vary, however for most common types of data sharing transactions (like business cards), the link contract is likely to be very simple and standardized.</p>

<p>This model extends within a user or organization’s internal Dataweb as well. For instance, rather than look up Alice’s phone number online at his XDI service provider, where Bob really needs this data is directly on his laptop and cell phone. If these devices included an XDI dynamic address books linked to Bob’s XDI service provider, any updates to Alice’s business card would automatically flow right down to his local devices. In essence, they become local caches of a selected portion of Bob’s online Dataweb site.</p>

<p>(<a>^</a>12) The OASIS XDI TC will also consider include protocol-level support for basic transactional integrity.<br>
(<a>^</a>13) XRIs are backwards-compatible with most HTTP URIs.<br>
(<a>^</a>14) Most likely these datatypes will be identified with general XRIs assigned to standard contact datatypes such as those developed by the OASIS CIQ TC. See also the discussion of general XRIs and XDI dictionaries below.<br>
(<a>^</a>15) This may be an online HTML application provided by an XDI service provider, or a new feature provided by a client-side contact manager such as Microsoft Outlook or Palm Address Book.<br>
(<a>^</a>16) XDI personal link contracts are expected to be very simple, reflecting person-to-person trust relationships.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 CALENDAR SHARING USING THE DATAWEB 

<p>An appointment is just another group of shared data, so from a Dataweb standpoint every appointment is simply a new XDI document that needs to be shared among all attendees. Assuming this is controlled data, however, this first requires that attendees have a contract covering this type of data. Such a contract may include options such as, “Can this contact automatically schedule an appointment on my calendar? Can they move an appointment? Can they see an appointment that they have not created?”</p>

<p>Many XDI business card sharing contracts are also likely to include calendaring sharing. Let’s say this is the case with Alice’s contract with Bob, and now Bob wants to schedule a meeting with Alice. Bob could create a new XDI appointment and “invite” Alice by linking it to her contract, as shown in Figure 6.</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p></p>Figure 6: Bob creates a proposed appointment linked to Alice.<p></p>

<p>Bob’s XDI service provider then sends the XDI appointment document to Alice’s XDI service provider. Assuming Alice handles appointment requests locally, Alice’s service provider would deliver the message to her preferred device (such as her laptop or cell phone), which would notify her as she desires (such as using an HTML email or SMS message). As with most calendar sharing systems, Alice can now accept, decline, or modify the request. If she accepts it, the result would look like Figure 7 (except that this appointment would also be cached locally on her laptop or cell phone, not shown.)</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p></p>Figure 7: Alice accepts the appointment and it is confirmed on Bob’s site.<p></p>

<p>Of course the real productivity payoff is realized when conflicts arise and either Bob or Alice needs to move the appointment. Assuming both have permission, either could modify it, and the other will receive the proposed change automatically. Negotiation over conflicts and proposing alternative times can also be automated to the extent that Bob and Alice’s respective XDI calendaring applications support this.</p>

<p>None of this is new functionality—these features are staples of workgroup calendaring systems. The breakthrough is reaching a platform- and domain-independent solution that can make Internet calendar sharing as widely available as Internet email and the Web.</p>

<p>(<a>^</a>17) This could be using an XML digital signature, or whatever other means of verification is acceptable to Alice.</p>

 TRUSTED SEARCH USING THE DATAWEB 

<p>The third distributed data sharing challenge was being able to do searches across private sites—data that is not available publicly, but that could be very valuable if searchable across a federated trust community.</p>

<p>Today’s Internet search engines compile their indexes using automated “spiders”, programs that crawl Web sites and follow the links to discover new content.<a>^18</a> Dataweb search engines will work the same way, only spiders will also crawl link contracts. In other words, on the Dataweb, data is indexed only by permission, and this permission is provided to spiders the same way it is provided to any other party,
using link contracts. In turn, Dataweb search engines will control access to these indexes by authenticating search requests with the governing community.

</p><p>To illustrate, let’s say Alice and Bob are both members of a scientific association that offers the benefit of searching across portions of member’s private profile data (for example, their plans to do future research in a specific area.) Offering this feature today would require building a special search site to index the data, creating user accounts on this site for all participating members, and requiring members to login to this site to perform trusted searches.</p>

<p>The Dataweb solution requires only that all participating members share a common link contract. This governs not only what data is searchable under what terms, but also provides each member with permission to conduct searches across the linked data. No special sites, no separate accounts, no
additional passwords. Furthermore the system can grow and evolve simply by making changes to this common contract, for example, by adding new types of data.</p>

<p>Whats more, trust communities can be now be federated by linking their contracts. So if Alice’s and Bob’s scientific association were to form an alliance with another scientific association, and the two communities wanted to offer trusted search across their combined membership, this could be accomplished simply by creating a new contract that links their respective member search contracts.<a>^19</a> Now a trusted search request from a member of either association would automatically be authenticated against both search indexes.</p>

<p>(<a>^</a>18) Google also pioneered the use of link metadata to optimize the resulting indexes.<br>
(<a>^</a>19) This contract could also establish the XRI synonym mapping if the two communities were using different XDI datatypes.</p>

 HOW THE DATAWEB BUILDS ON WEB SERVICES 

<p>Although the XDI data model is rooted in Web architecture, and its WSDL definition can be bound to other transport protocols besides SOAP, XDI is ideal as a Web service because it adheres to the classic tenets of Web services architecture: domain-independent application-to-application XML messaging using XML schema definitions, WSDL service definitions, and SOAP envelopes.</p>

<p>Thus XDI/SOAP is fully compatible with all emerging Web services standards including WS-Security, WS-Federation, WS-Inspection, WS-Routing, and WS-Reliable Messaging. So where does XDI fit with other Web services?</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 A GENERALIZED DATA SHARING SERVICE 

<p>In a world of domain-specific Web services, the role of XDI is as a utility service—a generalized Web service that can be employed by other Web services to handle common data sharing transactions. For example, say a heavy equipment manufacturer offers a suite of Web services for generating orders, accepting invoices, and monitoring inventory from its supply chain. This suite uses a set of XML schemas and WSDL service definitions customized for the manufacturer's product line and accounting systems.</p>

<p>If this manufacturer wanted to add a new supplier and its sales representatives to its supply chain, the manufacturer could offer another special Web service for accepting this supplier's account data into the manufacturer's CRM. Alternatively the CRM vendor could offer a pre-packaged Web service for doing this same task. But in either case the supplier would have to implement another Web service client for communicating this account provisioning data. If the supplier serves 25 manufacturers, this could mean implementing 25 different account-provisioning clients all for the same standard data.</p>

<p>This would become much simpler and less costly if all parties to this supply chain used a generalized data sharing service such as XDI. Then one set of XDI transactions could transfer, link, and permanently synchronize all the account data. XDI could also be used to "bootstrap" the other specialized Web services by transferring the XSD and WSDL files (encapsulated as XDI documents) necessary to configure the supplier's Web service clients. Now the manufacturer's and supplier's respective systems would be ready to begin automated data interchange at a fraction of the time and expense.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 A DISTRIBUTED DATA MEDIATION SERVICE 

<p>A standardized data interchange service not only simplifies the creation of a new relationship, it also automates many standard relationship maintenance tasks. For example, if the manufacturer and supplier described above used XDI to link their shared data, then changes in either of their configurations—prices, contracts, sales representatives, XSD files, WSDL files—could flow automatically from one's XDI servers to the other's using the mediation of XDI link contracts without any custom programming or specialized administration.</p>

<p>XDI is also a very efficient way of applying SAML<a>^20</a> authentication and authorization assertions, because in XDI every policy decision point is identified by the XRI for the authoritative link contract. And shared access control policies described in a language like XACML<a>^21</a> could be implemented within or across organizations—even throughout the manufacturer's entire supply chain—by using shared XRIs to the same XDI link contract.</p>

<p>Lastly, this is a context in which persistent XRIs—XRIs that will not change for the lifetime of a relationship—provide significant benefits. For example, suppose the supplier underwent a major reorganization of its sales force, or was bought by another vendor and changed its name. The use of persistent XRIs means all the XDI links and contracts between the supplier and manufacturer will remain intact even when the DNS names changed. Furthermore, XDI synchronization would allow changes to attributes such as titles, roles, and contact data to automatically flow between the XDI systems.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 XDI FORMS 

<p>The scenarios above raise the question of how XDI is customized for specific types of data interchange. For example, different XDI data sets are needed to provision the supplier's accounts for a heavy equipment manufacturer vs. an airplane manufacturer vs. a plastics manufacturer. How does each manufacturer request just the specific data needed by their CRM system from the supplier's XDI service?</p>

<p>The Dataweb answer is identical to the Web answer: forms. Just as a Web server can request customized data from a Web browser using an HTML form, an XDI client or server can request instances of specific XDI datatypes from another XDI service using an XDI form. The key difference between HTML and XDI forms is that the latter are XDI documents designed for fully automated machine processing. In other words, an XDI form uses machine-readable:</p>

 
   Datatypes. Instead of human-readable field labels, XDI forms use XRIs to identify the XDI datatype instances being requested (including XRI synonyms for domain-independent type mapping). 
   Link contracts. XDI forms can specify one or more XRIs for the proposed link contract(s) governing the requested data. 
   Credentials. The link contracts can also include one or more XRI-addressable authentication credentials, which themselves include XRIs for the issuing XDI authorities for verification. 
 

<p>XDI forms can also be chained together to provide workflow and multi-party data sharing transactions. In short, they are the mechanism that enables XDI to serve as a generalized solution to sharing many different types of data under many different contract terms and trust models.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 HOW THE DATAWEB BUILDS ON THE SEMANTIC WEB 

<p>The foundation of the Semantic Web—the W3C's term for a Web of machine-readable and understandable resources as opposed to human-readable content—is RDF (Resource Description Framework). RDF is an abstract model and XML syntax for expressing metadata about any URI-identified resource, from a Web page to a file to a media stream. The goal of RDF is to provide a common format for machine-understandable metadata that can be processed by any RDF-aware application.</p>

<p>Just as XDI can integrate directly with other Web services because it can be a Web service itself, XDI can integrate directly with RDF because:</p>


 
   Every XDI resource is URI-addressable,<a>^22</a> so it can be described using RDF. 
   Every RDF graph can be serialized in RDF/XML, so the resulting XML document is a resource that can be identified, exchanged, linked, and synchronized using XDI. 
 

<p>However, since both XDI and RDF represent graphs of relationships between resources, they can interoperate at an even deeper level.</p>

<p>(<a>^</a>22) Every XDI resource is XRI-addressable, and every XRI can be transformed into valid URI.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 RDF GRAPHS AND XDI GRAPHS 

<p>RDF represents all relationships using tuples—three part statements consisting of a subject, predicate, and object.<a>^23</a> For example: a book (subject) has a rating (predicate) of "four stars" (object). The descriptive power of RDF derives from the fact that any value of any property of any resource can be described using this basic construct.</p>

<p>RDF statements can also be nested, i.e., one statement can describe another. For example, you can have an RDF statement describing who said that a book has a rating of four stars. But since RDF syntax is based on tuples, doing this actually requires four tuples (a tuple for the new statement, and three tuples describing the new statement's relationship to the subject, predicate, and object of the first statement.) Known as reification, this is one of the most complex topics in RDF.<a>^24</a></p>

<p>Since distributed data sharing depends heavily on describing nested data relationships, the XDI meta-schema takes a slightly different approach. As described above, it models data from the "inside out", i.e., by starting with a Data element for containing atomic data values and then using three elements to model the three types of UML relationships in which a Data element can participate:</p>

 
   XRI elements model association relationships. The value of the XRI identifies the associated resource. 
   Resource elements model composition relationships. Resources can be nested to any depth. 
   Link elements model aggregation relationships. Links can be nested to any depth. 
 

<p>The result is a model for graphing data relationships that is optimized for generalized distributed data sharing. The key word is optimized. In theory, both RDF and XDI graphs can describe the relationships between any set of URI-identifiable resources. But each graph is optimized for different purposes. The distinction is similar to that between Cartesian and radian coordinates—either can locate any point on a plane, but certain types of shapes (e.g., squares vs. circles) are much easier to describe using one or the other.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 THE XDI GRAPH: OPTIMIZED FOR RESOURCE LINKING 

<p>In particular, the XDI graph is optimized for describing relationships between shared resources. This is the nature of distributed data sharing. Every time data is shared, a copy of a resource—a new sub-tree—is instantiated at a new location on the global XDI graph. Because this new sub-tree has an inherent relationship to the original sub-tree, it can be represented simply by using:</p>

 
   A Link element (rather than a Resource element) to represent the root of the new sub-tree, and 
   One or more of the same XRIs that described the original Resource element, now in a new context.<a>^25</a> 
   A cache of any data from the original sub-tree that is literally "copied-and-pasted" below the root Link element in the new sub-tree. 
   In cases where data sharing is controlled, a link contract as one element of the cached data. 
 

<p>The result is both a simple, efficient XDI operation and clean, relatively compact XML.</p>

<p>A second way the XDI graph is optimized for linking is the use of XRIs to identify every resource and link element. Because of this, every node in the XDI graph is directly addressable using both persistent and reassignable XRIs. In addition every node that has a global context (i.e., a globally addressable ancestor) is globally addressable.</p>

<p>A third way the XDI graph is optimized for linking is link contracts, discussed above. Every link element that needs to control its active data interchange relationship with the target resource can cache a copy of its link contract, as shown in Figure 2 above. This means each XDI link can be not just self-describing, but self-governing—an ideal architecture for distributed data mediation.</p>

<p>(<a>^</a>23) From an object-oriented perspective, this is the same thing as an object, property, and property value. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#basic">http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/#basic</a><br>

(<a>^</a>25) Note that for privacy and data protection purposes, the XRIs at any Link node may be only a subset of the XRI synonyms used at the target Resource node (or at other Link nodes) for this resource. This is a secondary mechanism by which data authorities can control the sharing of their data.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 GENERAL XRIS AND XDI DICTIONARIES: CONCEPT MAPPING ON THE XDI GRAPH 

<p>There is a fourth way in which the XDI graph is optimized for distributed data sharing. Since data describing the same resource is often already widely distributed (such as the same registration data representing the same user on multiple Web sites), a key challenge in establishing a distributed data
sharing infrastructure is “linking it up.” This requires:</p>

 
   Establishing equivalence between the different instances. 
   Establishing chain-of-authority relationships (in XDI graph terms, this means deciding which instances are resource nodes vs. which are link nodes). 
   Adding any necessary link control metadata, i.e., link contracts. 
 

<p>The latter two problems hinge on solving the first one—mapping equivalence. XDI offers four tools specifically to help with this problem:</p>

 
   XRI synonyms, discussed above, allow multiple XRIs to be assigned to the same resource or link element. This is how the XDI graph forms a dynamic global “identity map.” 
   Persistent XRIs, also described above, enable XDI authorities to assign persistent IDs to any node in the XDI graph. Most data instances already have a persistent ID within their local data store (e.g., a database key or file system i-node). When adapted to become a persistent XRI, this ID becomes the “anchor point” around which other XRI synonyms can be assigned to build an equivalence map. 
   General XRIs can be assigned to any resource representing an instance of a shared concept (“phone number,” “shoe size,” “age,” “budget,” “whale,” etc.) General XRIs use the general context symbol ("+") designed for this purpose. There is no single global authority for general XRIs because XDI communities will self-select a common set of general XRIs the same way communities of same-language speakers naturally self-select a common set of generic nouns. (However general XDI dictionaries will be very useful in this respect.) 
   XDI dictionaries are Dataweb sites used as references by other Dataweb sites to help build shared concept maps. Except for the fact that they are entirely machine-readable and searchable, their purpose is the same as real-world dictionaries—to share resource identifiers (words) and resource descriptions (definitions) across communities of interest. Like real-world dictionaries, XDI dictionaries can be either generalized (the XDI equivalent of Merriam-Webster’s or the Oxford English Dictionary) or specialized (the XDI equivalent of Black’s Law Dictionary or Stedman’s Medical Dictionary.) 
 

<p>With XDI dictionaries, Dataweb mapping software can help automate the process of assigning XRIs and XRI synonyms to local resources, in the process building equivalence maps for linking this data with other XDI authorities. With such tools it may be possible, despite the four-dimensional challenges of distributed data sharing, to establish a global Dataweb almost as quickly as the World Wide Web formed.</p>

<p><a>^ Table of Contents</a></p>
 THE MISSION OF THE OASIS XDI TC 

<p>Besides the Web and XML, the roots of the Dataweb are in data addressing and linking technology originally developed by the XNS Public Trust Organization.<a>^26</a> This work was contributed to the OASIS XRI TC in January 2003 to help develop the abstract, location-independent identifier scheme necessary to support Internet-wide persistent linking and synchronization of data.</p>

<p>With the approval of the XRI Generic Syntax and Resolution Specification 1.0 as a Committee Draft<a>^27</a> on January 19, 2004, the foundation is now set for the OASIS XDI TC to develop the other specifications required for a global Dataweb. These deliverables include:</p>

 
   The XDI meta-schema for describing and linking XRI-identified resources using XML documents. (See the initial proposal attached as Appendix A.) 
   XRI resolution rules within XDI documents. 
   The XDI WSDL service definition and bindings to transport protocols including HTTP, SOAP, and SMTP/MIME. 
   The XDI service dictionary—the set of globally shared XDI resources including that can be used in XDI link contracts to define, control, secure, and protect data sharing relationships using XDI. 
 

<p>In addition the XDI TC plans to work closely with other OASIS TCs as well as other standards bodies and industry consortiums. Initially the XDI TC will be forming liaisons with:</p>

 
   The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Infrastructure Working Group to establish common use cases and ensure interoperability of TCG and XDI specifications in trusted computing infrastructure.<a>^28</a> 
   The Telemanagement Forum (TMF) to establish common use cases and requirements for using XDI as a mechanism for implementing the TMF SID (Shared Information/Data Model) component of the TMF NGOSS (New Generation Operations System and Software) program.<a>^29</a> 
   The International Security, Trust, and Privacy Alliance (ISTPA) Framework Working Group to adapt the ISTPA Privacy Framework as a reference model for XDI privacy and usage control architecture.<a>^30</a> 
 

<p>We invite other industry alliances, standards bodies, companies, and individuals interested in XDI and Dataweb development to join the OASIS XDI TC or to contact us regarding developing a liaison.</p>

 CONCLUSION 

<p>The task of establishing an Internet-wide data sharing infrastructure might appear overwhelming. However ten years ago, the idea of a global Web that put billions of linked documents at our fingertips appeared equally unthinkable. What the Web proved was that a simple, generalized model for content sharing and linking could grow exponentially as each new link was created.</p>

<p>The Dataweb proposes the same model for distributed data sharing. As shown in Figure 8, it combines the best features of the Web's linking model, Web Service's structured XML messaging model, and the Semantic Web's resource description model into an architecture that has the potential do for interoperable trusted data sharing what the Web did for open content sharing.</p>

<p>Web (HTML/HTTP) Web Services (XML/SOAP)</p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Figure 8: The Dataweb bridges the best features of the Web, Web Services, and the Semantic Web.</p>

<p>Moreover, XDI does not displace any of the existing or emerging XML vocabularies designed to support specific applications or Web services infrastructure. Rather, it augments them by providing a common Web service for sharing, linking, and synchronizing other XML documents encoded in any XML language or schema. XDI service is designed to layer over enterprise-level data sharing solutions and standards the same way the Web layered over enterprise-level content sharing solutions and standards.</p><p>

 A response to Senator Tillis’s questions regarding his proposed draft legislation and possible changes to Title&nbsp;17. <p>Dear Mr. Watts, Mr. Greenberg and Senator&nbsp;Tillis,</p><p>My name is Adam Holland, and I am a Project Manager at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society, where I oversee the day-to-day operations of the Lumen database project [1]. I write to you today in my individual capacity to answer some of the questions you have posed to stakeholders regarding your DMCA Reform Bill, and to suggest a few additional changes.</p><p>Lumen is an independent research project that studies, and facilitates the study of the landscape for online content. This includes requests — based on legal or extra-legal theories — to remove materials (or links to materials) created or uploaded by Internet users. Lumen operates a research platform that invites rightsholders, Online Service Providers (OSPs), search engines, and other online intermediaries, as well as members of the general public, to share takedown requests that they send and receive concerning online content. Lumen maintains a database containing approximately 15 million such notices, all of which have been voluntarily shared with the project by their recipients and senders. Lumen makes those notices available to scholars, journalists, and others for purposes of research and analysis.</p><p>Lumen was formed as the Chilling Effects Clearinghouse in or around 2001, in the wake of the United States’ 1998 implementation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and its safe harbor provisions. The project was founded in recognition of the fact that the DMCA safe harbor in the US would change the landscape concerning availability of online content by incentivizing platforms to remove content in response to copyright claims in order to qualify for the safe harbor, and that it would do so through a process that took place largely out of the public eye. Against that backdrop, Lumen’s goals are to facilitate research about different kinds of complaints and requests for removal — both legitimate and questionable — that are sent to online publishers and service providers; and to provide as much transparency as possible about such notices in terms of who sends them, why, and to what&nbsp;effect.</p><p>However, no existing law or regulation mandates that removal requests or demands be made public or even available for study. Thus, all of the notices in the Lumen database have been shared voluntarily with Lumen. And, those companies that have chosen to share notices with Lumen decide which types of notice, and which data fields within a notice, to share. The set of data to which Lumen has access is unfortunately therefore limited, and of commensurately limited utility with respect to drawing conclusions about the efficacy of the DMCA. It is with that backdrop in mind, and with the insight that my experiences managing Lumen have given me, that I write with a response specifically to your question 7, regarding the shortcomings of the notice-and counter-notice sending process as well as its potential standardization.</p><p>If Lumen had a motto, it would be “good policies are founded on good data.” The best way to draft well-functioning new legislation and policies regarding online takedowns is to carefully study the takedowns that have already occurred and that continue to occur. Only by fully understanding that complex ecosystem and its stakeholders, the successes and failure of existing policy, can legislators move forward in an effective way, one that will not create new problems as it attempts to solve the&nbsp;old.</p><p>I therefore propose, related to Senator Tillis’s suggestion for “regulations for the communications that OSPs must deliver to a user when their content is taken down or had access disabled” that in addition to standardization of forms, which I would support, that in contemplating changes to Section 512, drafters should consider ways to effectively incentivize those who send and receive notices to disclose those notices in ways that allow for their ongoing&nbsp;study.</p><p>Of course the devil will be in the details, but as just one example, a provision could be added to section 512 mandating that recipients of DMCA notices and any related counternotices disclose the contents of such notices, along with any action taken, to an independent third party entity. It seems less germane to have DMCA senders disclose the notices they send, but that could also be a topic for consideration.</p><p>If it received adequate funding to handle the substantial new volume, these mandatory disclosures could easily be made to Lumen, the largest current aggregator of DMCA requests, which has twenty years of history managing and facilitating research within a database of such requests. Or, a new clearinghouse entity could be created, perhaps under the auspices of the Copyright Office. In the alternative, or as an option for smaller scale DMCA recipients, there could instead be a requirement for a standardized general disclosure to the public, in the form of a Transparency Report published regularly by each recipient of DMCA notices, at least any with a registered DMCA agent. There is already ample precedent for such reports, and many larger companies publish&nbsp;them.</p><p>These Transparency Reports would be required to take a standardized form, allowing external researchers, including Lumen, to easily collect, aggregate, and compare their data for further study. Access to the “raw” data could be limited to vetted and accredited researchers, while the public could have access to a version with private and personally identifying information (PII) masked, as question 7 suggests. Lumen also has extensive experience with handling PII within DMCA notices and would be glad to consult on this topic. Any necessary redaction should be undertaken by the least-cost avoider.</p><p>Were this level of transparency regarding DMCA notices and counternotices, as well as the ultimate actions taken on them by recipient OSPs to become standard, I believe that the resulting wealth of information and insights gleaned from it would make it much easier to answer all of the other questions Senator Tillis has asked, whether initially or as part of ongoing and regular evaluation of existing laws and regulations.</p><p>Draft language on this topic might look something like:</p><p>(X) In order to facilitate ongoing research and policy analysis, any online service provider, as defined in [Section NNN], shall, upon receipt&nbsp;of:</p><p>(1) a notice per the requirements of 17 USC 512(c)&nbsp;(3),</p><p>(2)a counternotice sent per the requirements of 17 USC 512(g)(3),</p><p>(3) a subpoena sent per the requirements of 17 USC 512(h),&nbsp;or</p><p>(4) a cease &amp; desist letter sent regarding Section 1201 violation</p><p>transmit a copy of the notice, counternotice, subpoena or letter, formatted according to the criteria in[Section NNN], to the Lumen Database / Copyright Office’s clearinghouse for such documents described in Section&nbsp;(NNN);</p><p>or in the alternative, make a copy of the correctly formatted notice, counternotice, subpoena or letter available in a quarterly Transparency Report, as described in [Section&nbsp;NNN].</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Adam Holland</p><p>Project Manager — Lumen</p><p>Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;&nbsp;Society</p><p>Harvard University</p><p>[1] The Lumen database is accessible at <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org.">https://www.lumendatabase.org.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/a-response-to-senator-tilliss-questions-regarding-his-proposed-draft-legislation-and-possible-ac1f3a0dfc74">A response to Senator Tillis’s questions regarding his proposed draft legislation and possible…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Even before the impact of the pandemic, much of the education community was exploring ways to expand online learning and determining which technology solutions were worth the investment. While integrating information technology in education can provide many new opportunities, any change to teaching and learning can cause challenges to arise as well. “As faculty are discipline experts, they need support with designing and implementing courses in a way that best promotes student success and learning. This became especially important during the pandemic as faculty needed to quickly learn how to use an online platform only for teaching and learning,” shares Dr. Christine Harrington, Associate Professor and Co-Coordinator Ed.D. in Community College Leadership,<a href="https://www.njcu.edu/"> New Jersey City University</a> (NJCU). “Online platforms are significantly different from traditional face-to-face learning and faculty needed to discover what was and was not possible when making the sudden shift to online learning.”</p>
<p>Once COVID-19 began to shut down in-person classes, many institutions’ technology timelines were rapidly sped up, with organizations quickly shifting to find effective ways for educators to connect and teach students online. “As the pandemic hit and the world shifted, everyone had to be online and many faculty members had to quickly learn the functionalities of virtual platforms,” says Harrington. “NJCU does not currently have a teaching and learning center and because this is my area of expertise, I tried to help faculty navigate through the crisis by sharing key resources on how to shift to online learning.&nbsp; The focus was on helping faculty find ways to engage students and to help them achieve the learning goals of the course in this new online format.”</p>
<p>Even when faced with a complicated undertaking, NJCU worked together to make the transformation to online learning as smooth as possible. “Like our students, our faculty and staff are very resilient,” says Dr. Nurdan S. Duzgoren-Aydin, Associate Provost for Academic Affairs, The Office of the Provost and Senior Vice President. “Through collaboration, trust, understanding, and working to accommodate each other, we were able to keep moving forward amid this perfect storm. However, our team is small and we couldn’t support the number of requests for support. Plus, we were already in the midst of changing our Blackboard navigation system and learning platform, so our faculty was trying to navigate a great deal of change.”</p>
<p>Providing Faculty Support</p>
<p>In hopes of further expanding their online resource hub and offering faculty development courses and support, NJCU met with Edge to determine how they could help. “We realized quickly that not only do we need to help faculty swiftly shift to online learning, but we must offer guidance as they design their courses going forward,” shares Harrington. “In addition to instructors trying to navigate the current tools at their disposal, they must learn new online tools to continue to create a positive learning experience for students. Edge offered online courses and office hours to help faculty develop these skillsets and network with other people within the education community.”</p>
<p>Duzgoren-Aydin says NJCU’s collaboration with Edge has provided one of the most important benefits needed during digital transformation: feedback. “Prior to COVID-19, Blackboard utilization was around 40 percent among the faculty, and within a week, that usage was 100 percent,” says Duzgoren-Aydin. “We needed to help our faculty immediately, answer their questions, and offer the training required to understand online tools. Through Edge’s online learning support services and integrating their best practices for learning design, we were able to go online in August despite the fact we didn’t engage with Edge until July. The implementation timeframe was impressive.”</p>
<p>NJCU’s information technology department had to work quickly to acquire the necessary educational tools to make online learning a reality. “I’m so proud of our relationship with IT and appreciative of their dedication,” says Duzgoren-Aydin. “They were offering daily support as everyone transitioned to Zoom and Blackboard and gave additional training on how to use the technology.”</p>

		 
	 
   
			  
		 
	  
  
		        
	  
		 
			 
				
	 
		 
			  “Going forward, every course should have an online component, even if the class is completely face-to face. We will need to broaden the way we think about online teaching and learning. The learning management system will be important, but since each instructor has a different approach, a variety of support, design, and delivery options will be critical.”

			<p>Adapting to Changing Times </p>
<p>As more courses convert to the online learning platform, NJCU is looking at high flex technology and finding solutions based on the feedback from faculty. “As we transition to a new model, instructors want to ensure a quality student learning experience and that learning goals are achieved,” says Duzgoren-Aydin. “Not only will they need technological support, but also help navigating the next steps of high flex technology and understanding student engagement best practices.”</p>
<p>NJCU continues to develop a centralized location for faculty resources and identify ways to improve instructional design to ensure quality online education. “I’d love to connect online learning to an overall teaching and learning center so that we can provide a much more comprehensive, ongoing, and consistent service to faculty,” shares Harrington. “Going forward, every course should have an online component, even if the class is completely face-to face. We will need to broaden the way we think about online teaching and learning. The learning management system will be important, but since each instructor has a different approach, a variety of support, design, and delivery options will be critical.”</p>
<p>Duzgoren-Aydin says the pandemic has revealed the importance of strategic planning and making clear and smart investments. “We continue to listen to our students and faculty and identify the redundant questions and problems to streamline the solutions. The entire education community has to embrace the concept of learning in a new way. We are experiencing a cultural change in a very short period of time. Through this experience, we learned how fragile we are, but also how resilient. Despite the limitations, shortage of funds, and strain on our support staff, we survived and we will emerge stronger and wiser from where our journey started.”</p>

			<p>Next January, <a href="https://njedge.net/edgecon2021/">EdgeCon 2021</a> will be a virtual gathering to connect leaders from Higher Education, K-12, Government, and Healthcare organizations and inspire discussions of technology breakthroughs and best practices. vConferenceOnline, a virtual event solution, will help bring EdgeCon to life by creating an interactive environment and seamless viewing experience. Stephen Wynkoop, the CEO of <a href="https://www.vconferenceonline.com/">vConferenceOnline</a>, Bits on the Wire, Inc., and founder of SSWUG.ORG, has always had a passion for technology and bringing people together online. “I lean heavily into community and I enjoy helping people help each other and have access to the necessary tools they need to succeed,” shares Wynkoop. “Online communities allow people to learn from each other, become friends, and help take everyone’s careers and personal lives to the next level. This thought of embracing community served as the foundational idea behind SSWUG.ORG, a database technology community dedicated to learning and technology.”</p>
<p>Wynkoop founded SSWUG.ORG in 1999 as one of the first cross-platform sites to cover enterprise technologies. Since then, the site has become a go-to resource for articles, classes, and video-based training sessions. “The inspiration for vConferenceOnline, came from SSWUG.ORG,” says Wynkoop. “We were frustrated by the tools that were available for conducting webinars. These options lacked the capabilities to do demonstrations and to learn without a lot of overhead. This challenge led to the genesis of vConferenceOnline and building our own budget-friendly platform.”</p>
<p>Bringing Online Events to Life</p>
<p>The vConferenceOnline platform was built to foster communication and provides a similar experience to what attendees expect from a face-to-face event at a conference center. “You can watch presentations, ask the speaker questions, interact with other attendees in chat lounges, visit exhibit booths, and join round table discussions,” explains Wynkoop. “With multiple rooms and sessions available simultaneously, the experience is very similar to an in-person convention, where you can choose which presentations you are most interested in attending. The platform opens up many possibilities for stimulating, high value content and provides the tools to facilitate a more engaging online event.”</p>
<p>A virtual conference platform is different from a webinar tool in that it is designed to offer the same capabilities as a full-scale in-person event. As most attendees of EdgeCon agree, the networking opportunities are among the most valuable features of the conference. The vConferenceOnline platform has built-in chat capabilities that allow attendees to still connect with each other, discuss pertinent topics, and engage with exhibitors and industry leaders. “I’ve always thought of communities as a kind of conversation,” says Wynkoop. “The chat function lets you see other people’s questions and they can see yours, allowing you to answer back and forth. You will still have the opportunity to make the important connections you highly value from such events.”</p>
<p>Fostering Community and Connection</p>
<p>The vConferenceOnline platform aims to bring people together across desktops and mobile devices, no matter their location. The chat lounge offered through the platform is similar to the lunchroom at an in-person event where attendees can sit down at a table to discuss a specific topic. “With our virtual event solution, you can set up any number of chatrooms to talk about a variety of topics,” says Wynkoop. “An attendee can choose a chatroom from the menu and pop in and out of different conversations. This feature is a powerful way of highlighting areas of interest and allowing people to participate in these topics.”</p>
<p>The platform not only offers several benefits to attendees and speakers, but can provide great opportunities for sponsors and exhibitors to connect with attendees and showcase their organization. “There are a number of options for the exhibit hall, where exhibitors can have videos inside their booths,” explains Wynkoop. “The background design of the booth can be customized to make the atmosphere their own, with places to put posters and banners and advertise in between sessions. Plus, the chat capabilities allow exhibitors to talk to attendees and answer questions.” vConferenceOnline offers many ways for exhibitors to get involved in an event and promote their organization to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Enhancing the Value of Industry Events</p>
<p>Virtual events offer many advantages for attendees, including providing access to a large breadth of content and the opportunity to attend a wider variety of sessions that would not be possible in person. “At an in-person event, an attendee can only be in one place at a time, and you may miss speakers you would really like to see,” explains Wynkoop. “A virtual conference allows a person to catch sessions on-demand, so you will not miss any presentations or discussions that are important to you.”</p>
<p>Adding a virtual component to conferences is likely to become more of the norm going forward, helping to expand the capabilities and reach of such events. “Hybrid events that include both in-person and online opportunities can help expand the attendees’ options for seeing sessions exponentially,” says Wynkoop. “A hybrid event allows the in-person and virtual portions to complement each other—creating a powerful combination.&nbsp; Organizations can still have on-site meetings, but enhance the value of these events by providing access to virtual sessions following the conference. Exhibitors can get additional exposure, including ongoing promotion during an on-demand session, to help keep their brand top of mind following an event.”</p>
<p>Whether an organization wants to host a virtual conference or a hybrid event, the vConferenceOnline platform can help create a seamless, engaging experience in a cost-effective way. Through a wide variety of options for keynote presentations, training sessions, exhibit halls, and networking opportunities, vConferenceOnline can provide the platform and tools necessary to create an unforgettable event.</p>

 Maitrayee Deka, Adam Arvidsson, Rohini Lakshané &amp; Ravi&nbsp;Sundaram  Session <p>Up till now digital technologies have mostly served to create new markets opportunities for the large capitalist monopolies like Facebook, Apple and Google that dominate the global information economy. But what happens when the potential for disintermediation and market making that comes with digital technologies hit the bazaars for of the worlds ‘other economy,’ what Ravi Sundaram has called ‘pirate modernity.’ Indeed this is already happening in two inter-related ways.</p><p>First, the availability of cheap, copied or pirated digital goods like Shanzhai cell phones or pirated video games support a reinvigorated bazaar economy made up of small traders who eek out a living while providing informational goods to the broad popular market segments that large brands do not cater to. This is already an emerging phenomenon in India, Africa and large parts of South America, but similar forms of what Gordon Mathews and his colleagues call ‘globalisation from below’ are gaining an influence in Europe as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Second, the potential for disintermediation on the part of digital technologies like WhatsApp today and blockchain technologies in the near future provide a technical infrastructure for strengthening the organizational basis of such bottom-up markets and enable them to strengthen their standing vis-a-vis capitalist monopolies. Can the ‘pirate economy’ launch its own institution, its own capital markets and its own&nbsp;brands?</p><p>In this session we want to explore the future of bottom-up markets. What happens when traders on Delhi’s electronic bazaars can bypass middlemen connecting directly to their Chinese suppliers via WhatsApp; what happens when informal financial circuits like Hawala networks start operating blockchain technologies? Extrapolating from research on what is going on know we want to collectively imagine what the future might bring. What sort of economic social and, importantly political consequences might these changes bring about? How can we theorise this emergence and how does it challenge and force us to rethink basic categories like capitalism, markets and&nbsp;agency?</p> Plan <p>The sessions will start with presentations on traders in Delhi’s pirate bazaars, blockchain and the democratization of financial markets, impact of mobile connectivity on business and family interaction, and relationship between peer-to-peer, pirate economies, and large media corporations within cultures of circulation. The presentation will be brief (about 20 mins.) and will serve to open up discussions and constitutions form workshop participants.</p><p>Discussions will be centred&nbsp;on:</p>  What are interesting areas of study in understanding how digital technologies are changing the balance of power in the digital economy in&nbsp;India?  What is the potential of digital technologies in relation to the mediation and transformation of bottom up economic processes in contemporary India?  What are the new forms of injustices and/or imbalances are arising form these transformations?  What is the political potential in digital disintermediation in relation to markets, beyond the ‘official paradigm of ecommerce and Uber-like platforms?

     The right to know about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared; 
     The right to delete personal information collected from them (with some exceptions); 
     The right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information; and 
     The right to non-discrimination for exercising their CCPA rights.<br>
Businesses are required to give consumers certain notices explaining their privacy practices. The CCPA applies to many businesses, including data brokers.

It is obvious to even the most tech illiterate by now that regulations over data are becoming more onerous and intrusive against what was more of a wild west type scenario in the early days of data sharing.  The latest proof of this is in the newly enacted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union effective on May 25, 2018 (it happens to be my birthday), and in the shadow of the pending U.S. Encrypt Act, and the most recent state’s effort to tighten the data screws for which the poster child currently is California’s new regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that sets the bar higher than ever before for U.S. companies regarding data privacy regulation. If the bill comes into law in its present form, which this author believes it will not, then companies doing business in the U.S. will require almost the same data privacy controls and capabilities that multinationals need to do business in the European Union require today with some rather ideological exceptions. As always, “failure to protect the data” signals the same need GDPR has for end-to-end encryption, portability, conformity, and data residency.

    <blockquote>
      <p>GDPR was implemented on May 25, 2018 to standardize the data protection law across all 28 European Union (EU) countries. It requires businesses to protect consumers’ personal data for transactions that occur within the EU and affects any US business that operates in the EU.<br>
Unlike GDPR, CCPA only applies to businesses in the state of California, not the European Union. CCPA also focuses on selling personal information for profit, whereas GDPR focuses on data ownership and rights of deletion.<br>

      <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was enacted to provide California consumers with greater transparency and control over their personal information. In many ways, the CCPA is a first of its kind law in the United States: an omnibus statute that seeks to create broad privacy and data protection rules that apply to all industries doing business in one jurisdiction, California, rather than focusing on a single sector or specific data collection and use practices. The CCPA was created in response to changing public perceptions. Users, rightfully, want to understand and have the option to exercise control over their own data.</p>

<p>The Web3 ecosystem has never been more exciting, with the Phase 0 launch of Eth2, the explosion of DeFi legos, and the maturation of collaborative tools like social money, governance products, and creator platforms. All this growth requires better infrastructure and open source tooling, and there's no better time or place to support that than Gitcoin Grants Round 8!</p><p>To celebrate this, we're excited to be sponsors of the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr8/prizes/">Grants Round 8 Hackathon</a>, where the community can support the Web3 ecosystem not just with money but with code, projects and demos that bring this technology to life.</p><p>The hackathon kicks off December 2 on <a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr8/prizes/">Gitcoin</a>, and lasts until December 17. Here’s how to get started:</p>  <a href="https://t.co/edyHGiYb88?amp=1">Register for the hackathon</a>  Check out the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/ceramicnetwork">Ceramic and IDX bounties</a>  <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz/">Hop into the IDX Discord</a> for help or to share what you’re working on. We’re more than happy to help discuss your plans   Ceramic Network Bounties <p>We've partnered with other projects in the ecosystem to offer six bounties totaling more than 5000 DAI!</p><a href="https://gitcoin.co/ceramicnetwork">  @ceramicnetwork | Gitcoin  @ceramicnetwork is a organization who has participated in 0 transactions on Gitcoin  @ceramicnetwork | Gitcoin    </a><p>1. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/38/100024328">Open Prize: Best App or Service that uses IDX</a></p><p>This is an open prize for using IDX to manage decentralized identity information or data. This can include integrating IDX into an existing project, building a new product that uses IDX, building tooling that supports or complements IDX, or any other creative implementation that makes use of IDX as decentralized identity infrastructure.</p><p>2. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/snapshot-labs/snapshot-bounties/2/100024329">Integrate 3Box Profiles into Snapshot's Governance App</a></p><p>Integrate the <a href="https://docs.3box.io/build/web-apps/public-data">3Box Profiles API</a> to add social profiles to the <a href="https://snapshot.page/#/">Snapshot app</a>, adding familiarity and social reputation to this critical governance tool.</p><p>3. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/40/100024331">Add a Discord Verification to Gitcoin using IDX</a></p><p>This bounty is to integrate IDX into Gitcoin to add a discord verification to the others already offered, and lay the foundation for a more decentralized identity and trust system in future Grant rounds!</p><p>4. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/39/100024330">Migrate Eth.Build's Backup Feature to use IDX rather than 3Box</a></p><p>Eth.Build currently uses 3Box to backup user sessions. This bounty is to work with Austin Griffith to replace the existing backup implementation with one that uses IDX for identity and authentication alongside a storage solution like Ceramic, OrbitDB, Textile ThreadsDB or SkyDB.</p><p>5. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/41/100024332">Add Support for new Blockchains to IDX</a></p><p>IDX supports a cross-ecosystem, cross-chain identity model by letting users link any number of blockchain accounts and key pairs to their DID. To support a new blockchain, check out this <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">blog post</a> to learn how.</p><p>Currently, Ethereum and Filecoin keys are supported. This bounty is to add support for additional blockchains. This makes the promise of a portable cross-chain identity more complete, and increases the number of apps and services that can use truly interoperable identity and data.</p><p>6. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/42/100024333">Use IDX and Textile ThreadsDB Together</a></p><p>Build a project that makes use of IDX as an identity protocol alongside Textile's ThreadsDB. To achieve this, during onboarding you can use the IDX SDK to import or create identities, create a Textile ThreadsDB definition for your application's data, add this to users' identity index, and query their index for their data stored by your app or others.</p> IDX: An open identity system for dweb apps <p><a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a> is a new cross-ecosystem decentralized identity and user data management protocol that provides for a single, unified digital identity system that works with all Web3 platforms, blockchains, and storage technologies. IDX is built on <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, a peer-to-peer dataweb for publishing, linking, and querying verifiable information on the open web.</p><p>By design, IDX is completely agnostic as to which wallet users authenticate with and which backend configuration you choose to build with — including any blockchain and data storage system — so it easily integrates into the rest of your stack and allows you to build truly cross-platform interoperable applications. You can save data wherever you choose, and import data from other applications!</p><p>The IDX identity framework allows you to tap into a universal decentralized identity layer that makes user and data management for your dweb app much more open and powerful. IDX provides a universal cross-platform identity (DID) for users that can be used everywhere across the Web3 ecosystem, a way to store/access public metadata such as profiles and social graphs, a way to associate your app’s data storage systems (e.g., Textile, SkyDB) to the user’s identity, a way to discover and import available third-party data sources for the user (even ones outside of the SkyDB ecosystem such as Filecoin files, TextileDBs, OrbitDBs, and much more!), and a way to publish schemas for your data so that others might easily make use of your application data within another application or context.</p><p>This decentralized, unified, and cross-platform identity infrastructure helps Web3 projects build faster and more simply. It is also the key to realizing the vision of giving users ultimate control and portability of their information across applications and networks by breaking down information silos and putting users at the center of the web. With IDX, every user gets a cross-platform decentralized identifier (DID) and an identity index document to which developers can attach various pieces of data relevant to their experience. Since IDX identities are public and permissionless, any developer can openly discover, query, and import data from an identity into their application, creating a rich ecosystem of information around each user.</p>  Good luck to all the hackers!

The world's attention has turned to healthcare this year, with many initiatives exploring the use of open data and standards. Schema.org has made a number of efforts already to contribute to the global Coronavirus response, including the creation of <a href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> markup, improvements around events, jobs, <a href="https://schema.org/docs/cdc-covid.html">hospital reporting</a>, and other schemas to reflect our changed reality.&nbsp; <br>  This week we have invited <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/11/07/open-innovation-heroes-introducing-veterans-job-bank">longstanding</a> Schema.org collaborator Aneesh Chopra to provide an introduction to some important developments in the United States, where Schema.org is being used to improve the accuracy of information about healthcare provider directories.&nbsp; <br>  Guest post by Aneesh Chopra, former U.S. CTO (2009-2012) and President/Co-Founder of <a href="https://carejourney.com/">CareJourney</a>: <br>  Just over 9 years ago, the schema.org community <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/11/schemaorg-support-for-job-postings.html">launched a markup for JobPostings, </a>an important resource to meet a call to action in helping veterans find jobs that valued their skills. During the early months of the pandemic, this community responded with an important upgrade to the nation’s health IT infrastructure to democratize access more <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/connecting-americans-coronavirus-information-online/">trusted health information online</a>. <br>  Today, at an <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/news/events/accelerating-apis-healthcare-year-review-and-momentum-2021">API Summit</a> hosted by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, Kathy Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced an open collaboration that builds upon the same regulations and industry standards to improve another important aspect of the consumer health navigation experience - searching for timely, accurate provider directory information. <br>  For many Americans, finding a health plan that includes their trusted providers is critically important, but often requires tedious work looking up each plan’s provider directory. Sadly, as CMS found in a recent <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/ManagedCareMarketing/Downloads/Provider_Directory_Review_Industry_Report_Round_3_11-28-2018.pdf">review</a>, nearly 50% of provider directories contained inaccuracies regarding whether the provider was accepting new patients, practicing at the address listed, or reachable via the listed phone number.&nbsp; <br>  Regulators have attempted to solve these problems by imposing penalties on government-sponsored plans for inaccurate information, but an additional solution may be at hand. A <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/interoperability-and-patient-access-fact-sheet">provision</a> embedded in CMS’ interoperability regulations requires government-sponsored health plans to publish machine-readable access to timely directory information by July 2021. In an effort to reduce administrative burdens, a multi-stakeholder collaborative is looking to both improve the quality of physician websites to include this information and to enable health plans to source timely, accurate information from them to comply with the rules. <br>  Similar to the work that was done to make it easier for consumers to find <a href="https://carejourney.com/covid-schema-playbook/">COVID announcements</a> on physician websites, such as testing availability, revised office hours or telemedicine services, this collaborative will work to standardize how to publish structured provider directory information. To further simplify the search experience, providers can now publish their website URL when updating their “digital contact information” on CMS’ <a href="https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help-details">NPPES NPI Registry</a>. <br>  Adding structured data from a provider’s website to the portfolio of tools health plans use today – including plan-agnostic reporting tools, “secret shopper” visits, mailings, and a number of emerging data-driven solutions – should result in a reduction in the administrative burden of updating physician directories. Directory maintenance is burdensome. The average practice has over 20 health plan contracts and directories to maintain with over 50% of these updates being conducted via phone or fax. According to a 2019 CAQH (Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare®) <a href="https://www.caqh.org/sites/default/files/explorations/CAQH-hidden-causes-provider-directories-whitepaper.pdf">report</a>, the average practice spends $1,000 each month for directory maintenance. Yet at the same time, physician practices find value in online marketing as a way to attract new patients, and invest an average of $650 per month to design websites and optimize search results, according to a study by <a href="https://thescript.zocdoc.com/how-much-do-other-practices-spend-on-marketing/">Zocdoc</a>. A web standardization effort will therefore have multiple benefits. It will allow physicians to more efficiently communicate useful information via search engines that can also be used to populate health plan directories and to meet regulatory compliance, thus reducing administrative burdens.&nbsp; <br>  CareJourney, with support from The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, seeks to engage public and private sector stakeholders in an effort to accelerate the development and adoption of <a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a> web standards for physician information, and to curate a portfolio of tools to structure this information on a practice’s website. Our goal is to improve consumer access to provider information while lowering physician burden. We anticipate the following benefits:&nbsp;<br>  Increased consumer access to high-quality, accurate provider information, such as whether a doctor, practicing at this location, is seeing new patients from my plan.   Consistent webpage documentation and maintenance practices that are sufficient to meet health plan regulatory requirements   Improved search engine results by leveraging the structured website markup&nbsp;  This effort will benefit from the active participation of the healthcare community and we welcome additional participants to play a part in our initiative. Assistance in testing and providing feedback on the proposed web standards will be critical and extremely helpful in further promotion and adoption. Once the resulting open information and markup instructions are freely available, we welcome assistance in the widespread dissemination. Finally, we are grateful the prominent search engines are engaged in a process for site maintenance that ensures physicians keep their websites properly structured at the lowest possible administrative burden. <br>  Thank you, in advance, for your interest in advancing this important work! Please sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5bMFAAOoQm-AkVtOQQFHeQvPHoWw_1CAwZ1GvMtr0Bd4ZEg/viewform">here</a> to participate!           <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<p>By Wafa-Ben Hassine, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>I believe it can. And it must. As a human rights attorney, I come at this issue thinking about people&nbsp;first.</p><p>Whether its messaging a family member asking them to bring home a loaf of bread, or discussing next year’s business strategy with a colleague, secure encryption ensures we can have private conversations and guarantees the integrity of our communication. Users’ quick adoption of encrypted, private messaging speaks volumes of its importance: billions of users worldwide use encrypted messaging on a daily basis as an indispensable tool in their livelihoods.</p><p>While the examples above are innocuous, we know that encrypted messaging platforms can also be used for more nefarious purposes. And with these platforms’ breadth, reach, and the undetectable nature of the content of conversations, we are deeply concerned about the harms that their deployment creates. Examples include <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-44856910">lynch mobs in India</a>, <a href="https://mediaengagement.org/research/encrypted-propaganda/">widespread disinformation</a> on the coronavirus pandemic in Mexico and the US, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/whatsapp-skewed-brazilian-election-showing-social-medias-danger-to-democracy">swaying election results</a> in Brazil, facilitating global <a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2019/9/13/20863489/encryption-stanford-conference-facebook-ncmec-ghq">child abuse</a>, and providing white supremacists the channels needed to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/karstenschmehl/whatsapp-groups-nazi-symbol-stickers-germany">spread Nazi propaganda</a> in Germany and the&nbsp;US.</p><p>But we can’t just blame encryption for these harms. Encryption is universally regarded as a <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&amp;id=p::usmarcdef_0000246527&amp;file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_832e8e2a-88a0-4df2-a332-c945a30d9f8f%3F_%3D246527eng.pdf&amp;locale=en&amp;multi=true&amp;ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000246527/PDF/246527eng.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A145%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D">prerequisite for the exercise of rights</a> like freedom of expression, and freedom to privacy online. It is a means to a fundamental end. With the Internet increasingly permeating every aspect of our lives, encryption is a technology that will not and should not go away anytime soon. Health and financial institutions also utilize encryption to ensure that individuals’ personal information is safe from identity theft and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>We need to disrupt the status quo that materially benefits the large tech companies that provide these platforms (often for free), who then turn a blind eye to the harms they can cause. Researchers, civil society groups, and governments should be able to have select information on how the technology is operated and used — e.g. market sizes based on geography, metadata about how information travels, peak use and dynamics, etc. — all appropriately aggregated so as to protect individual privacy — so they can better understand the nature, type and impact of these harms, and ultimately, help propose ways to fix them. And tech platforms who provide these services should be ultimately accountable for ensuring their safety and&nbsp;quality.</p><p>I joined Omidyar Network to lead and support the type of work that can change that status quo. Our goal is to work with our partners to advance a robust, evidence-driven, and sensible public conversation that ensures encrypted messaging is safe, trustworthy, inclusive, and doesn’t sacrifice encryption and privacy. One that, based on my professional background, respects and upholds human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>To do that, we must start by envisioning the kind of messaging we want to see. The debate around whether we should, or should not encrypt, is a non-starter. Instead, we should ask: What kind of information do researchers need to help understand and prevent some of the issues we see? What pressure points can we identify to tilt the balance with policymakers? What does accountability look like in an encrypted ecosystem that in some instances, verifiably led to rampant organized disinformation and propaganda campaigns? What can different stakeholders do to stop the exploitation of technological gains benefitting privacy?</p><p>Answers to these questions will help us collectively conceive of more effective ways to mitigate any harmful byproducts of private, secure messaging, and begin to truly enjoy all that it has to&nbsp;offer.</p><p>As social activist and author Alice Walker said: “Look closely at the present you are constructing: it should look like the future you are dreaming.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/can-encrypted-messaging-be-safe-inclusive-and-respect-human-rights-f8ad28e53443">Can Encrypted Messaging Be Safe, Inclusive, and Respect Human Rights?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Q&amp;A covers election misinformation, content moderation, and&nbsp;COVID-19 Oumou Ly (left) interviews Joan Donovan (right) for The Breakdown from the Berkman Klein&nbsp;Center.<p>The 2020 US election was marked by misinformation and bad actors stemming from domestic&nbsp;sources.</p><p>In this episode of The Breakdown, Oumou Ly, an Assembly staff fellow at the Berkman Klein Center is joined by Joan Donovan, the director of The Technology and Social Change Project (TaSC) at Harvard Kennedy&nbsp;School.</p><p>Read the transcript, which is lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou, I’m a fellow on the Assembly: Disinformation Program at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard. Our topic of discussion today continues the discussion of the election. I am joined today and thrilled to be joined today by Joan Donovan, who is the Research Director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Dr. Donovan leads the field in examining internet and technology studies, online extremism, media manipulation, and disinformation campaigns. Thank you Joan for joining&nbsp;us.</p><p>Joan Donovan (JD): Really excited to talk about this stuff&nbsp;today.</p><p>OL: So our discussion today centers on domestic actors and their goals in purveying disinformation, and we would be remiss if not to mention that at the time it was this recorded, just last night, the president fired Chris Krebs who was the head of CISA at DHS, the agency within the federal government that takes the lead on countering, mitigating and responding to disinformation, particularly as it relates to democratic processes like elections. Joan, what do you sort of make of this late-night firing, this last-minute development?</p><p>JD: If you study disinformation long enough you feel like you’re looking through a crystal ball in some instances. So we all knew it was coming, even Krebs had said so much. And that’s because countering disinformation, it’s a really thankless job, in the sense that it wasn’t just the fact that Krebs had built an agency that over the course of the last few years really had flown under the radar in terms of any kind of partisan divides, had done a lot of work to ensure election security and cared about the question of disinformation, misinformation as it applied to questions about election integrity, right?</p><p>So CISA and Krebs [weren’t] trying to dispel all of the crazy myths and conspiracies out there, but they were doing their part within their remit to make sure that any kind of theory about voter fraud was something that they took seriously and took the time to debunk. And so it wasn’t necessarily just the kinds of tweets that were coming out of CISA, but it was really about this website that they had put together that was really a kind of a low budget version of Snopes in the sense that the website it’s called Rumor Control. And the idea was very simple which was provide [a] very rapid analysis of any conspiracy or allegation of election fraud that was starting to reach a tipping point, not everything, but things that started to get covered in different areas, covered by journalists, and to give people an anchor that says, “This is what we know to be true at this&nbsp;moment.”</p><p>Of course, as the president has come to refute the election results rather forcefully online, Krebs’ role became much more important as a vocal critic with the truth on his side. And over the last few weeks, especially the last week, we’ve seen Trump move anybody out of his way that would either contradict him in public or would seriously imperil his desire to stay in the White&nbsp;House.</p><p>OL: That makes me think of something that I think about a lot recently, particularly over the last four years, but especially in 2020, is this use of disinformation as political strategy by the GOP. It seems like one pillar of that strategy is just [a] want to spread disinformation. The second is to sort of leverage our institutions to legitimize the information that they’re spreading. And the third is just to accelerate truth to get in a matter that’s advantageous to the GOP’s particular political aims. How do you respond to that? And how do you think the information ecosystem should be organizing around that problem? That is, that we have a major political party in the United States for whom this is [a] strategy for&nbsp;them.</p><p>JD: They’re really just leveraging the communication opportunities in our current media ecosystem to get their messaging across. And in this instance when we know where the propaganda is coming from, that is it’s coming from the White House, it’s coming from Giuliani, it’s coming from Bannon, it’s coming from Roger Stone, how then do we reckon with it? Because we actually know what it is. So the concept of white propaganda is really important here because when we know what the source is, we can treat it differently. However, the difference between something like what went down in 2016 and what happened in 2020 is an evolution of these strategies to use some automated techniques in order to increase engagement on certain posts so that more people see them, coupled with serious, serious money and influence in order to make disinformation travel further and&nbsp;faster.</p><p>The third thing about this communication strategy in this moment is that the problem really transcends social media at this point where we do have our more legitimate institutions starting to bow out and say, you know what? We’re not even gonna try to tackle this, where like for us, it’s not even an issue, because we’re not gonna play into allegations that there’s voter fraud, we’re not gonna play into any of these pet theories that have emerged about Hammer and Scorecard and Dominion. And if you’ve heard any of those keywords then you’ve encountered disinformation. But it does go to show that we are immersed in a hyper-partisan media ecosystem where the future of journalism is at stake. The future of social media is at stake. And right now, I’m really worried that the US democracy might not survive this&nbsp;moment.</p><p>OL: I completely agree with you. And that is a really scary thing to think. Can you talk a little bit about sites like Parler, Discord, Telegram, Gab. Just recently after the election, Facebook disbanded a group called Stop the Steal, and then many of those followers found a new home on Parler. The Parler app then went #1 on Apple’s iTunes downloads chart. Why are sites like this so attractive to people who have a history of creating affinity around conspiracy theories?</p><p>JD: So I think about Gab, for instance… me and Brian Friedberg and Becca Lewis <a href="https://mediarep.org/bitstream/handle/doc/13283/Post_Digital_Cultures_49-65_Donovan_ea_Parallel_Ports_.pdf?sequence=3">wrote about Gab </a>post the Unite the Right Rally, because Gab really put a lot of energy into recruiting white supremacists who were being removed from platforms for terms of service violations. And they were basically saying, “we’re the free speech platform. And we don’t care what you say.” And for Gab that went overhead pretty fast, where they did have to start banning white supremacists. Because unfortunately what you get when you make a platform that emphasizes lack of moderation is you get some of the worst kind of pornography you can ever imagine, no style, no grace, nothing sexy about it just — Here’s a bunch of people in diapers, right? Like it’s just not good. And so right now these minor apps that are saying on we’re unmoderated, come one, come all are actually facing a pretty strong content moderation problem where trolls are now showing up pretending to be celebrities. There [are] lots and lots of screenshots out there where people think they heard from some celebrity on one of these apps. And it’s really just a troll with a fake account. But this moment is an opportunity for these apps to grow and they will say and do anything in order to capture that market&nbsp;segment.</p><blockquote>Right now, we’re having a crisis of stability in terms of content moderation policies.</blockquote><p>If we think about infrastructure, as all three things: the technology, the people that bring the technology together including the audiences, and the policies. Right now, we’re having a crisis of stability in terms of content moderation policies. And so people are seeking out other platforms that increase that kind of stability in their messaging because they wanna know why they’re seeing what they’re seeing and they want for those rules to be really&nbsp;clear.</p><p>OL: Picking up on that content moderation thread to talk about larger and sort of more legacy tech platforms more broadly, what is your sense of how well content moderation, and maybe even more specifically labeling efforts, work? We saw Twitter and some of the other platforms to do a pretty, I think, comparatively good job when compared with the past. Slapping labels on the president’s tweets, but that’s because there was an expectation that there would be premature claims of victory. What’s your sense of how well it minimizes virality?</p><p>JD: So we don’t really know or have any data to conclude that the labeling is really doing anything other than aggravating people.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>JD: Which is to say that, we thought that the labeling was gonna result in massive reduction and virality. In some instances you see influencers taking photos or just screenshots of the labels on their tweets on Twitter, and then you saying like look, it’s happening to me as a kind of badge of honor. But at the same time when done well, they convey the right kind of&nbsp;message.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don’t think any of us anticipated the amount of labels that were gonna be needed on key public figures, right? And so I imagine that okay, they’re gonna do these labels for folks that have over a hundred thousand followers on Twitter, or they’re gonna show up on YouTube and in ways that deal with both the claims of voter fraud, but also the virality. But it’s hard to say if anybody’s clicking through on these labels, I’ve clipped through some of them and the information on the other side of the label is totally irrelevant. That is it’s just not about the tweet or any, it’s not specific&nbsp;enough.</p><p>Which is to say that, in watching the tech hearing this week, Dorsey seem[s] to not really be committed to a content moderation policy that deals with misinformation at scale. And as a result, what you get is these half measures that we don’t really know what their effect is gonna be. And for the partners in the fact-checking world that power partnered with Facebook, they’re now under a delusion of allegations that they’re somehow partisan and they’ve been weaponized in a bunch of different ways. And so I don’t even know what the broad payout is to risk your reputation as a news organization, to do that kind of fact-checking on Facebook, where Facebook isn’t really committed to removing certain kinds of misinformation.</p><p>OL: Joan, why is medical misinformation different than other types of information we see circulating, maybe related to elections or other democratic processes?</p><p>JD: So when we think about medical misinformation, we’re really thinking about well, how quickly are people gonna change their behavior, right? If you hear that coronavirus is in the water, you’re gonna stop drinking water, right? If you hear that it’s in the air, you’re gonna put a mask on. And so the way in which people receive medical advice, really it can stop them on a dime and move them in a different direction. And unfortunately, we’ve entered into this situation where medical advice has been polarized in our hyper-partisan media environments. And there’s been some <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/24/qa-how-pew-research-center-evaluated-americans-trust-in-30-news-sources/">recent studies</a> that can even show the degree to which that polarization is happening that is really leading people to downplay the risks of COVID-19. And this has a lot to do with them encountering misinformation from what they might consider even trusted&nbsp;sources.</p><blockquote>Unfortunately, we’ve entered into this situation where medical advice has been polarized in our hyper-partisan media environments.</blockquote><p>And so when we think about the design of social media in this moment, we actually have to think about a curation strategy for the truth. We need access to information that is timely, local, relevant, and accurate. And if we don’t get that kind of information today, people are going to continue to die, because they don’t understand what the real risk is, they don’t understand, they don’t understand how they can protect themselves. And especially as we enter into this holiday season, where a lot of people are starting to relax their vigilance and are hoping that it won’t happen to them, that’s the exact moment where we need to crank up the health messaging and make sure that people understand the risks and have seen some form of true and correct information about COVID-19. Because I’ll tell you right now if you go on social media and you start poking around, sure there’s a couple of interstitials, or there’s a couple of banners here and there, but we can do a lot better to make sure that people know what COVID-19 is, what the symptoms are, how do you get tested, how to keep yourself safe and how to keep your loved ones safe as&nbsp;well.</p><p>OL: I’m just curious what are the sorts of data points you’ve seen that would explain why some people don’t necessarily believe information from authoritative sources about the spread of COVID-19. Why are some people inclined not to believe that authoritative information?</p><p>JD: It’s a good question. And part of it has to do with the echo chambers that they’ve been getting information in for years. We’ve started to see certain Facebook groups, that maybe it’s a local Facebook group and you’ve been in it a long time and is about exchanging like of the free list, exchanging things in your neighborhood. And then people slowly start to talk about these really important issues. And misinformation is introduced through a blog post or an article. Or I saw this on the quote-unquote news, and you find out that they’ve been watching one of these hyper-partisan news sources that [are] downplaying what’s happening. And so you kind of see it in the ephemera, but our journal, the <a href="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/">Harvard Kennedy Misinfo Review</a>, we’ve published research around even within the right-wing media ecosystem, the degree to which someone watches a lot of, let’s say Hannity versus Tucker, they’re gonna have different associations with the risk of COVID-19, because it’s covered differently these folks that are at the same outlet. And so it’s really important to understand that this has to do with the communication environment that is designed and the fact that people are really trying when they’re sharing things that are novel, or outrageous or things that might be medically incorrect. They’re doing it in some cases out of love. They’re doing it just in case, and maybe you didn’t see this. And it’s an unfortunate situation that we’ve gotten ourselves into, where the more outrageous the conspiracy theory, the more outlandish the claim, the more viral it tends to be. And that’s an unfortunate consequence of the design of these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>OL: Thank you so much for joining me today Joan, I really enjoyed our conversation.</p><p>JD: That’s great, thank you so much. I really appreciate you doing these&nbsp;series.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-joan-donovan-on-domestic-misinformation-da4f60296420">The Breakdown: Joan Donovan on domestic misinformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <p></p>
<p>What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning?</p> 
<p>I am the Director of Partnerships at Simprints, a non-profit technology company with the mission to radically increase transparency and effectiveness in global development, making sure that every vaccine, every dollar, every public good reaches the people who need them most. Practically, I lead a passionate and determined team to develop partnerships with a variety of other stakeholders within the international development space — iNGOs, technical providers, governments, etc.</p>
<p>What gets me out of bed in the morning (besides a strong cup of coffee)?</p>
<p>It’s seeing our sector throw millions of dollars into programs that simply do not reach the people they’re intended for. It may be that some of these programs are&nbsp; reaching beneficiaries and we just don’t know it but there is a data discrepancy of up to 50% in vaccination programmes. That means that we just don’t know whether or not 50% of beneficiaries received the intended services. Without real-time, accurate data linked to an individual, it’s like we’re fighting poverty and disease blindfolded. I must admit that makes me really angry </p>
<p>Simprints looks to address the “accuracy” piece by deploying biometrics to create unique IDs for each beneficiary. Our sense of purpose is really strong and the people that I get to interact with on a daily basis are an awesome, committed, smart, capable, passionate team.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I kind of stumbled my way into it!&nbsp; In my previous life I was a crisis counsellor, working with folks who were often at their most desperate – survivors of assault and trauma, people suffering with addiction or those feeling suicidal. I worked across a number of countries (Zambia, South Africa, the U.S., China) and the impact was incredibly tangible. I really loved it and sometimes I do miss the day to day buzz of that work. But I felt we were always just reacting to some of the world’s larger more systemic issues. I wanted to get involved in driving forward change that will make a real difference for the future.</p>
<p>So, I decided to shift towards the global health and international development sectors. &nbsp;The main reason we are in this space is to create greater transparency and trust around the whole issue of identity and biometrics.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>This is going to sound a real cliche but, honestly, it was to trust myself. I know I won’t get things right all of the time but being able to cut through the noise and listen to myself was a huge learning curve for me. I noticed that the more I did it, the better results I had. Even if I was still wrong, at least I could own it as my own decision instead of something that was decided for me by others</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>There are 1.1 billion people in this world that lack a formal identity. When you are working on developing identity solutions for the masses, don’t forget about those folks! There is a massive gap in the amount of data being used to underpin programmes. This can lead to complacency and an acceptance that data – and therefore resources – will be misused. We have to stop this NOW!</p>
<p>If you continue to focus on narrow proprietary solutions, we will never get a truly holistic view of the individual. And when you are talking about healthcare programmes, this can lead to life-threatening situations. For instance, a midwife working in Dhaka’s Beguntila needs a single view of her patient, complete with medical histories. Often the Mother won’t have a formal ID, date of birth or other identifier so ensuring the correct interventions are given is incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>We need interoperability across the identity sector. At the end of the day all of the work we are doing will need to intersect so anything we can do as a global community to start that work now will be key! Your people have the talent, the passion and the ideas – make sure you use ALL of them and encourage knowledge sharing appropriately.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Achieving global impact is never the outcome of one individual. It is achieved by having a strong collective – one that it is diverse in background, ethnicity, opinion, education, gender, sexuality, ability …. We work closely with Community Health workers on the ground because they bring knowledge and experiences that feed straight into our product development.</p>
 What book or film would you recommend to your fellow members and why? 
<p>IMy choices all lay out (in a very readable, story-like way) the incredible histories / backgrounds of some of the most effective and ground-breaking global development interventions of our time.</p>
<p>Whatever It Takes by Paul Tough (an in depth look at the inspiration behind the Harlem Children’s Zone in the U.S.)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Mountains Beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder (biography of Paul Farmer who is a founder of Partners In Health), and Banker To The Poor by Muhammad Yunus (story of how he started Grameen Bank).</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>You’re going to be just fine. Keep doing what you do and stop worrying so much about what others think.”</p>

 Outlining three essential narratives in the political history of the&nbsp;Internet <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/pdefilippi">Primavera De Filippi</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jortizfreuler">Juan Ortiz Freuler</a>, and <a href="http://www.joshuatan.com/research/">Joshua&nbsp;Tan</a></p><p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large portion of social interactions have moved online. While our interactions in the physical world are affected by national lockdowns and social distancing rules, our interactions in the digital space are increasingly affected by online operators and algorithmic gatekeepers. Proposals such as the <a href="https://contractfortheweb.org/">Contract for the Web</a> can help us navigate through some of the current challenges, yet new narratives might be needed to navigate the uncharted waters&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>A declaration is a political act, which describes what should be done. A narrative is a political tool, which elaborates on why it should be done. We sketch here three essential narratives in the political history of the Internet: the libertarian narrative, the corporate narrative, and the nationalist narrative. Each narrative emerged from a community of shared interests; each calls for a set of institutional arrangements; each endures in today’s politics. And each has something to teach us as we build new narratives to shape the future of the Internet.</p> The libertarian narrative: cyberspace as an independent space <p>In 1996, John Perry Barlow, poet of the Grateful Dead and founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, drafted <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>: “Governments of the Corporate World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we&nbsp;gather.”</p><p>Indeed, the early Internet relied on a <a href="https://www.smallpieces.com/">loosely-networked system</a> of small, private servers which was relatively free from regulatory interference. From its inception in 1989 to the year of Barlow’s declaration, this system had evolved into a global infrastructure connected through a series of open and standardized protocols — one where everyone with sufficient technical knowledge and means could deploy a server without seeking permission from anyone. But the relative absence of regulation <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/laws_cyberspace.pdf">does not imply</a> the impossibility of regulation. Things changed rapidly as governments and corporations began to see the potential of this global network, leading subsequent critics to point out that Barlow’s claims about state sovereignty (“You have no sovereignty where we gather”) were inaccurate or, at best, <a href="https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/march-april-2006-can-we-know-everything/jp-barlow-cyberspace-still-anti">wishful thinking</a>.</p><p>Still, declarations are judged not by the facts they assert but by the myths they create. Barlow’s Declaration articulated a vision of the Internet as a libertarian space, free from any form of regulatory control. It spoke to the highly meritocratic, get-stuff-done ethos of early Internet pioneers — to whom the Declaration was originally addressed — while glossing over the pivotal role of governments in funding and regulating the underlying infrastructure of the Internet. It told a story that was both fearless and optimistic, and in so doing rallied a movement of digital activists who would stand up and fight to preserve their newfound digital freedoms. Such a libertarian narrative was, however, not the only narrative that emerged in the early years of the Internet.</p> The corporate narrative: access through advertising <p>The first clickable web ad <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/10/1027hotwired-banner-ads/">was served in 1994</a> by an online publication then known as HotWired. By clicking on a banner, users would be taken to the <a href="http://thefirstbannerad.com/youdid.html">landing page</a> of AT&amp;T’s “You Will” ad campaign. For the first time, websites and advertisers could see not only the number of banner impressions on a website but also the number of click-throughs.</p>The first banner ad, served by HotWired.com (later Wired.com), for an AT&amp;T ad&nbsp;campaign<p>The two-sided, advertisement-based business model first tested at HotWired eventually gave rise to the Internet as we know it today: one where we can search through Google, watch YouTube, and catch up with friends on Facebook — all for “free”. Ad revenues funded the Web’s growth, spurring and sustaining a swath of online services that we now regard as essential services on the&nbsp;Web.</p><p>This ad-based business model engendered a powerful new narrative for the corporate Web. To its proponents, web advertising was a positive force: it massively expanded access to Internet services; sustained independent projects and websites across the Internet; and matched relevant ads to those who would benefit from them the most. In a way, those with purchasing power were subsidizing access to those who had&nbsp;none.</p><p>To this day, many people maintain a positive view of the role that Internet giants like Google (“don’t be evil”) and Facebook (“move fast and break things”) played in the development of the Internet. To its detractors, the ad-based business model was the economic basis for a new and extractive system of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook">surveillance capitalism</a> and <a href="https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Avila.pdf">digital</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527476418796632">coloni</a><a href="https://sur.conectas.org/en/digital-sovereignty-or-digital-colonialism/">alism</a> very different from the open and permissionless web promised in the libertarian narrative. Yet, to those complaining about the commodification of personal data and the commercialisation of Internet content, the proponents of this corporate narrative would respond that, while companies like Google, Facebook or Twitter could have funded their online services by directly charging users, how many people would have been able and willing to pay for that service? Would the Web have been more “open” and “free” had it been sectioned off into siloed paywalls in its early&nbsp;years?</p><p>All political narratives have an institutional agenda, in the form of a set of business models, governance systems, or ways of life. The corporate narrative emerged to defend a set of institutional arrangements that serve the interests of a specific set of social, commercial, and political actors. But once it is articulated, the same narrative can be deployed for a range of different uses and interests. For example, the narrative of access through advertising has been used to defend everything from zero rating programs such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/27/16050446/facebook-net-neutrality-digital-colonialism-internet-org">Facebook’s Free Basics</a> to the rise of <a href="https://medium.com/mediarithmics-what-is/what-is-a-walled-garden-and-why-it-is-the-strategy-of-google-facebook-and-amazon-ads-platform-296ddeb784b1">walled gardens</a> in the Web 2.0. And those who benefit from a given institutional arrangement will often change over time — witness, for example, the way in which advertising has shifted away from the operators of discrete websites to a new class of algorithmic intermediaries that manage large inventories of online ad&nbsp;space.</p>Sketch of where narratives stand across key dimensions<p>Narratives can also be used to narrow or redirect the debate away from a particular set of issues. Just as the libertarian narrative obscured the legal and regulatory arrangements that enabled the early Internet to emerge, so the corporate narrative deliberately introduces a dichotomy between advertising-based business models and pay-for-access solutions. Yet, this vision reflects a limited perspective of the institutional alternatives available to us. We delineate below a set of different narratives that might help overcome this dichotomy.</p> The nationalist narrative: national hegemony and&nbsp;control <p>As governments began to see the Internet as a critical infrastructure for economic development, political stability and national security, a new narrative has emerged, focused on national sovereignty and control. China’s Great Firewall is probably the most popular example of this emerging narrative, but it is certainly not the only one. In the past few months, several governments have intervened, regulating access to the Internet, framed as an attempt to protect their national sovereignty — sometimes even going as far as disconnecting from the global network (or at least threatening to do so, perhaps as an attempt to increase their negotiating power). For instance, the U.S. recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/github-ban-sanctioned-countries/">required GitHub to block access to its platform in Iran</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20904030/adobe-venezuela-photoshop-behance-us-sanctions">Adobe to refuse access to the Venezuelan government</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/26/russia-starts-testing-its-own-internal-internet/">Russia has taken steps to create a national intranet</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/china-moves-to-ban-foreign-software-and-hardware-from-state-offices/">Chinese government started banning foreign software and hardware in government offices</a>, and the Trump administration <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/tiktok-trump-and-need-digital-non-aligned-movement/">is advocating for a “Clean Network” agenda, aimed at excluding Chinese software and hardware</a> from the U.S. territory, and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>This type of fragmentation is not particular to the digital space; nor can it be encapsulated in a left-right wing dichotomy. It is present in the Brexit and the “America First” narratives, in the growth of blocks like <a href="https://cyberbrics.info/">BRICS</a>, in the nationalistic speeches of India’s Modi, in the xenophobic waves in Europe and elsewhere, and in the closing of borders all over the world in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also present in more progressive approaches advocating for national or regional autonomy: calls to resist the technological, industrial, cultural and agro-economic dependency to the currently dominant nation-states and corporate actors.</p>Comparing different narratives The need for a new narrative? <p>These three established narratives did not properly address a wide variety of grievances that emerged over the years, as more and more of our social interactions became online interactions. People disenchanted with the state of the Internet coalesced into smaller camps to address the grievances which remained unattended and unresolved.</p><p>These include a multiplicity of groups, with different objectives in mind: those who advocate for the need to further the development of the Internet as a <a href="https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/redecentralizing-the-web/">decentralized global network</a>; those who condemn the growing influence of governments <a href="https://logicmag.io/bodies/another-network-is-possible/">and consolidated corporate actors</a> as a form of <a href="https://autonomy.work/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Avila.pdf">digital</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527476418796632">coloni</a><a href="https://sur.conectas.org/en/digital-sovereignty-or-digital-colonialism/">alism</a> or extractive surveillance capitalism; those who defend the <a href="https://colorofchange.org/">rights of minorities</a>, women and systematically excluded groups, and those who criticize the current Internet landscape as enabling the propagation of hate. While most of these communities would benefit from uniting their forces in a shared front, they have so far failed to coordinate their actions — thereby reducing their ability to ensure that their respective interests and values are effectively catered&nbsp;to.</p><p>In contrast, the libertarian, corporate, and nationalist narratives enjoyed tight coordination towards the propagation, consolidation, and attainment of the goals set out by their respective interests. The libertarian narrative was born within the circles of like-minded technologists often in a position of power, and whose coordination was driven by a shared ideology. The corporate narrative emerged from an increasingly-consolidated set of corporate actors who could easily coordinate their lobbying strategies in favor of their shared vested interests. Lastly, the nationalist narrative benefited from an existing bureaucracy that was already well-trained in elaborating and propagating well-articulated narratives to a population that often perceived them as natural extensions of their pre-existing nationalist values.</p><p>The other groups were left with a multiplicity of grievances that were more difficult to articulate into a cohesive set of actions or a concrete institutional proposal. The lack of a shared narrative contributed to this failure of collective action. While the power imbalances that exist between these dispersed groups and the more coordinated actors backing up the other three narratives could be seen as a potential source of this coordination failure, another limiting factor in achieving proper coordination is the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2687120">wide discrepancy</a> of rights and values brought forward by these disparate groups. The problem with this framing is that it further underlines the differences that keep these groups apart, rather than focusing on what they all have in common. For example, women fighting against hate and discrimination, decentralization advocates pushing for more openness and interoperability, and global south activists requesting a seat at the table in global policy discussions all share a common objective: more equality and a level playing&nbsp;field.</p><p>With the evolution of the Internet from a voluntary network of private actors mostly located in the developed West, to a global commons available to the public at large, it has become more and more important to discuss whether we can develop <a href="https://twitter.com/nielstenoever/status/1243960008259391488">a public network on privately-owned infrastructure</a>. In its early days, the Internet was regarded as a “public” infrastructure because of its permissionless nature. The Web was neither owned nor controlled by any single individual or entity; it functioned through collective adherence to a common set of protocols and standards. Later, as Internet adoption burgeoned during the 1990s (jumping from 1% adoption in the US to almost 50% by 1999) and as the Internet became home to a wide range of private, commercial, and governmental online services, “public interest” considerations emerged, especially with regard to accessibility, free speech, privacy and security. By 1999 — with the publication of <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2687120">what is now regarded as the first</a> <a href="http://www.pccharter.net/charteren.html">“bill of digital rights”</a> — cyberspace had already started to pick up the qualities of a public square, inspiring new analogies such as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/">digital public parks</a> and <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/the-case-for-digital-public-infrastructure">digital public infrastructure</a>.</p><p>Despite their different orientations, these unattended grievances marked the emergence of a wide variety of proposals, manifestos, contracts and constitutions for the Internet, which all share one common observation: as the Internet has become a public space, rights must be safeguarded on cyberspace at least as much as they are in the physical space. Yet, the argument goes, current arrangements have failed at providing substantially just and procedurally legitimate solutions.</p><p>The multistakeholder model of Internet governance promoted through <a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a>, the United Nations <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/">Internet Governance Forum</a>, and the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/ip-development/en/agenda/recommendations.html">WIPO Development Agenda </a>has been presented as an attempt to mediate the grievances of these different groups. Yet, this specific approach to Internet governance has been subject to criticism due to the growing perception that it has fallen under corporate capture. The multistakeholder model — allegedly designed to serve the public interest — is being condemned as a <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/publication/multi-stakeholderism-a-corporate-push-for-a-new-form-of-global-governance">guise for watering down the legitimate role of governments</a> in the pursuit of a neoliberal ideology or corporate interest, or as a means of <a href="http://twentyseven.fibreculturejournal.org/2016/03/08/fcj-198-new-international-information-order-niio-revisited-global-algorithmic-governance-and-neocolonialism/">forwarding the compound interests of a small set of corporate and state actors from the&nbsp;north</a>.</p><p>The ingredients for an effective shift in the way the Internet operates are already there. The current sources of discontent are varied in nature, yet they are not necessarily distinct. If the strategy of consolidated power is to keep critics divided, it is all the more crucial to underline the commonalities that subsist underneath these different struggles. The goal is to form a united front that actually leverages these different narratives, bringing a multiplicity of actors (including software engineers, activists, legal experts and policy-makers) together around a stronger consolidated narrative. We need a narrative that can accommodate all these grievances into a cohesive and coherent story, enabling proactive cooperation across these groups. We need to bridge the gaps between these separate narratives, even if that requires acknowledging that we all speak different languages, and that we are all looking at a similar problem, from distinctly situated perspectives.</p>A sketch of alternative narratives Declarations, new and&nbsp;old <p>As we navigate new governance challenges, these narratives — new and old — are already being used to mobilize collective action and rally political will. Understanding these narratives can help us write better manifestos. But seeing these narratives side-by-side can also help us understand the interplay and interdependence that subsists between these narratives: for example, the degree to which the corporate narrative is an outgrowth of the libertarian one, the extent to which the nationalist narrative feeds on the perceived failures of the former two, and the conflict or overlap between different variations of the blockchain and dweb narratives. Understanding these patterns in political storytelling can help us identify those liminal gaps between narratives where new narratives, new politics, and new declarations might&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>Acknowledgements: this document grew out of discussions at the “<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iD_d8qovuZcXdxH1RX_3Sjw9YHMtVgmOVsgl_hLOl34">Building blocks of Web 3.0</a>” workshop held at Harvard Law School in the spring of 2020.

<p>Women in Identity spoke to Erdoo Yongo, Policy &amp; Advocacy Manager at GSMA – the industry body for the mobile telecoms sector. Given the prevalence, and significance, of mobile phones and mobile technology across the globe, we wanted to know how she sees the development of ‘identity’ in this space – and whether policies and products really have the individual user at their core.</p>
 What do you love most about your job? 
Erdoo Yongo
<p>I work within the Mobile for Development department that explores how mobile technology can be used as a platform to create growth and reduce inequalities. To really understand the impact mobile can have on people, my role spans two areas: the Digital Identity programme and Mobile for Humanitarian Innovation programme.</p>
<p>My work involves uncovering the policy-related barriers that individuals face in accessing mobile services. Identity is a gateway to some of the most fundamental resources and services including healthcare. My responsibilities focus on high-level policy research. It is vital that we fully understand the different approaches governments around the world take to ID. We saw this year how COVID-19 released a whole new reliance on mobile technology. But in some countries, no ID meant no SIM – means no connection, not to family and friends and also, sometimes, not to school resources, financial support or healthcare initiatives.&nbsp; My research focuses on creating an evidence base that can be used to campaign for better access to all these vital services.</p>
<p>I am of Nigerian heritage but born and bred in the UK.&nbsp; I am very aware that we don’t connect with the concept of ID as they do in countries where a national ID is mandated by the government. In many of the countries I have researched, citizens value mobile services even more than they do basic things like food services or banking. It is a lifeline but, if it is tied to ID, it can exclude millions of people who – for whatever reason – don’t have a recognised identity.</p>
<p>So, to answer the question …. what I love most about my job is that it relates very much to the provision of vital life services. And, because very few people are involved in this kind of work, I really feel it is valued.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>It was an accident! I started within GSMA’s Digital Identity team as an intern. I stumbled across the internship through ‘The Brokerage’ – a social mobility network that focuses on providing opportunities for young people from disadvantaged communities, helping them take their first step into a professional career. Before seeing the internship, I had no idea who GSMA was or what they did. My internship lasted for just under a year but a number of opportunities arose which enabled me to progress from an intern to my current role. I feel it was a mixture of luck and positioning that got me to where I am today.</p>
 Luck???? Really ….? 
<p>OK…:)&nbsp; Maybe there was some hard work and risk-taking along the way!&nbsp; I studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Manchester University and was always interested in international development and humanitarian issues. So I guess being curious and not afraid to ask questions was a help! I think I was willing to take more risks too when I was younger – guess you have less to lose! I went for the GSMA internship even though it was initially advertised for 3rd year undergraduates – and I knew nothing about ‘identity’!! I’d just graduated but loved the sound of it so I went for it – and got a place!!</p>
<p>It is hard to do things that – on the face of it – look like there’s no chance of success. But what have you got to lose? I hope I retain that element of me, but it does get harder as your career develops </p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Good question. I guess it would be “You are in control of your destiny”. When I first started at GSMA I was pretty timid. I didn’t really know what I was doing and tended to expect that opportunities would come to me from my manager. Now, 3 years in, I realise that I am the only person who can control and direct my career. If I want exposure to certain things, I need to carve out the opportunities myself.</p>
<p>To this end I now recognise how important it is to have a mentor who can help you – especially in the early years. I was one of the first interns within GSMA’s 2017 intake and it was pretty scary coming out of university and into a corporate role. I didn’t really have a mentor but do feel it would have been beneficial. I now mentor others within the GSMA and externally at Queen Mary’s University as I feel it is so important to have someone ‘safe’ who can help you chart your path.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am the only person who can control and direct my career</p></blockquote>
 What do you feel needs to change in the identity sector? 
<p>We need to attract more people into our sector. As yet, it is still a relatively unknown sub-sector of “technology” and I feel I sort of stumbled into it by accident! Most young people would just look at it and assume the only opportunities are in computing or coding. Yet here we are chatting – a Policy person and a Communications person, both working in Identity! </p>
<p>There are so many great ways you can develop your career in this sector – we just need to promote it better!</p>
 In a nutshell, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>As individuals we are all unique in our own way with different skills, qualities and ideas. In ‘identity’, we are all about the individual, yet our teams often look very homogenous. This creates an underlying tone that you need to conform and it is better just to fit in than to challenge the way we do things.</p>
<p>Greater diversity in our teams will bring a different way of looking at the world – leading to different solutions for the problems it faces.</p>
<blockquote><p>In ‘identity’, we are all about the individual, yet our teams often look very homogenous.</p></blockquote>
 What book or film would you recommend to your fellow members and why? 
<p>I recently watched the film&nbsp;Palm Trees in the Snow. It is based on the Spanish novel&nbsp;by Luz Gabas.</p>
<p>After the death of her father, a young Spanish woman embarks on a journey to discovers&nbsp;generations of family secrets. Typically, movies show colonialism from a British or American perspective, so this it was really intriguing to see it from the Spanish perspective.</p>
<p>Also … as most of the dialogue is in Spanish, it was good to practise my Spanish listening skills, though I admit I did rely heavily on the subtitles!</p>
 Finally, what piece of advice would you give to the teenage Erdoo? 
<p>Keep on getting to know yourself.</p>
<p>We go through life prioritising situations and others and we tend to lose sight of ourselves.</p>
<p>Remember that as an individual you will change, mostly without even recognising it. I implore people to continue learning about themselves – their values, goals and ambitions – it’s the only way to stay true to yourself.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Sarah Douglas
<p>I’m the VP of Global Communication and Marketing for SecureKey Technologies, a leading identity and authentication provider that simplifies consumer access to online services and applications. The idea of finding new stories to tell in an exciting way gets me out of bed in the morning, and digital identity is no different. I feel very privileged to be able to tell the digital identity story to Canadians and to showcase how we are leading the world in the ecosystem-based approach of identity. I think one of the most important skills is to be able to find and tell meaningful stories in new and creative ways that are easy to understand – which isn’t very different from the lessons I teach to my kids. Finding meaning in every story helps broaden your horizons and appreciate the unique perspectives of a wide variety of people. Every story is an opportunity to better understand the world around us.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Where I am today can be summed up in three words: determination, flexibility and creativity. I’ve done every job from being a receptionist and graphic designer, to a visual stylist and an event planner all around the globe to where I am now. There is value to be taken out of every role, and I welcomed every opportunity that came my way with open arms and an open mind. You need to be determined in finishing every task you’ve been given to the best of your ability, flexible to go down avenues you may not have considered – but that can bring you to great places – and creative enough to make the most challenging opportunities successful.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>For me, this lesson is very straightforward and applies to every aspect of my life: always be kind to those around you. People will remember your kindness, your willingness to help and your ability to go the extra mile every day. With kindness, people will be more inclined to work with you in true partnership which always delivers the best results. Ruling with kindness will take you much farther than ruling with fear.</p>
<blockquote><p>Diversity breeds creativity in a sea of digital sameness.</p></blockquote>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>My advice to any CEO, whether they’re in the identity space or not, is to know your audience. Without having a good sense of who your target audiences are at every stage of your product’s lifecycle, you’ll fall short of your goals. Messaging won’t hit home, digital and traditional marketing won’t be optimized, customer bases won’t grow as quickly, and investors won’t see your growth potential. Digital identity in particular is a challenging topic to cover – you can’t be everything to everyone right away. You need to start with individuals who understand the value-add and can act as ambassadors for your product before moving on to audiences who are less familiar with the concept. Educating new audiences takes time, and it’s essential not to rush or bypass this process.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity breeds creativity in a sea of digital sameness. Working with a diverse group of different voices and lived experiences allows you to broaden your horizons and see the world through someone else’s story. I subscribe to Miriam-Webster’s word of the day email blasts and multifarious coincidentally landed in my inbox as I wrote this. Good leaders will live their personal and professional lives in the pursuit of multifariousness, or they will always fall short.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>Read – and read a lot. I don’t align with any one genre. Much like my professional drive of telling good stories, reading good stories from any perspective and in any voice is just as important. The more you answer “yes”, the more you can learn (and I am currently reading The Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes).</p>
<blockquote><p>The more you answer “yes”, the more you can learn</p></blockquote>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Take every opportunity that is given to you, and don’t be afraid of taking chances. I’m so proud of where I am today because I was open to opportunity. I’ve lived abroad, travelled the world and done so many things that required an open mind and a resounding “yes”.</p>

<blockquote><p>Diversity is essential not just for success – but for existence.</p></blockquote>
 Tell us a little bit about you 
Titi Akinsanmi
<p>I am a digital policy expert currently serves as Policy and Government Relations lead for West and Francophone Africa at Google.</p>
<p>I’m also the lead on Privacy for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>I’m a published academic, with a BA in English from OAU, Ile-Ife in Nigeria; a Masters in Public Policy from University of Witwatersrand in South Africa and an LLM from Osgoode Law School (specialising in Privacy and Cybersecurity).</p>
<p>I was a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard from 2018 – 2020; I sit on the boards of digital economy, arts and youth development related institutions and currently serve as an advisor on the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on the Digital Economy.</p>
<p>With over 20 years’ experience in the digital ecosystem, I have learned to live my life focussed on four key principles:</p>
<p>Inspire.</p>
<p>Inform.</p>
<p>Involve.</p>
<p>Impact.</p>
 What drives you forward? 
<p>In my undergraduate years while running for election to the role of librarian, I got inspired and hooked on the famous Latin saying by René Descartes: ‘Dubito, Ergo Cogito, Cogito Ergo Sum. Or… “I doubt, therefore I think. I think, therefore I am.” Where I am today has been shaped by my personal quest to become the change that is needed. For me this has meant transitioning from focussing on the use of technology to creating the policy and regulatory ecosystem necessary to allow innovative technologies to be adopted across all of society.</p>
<blockquote><p>Where I am today has been shaped by my personal quest to become the change that is needed.</p></blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Be courageous. Do not allow negative doubt and failure to disable you. Just tell yourself: “I am more than enough and much more” </p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>Let us rethink our approach to data: the ways we use and reuse it and, most importantly, the people and context that help generate this ‘infinite’ resource.</p>
<p>It is the 21st century, and the world is at the fingertips, ears and eyes of those that are digitally connected. Innovations in data and information technology are rapidly outpacing statutes, policies and regulations and 2020 has further entrenched the idea that our social and economic lives are fuelled by data – from video conferencing to healthcare. We have a huge opportunity but this has also brought global attention to the risks and threats (including the issue of data protection in relation to personal consent).</p>
<p>We must continue to press for privacy-based trust frameworks and put consent at the heart of our innovations.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the very life blood that enables us to create, exist and succeed! Without it we – and any other living being would cease to exist. Whether in the environment or the identity ecosystem, diversity is essential not just for success – but for existence..</p>
 What book/film would you recommend to your fellow members? And Why? 
<p>Honestly?? There are way too many to name just one. It really depends on the state of mind </p>
<p>Recommended books would include:</p>
<p>Ake by Prof. Wole Soyinka;</p>
<p>Wedlock of the Gods by Zulu Sofola;</p>
<p>The Beautiful Ones Are Not Yet Born by Ayi Kwei Armah;</p>
<p>Weep Not Child by Ngugi Wa Thiongo;</p>
<p>Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe.</p>
<p>And I love to read historical romance !!!</p>
<p>Favourite film is: Black Panther.</p>
<p>Why? These all speak of the experience of those in the minority portraying the, at times, harsh realities of their existence in a deeply divided and biased world.</p>
Black Panther. Source: Disney
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“Be You To The Full”</p>
<p>Be courageous and you will succeed. Enjoy every moment. Be present in the present. Make memories &amp; don’t be afraid of tomorrow.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> is a hosted 3ID account management and authentication system for browser-based Ceramic applications that allows users to onboard to applications and transact with Ceramic documents by signing authentication messages with their blockchain wallets. Try a demo of 3ID Connect <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here</a>.</p><p>3ID Connect already supports Ethereum accounts, but this tutorial will show you how to add support for accounts from new blockchains to 3ID and 3ID Connect. This is the final part of a three-part series on 3ID Connect. Previous posts:</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>   About 3id-blockchain-utils <p>All of the core functionality for supporting accounts from new blockchains/networks in 3ID and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> is provided by the <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils">3id-blockchain-utils</a></code> package. This library allows the creation and validation of public links that cryptographically bind a blockchain account to a 3ID DID method using Ceramic documents. It also allows 3ID Connect and other similar 3ID account management/authentication libraries to create these public links as well as add the blockchain account as an authentication method capable of controlling a DID.</p><p>To add a new blockchain, you will need to implement a few functions in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils"><code>3id-blockchain-utils</code></a>. Before beginning, take a peek at the library to explore examples of current blockchain implementations such as Ethereum, Polkadot, and Filecoin. Then, continue with the process outlined below.</p> Fork 3id-blockchain-utils <p>Start out by forking the <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils">3id-blockchain-utils</a></code> library on Github. This will allow you to make changes locally and then push everything up in a Pull Request once you're done.</p> Create your files <p>First, create a file with the following path <code>src/blockchains/&lt;blockchain-name&gt;.js</code> to contain the JavaScript code that implements your blockchain. Then, create a file with the <code>src/blockchains/__tests__/&lt;blockchain-name&gt;.test.js</code> path to contain any tests for your blockchain.</p> Adhere to CAIP standards <p>In the interface seen below, note that &nbsp;<code>namespace</code> and <code>AccountID</code> use <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs">ChainAgnostic (CAIP) standards</a>. <code>namespace</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md">CAIP-2</a> which specifies a standard id to represent any blockchain and/or network. For example, this is 'eip155' for Ethereum and 'fil' for Filecoin. <code>AccountID</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md">CAIP-10</a> which defines a standardized way to represent any account on any blockchain.</p><p>If a CAIP standard for the blockchain or network you want to add support for does not already exist, follow directions in the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs">CAIP Github</a> repo to add it.</p> Implement the interface <p>You must create a BlockchainHandler module that exports the following interface which takes a CAIP-2 <code>namespace</code> and three functions: <code>authenticate</code>, <code>createLink</code>, and <code>validateLink</code>.</p> <code>interface BlockchainHandler {
  namespace: string;
  authenticate(message: string, account: AccountID, provider: any): Promise&lt;string&gt;;
  validateLink (proof: LinkProof): Promise&lt;LinkProof | null&gt;;
  createLink (did: string, account: AccountID, provider: any, opts?: BlockchainHandlerOpts): Promise&lt;LinkProof&gt;;
} 
</code> <p>Now, let's implement the interface.</p> authenticate() <p>The <code>authenticate</code> function allows a blockchain account to be added as an authentication method (authMethod) to a 3ID. This means using your blockchain account you will always be able to access that 3ID and derive its <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a> for use, for example in 3ID Connect. This function consumes the following:</p>  <code>message</code>: string, can be any string  <code>AccountID</code>: an instance of a CAIP-10 AccountID  <code>provider</code>: specific to your blockchain. This is any standard signer or provider defined for your blockchain. Ideally your ecosystem has a widely-accepted standard interface so that this module can support signing by most accounts.  <p>The function should be implemented such that the given <code>AccountID</code> signs the given <code>message</code> using the given <code>provider</code>, and then returns a fixed length string deterministically derived from the signature.</p><p>The only strict requirements here are that:</p>  The string derivation is deterministic, and will return the same string for a given message + AccountID combination.  Unique messages return unique strings.  <p>Typically implementation looks as follows:</p> <code>async function authenticate(message: string, account: AccountID, provider: any): Promise&lt;string&gt; {
  const address = account.address
  // convert message into proper input for your signer, ie object, encoding, etc
  const payload = toPayload(message, address)
  // use provider to sign message
  const signature = await provider.sign(payload, address)
  // typically good to hash and return, so that fixed length hex string is returned
  return sha256(signature)
}
</code>  createLink() <p>The <code>createLink</code> function allows a blockchain account to create a verifiable link proof that publicly binds the blockchain account to a given DID. In Ceramic, these these link proofs can be used to create <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-7/CIP-7.md">CAIP-10 Link Documents</a> which allow anyone to look up the 3ID DID linked to your blockchain account, and then resolve any other public info linked to your 3ID. The DocIDs of your CAIP-10 Link documents can be stored in the IDX <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-21/CIP-21.md">Crypto Accounts documents</a> for simple lookup.</p><p>This function consumes similar arguments as described above. It also consumes the 3ID DID string that is being linked. This function is implemented such that when the given <code>AccountID</code> signs a <code>message</code> including the given <code>DID</code> with the given <code>provider</code>, a LinkProof is returned.</p> <code>async function createLink (did: string, account: AccountID, provider: any, opts: BlockchainHandlerOpts): Promise&lt;LinkProof&gt; {
  const address = account.address
  // util function that returns standard message string including did 
  const linkMessage = getConsentMessage(did)
  // convert message into proper input for your signer, ie object, encoding, etc
  const payload = toPayload(linkMessage.message, address)
  // use provider to sign message
  const signature = await provider.sign(payload, address)
  const proof: LinkProof = {
    // version and type are implementation specific context used for verifying linkProofs later
    version: 2,
    type: 'eoa',
    message: linkMessage.message,
    signature: signature,
    account: account.toString()
  }
  return proof
}
</code>  validateLink() <p>Lastly the <code>validateLink</code> function validates a given LinkProof. This allows anyone to easily verify linkProofs and for Ceramic to validate &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-7/CIP-7.md">CAIP-10 Link Documents</a>. The function consumes a LinkProof and returns the LinkProof if valid, otherwise it returns null. Valid typically means that the given signature in the LinkProof is valid over the given message and is created by the given account.</p> <code>async function validateLink (proof: LinkProof): Promise&lt;LinkProof | null&gt; {
  const account = new AccountID(proof.account)
  const address = account.address
  const payload = toPayload(proof.message, address)
  // specific to how ever you verify signatures
  const res = await verifySignature(proof.signature, payload)
  return res
}
</code>  Open a pull request <p>Now that you have implemented the required interface and have included the necessary tests with adequate coverage, open a pull request in <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils">3id-blockchain-utils</a></code>. Once reviewed, it will be merged and released.</p><p>When opening a pull request, please be sure to minimize the size of new dependencies and/or try to use libraries that are likely shared across blockchain implementations. If you include large, one-off dependencies in your PR, support for the blockchain may not be included by default in other libraries like <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code>.</p> Usage in 3ID Connect <p>After adding support for the blockchain in <code>3id-blockchain-utils</code>, it is easy to use these newly supported blockchain accounts with 3ID Connect. 3ID Connect consumes this functionality through an AuthProvider. You can implement an AuthProvider in your own codebase and/or also submit a pull request to 3ID Connect so that others can easily use it as well.</p><p>The interface for AuthProvider can be found below, and we will use the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect/blob/develop/src/authProvider/ethereumAuthProvider.js">ethereumAuthProvider</a> as an example. You can reference that code for more details, and find the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect/blob/develop/src/authProvider/abstractAuthProvider.js">AbstractAuthProvider</a> interface to reference.</p> <code>class EthereumAuthProvider extends AbstractAuthProvider {
  constructor(ethProvider: any, address:string ): string {
    //...
  }

  async authenticate(message: string, address:string): Promise&lt;string&gt; {
    // call authenticate from 3id-blockchain utils, encode any params as needed
    // ...
    return authenticate(message, accountId, this.provider)
  }

  async createLink(did: string, address: string): Promise&lt;LinkProof&gt; {
    // call createLink from 3id-blockchain utils, encode any params as needed
    // ...
    return createLink(did, accountId, this.provider, { type: 'eoa' })
  }
}</code> <p>Once you have an authProvider you can now use your newly supported blockchain accounts to authenticate and link accounts to 3IDs in 3ID Connect. You can reference the "<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>" post for more details, but you simply have to pass your AuthProvider when connecting to 3ID Connect.</p> <code>const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()
const authProvider = new yourAuthProvider(yourProviderOrSigner, addressOrAccount)
await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)</code>  That's it! <p>This tutorial covered how to implement support for any simple key pair account on any blockchain in 3ID Connect. However, these interfaces also allow support for more complex account implementations such as contract accounts that may support multi-sig accounts and other account or identity features. It may be possible to add support for other types of accounts in the future as well.

<p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> is a hosted 3ID identity management and authentication system for use within browser applications that allows users to use their existing blockchain accounts to onboard to applications, control/authenticate their DID, and interact with Ceramic documents. We covered a full overview of 3ID Connect, how it works, and various user flows in a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">previous post</a>. You can try a simple demo of 3ID Connect in a browser application <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here</a>.</p><p>This guide will walk you through how to add 3ID Connect to your browser-based Ceramic application. It is the second part of a three-part series on 3ID Connect. Other posts include:</p>  Previous: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  Next: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect</a>   Installation <p>Install 3ID Connect into your browser application using npm.</p> <code>npm install 3id-connect@next</code>  Usage &amp; Authentication <p>During application runtime, 3ID Connect can help you onboard decentralized identities to your application while allowing your users to leverage their existing blockchain wallets to provide authentication signatures.</p><p>First, import 3ID Connect:</p> <code>import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'
</code> <p>Then use an AuthProvider to connect a blockchain wallet to 3ID Connect. AuthProviders typically consume a signing interface and an account or address. </p> <code>const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()
const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()

const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])

await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)
</code> <p>In the future there will be support for AuthProviders using accounts from many different blockchains and services, however right now Ethereum is primarily supported. In the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">"Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect"</a> post we detail how to add support for new blockchain accounts as AuthProviders. This would allow your users to use different blockchain wallets to authenticate 3IDs in 3ID Connect.</p> Application Interactions <p>Once connected using an <code>authProvider</code>, you can begin to interact with 3ID Connect. However most often your application will not directly interact with 3ID Connect; instead you will just get a <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">DID Provider</a> from 3ID Connect which will allow you and your users to interact with a number of other libraries that require DID authentication, signing, encryption, etc such as <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Ceramic</a></code>. The library consuming the DID Provider will request authentication and permission from 3ID Connect when necessary.</p> <code>const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()
</code> <p>For example you can now instantiate <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">js-idx</a></code> and <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code> with the DID Provider and a user can create and update Ceramic documents with their DID using 3ID Connect.</p> <code>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client'
import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'

const ceramic = new Ceramic(&lt;'LOCAL_CLI_NODE_OR_REMOTE'&gt;, {didProvider})
const idx = new IDX({ ceramic })
</code>  Experimenting with Ceramic <p>The simplest way to to get started using 3ID Connect as a DID Provider for a Ceramic node is by running a local node using the Ceramic CLI. To do this you'll need to install the Ceramic CLI and then you can create and update Ceramic documents for your application's data.</p> <code>$ npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli
$ ceramic daemon</code> <p>Once the daemon is running, the Ceramic API will be available at <code>http://localhost:7007</code>.</p> Additional ways to install 3ID Connect <p>This guide demonstrates how to directly install 3ID Connect into your Ceramic application. However, 3ID Connect is also included out of the box as a dependency in the <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/libs-web">IDX Web SDK</a>. If you're building browser-based applications and want to use the full IDX protocol for decentralized identity and user-centric data, we recommend checking it out.</p> Further Reading <p>Check out the other posts in this three-part series on 3ID Connect:</p>  Previous: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/what-is-3id-connect/">What is 3ID Connect?</a>  Next: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect</a>   Questions? <p>Reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p>

Other posts:</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">Add authentication with new blockchains in 3ID Connect</a>   What is a DID? <p>DIDs is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standard</a> for globally-unique, persistent decentralized identifiers. These identifiers have an associated DID document which contains public keys used for signature verification and encryption. There are currently more than 60+ implementations of DIDs, called methods. The primary DID method for end-user accounts on Ceramic is called 3ID.</p> DID Providers <p>DID providers are lightweight libraries that implement the standard <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a> interface for a particular DID method. DID providers allow for creating DIDs, signing data, verifying data, encrypting data, and decrypting data. A DID provider needs to have a currently authenticated DID, then be passed to a Ceramic instance in order to allow the user to perform transactions on Ceramic. <code><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">3id-did-provider</a></code> provides this interface for the 3ID DID method.</p> Key Management <p>Like any other asymmetric cryptographic account, DIDs have a public identifier that is controlled by a private seed (pneumonic/private key). Therefore, building applications with Ceramic functionality requires that this DID seed is managed and protected in a secure way. When a 3ID DID is created using the raw <code>3id-did-provider</code> interface, it is up to the wallet or application developer to decide how to manage this seed.</p><p>This flexibility in DID key management is desirable considering the many different runtime environments where you might want to build a Ceramic application. For example in a React Native application, you might want to use the device's local storage to store a 3ID seed. Alternatively, you might want to implement your application using a custodial key management solution so users don't need to worry about keys at all.</p> 3ID Connect: A hosted 3ID wallet for browser apps <p>3ID Connect is a secure DID wallet purpose-built for Ceramic browser applications which offers all the <code>3id-did-provider</code> interfaces, but wraps them in a novel solution to key management and authentication using one or more blockchain wallets that your users already have. By using 3ID Connect, neither users nor developers need to worry about managing DID keys and instead users can rely on the key management of their blockchain wallet(s) to protect their DID seed.</p><p>During the process of onboarding to an application, 3ID Connect makes it seamless for users to create a 3ID, permission one or more blockchain accounts to authenticate/control their 3ID, and grant applications permissions to utilize their DID in various ways using signatures provided by this blockchain account. Instead of needing to provide the raw <code>3id-did-provider</code> to your application's Ceramic node in order to transact with the user's Ceramic documents, you can simply pass 3ID Connect as the user's DID provider.</p><p>This multi-account-to-one-DID model provides resilience against identity loss while offering additional security benefits. When more than one blockchain account is connected to a single DID, the only way a user could ever lose control of their DID is if they simultaneously lose control of all of their blockchain keys. This type of catastrophic key loss scenario is highly unlikely and improves security by delegating and distributing DID key management to all of a user's blockchain wallets. Additionally since each blockchain account is considered an equal "owner" of the DID, any account can remove any other account at any time. This allows a user to deprovision an account in the case that particular wallet account is compromised or lost, without losing their DID.</p><p>3ID Connect also provides many other benefits:</p>  Intuitive data consent management screens let users know which permissions they're giving to the application  Simplified user onboarding flow removes DID creation and key management friction, and remembers which permissions a user has given to an application on future visits so they don't need to sign unnecessary messages each time  Users can publicly link their blockchain accounts to their DID, which allows data associated to the DID (such as linked profiles, social graphs, verified social accounts, other blockchain accounts, application data, etc.) to be resolved by simply looking up the blockchain account   How it works  Architecture <p>3ID Connect is a hosted 3ID account management application that runs in an iFrame window alongside any applications which have <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">installed the 3ID Connect library in their app</a>. The 3ID Connect library communicates with the iFrame application over an RPC interface. It implements RPC calls to support functionality in 3ID Connect and most importantly relays any DID provider calls from the application to the <code>3id-did-provider</code> instance running in the iFrame. </p><p>The iFrame application uses <code>3id-did-provider</code> , <code>js-ceramic</code>, and <code>js-idx</code> in combination to support all keychain and identity management operations. It also connects to a community Ceramic node managed by the <a href="https://3box.io">3Box Labs</a> team, to persist all 3ID and IDX related Ceramic documents. The 3ID Connect application is hosted on AWS under the <code>app.3idconnect.org</code> domain.</p> Key Management System <p>3ID Connect uses Ceramic, the 3ID DID provider, the <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX identity protocol</a>, and blockchain wallets to manage the DID's seed and authentication data in a secure, decentralized manner. The various components of this system are outlined below.</p><p><code>3ID DID Method</code>: An implementation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) stored on Ceramic. 3ID Connect uses 3IDs as end-user identities.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js">3id-did-provider</a></code>: A DID provider interface for the 3ID DID method.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic</a></code>: A node that implements the full Ceramic protocol. 3ID Connect connects to this node over an HTTP API and uses it to store 3IDs, as well as other documents described below.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">js-idx</a></code>: A JavaScript/TypeScript library which implements the IDX decentralized identity protocol for keeping track of data associated with a DID in a decentralized manner.</p><p><code><a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/concepts/index">IDX Index</a></code>: A key-value store document which contains an index of a DID's personal information. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID document of the <code>3ID DID</code>.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a></code>: A document which stores copies of the DID's seed encrypted to their various authentication methods. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID's <code>IDX Index</code>. When a user authenticates with a blockchain account in 3ID Connect, this DID seed is decrypted inside the iFrame.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-21/CIP-21.md">Crypto Accounts document</a></code>: A document which stores a list of blockchain accounts that are publicly linked to a DID, along with their <code>CAIP-10 Link</code> proofs. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID's <code>IDX Index</code>.</p><p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-7/CIP-7.md">CAIP-10 Link document</a></code>: A document which acts as a proof that publicly binds a blockchain account to a DID. This document is stored on Ceramic and a reference to it is included in the DID's <code>Crypto Accounts document</code>.</p><p><code>iFrame localStorage</code>: A local store which stores a decrypted copy of the DID's seed (which permanently resides inside the <code>3ID Keychain</code>) under the 3ID Connect domain, and permissions granted to each application under each application's domain. These secrets are stored in the iFrame for convenience and user experience. Even if all data is lost from the iFrame it can always be resynced from the <code>3ID Keychain</code>, using the path <code>3ID &gt; IDX Index &gt; 3ID Keychain</code>.</p><p><code>Blockchain wallets</code>: Key management and signing solutions for accounts on blockchain networks. These providers are used for user authentication and permissions management in the 3ID Connect system. They are used to sign messages, and encrypt and decrypt the DID's seed which is then stored in the <code>3ID Keychain</code>. 3ID Connect currently supports Ethereum wallets, but any blockchain that supports deterministic signatures can easily be added. See <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">this tutorial</a> to learn how to add support for accounts from a new blockchain in 3ID Connect.</p> 3ID Connect User Flows <p>In the next post, "<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-use-3id-connect-in-browser-applications/">How to use 3ID Connect in browser applications</a>," we guide you through installing 3ID Connect in your application. In the section below, we walk through some of the most common user flows that your users can experience while using 3ID Connect within your application. These flows will shed light on how the various components of the key management and authentication system described above work together. Try a simple demo app that includes 3ID Connect <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">here.</a></p><p>Users of your application will encounter one of a few 3ID Connect flows depending on: 1) whether or not they already have a 3ID linked to their blockchain account; and 2) whether or not they have previously used their 3ID with your application. </p><p>Here are the four different flows described in this section:</p>  The blockchain account has a 3ID, and the 3ID has previously used this domain.  The blockchain account has a 3ID, but the 3ID has not yet used this domain.  The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to create a new 3ID.  The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to connect to an existing 3ID.  <blockquote>Some of the examples below show 3ID Connect being used with the MetaMask browser extension wallet on Ethereum, but any other wallet on any other blockchain would have a similar flow.</blockquote> Onboarding Flow 1 <p>The blockchain account has a 3ID, and the 3ID has previously used this domain.</p><p>If the user's blockchain account already has a DID, and if they have already provided your application's domain with the permissions that are being requested during a previous session, the user will automatically be authenticated into your application. No action will need to be taken on the user's part and they won't see any 3ID Connect windows. Because 3ID Connect had stored the keys and permissions in iFrame localStorage from a previous session, they will be used for this session and all future sessions.</p> Onboarding Flow 2 <p>The blockchain account has a 3ID, but the 3ID has not yet used this domain.</p>The 3ID Connect permissions screen will appear in the corner of your browser window.<p>If the user's blockchain account is already connected to a 3ID (likely from using 3ID Connect in a separate application) but they have not yet provided your application with the permissions that you're requesting, then the user will see a 3ID Connect permissions window. After clicking "Continue", the user will be authenticated. </p> Onboarding Flow 3 <p>The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to create a new 3ID.</p><p>If the user's blockchain account does not have a 3ID, they will be prompted with a 3ID Connect new account window which provides them with the option to "Create new 3ID" or "Link existing". If the user clicks "Create new", behind the scenes 3ID Connect will perform a series of actions to initialize a new 3ID and connect their blockchain account to it.</p>The 3ID Connect new account screen<p>First, 3ID Connect creates a new 3ID enabled with IDX.</p>  Create a new 3ID DID on Ceramic  Create a new IDX Index on Ceramic  Create a new 3ID Keychain on Ceramic  Create a new Crypto Accounts document on Ceramic  Store the DocID of the IDX Index inside the 3ID  Store the DocID of the 3ID Keychain inside the IDX Index  Store the DocID of the Crypto Accounts document inside the IDX Index  <p>Next, 3ID Connect adds the blockchain account as an authentication method for the 3ID.</p>  The user is prompted to sign a message with their blockchain account that says: <code>Add this account as a Ceramic authentication method</code> (see above). From the resulting signature, an encryption key is deterministically derived. Because determinism is used to derive the encryption key from the signature, the user is always able to regenerate this encryption key wherever they can sign the same message with this same blockchain account.  3ID Connect encrypts the seed of the DID with this derived encryption key (called an <code>authMethod</code>).  3ID Connect stores this encrypted seed in the 3ID Keychain document on Ceramic.  <p>Lastly, 3ID Connect publicly links the blockchain account to the 3ID.</p>  The user is prompted to sign a message with their blockchain account that includes their DID (see above). 3ID Connect then uses this signed payload to create a CAIP-10 Link document which binds the blockchain account to the 3ID.   3ID Connect stores the DocID of the CAIP-10 Link document inside the DID's Crypto Accounts document.  <p>After the user has completed the steps above, they will now have a new 3ID that can be controlled by a blockchain account. Upon completion, they will see the 3ID Connect permissions window. Once approved, the user will be authenticated. </p> Onboarding Flow 4 <p>The blockchain account does not have a 3ID, and the user wants to connect to an existing 3ID.</p><p>If the user clicks "Link existing" instead of "Create new" when they see the 3ID Connect new account window, they will enter a flow where they connect their current blockchain account to an existing 3ID. </p><p>To accomplish this, 3ID Connect will redirect the user to an external domain where the user can: 1) see their other 3IDs currently managed in their 3ID Connect window; 2) search for 3IDs not currently in the 3ID Connect window; and 3) manage the account linking process. By default, 3ID Connect will redirect this flow to the domain of an 3ID identity management application (to be announced).</p><p>Behind the scenes, this flow will then execute the second and third steps outlined in Flow 3 to add the blockchain account as an authentication method for the 3ID, and publicly link the blockchain account to the 3ID.</p><p>Once the user has completed these steps, they will be redirected back to the original application domain and see the 3ID Connect permissions window. Once approved, the user will be authenticated.</p> Security Considerations <p>The current implementation of 3ID Connect makes a number of usability and security tradeoffs. The development team has a list of planned security improvements for the future, but here are a few things to be aware of with 3ID Connect as it's implemented today: </p>  While the code is open source, the application is still hosted by 3Box Labs. In the future this could be hosted on IPFS and resolved through ENS or IPFS.  Key material is kept in iFrame local storage. While it is sandboxed and we restrict any third party JavaScript from running in the app, local storage is still vulnerable to known attacks.  Phishing attacks and/or malicious websites could impersonate 3ID Connect screens and/or have the user sign a message that allows that attacker to access their DID kept in the iFrame.

<p>The truth is that women don’t self-promote as much as men. But they should and here’s why – Your personal brand is valuable. Demonstrating your expertise consistently will create both career and business opportunities. When your true talents are understood, recognised and noticed, it’s far more likely you’ll be tapped on the shoulder for relevant and interesting assignments&nbsp;or opportunities – you will stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>In 2019 Harvard Business Review (HBR) ran a detailed <a href="https://hbr-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/hbr.org/amp/2019/12/why-dont-women-self-promote-as-much-as-men">study</a> where they&nbsp; found a large gender gap in self-promotion —men rating their performance 33% higher than equally performing women. To understand what’s driving this gap, HBR looked at two factors that might influence one’s level of self-promotion: confidence (you may be unsure of your actual performance) and strategic incentives (you may talk up your performance to get a raise or promotion).&nbsp; The HBR results found that men engaged in substantially more self-promotion than women. For example, despite the fact that men and women performed equally well in the given test, men rated themselves an average of 61 out of 100 while women only rated themselves a 46 out of 100. This self-promotion paid off: workers who rated their performance more highly on the 0 to 100 scale were more likely to be hired and offered higher pay.</p>
<p>Many women may feel uncomfortable talking about their accomplishments and promoting themselves directly. But there are other ways to show your skills and knowledge when building a personal brand. Content curation and creation is a good way to share your ideas and build a positive reputation at scale. I would also suggest having a personal LinkedIn strategy that really amplifies your brand and demonstrates your knowledge whilst often helping others.</p>

<p>One of the quickest ways to build your personal brand is by growing a LinkedIn network – reaching out and connecting with your peers, thought leaders, alumni, clients and prospects. Once you have a high value group of people to talk to, you should invest time into sharing your insights and knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a member/supporter of <a href="https://womeninidentity.org/">Women in Identity</a> can play a very important role in helping you to become part of a well-established community.&nbsp; Being part of a group like WiD means that others will help you to shine and “raise you up” which can often be the lift that we all need.&nbsp; This is where “not for profit” organisations really help us to broaden our horizons by giving us access to mentors, coaches, leaders and other members who can inspire us!&nbsp; So, congratulations on being part of something so much bigger that will not only help you but will help so many others too, collectively making a difference by changing hearts and minds on such an important issue.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;Your personal brand is valuable</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are my quick tips for building your personal brand on LinkedIn and getting yourself noticed in an already crowded marketplace:</p>
 
 Optimise your LinkedIn profile page – Spend some time and energy bringing your profile to life. Talk to the challenges you solve for clients, your unique skill set and your deep expertise. Complete the ‘featured’ section on the profile page – add your capability statements, video interviews, articles and press releases.<br>
Remember you are trying to stand-out from 690 million members on the platform! 
 Personalise your Connection Strategy on LinkedIn – It is time to identify who you need to talk to on the platform and get yourself in front of them. Think carefully about who the players are that need to see you and hear you in their feed. Once you have identified this group of people, you need to sit down and reach out individually sending personalised and authentic ‘connection requests’. 
 So, you now look good on LinkedIn and you now have a growing relevant audience. It is time to socialise. Put some time in your diary 3 – 4 times a week to get active on LinkedIn – not just ‘liking’ posts, actually engaging with content and sharing your insight and knowledge – this will be what sets you apart. And if you really want to go next-level share a high value piece of content (once a week), wrapped in smart commentary, tagging authors and publications and adding hashtags – this is a sure fire-way to really build credibility and thought-leadership. 
 
<p>These 3 steps when done well and with consistency will really assist with that all-important personal brand amplification. If you want to become known as an industry expert with a strong point of view you need to embrace a personal branding strategy. I know from working with many senior industry leading women that those who take on LinkedIn marketing head-first are a step ahead of their competition regardless of the gender.</p>
<p>I urge you all to jump onboard.</p>

The Lissi wallet simplifies the management of credentials, certificates, contacts and other personal data. This information itself is stored on the user’s device and can be presented by the user to the desired third parties. This is useful for different use cases and enables a new way of identity management.</p> Networks — the backbone of information verification <p>While the information exchange is conducted via encrypted peer-to-peer connections, a verifier requires a mechanism to verify the truthfulness of the presented information. To allow verifiability, distributed networks are used, which contain information to identify the issuer of identity information. When a credential is issued, it is signed by the issuer enabling asynchronous verifiability for verifiers. While the Lissi team is one of the driving forces of the IDunion network, we also support other networks.</p> Networks, which are currently supported by the Lissi&nbsp;wallet:  IDunion test <p>The IDunion test network is operated by the IDunion consortium consisting of private and public partners.

<p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a cross-ecosystem decentralized identity protocol that enables users to own their personal information and content as part of a global, open data network. The IDX framework allows developers to build safe, secure applications using user-owned identity and interoperable data. </p><p>The IDX identity protocol is compatible with a variety of data storage backend technologies including <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skydb-a-mutable-database-for-the-decentralized-web-7170beeaa985">SkyDB</a>, <a href="https://textile.io">Textile</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org">OrbitDB</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io">Filecoin</a>, among others - so you can store your application's data in whichever storage stack is best suited to your needs. By using IDX identity with your backend, not only can you can give users control of their information, but you can also import any other data that was created on any other application or domain that also uses IDX - even if they stored their content in an entirely different backend technology!</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y36JvYXwrw&amp;t=7s">This workshop</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/web-playground">associated Github library</a> show you how to easily build browser applications that utilize IDX for identity and SkyDB for data storage.</p> Video Tutorial   Web Playground <p><code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/web-playground">web-playground</a></code> is the library used in this workshop.

<p>Storing authenticated and encrypted data on <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> is a core building block for many Web3 applications, but to date there has not been a standardized way to encode this type of data.</p><p>Without a standard, many developers have been forced to create custom formats for their signed and encrypted data. This has been prohibitive to the openness and interoperability of information stored in IPFS by siloing data to their particular implementation. Another approach to authenticated data has been to put data in IPFS and put the CID of the data in a smart contract on a blockchain, such as <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a>. This is essentially an expensive way of adding a signature on top of the data and persisting the signature record on the blockchain.</p><p>With the introduction of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP-2844</a>, a standard that allows wallets to support a few new methods for signing and decrypting data based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ipld/specs/pull/269"><code>dag-jose</code></a> IPLD codec, we can now simply put authenticated and encrypted data directly into IPFS. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can utilize these primitives with two libraries, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did"><code>js-did</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect"><code>3ID Connect</code></a>!</p> What are DIDs and JOSE? <p>DIDs is the W3C standard for Decentralized Identifiers. It specifies a general way of going from a string identifier, e.g. <code>did:3:bafy...</code>, to a DID document which contains public keys for signature verification and key exchange. In most DID methods the document can be updated when keys are rotated for security reasons.</p><p>JOSE is a standard from <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/">IETF</a> which stands for JSON Object Signing and Encryption, and that pretty much explains what it is. There are two main primitives in this standard: JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption). Both of these formats allow for multiple participants: in JWS there can be one or multiple signatures over the payload, and in JWE there might be one or multiple recipients for the encrypted cleartext.</p> Building with dag-jose and EIP2844 <p>As we have been building out <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> with dag-jose and EIP-2844 as basic building blocks, we've created a few lower-level tools which allow us to more easily use these technologies. This tutorial will show you how to use these powerful tools directly.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-3id-did-provider">js-3id-did-provider</a> is an implementation of EIP-2844 using 3ID as the DID method. It can be used standalone as a DID Provider, or more conveniently within the <a href="https://github.com/3box/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a> library. 3ID Connect allows users to use their Ethereum wallet (support for more blockchains coming soon) to get access to a DID Provider.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/key-did-provider-ed25519">key-did-provider-ed25519</a> is an implementation of EIP-2844 using the Key DID method. It's the most simple DID Provider that supports both signing and encryption.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did">js-did</a> is a library that allows developers to represent a user in the form of a DID. This is the main interface we're going to be looking at in this tutorial. It allows us to sign data with the currently authenticated user, encrypt data to any user (DID), and decrypt data with the currently authenticated user.</p> Signed data in IPFS <p>By using the dag-jose IPLD codec we can create data structures that are linked and signed. This is done by creating JSON Web Signatures (JWS) that contain a link to additional data. One of the main problems that the dag-jose codec solves is that the payload of a JWS is traditionally encoded as <code>base64url</code> which means that if it contains any IPLD links you can't traverse those links. Instead what we do with DagJWS is enforce the payload to be the bytes of a CID. The codec then transforms the payload into a CID instance and sets it to the <code>link</code> property of the DagJWS. This allows us to easily traverse the resulting DAG.</p> Setup your environment <p>This section will cover how to set up some specific dependencies needed for this tutorial. If you just want to skip the setup part we have prepared <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">a simple playground</a> which bundles ipfs, 3id-connect, and dids. You can use it by opening the web page, clicking on connect, then opening the developer console where you can run the commands. If you decide to do so, skip the following two sections.</p> Setup IPFS with dag-jose support <p>Since dag-jose is a new IPLD codec it's not yet included in js-ipfs by default. It also implements the new IPLD codec API which is also not supported by js-ipfs yet. Therefore we need to do the following when we are creating an instance of IPFS:</p> <code>import IPFS from 'ipfs'
import dagJose from 'dag-jose'
import multiformats from 'multiformats/basics'
import legacy from 'multiformats/legacy'

multiformats.multicodec.add(dagJose)
const dagJoseFormat = legacy(multiformats, dagJose.name)

const ipfs = await Ipfs.create({ ipld: { formats: [dagJoseFormat] } })
</code> <p>Make sure to install the correct version of multiformats:</p> <code>$ npm i multiformats@3.0.3</code>  Setup a DID instance <p>In the example setup below we use the key-did-provider-ed25519. If you choose to use the web playground from above you will be using 3ID Connect and js-3id-did-provider in the background.</p> <code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import { Ed25519Provider } from 'key-did-provider-ed25519'
import KeyResolver from '@ceramicnetwork/key-did-resolver'
import { randomBytes } from '@stablelib/random'

// generate a seed, used as a secret for the DID
const seed = randomBytes(32)

// create did instance
const provider = new Ed25519Provider(seed)
const did = new DID({ provider, resolver: KeyResolver.getResolver() })
await did.authenticate()
window.did = did
console.log('Connected with DID:', did.id)</code>  Create a signed data structure <p>We can now start signing and adding data to IPFS! First lets create a simple function that takes a payload, signs it using the <code>did.createDagJWS</code> method, and adds the resulting data to IPFS. As we can see in the code below we get two objects back from this method: <code>jws</code> which is the DagJWS itself and <code>linkedBlock</code> which is the raw bytes of the encoded payload. What happens in the background is that the payload gets encoded using dag-cbor, after this the CID of the encoded payload is used as the payload of the created <code>jws</code>. We can access this payload CID on the DagJWS instance as <code>jws.link</code>.</p> <code>async function addSignedObject(payload) {
  // sign the payload as dag-jose
  const { jws, linkedBlock } = await did.createDagJWS(payload)
  // put the JWS into the ipfs dag
  const jwsCid = await ipfs.dag.put(jws, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
  // put the payload into the ipfs dag
  await ipfs.block.put(linkedBlock, { cid: jws.link })
  return jwsCid
}</code> <p>Using this function, let's create our first signed data objects:</p> <code>// Create our first signed object
const cid1 = await addSignedObject({ hello: 'world' })

// Log the DagJWS:
console.log((await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)).value)
// &gt; {
// &gt;   payload: "AXESIHhRlyKdyLsRUpRdpY4jSPfiee7e0GzCynNtDoeYWLUB",
// &gt;   signatures: [{
// &gt;     signature: "h7bHmTaBGza_QlFRI9LBfgB3Nw0m7hLzwMm4nLvcR3n9sHKRoCrY0soWnDbmuG7jfVgx4rYkjJohDuMNgbTpEQ",
// &gt;     protected: "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6MzpiYWdjcWNlcmFza3hxeng0N2l2b2tqcW9md295dXliMjN0aWFlcGRyYXpxNXJsem4yaHg3a215YWN6d29hP3ZlcnNpb24taWQ9MCNrV01YTU1xazVXc290UW0iLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NksifQ"
// &gt;   }],
// &gt;   link: CID(bafyreidykglsfhoixmivffc5uwhcgshx4j465xwqntbmu43nb2dzqwfvae)
// &gt; }

// Log the payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid1, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }

// Create another signed object that links to the previous one
const cid2 = addSignedObject({ hello: 'getting the hang of this', prev: cid1 })

// Log the new payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; {
// &gt;   hello: 'getting the hang of this'
// &gt;   prev: CID(bagcqcerappi42sb4uyrjkhhakqvkiaibkl4pfnwpyt53xkmsbkns4y33ljzq)
// &gt; }

// Log the old payload:
ipfs.dag.get(cid2, { path: '/link/prev/link' }).then(b =&gt; console.log(b.value))
// &gt; { hello: 'world' }
</code> <p>Note that the values of the CIDs and JWS will be different for you since the payload will be signed by your DID.</p> Verify a signed data structure <p>Verifying a JWS is very straight forward. Simply retrieve the JWS object and pass it to the <code>verifyJWS</code> method. If the signature is invalid, this function will throw an error. If the signature is valid, it will will return the DID (with key fragment) that was used to sign the JWS.</p> <code>const jws1 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid1)
const jws2 = await ipfs.dag.get(cid2)

const signingDID1 = await did.verifyJWS(jws1)
await did.verifyJWS(jws2)
</code>  Encrypted data in IPFS <p>Signed data in IPFS is one piece of the puzzle, but perhaps more interesting is encrypted data. With the use of dag-jose and EIP-2844 we can encrypt data to one or multiple DIDs and store it directly in IPFS. Below we demonstrate how to use the convenient tools provided by the js-did library to do this.</p> Encrypt IPLD data <p>There is a simple method to create a DagJWE object which is encrypted to one or multiple DIDs, <code>createDagJWE</code>. This method accepts an IPLD object (a JSON object that may also include CID links) and an array of DIDs. It will resolve the DIDs to retrieve the public encryption keys found in their DID document and create a JWE that is encrypted to these keys. To get going, let's create a helper function that creates a JWE and puts it into IPFS.</p> <code>async function addEncryptedObject(cleartext, dids) {
    const jwe = await did.createDagJWE(cleartext, dids)
    return ipfs.dag.put(jwe, { format: 'dag-jose', hashAlg: 'sha2-256' })
}
</code> <p>Once we have this function we can create a few encrypted objects. In the example below we first create a simple encrypted object, then we create an additional encrypted object that links to the previous one.</p> <code>const cid3 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'secret' }, [did.id])

const cid4 = await addEncryptedObject({ hello: 'cool!', prev: cid3 }, [did.id])</code> <p>Note that in the example above we use <code>[did.id](&lt;http://did.id&gt;)</code> to encrypt the data to the currently authenticated DID. We can of course also encrypt the data to the DID of a user that is not locally authenticated, such as another user!</p> Decrypt IPLD data <p>When the data is retrieved from IPFS we will just get the encrypted JWE. This means that we need to decrypt the data after we fetch it. Since we have created objects that link to each other, lets create a function that retrieves these objects and decrypts them recursively.</p> <code>async function followSecretPath(cid) {
    const jwe = (await ipfs.dag.get(cid)).value
    const cleartext = await did.decryptDagJWE(jwe)
    console.log(cleartext)
    if (cleartext.prev) {
        followSecretPath(cleartext.prev)
    }
}
</code> <p>The function above is a toy example that just logs the decrypted objects. We can use it to look at the content of these objects.</p> <code>// Retrieve a single object
followSecretPath(cid3)
// &gt; { hello: 'secret' }

// Retrive multiple linked objects
followSecretPath(cid4)
// &gt; { hello: 'cool!', path: CID(bagcqceraqittnizulygv6qldqgezp3siy2o5vpg66n7wms3vhffvyc7pu7ba) }
// &gt; { hello: 'secret' }
</code>  <p>That’s it for this tutorial! Hope you enjoyed diving deep into IPFS-enabled authenticated and encrypted data. I'm really looking forward to what you build on top of these powerful standards.</p><p>If you want to go deeper into how we are using these technologies in Ceramic, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">js-ceramic Github repo</a> and jump into our <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a>.</p>

 IntellectEU leverages EW Flex to win Vattenfall’s ‘Balance the Grid’ Challenge at Odyssey Momentum hackathon <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPgooLPQB2Y">Micael Widell</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fPgooLPQB2Y">Unsplash</a><p>Antwerp, Belgium and Zug, Switzerland — 18 November 2020 — Today <a href="https://intellecteu.com/">IntellectEU</a>, an international technology company focused on digital finance and emerging technologies, announced that it won last weekend’s ‘<a href="https://www.odyssey.org/hackathon-2020-vattenfall-challenge-balance-the-grid/">Balance the Grid</a>’ challenge sponsored by Vattenfall at the Odyssey Momentum hackathon. Swedish multinational energy company <a href="https://group.vattenfall.com/">Vattenfall</a> has committed to “fossil-free living within one generation.” For the Odyssey Momentum challenge, Vattenfall asked applications to address “the challenge of incentivizing consumers to communicate energy demand and production to allow all stakeholders to balance the grid.” IntellectEU built its winning submission atop <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-flex/">EW Flex</a>, a suite of software development toolkits that provides the framework to register, clear, dispatch, and settle millions of assets in power&nbsp;markets.</p><p>“Vattenfall’s goal — to ‘enable the entire energy sector to transition from an ego-system to an eco-system, where everyone and anything is incentivized to share demand AND production of green power — is 100% aligned with our focus here at Energy Web: to enable any device, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market,” explained Jesse Morris, CCO of Energy Web. “We’re honored that IntellectEU chose EW Flex as the foundation for their award-winning submission and we congratulate their entire team on a well-deserved win.”</p><p>At Odyssey Momentum, Vattenfall was more-specifically looking for a solution that enables distributed energy resources (DERs) to replace today’s big fossil-fueled generation units as the main source of flexibility in balancing markets. Vattenfall recognised that just having a technical scalable solution won’t cut it. The underlying trust framework between flexibility providers and the grid operator is just as crucial. Given the importance of having a stable grid at all times, grid operators will only open up the balancing market to newly participating assets if they have sufficient certainty these assets will actually deliver when activated.</p><p>IntellectEU solved this problem by extending EW Flex’s functionality with two features:</p>  After DER device registration in a Flex-based asset registry, the asset owner initiates a remote qualification test with the grid operator (or any other trusted service provider). During the test, the service provider checks the asset’s dynamic behavior by sending a series of setpoints to the asset. Based on real-time metering data, the service provider assesses if the asset is capable of delivering the requested type of flexibility. If successful, the service provider can authorize the asset to offer its flexibility to the balancing market. This extension allows massive, automated, and remote onboarding of small DERs to the flexibility market in a scalable manner — including solar smart inverters, batteries, thermostats, heat pumps, and electric vehicle charge&nbsp;points.  Further, each flexibility asset is enriched with a reputation score. This reputation score is a dynamic attribute that is updated after every time period the asset was activated. By comparing actual real-time metering data with the activation signal, the reputation score for the asset is adjusted. When the asset operates within certain margins, its reputation score will increase; failing to deliver the required flexibility would lower the reputation score. The grid operator could then take the reputation score of the assets into account — alongside other variables, such as unit price — when contracting the required flexibility for each time period. This would be accomplished by constructing the merit order of all flexibility bids based on the weighted sum of the price and the reputation score of each asset. Since a good reputation score increases the probability to be contracted at attractive prices, all assets are incentivised to deliver when activated.  <p>Although this represents IntellectEU’s first big foray into the energy sector, it is not their first time focusing on climate solutions. IntellectEU previously partnered with the Demex Group, risk advisors leveraging advanced technology and rich data to manage climate-driven financial volatility, to implement workflows in DAML (a programming language for decentralized applications that run on blockchain and other distributed ledger technology).</p><p>“Our goal during Momentum was to not reinvent the wheel, but to build further on what’s already out there. Building on top of EW Flex proved to be the right choice for us, the existing framework takes care of most of the difficulties related to integrating millions of DERs into energy markets, which allowed us to immediately focus on solving our specific challenge: build a balancing market that is scalable, but still guarantees trust between the TSO and the almost anonymous DERs,” said IntellectEU’s Thomas&nbsp;Smets.</p><p>Energy Web <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">unveiled EW Flex in January 2020</a>, as part of a major partnership with transmission system operator Austrian Power Grid to similarly tap into the potential of DERs for that country’s electricity flexibility markets.

<p></p>
<p>RE: OpenID Foundation Follow-up to ACDS on CDS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Mr Stevens, Mr Franklin, Ms O’Rourke, and Mr McAuliffe,</p>
<p>This communication follows the letter I sent on August 13, 2019, as Chair of the OpenID Foundation’s&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">Financial-grade API (FAPI) Working Group</a>. In my prior communication, I noted the Foundation performed an analysis of the Australian Consumer Data Standards (ACDS) that highlighted some deviations from the OpenID Connect and Financial Grade API ( FAPI ) standards.&nbsp; Now that the majority of deviations have been removed this enables CDR Data Holders and Data Recipients to demonstrate their technical conformance with the FAPI standards. This increases the reliability of systems leveraging these standards, the repeatability in successive systems and trust among all stakeholders in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The ACDS’s adoption of FAPI enables the members of your community to leverage the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Foundation certification program</a>. It is a mature model in use today, at scale, via the Open Banking Implementation Entity from UK regulators, identity providers (Data Holders) and relying-parties (Data Recipients) to self-certify their OpenID Connect and FAPI deployments. The tests are available to all, today, at no cost, at any time. The test suite can be run by participants themselves locally on their infrastructure or by using the OIDF’s hosted service. At a time of their choosing participants’ test results are checked by the OIDF, a modest fee and they are added to a publicly available list of organizations that have demonstrated conformance to the FAPI standard.&nbsp; This greatly assists participants, all types, large and small to achieve ACDS compliance and interoperate globally.</p>
<p>The Foundation recently updated the FAPI conformance suite to ensure that servers following the CDR standards comply with the underlying FAPI specifications.&nbsp; A number of Australian organizations have tested these tests against their CDR environments. The interoperability and security issues found in the deployments of Data Holders and Data Recipients were then able to be fixed well before they caused concerns.</p>
<p>The success of testing the tests’ allows the Foundation to launch a FAPI compliance service for CDR data holders. This new service also optionally covers the new pushed authorization spec that CDR plans to start introducing in November 2020.&nbsp; This is timely and important given the CDR’s is a new protocol without the benefit of existing test suites and few vendor implementations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this communication is to gauge the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC), and relevant internal parties, interest in supporting the OIDF’s launch of a FAPI technical conformance service for CDR participants. Your support would help expand its value to Accredited Data Recipients, and influence evolving the service in the future. We welcome ACCC’s involvement in the FAPI Working Group at any time. Any feedback on the FAPI CDR compliance service is welcome, especially prior to launch.</p>
<p>The Foundation’s considerable investment in its certification program ensures trusted implementations of open standards. The return is measured in positive impacts on interoperability and security. The UK’s use of the Foundation’s test suites has resulted in reduced engineering costs for all parties and facilitated market entry for new participants. This becomes particularly important as CDR is expanded to more entities. It highlights the importance that standards like FAPI evolve within their working groups.</p>
<p>OIDF’s certification program has proven its value to UK OpenBanking. It has revealed and assisted in resolving a significant number of interoperability and security problems in production systems in the nine largest UK banks while reducing integration costs for all. The certification and FAPI teams continue to work to ensure the tests reflect the intent of the specification authors and the needs of users.</p>
<p>We have run a series of joint workshops with the OpenBanking Implementation Entity in the UK, the Financial Data Exchange in the US to increase understanding of the standards and the benefits of the certification tools.&nbsp; We hope we could run similar workshops with the assistance of the appropriate Australian entities.</p>
<p>Please consider engaging with the OpenID Foundation on the launch of the CDR testing service. Your involvement benefits the community at large by alignment with ACCC and ACDS goals. We would be happy to arrange a call to answer any questions you might have. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura<br>

 Deutsche ErdWärme Joins Energy Web, Brings Carbon-free Geothermal Energy to Germany’s Energy Transition <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mKtRlysoims">Enzo Lo Presti</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mKtRlysoims">Unsplash</a><p>Karlsruhe, Germany and Zug, Switzerland — 18 November 2020 — Today Energy Web announced that <a href="https://www.deutsche-erdwaerme.de/ueber-uns/">Deutsche ErdWärme</a> (DEW) has become its newest member. Founded in 2015, DEW has quickly become Germany’s largest private developer of geothermal energy plants, spanning heat, electricity, and combined heat-and-power projects.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/geothermal-energy-germanys-largely-untapped-renewable-heat-source">Clean Energy Wire</a> called geothermal energy “Germany’s largely untapped renewable heat source.” Despite strong potential, geothermal has to date contributed only small percentages to the country’s heating and electricity needs. For example, deep geothermal contributes just 0.1% to heating and cooling, while shallow geothermal adds only another 1.2%. But with DEW at the forefront, that all could&nbsp;change.</p><p>Germany has the potential to increase deep geothermal 100x by 2050, from 1.2 TWh of heat generation today to more than 100 TWh in three decades. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.agora-energiewende.de/fileadmin2/Projekte/2016/Sektoruebergreifende_EW/Heat-Transition-2030_Summary-WEB.pdf">analysis from think tank Agora Energiewende</a> forecasts that the number of shallow geothermal units could rise from 420,000 today to 2 million or more by&nbsp;2030.</p><p>DEW’s geothermal development is focused on the Upper Rhine Valley in southwest Germany, along the border with France, a region with some of the best geothermal potential not only in Germany, but also all of mainland Europe. In nearby Bavaria, the government is <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/aiming-for-climate-targets-germany-taps-its-geothermal-potential">looking to geothermal</a> to help meet its ambitious climate targets; Munich is looking to geothermal to make its entire heating system carbon-neutral by&nbsp;2040.</p><p>“Geothermal energy is a unique renewable energy as it provides baseload energy. Our plants can both produce heat and electricity and are therefore highly flexible,” said Herbert Pohl, PhD, CEO of Deutsche ErdWärme. “This flexibility is something we also expect and need from a decentralized future energy system. In order for this to succeed, we want to be actively involved in the solutions and see Energy Web as an excellent platform.”</p><p>In fact, a <a href="https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/study-in-germany-on-flexibility-of-combined-geothermal-heat-and-power-generation/">recently released study</a> from Germany’s Federal Environment Agency confirms exactly that. It sees geothermal as an important source of zero-carbon, flexible energy to complement variable renewables such as wind and&nbsp;solar.</p><p>“Our mission is to accelerate a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system with blockchain and other decentralized technologies. We have seen again and again the need for flexibility to be a key part of the future electricity system,” explained Jesse Morris, CCO of Energy Web. “Many times ‘flexibility’ translates into battery energy storage, but geothermal has tremendous potential to support wind, solar, and other renewable energies. We’re proud to welcome Deutsche ErdWärme into our ecosystem.”</p><p>Today’s announcement comes on the heels of several major developments in Germany and neighboring countries. Last month, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">Energy Web announced</a> it had been selected by DENA, the Germany Energy Agency, to lead on development of a blockchain-based identity register for energy assets. Weeks earlier Energy Web <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/elia-group-and-energy-web-launch-multi-year-strategic-partnership-be2c5d87395f">announced a multi-year strategic partnership</a> with longtime member Elia Group, whose subsidiaries include transmission system operators in Belgium and Germany. And at the beginning of this year, Energy Web <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">unveiled a partnership</a> with Austrian Power Grid to use a blockchain-based solution to tap into distributed energy resources for that country’s grid flexibility market.</p><p>DEW’s portfolio includes three development projects in Graben-Neudorf, Waghäusel, and another one close to the company’s headquarters in Karlsruhe. Deutsche ErdWärme is actively working to expand its portfolio.</p><p>About Deutsche ErdWärme<br>Deutsche ErdWärme is Germany’s largest private developer of geothermal energy plants. The company, founded in 2015, is based in Karlsruhe in the heart of one of the most promising regions for the development of deep geothermal energy in Germany — the Upper Rhine Valley. Equipped with several mining permits, Deutsche Erdwärme intends to realise up to twelve geothermal energy projects in the coming years and thus will contribute to a decentralised, reliable supply of carbon-free heat and electricity for the region in the near&nbsp;future.</p><p>The team of Deutsche ErdWärme consists of various experts who have many years of experience in their fields and cover all relevant areas of project development of geothermal energy plants: geology, drilling technology, power plant construction and project management. Over this the company relies on open and transparent communication throughout the entire development process in order to achieve the highest possible acceptance for its geothermal energy&nbsp;plants.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by unleashing the potential of blockchain and decentralized technologies. EW focuses on our open-source, decentralized, digital technology stack — the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) — to enable any device, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>EW launched the Energy Web Chain, the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector and the anchor of the broader EW-DOS technology stack.

 Introducing the Lissi Mobile Wallet&nbsp;2.0 <p>TL:DR:</p>  The Lissi wallet 2.0 enables you to establish private peer-to-peer connections to third parties and exchange identity information.  It is developed by the Lissi Team within the Main Incubator GmbH, the research and development unit of the Commerzbank group.  The Lissi wallet 2.0 is available for <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/io.lissi.mobile.android">Android</a> and iOS (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">via testflight</a>).   Wallets: A tool to participate in a digital&nbsp;society <p>With an increasing digital life the importance of trusted digital relationships is paramount for a functioning society. However, to establish reliable communication channels via the internet, it’s necessary to re-invent digital identity. The Lissi team has dedicated the whole year to create an outstanding user experience for the Lissi mobile&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>An identity wallet provides the user with a user interface to receive, store, manage and share credentials as well as establish trusted connections to third parties. Self-sovereign wallets store all the data on the device of the user and handle the necessary technical aspects in the background. The application empowers individuals to take back agency over their digital lives and provide choice for their interactions.</p> The story behind the Lissi&nbsp;wallet <p>Lissi provides software components for individuals and institutions to gain data sovereignty. This includes our Lissi wallet, which we want to introduce in this article as well as our institutional agent. Lissi is a brand of the Main Incubator GmbH, which is the research and development unit of the Commerzbank group. We have been actively involved in the identity community for years and initiated and lead the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/utility-foundry-wg/blob/master/workflow/stories/IDunion.md">IDunion consortia</a>, which is fostered by the German Government. While we develop the Lissi wallet internally together with the Commerzbank AG, we co-develop the institutional agent together with the Technical University of Berlin, ING-Germany, Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Bundesdruckerei GmbH. If you want to test our institutional agent feel free to contact us via info@lissi.id.</p>Lissi Logo<p>The main incubator already developed a prototype called “Chain ID” in 2017, however it wasn’t user-friendly and well structured. Based on these learnings the first version of the Lissi Wallet was published early 2020. After that we conducted countless code-reviews, improvement processes, design reviews and feedback-cycles to come up with the status quo of the Lissi wallet. Additionally, we tested the Wallet in an UX-lab with experts in the field of user experience (UX) to identify potential problems and further improve the user-friendliness of the&nbsp;wallet.</p> A feature rich user experience <p>The wallet can be used to establish private peer-to-peer connections to third parties and exchange identity information. This information can either be self-attested, verified by a third party or a privacy preserving statement. The wallet illustrates all collected credentials directly when opening the wallet, but also offers a credential carousel, which can be used to get additional information about a particular credential, such as the attributes and the activity. The activity creates the necessary transparency for the user and records when a user shared information with a third party. The credential images illustrated below currently only work in combination with our institutional agent. However, we are looking forward to participating in standardization efforts of such images with the international community.</p><p>The application is separated in two parts. On the left side the user has the wallet, which contains the collected credentials and on the right side the contacts. This product design is not only easy to navigate, but also streamlines the user experience and decreases the initial complexity for the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Furthermore, the Lissi wallet also offers multiple privacy preserving features. These statements (e.g. income &gt;= 40.000 Euro per year) are called zero knowledge proofs or predicates. They don’t reveal the actual information (e.g your exact income), but instead only confirm that the information is equal, above, under or exactly a certain threshold (e.g. 40.000 € per year). Another feature we already implemented is selective disclosure, which enables third-parties requesting information (also referred to as verifiers or relying parties) to only request a subset of attributes of a credential. When somebody wants to identify you and you show your electronic identification (eID) it’s e.g. not always necessary to also convey your&nbsp;address.</p> The status quo and the road&nbsp;ahead <p>This is a beta-launch, hence it’s for testing purposes only. Some functions still need further adjustment and the app might not always perform as expected. This enables interested parties to test the Lissi wallet in their use-case pilots and allows us to get direct feedback to further iterate on the product. A productive version is planned for early&nbsp;2021.</p><p>You can now download the Lissi wallet for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android">play store</a> (Android) and<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY"> testflight </a>(Apple iOS) and test it with either our institutional agent or one of the many other providers. Because we don’t lock you in our ecosystem and there are many other great SSI software providers, which we are actively working together with to enable seamless data portability and interoperability between different vendors. Should you have any comments or suggestions for feature implementations let us know via <a href="mailto:feedback@lissi.id">feedback@lissi.id</a>.</p>

<p>Collaborating on next-generation standards</p><p>DIF is proud to announce that it has entered into a liaison agreement with the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>). This provides a mechanism for both parties to work together on areas of mutual interest, allowing working groups to align and coordinate through dual-members. The first major collaboration, which has already been underway for weeks, is a process for revising the Self-Issued OpenID Connect (SIOP) <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">specification</a>. This revision takes place in the AB/Connect working group of OIDC, which focuses at any given time on extending the core OIDC specification.</p><p>Given the foundational nature of this collaboration (and the potential for breaking changes or mental-model shifts in the next major version), the work on DIF’s Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider DID Profile working draft, referred to colloquially as “did-siop,” has been paused. It is expected to resume, still housed as a work item in DIF’s DID Authentication<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html"> Working Group</a>, after the work on the new SIOP specification in AB/C is finalized. Other collaborations on OIDF work items are also expected.</p><p>DIF members from the group are actively contributing to the new version of SIOP specification through OIDF’s structure and channels. If you are interested in advancing or contributing to this work substantially, you are very welcome to join the calls, details of which you can find <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">here</a>. If you are not a member of OIDF, you may contact the chairs of the DID Auth working group, or the DIF’s Liaison Officer to OIDF, which are listed at the bottom of the working group’s<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">&nbsp;webpage</a>.</p><p>NOTE: The latest version of the “did-siop” specification has not been approved by the DIF steering committee; it is currently paused at v0.1 and remains an unofficial Working Group Draft at time of&nbsp;press.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">DIF &amp; OIDF</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The DEON project focuses on the application of blockchains to secure data sharing in private networks and was initiated in 2018 in the wireless and sensor networks laboratory at the Yale Institute for Network Science. The use case of off-grid communication networks was identified with the goal of enabling their full decentralization in terms of data management and identity management. Off-grid (communication) networks are peer-to-peer networks that are autonomous, without super nodes and not dependent on the Internet’s physical infrastructure. Several recent developments like goTenna[1] and the Beartooth[2] offer standalone wireless devices that could be used to form local peer-to-peer networks. Other developments like the well-known Guifi community network[3] in Catalonia, Spain, are community-led paradigms in that space. Although these networks promote decentralization, openness, and fairness, they rely on legacy, centralized technologies for specific parts of their architecture like data and identity management. The integration of blockchains into off-grid networks appeared promising since blockchain provides attributes like transparency, privacy, distribution of governance and decentralization that are highly desirable in off-grid networks.</p>



<p>We chose Hyperledger Fabric as the framework to build our architecture because of its flexibility, performance and the potential we saw behind this huge community of enthusiasts and developers to further advance the technology. After we got familiar with the framework, we identified a key missing aspect: a decentralized identity management component. Unlike the rest of Fabric’s architecture, its native identity management is centralized and based on Certificate Authorities. So we came across the following questions: “which of the nodes in the network is going to host and manage the CA?”, “can we stick with the initial plan of having equal nodes?”and “how can we preserve the decentralization of off-grid networks if we rely on centralized nodes?”</p>



<p>Looking at the rest of the Hyperledger ecosystem, we found that Hyperledger Indy and Aries enable decentralized identity management. We could transform the centralized CAs of Fabric to a distributed CA entity, aka the Indy ledger, so that they are accessible by all nodes but not hosted by a specific one. This approach would work like a distributed oracle of trust in the network but necessitated some changes in Fabric and other extensions in the entire stack to bring DIDs into the “Fabric world.”</p>



<p>Approach and proposed architecture</p>



<p>The first Fabric extension identified as necessary for the integration was an Indy-based MSP to verify identities, signatures and transactions signed by DIDs. In addition, we had to enable the Fabric SDK (Go) to sign transactions using DIDs. For the Indy/Aries part, we leveraged the Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent (aca-py) [4], which is deployed in each node of the network and serves as both the verifier and the issuer in the network. On one hand, it signs Fabric transactions using DIDs and issues credentials to the users of the network, and on the other it verifies proofs and transactions signed by DIDs. The DEON Core Service leverages Fabric private data collections and an interface to IPFS to expose a REST API for secure, transparent, fast and privacy-preserving data storage. An overview of the integration is shown in the figure below. The proposed architecture can be employed by off-grid networks of any kind, from IoT to communication and inter-enterprise consortia networks, for enabling self-sovereign identity and user-centric data sharing.</p>




Figure 1: HL Fabric-Indy/Aries integration




<p>Project outcomes and future work</p>



<p>The work started as a joint effort between the wireless and sensor networks lab of Professor Leandros Tassiulas at the Yale Institute for Network Science and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which put its expertise in decentralized identity to work in the development of the identity parts. Part of the work and initial benchmarks of the architecture deployed in off-grid settings are presented in the paper “A Blockchain-based Decentralized Data Sharing Infrastructure for Off-grid Networking[5].”</p>



<p>Currently the Yale team is working on improving the code to make it more usable by others as a standalone solution for integrating Fabric and Indy/Aries. The team is also working on feature enhancements for the DEON platform, such as supporting Fabric v2, updating DEON identity agents to the latest version of the aca-py agent, extending the DEON REST API with admin functionalities and finally looking for new applications of the platform. The code of the project can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/off-grid-block">https://github.com/off-grid-block</a>.</p>

 Tanveer Hasan &amp; Rahmanuddin Shaik  Session <p>Wikipedia is a group project, and people in the group need to have separate pages to discuss changes and improvements to Wikipedia’s content, be that an article, a policy, a help page, or something anything else. Reading these discussion pages is a vastly rewarding, slightly addictive, experience. Sometimes reading Wikipedia can ruffle feathers.</p><p>E.g. 1:</p><p>The song, Jana-gana-mana, composed originally in Bengali by Rabindranath Tagore, was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly as the National Anthem of India on January 24, 1950. It was first sung on December 27, 1911 at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress. [1]</p><p>Whereas Wikipedia entry of National anthem mentions&nbsp;thus:</p><p>“Jana Gana Mana is the national anthem of India. Written in highly Sanskritised (Tatsama) Bengali.” [2]</p><p>E.g. 2:</p><p>Are these beautiful waterfalls on the Kaveri River located in Tamil Nadu — or on the border between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — or in Tamil Nadu on its border with Karnataka? Or is it really the Cauvery river, and Hogenakal Falls?&nbsp;[3]</p><p>Whatever you believe, be sure to bring a (Google) map to the debate, and point out that your opponent’s sources are not RS or&nbsp;NPOV!</p><p>E.g. 3:</p><p>Born of Serbian parents in a part of the Austrian Empire, which a short time later became a part of the Hungarian half of Austria-Hungary and is now in Croatia. He eventually became a naturalized citizen of the US.&nbsp;[4]</p><p>So was he Serbian? Croatian? Austrian? Austro-Hungarian? Istro-Romanian? Jewish? American? Martian? You decide! But don’t forget to leave an edit summary saying how pathetic it is to choose any other version. (Guess who are we talking about?) Clue: He is inventor par excellence.</p><p>In this day and age where information is often a touch and go process, a forgotten mode, a solitary quest towards creating knowledge sounds romantic (almost). Networked collaborations (such as Wikipedia) which have created knowledge sites have led to democratic interpretation and assimilation of such knowledge. They also as a basic necessity have sprung up various modes of annotation, verifiability of the Knowledge thus produced and utility quotient of the same. After all, why create and hold on to information that no body really cares&nbsp;about.</p> Plan <p>In this discussion session, the co-leaders of the session shall attempt to peel out the benign face of the visible Wikipedia page(there is a hidden world out there) and discuss the political, technological and social contours of information available on Wikipedia. We shall take the participants through the various stages of discussion about a Wikipedia page and how discussions tend to alter the course of an article. How false consensus is proposed, consent is manufactured and how these efforts are usually defeated by ‘Answer People’ and ‘Vandal Fighters’. It is no less of a war than the one between information and mis-information. The discussion on, calculus, for instance, was host to some sparring over whether the concept of “limit,” central to calculus, should be better explained as an “average.”</p><p>This discussion session brings to the table questions of legitimisation of knowledge and the inherent hierarchies that operate even within open networks of collaboration and offers a critique on consumption oriented knowledge production. The session also aims to ask questions around knowledge as an agent that has levelled some of the earlier existing contours but has introduced some of its own and how that has changed our usages and shapes our experiences.</p><p>The session will involve an edit-a-thon on a topic that will be selected by the co-leaders of the session and live commentary on the discussion pages will be tracked for further analysis. The session intends to build a dialogue towards attempting to problematise the questions of the starkly hierarchical and segmented experiences that have played a significant role in production of knowledge in the era of new knowledge practices. The session also will question the ‘best practices’ in building consent in the present global techno-economic contours of the internet, and its effect on academic spaces, creative practice and intervention.</p> Readings   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_talk_pages">Using Talk&nbsp;Pages</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines">Talk page guidelines</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial/Talk_pages">Tutorial on Wikipedia talk&nbsp;pages</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_talk_pages/1">Introduction to talk&nbsp;pages</a>  <a href="https://cis-india.org/raw/www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/%237reader_Wikipedia.pdf">A Wikipedia Reader (pdf, 6.6&nbsp;MB)</a>   Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2WikiShadows">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Wiki Shadows : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Tanveer Hasan works with the Wikimedia Foundation.

Energy Web will also join IWA’s Sustainability Business Working Group, an issue-aligned working group focused on carbon emissions and related&nbsp;themes.</p><p>As a member of the IWA, EW will collaborate with the organization’s global member base to set the standards for building distributed applications, including appropriate frameworks for tokenizing items of value, writing contracts over those tokens, and privacy-preserving analytics of multi-party data. EW’s Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) is anchored by the Energy Web Chain, which includes a native utility token, the Energy Web Token (EWT). In addition, many of its software development toolkits, such as EW Origin for renewable energy markets, apply a multi-token approach for handling the fungible and non-fungible aspects of digitalized assets such as energy attribute certificates (EACs) that serve as the verified ‘proof of purchase’ for renewable energy.</p><p>“The energy sector is not an island. Though the Energy Web is rooted in the world’s electricity grids, we naturally interface with many adjacent sectors, such as telecom for a fast-growing fleet of IoT-connected distributed energy resources and finance for settlement of grid services,” explained Jesse Morris, CCO of Energy Web. “Membership in the InterWork Alliance is a great way for us to interface with like-minded organizations in a variety of sectors, to ensure that we’re all building solutions that can ultimately work together as part of a bigger&nbsp;whole.”</p><p>IWA frameworks will enable businesses to create standardized token definitions and contracts in non-technical, business terms, and then turn them over to developers for coding on any platform of choice. The Alliance’s focus areas&nbsp;include:</p>  The Token Taxonomy Framework: provides a common language and toolset that enables multiple parties to agree on the definition of a token and how its value can be exchanged or&nbsp;used  The InterWork Framework: allows businesses to compose multi-party contracts from clauses that directly correlate to the token standards, enabling communication protocols to be defined and connected to framework components regardless of the eventual technology deployment  The Analytics Framework: enables organizations to derive additional business value from a privacy-preserving analysis of multi-party contracts, and shared data schema for value-add AI services and market-driven data reporting  <p>About the InterWork Alliance<br>The InterWork Alliance (IWA) is a non-profit, member-led organization creating platform-neutral specifications and trusted certification to define how digital token business processes can interwork regardless of location or market segment. By focusing on real-world projects, market requirements, and performance metrics, the IWA will define tokenization and interworking standards to drive business-level interoperability, multi-party interchange, and trust across applications and networks. Our global membership includes leaders, adopters, innovators, developers, and businesses representing the best practices for every use case the token-powered ecosystem has to&nbsp;offer.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://interwork.org/">https://interwork.org/</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating a low-carbon, customer-centric electricity system by unleashing the potential of blockchain and decentralized technologies.

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee and Atsuhiro Tscuhiya, APAC Market Development Team</p>



<p></p>



  



<p>[Snapshots of AMF Inauguration Members]</p>



<p>As the world struggles to contain the global pandemic, cybercriminals are launching their attacks and taking advantage of the anxiety and uncertainty that people are feeling. They impersonate trusted authorities or brands to mislead their victims. This is not surprising as cybercriminals are always on the lookout for opportunities and vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity ranks amongst the top ten global risks, and reducing cyber-risk exposure has become a priority for business leaders, according to the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risk_Report_2020.pdf">World Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Risks Report</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, cybersecurity and technology experts overwhelmingly agree that reliance on passwords should be reduced if not totally scrapped: <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">80 percent</a> of all data breaches involve weak or stolen passwords, and <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">29 percent</a> of all attacks leverage the latter.</p>



<p>The use of passwords poses many challenges. As we increasingly live our lives and perform mission critical work online, safe access to connected devices and online services is more important than ever. The need to raise authentication standards and reduce reliance on passwords is now more urgent than ever.</p>



<p>APAC Marketing Forum</p>



<p>Since 2012, the FIDO Alliance has been working with organizations across Asia Pacific (APAC) to reduce the reliance on passwords and encourage the adoption of simpler and stronger approaches to authentication. Today, we have close to 40 members from both the public and private sector in this region.</p>



<p>Recently, more than 30 representatives from these member organizations got together for the very first FIDO Alliance APAC Marketing Forum (AMF). The AMF, held virtually, was an informal marketing related discussion.</p>



<p>The event provided a platform for members to connect, learn about each other’s markets and share best practices. It facilitated communication and cooperation amongst members, and the authentication industry as a whole.</p>



  



<p>Recent Initiatives in APAC</p>



<p>FIDO members in APAC also have made tremendous progress in recent months.</p>



<p>Companies that deployed FIDO authentication include PrivyID in Indonesia, and Japan-based NTT Docomo and KDDI. Furthermore, VinCSS became the first company in Vietnam to develop FIDO2-certified strong authentication servers.</p>



<p>FIDO also was included in official standards documents developed by the Taiwan Association of Information and Communication Standards (TAICS) and SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in Taiwan, the Taiwan-Cathay United Bank has added the FIDO logo to the latest version of its app, which was released to customers in August.</p>



<p>Additionally, we had successful events like the FIDO Security Key Support Campaign, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jnhklee_in-the-afternoon-of-july-1st-2020-a-mid-term-activity-6684348243301822464-d8Rv/">2020 FIDO Hackathon</a> – Goodbye Password Challenge that offered member organizations opportunities to interact with each other despite physical distancing.</p>



<p>Activities in the Pipeline</p>



<p>Moving forward, we aim to organize more of both digital and onsite collaborative marketing events where members can promote their innovations and share case studies. Currently, planned initiatives include:</p>



  FIDO Alliance virtual AMFs to be organized once every quarter, where post discussion updates will be shared through the FIDO Blog  FIDO Alliance quarterly member newsletter&nbsp;  Updated FIDO Alliance orientation material with contents customized for the needs of APAC members  



<p>We look forward to seeing you at the next virtual meeting in October!</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>If you wish to take part in these exciting new initiatives, or have any inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:tsuchiya@fidoalliance.org">tsuchiya@fidoalliance.org</a>.</p>



<p>By joining AMF, you will not only get to connect with key authentication players in APAC, but also gain benefits of participating in FIDO branded awareness and promotional activities together with global champions.</p>

That’s changing, thanks in part to transitions to proof-of-stake and other consensus approaches aimed at increasing blockchain throughput while making networks more energy-efficient. But we also need to power blockchains with renewable energy — just as we did with <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">EW Zero</a> and our <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">recent announcement with Ripple</a>. In doing so, we can turn the world’s blockchains into sizable renewable electricity buyers driving clean energy markets around the world — alongside other major sources of renewable energy demand, such as <a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/2020/10/22/u-s-corporations-responsible-for-up-to-72-gw-of-renewable-energy-capacity-by-2030/">voluntary corporate procurement</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/electric-vehicles-are-the-next-dominant-class-of-renewable-energy-buyers-5c543f9cc6f">electric vehicles</a>.</p><p>In this three-part series let’s take a closer look at 1) the importance of chain greenification; 2) how blockchains can leverage EW’s public application, <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">EW Zero</a>, for the first step of decarbonization; and 3) different techniques for estimating the power demand of blockchains themselves.</p><p>Parts:</p>  Importance of blockchain greenification  How blockchains can leverage EW’s public application, <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">EW Zero</a>, for sourcing renewables  Different techniques for estimating the power demand of blockchains   Why should we care about blockchains’ electricity consumption? <p>One of the controversial characteristics of blockchain technology is its power consumption. Bitcoin is the most notorious, consuming an estimated 65–70 TWh per year or more [1]. For perspective, that’s more than double the annual electricity consumption of countries such as Ireland or&nbsp;Denmark.</p><p>Bitcoin’s enormous energy intensiveness is representative of blockchains with proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms. PoW still dominates the market, with <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">80% of the top 20 blockchains by market cap</a> using it. In fact, the top five PoW blockchains by market cap — Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Litecoin — <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x">consume up to 170 TWh per year</a>. That’s more than all of New York State, which would rank as one of the world’s top 15 economies if it were a separate&nbsp;country.</p><p>It’s important to remember that not all blockchains are like Bitcoin and Ethereum (marketing claims aside!) in terms of how they operate. As a result, not all blockchains are power-hungry in the same way. For example, blockchains designed with proof-of-authority (PoA) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithms are several orders of magnitude more energy-efficient, since they don’t require ultra-competitive mining and all the server farms and computational resources behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>This means that for roughly the same amount of electricity consumption, you could run: 2–3 transactions on Bitcoin (PoW), 20 transactions on Ethereum (PoW), or at least 10,000 transactions on the Energy Web Chain (PoA) [2]. The numbers become even more interesting when we add non-blockchain solutions to the comparison: 1.5 million transactions on Visa&nbsp;[3].</p>Figure 1: Illustrating differences in power consumption across&nbsp;chains Turning blockchain’s power consumption problem into an opportunity <p>Current efforts to increase the throughput and energy efficiency of blockchains (e.g., Ethereum eyeing PoS) are certainly worthwhile. But we should also fulfill the remaining electricity demand of blockchains with renewables, which is the next logical step to fully decarbonizing their climate footprint.</p><p>In doing so, we can create a multi-million dollar annual market for renewables. Regardless of the design or the application, when all summed up, the power consumption of blockchains can make them substantial renewable energy buyers similar to the <a href="https://www.there100.org/">260+ corporations</a> that have signed up for RE100 targets for 100% renewable energy sourcing.</p><p>This is by no means a revelation, given that many Bitcoin and Ethereum miners are already sourcing or producing their own cheap renewables in order to maximize profits. Assuming the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18642645/bitcoin-energy-price-renewable-china">University of Cambridge’s estimation</a> that Bitcoin was already 30% green in 2018 is correct, there is still 45 TWh of demand to be decarbonized for Bitcoin alone, especially in emerging regions like APAC. And this is only accounting for Bitcoin. Don’t forget (although it is easy) all the other chains we have not covered&nbsp;here.</p><p>This significant untapped demand for renewable energy is especially needed in markets with no established support mechanisms for renewable energy producers. The potential impact of converting overall blockchain electricity consumption to renewable energy demand can be drastic. Looking at the top 5 PoW blockchains, just 10% of their electricity demand equals the entire market of renewable energy certified by <a href="http://www.irecstandard.org">The International Renewable Energy Certificate Standard</a> (The I-REC Standard), an internationally recognized EAC standard in more than 30 countries. Think about that: boosting the renewable energy demand of the top 5 PoW blockchains by just 10% could almost double the global I-REC market [4]. As a result, there would be at least 500 more renewable energy generators in emerging markets becoming more cost-competitive with the conventional power plants thanks to the additional income from the I-REC&nbsp;sales.</p>Figure 2: Illustrating the impact of greenifying blockchains on existing renewables markets What are the renewables options for blockchains? <p>Assuming select blockchain participants (e.g., blockchain nodes / validators, miners, foundations, and exchanges) did decide to meet their power needs with renewables, what are their&nbsp;options?</p><p>Depending on the electricity regulatory frameworks of their locations, there are some options for sourcing renewables today, including 1) signing up for a green electricity tariff, 2) entering into a power purchasing agreement with a utility and/or generator, 3) installing rooftop solar, and 4) purchasing renewable energy attribute certificates (EACs). If this all sounds confusing and hard, it is. Navigating through the renewable energy supply can be a daunting and expensive task. But it shouldn’t be.</p><p>Here at Energy Web, we are addressing this issue (among other energy transition-related challenges) with our public, open-source decentralized technology stack. As the first step, we are aiming to streamline and simplify the procurement of renewable EACs such as renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the U.S., guarantees of origin (GOs) in Europe, and International RECs (I-RECs) in 35+ developing countries. Recently, we started developing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero (EW Zero)</a>, a digital application for locating, procuring, and managing verified EACs around the world. The idea behind EW Zero is to enable any renewable energy buyer, including blockchains, to find and source local renewables from across a wide variety of digital marketplaces. We started with EACs because they represent a simple renewable energy sourcing instrument available in many parts of the world and a compelling market incentive to accelerate renewables investments, especially in countries with no related policy support mechanisms (e.g., feed-in tariff schemes) and countries where support mechanisms are being phased out. Decarbonizing blockchains via EACs would mean scaling the EAC market, which will lead to stronger competitiveness of renewable energy generators and a more-attractive market for newcomers because these EACs provided an added source of ongoing revenues.</p> How can you&nbsp;engage? <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">Energy Web’s partnership with Ripple and XRP Foundation</a> to greenify XRP Ledger marks the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-starting-ripple-bid-crypto-130005024.html?guccounter=1">first technical and commercial demonstration</a> of EW Zero. And we are looking for more blockchain actors (be it mining pools, crypto exchanges, dApp operators) to partner with us in further tests and development efforts of EW Zero. For instance, we are exploring solutions to support “EAC futures” purchases for not-yet-built renewable energy projects to support additionality and we need feedback and pilot partners to develop this&nbsp;feature.</p> Call for&nbsp;input   This blog is far from being a robust academic-grade analysis, so if you have any ideas on improvement, please <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">contact&nbsp;us</a>.

				 <p>aNewGovernance is proud to have joined the Sum4All initiative promoted by the World&nbsp;Bank, and more specifically its working group “Enabling Data Sharing for Sustainable&nbsp;Urban Mobility” lead by World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SuM4All initiative embarked on a challenging effort to answer the question of how&nbsp;countries and cities can attain their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and improve&nbsp;the sustainability of the transport sector. SuM4All is now equipped to engage with policy&nbsp;makers and pilot the implementation of country action plans with those of South Africa and Ethiopia taking the lead in 2020.</p>

<p>“It seems natural, as a champion of Data Sharing and Personal Data to join this initiative,&nbsp;declared Eric Pol, Chairman of aNewGovernance. This will enable us to push our efforts&nbsp;towards human-centric Data Sharing in the mobility sector outside Europe, in a global&nbsp;perspective aligned with the UN SDGs.”</p>

<p>By Mike Kubzansky, CEO, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>2020 has challenged and consumed us — as individuals and as a society. From the pandemic to politics, to the severe economic downturn and the desperate cries for Black lives to matter; too many across the country and around the globe are struggling — financially, physically, and mentally.</p><p>We are at times scared, or angry, or resigned, and a pervasive sense of helplessness underpins so much of current daily life, across whole swathes of society. Yet so many people have remained remarkably resilient and resolute. We have donned our masks and taken to the streets to peacefully protest, help at food banks, or simply serve as poll watchers. We have prayed, meditated, eaten (and then tried to exercise) our way through this year of chaos and uncertainty. Several of us even got new animal companions to</p><p>While everyone has different coping mechanisms, there is one thing I hope we all do:&nbsp;vote.</p><p>As political scientist Larry Sabato said, “Every election is determined by the people who show up.” Whether it’s by mail, drop box, in person, early, or on election day (masked, of course), we must all show up. We believe deeply in democracy. It is the bedrock of this nation, and it will only be of, for, and by all the people if we all vote. That’s why Omidyar Network signed <a href="http://adayfordemocracy.com/">A Day for Democracy</a> pledge to give our staff in the US time off to vote and do their civic&nbsp;duty.</p><p>And when voters do their civic duty, their votes must be counted. We are proud of the work of our sister organization, <a href="http://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, and many of our grantees like <a href="http://communitychangeaction.org/">Community Change Action</a>, <a href="https://demosaction.org/">Demos Action,</a> <a href="http://citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://jwj.org/">Jobs With Justice</a> for their ongoing efforts to dismantle barriers to voting, so that everyone who is eligible can vote with ease — <a href="http://www.protecttheresults.org/">and can trust that election outcomes are legitimate</a>, so that we have genuine majority rule by a full and fully empowered electorate. It’s also why I signed on to <a href="https://medium.com/world-justice-project/a-joint-appeal-to-protect-the-rule-of-law-in-the-2020-u-s-elections-1f1f6876b351">World Justice Project’s letter</a>, along with a number of other foundation presidents, demanding that the rule of law is protected to ensure the security and integrity of the elections.</p><p>We cannot let expediency outweigh accuracy. We must be patient as election officials do their jobs and count every vote, even if it takes extra time before a winner is declared. Ensuring that every vote is counted will enhance the legitimacy of the election and strengthen our democracy.</p><p>While democracy is not a focus area for Omidyar Network — nor is improving its functioning our mission — it weaves through much of our work to strengthen technology and the economy. And pluralism, if true to its ideals, should have spillover benefits that improve democracy.</p><p>In Responsible Technology, we know that online platforms with outsized power can ravage our democracy by allowing unfettered hate, bigotry, racism, antisemitism, and disinformation to run rampant. We support organizations leading the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">#StopHateforProfit</a> campaign to call on Facebook to change its policies that inflame intolerance and undermine democracy. We also support <a href="https://graphika.com/">Graphika’s</a> investigations into domestic disinformation and potential foreign interference in the 2020 election, as well as its partnership with the <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/">Election Integrity Partnership</a>, which identifies instances aimed to “prevent or deter people from voting or to delegitimize election results.”</p><p>In our call to <a href="https://omidyar.com/our-call-to-reimagine-capitalism-in-america/">reimagine capitalism</a>, we recognize that democracy and the economy are fundamentally intertwined. We cannot address one without taking into account the other. Concentrated economic power too easily spills over into political power. That has resulted in policies that prevent the economic interests of the many from being fulfilled. We are working to address these imbalances, and support communities, working families, and small businesses to have greater power and voice in the economic decisions that impact their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>We also cannot reflect on American democracy without reflecting on race. The US is still not living up to its democratic ideal in which all people are created — and treated — as equal. In addition to the continued horror of the 164 Black individuals who have been killed by police through August, we see every day continued work <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/poll-prri-voter-suppression/565355/">to disenfranchise and suppress voting by Black and brown voters</a>. So it’s not surprising that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/election-nonvoters.html">some voters drop out of the system and choose to simply not participate</a> — real change has been too slow to&nbsp;come.</p><p>We know that change won’t always happen as quickly as we would like — or many times need — but it will happen. Voting is the first step on this journey toward a more just and equal&nbsp;future.</p><p>As President Obama said in Philadelphia at a rally last week, “Voting’s about using the power we have, and pooling it together to get a government that’s more concerned, and more responsive, and more focused on you and your lives and your children, and your grandchildren, and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we’ve got to vote, and then get some change, and then vote some more, and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it&nbsp;right.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/keep-voting-until-we-get-it-right-88e3cb4611ab">Keep Voting Until We Get it Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; In which sector(s) and country(ies) do you operate?</p>
<p>Airside’s privacy-based digital identity solutions help individuals and organizations share, verify, and manage personal information. While Airside started with the goal of using mobile technology to drive convenience throughout the travel experience, we believe no one should have to choose between convenience and privacy in any digital exchange of personal information. Our products and services are available and operational globally across a variety of sectors, such as travel, tourism, health, financial services, and more.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; What is your current market focus and what needs and areas of concern does your service/product address?</p>
<p>Our new Airside App is facilitating an easy and safe way for airline travelers to share their verified IDs from their mobile device, then self-check their luggage with facial recognition technology at the airport. Our app may also be used to enable other seamless, touchless, biometric experiences in the travel sector. For instance, our interoperable solution allows airports and airlines to implement the ID verification process without asking travelers to re-enroll information for each trip or sacrifice the privacy of sensitive information, enabling airports and airlines to provide the best experience for customers and employees.</p>
<p>Coming soon, Airside will also enable the sharing of verified COVID test results. Individuals can easily add their verified results to the new Airside App directly from a certified lab and securely share the results with an employer, travel operator, venue, and more. These organizations gain confidence that test results have not been tampered with and are compliant with local public health requirements, and worldwide privacy regulations.</p>
<p>Since 2014, our award-winning Mobile Passport App expedites a safe process through U.S. customs by U.S. and Canadian passport holders. Mobile Passport is the first app authorized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (U.S. CBP) and is trusted by over nine million people.</p>
<p> 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; In what ways does your service/product push beyond the state-of-the-art? </p>
<p>Privacy and security are at the core of everything we build, and now, more than ever, the integrity of our virtual selves is of the utmost importance. We see how identity theft and identity fraud have skyrocketed with the rapid need for technology during COVID-19. While there may be other ways to verify and share IDs and other personal information, Airside does so in a way that is user-controlled and consent-driven, putting the individual in control of their data. This mitigates health and security risks that come with tedious and often inconsistent paper processes, human intervention and low-grade technology.</p>
<p>Our products and services build a connection of digital trust between people and the organizations with whom they share their ID(s). What’s more, Airside cannot access, does not own, and will not sell the information transmitted using our network. We only keep transaction records (which do not contain any personal information) for audit purposes.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Where do you see the market trending in the mid/long term and how do you see your product/service playing into it?</p>
<p>The paradigm for digital identity has shifted and Airside is uniquely built in such a way to lead the industry with the highest levels of security and privacy standards. Digital identity now serves a critical function for everyday tasks. People are digitally sharing everything, from driver’s licenses and passports to school records and gym memberships. At the same time, the general public is becoming more aware and empowered by well-known privacy regulations, like GDPR and CCPA. Biometrics, for instance, is no longer a topic for tech-savvy early adopters. There is an immediate need for it and the secure transaction of all personal information. So, while people will continue to seek more virtual opportunities to conduct certain transactions, they’ll increasingly look for organizations or businesses that keep them safe, physically and digitally.</p>
<p>A lot of industries hit by COVID-19 are going to rebound and those who commit to personal data rights will do so faster than others. We’re eager to work with industries seeking to keep their employees and customers safe and healthy using our secure, scalable solutions to manage personal information with transparency.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Why were you motivated to join Kantara Initiative and how do you see it helping your organization specifically, and the digital economy as a whole?</p>
<p>Airside has great respect for Kantara Initiative’s work to make our complex, connected lives ones that are user-centric, consent-driven, and ultimately, built on trust. We were motivated to join Kantara Initiative to help us establish an architecture where a clear, unambiguous information exchange can take place. Using Kantara’s Consent Receipt specifications, we are able to offer our partners a service that eliminates the need for centralized databases of personal information and greatly simplifies their compliance requirements. This also provides our network members with clarity of the scope of their personal information and control as to when, how and with whom to share it in a focused, deliberative manner.</p>
<p>It’s a huge step when we can bind our secure and convenient technology with first-class privacy and data protection principles, as standardized by Kantara and echoed in various data protection laws, regulations and international standards. Being together in the global, thought-leading digital economy with Kantara means that Airside’s digital identity privacy network has put the highest levels of privacy assurance and interoperability into real-life practice.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; What other significant aspects about your organization (service/product) should our global community know about?</p>
<p>Airside has always believed that privacy is a human right and builds secure and convenient digital identity technology in a manner that protects personal information and meets privacy regulations around the world accordingly. We promise to lead and innovate with our core principle, “Privacy First. Human Always.” Everyone deserves to be treated with equality, respect, and dignity because, ultimately, our true identity is as a human always.</p>

<p>On October 21, Capital One hosted the 2nd Women in Identity DC Area Meetup. Speakers from both Women in Identity and Capital One brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the (virtual) table. The entire meetup was moderated by Melissa Heng, Senior Director of Digital Product Management at Capital One. &nbsp;It included a number of great discussions on the issues of identity and privacy as well as the tools women need to succeed in the industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Leadership and Identity</p>
<p>Sara Strauss, the Senior Vice President for US Card at Capital One, kicked off with a look at why it is important to have diversity in leadership positions in general – and specifically within the identity space. Because everyone has implicit bias, it is crucial that all perspectives are represented when developing new technologies. As unique individuals, we all need an environment that encourages us to share our perspectives openly – they are critically important in the identity space.</p>
<p>Sara also shared some tips from her own experience</p>
 
 Embrace that you are different. Your perspectives matter and what you bring to the table is unique and valuable. 
 Don’t try to look the same and think the same as everyone else because your uniqueness is what will set you apart. 
 When you are speaking up, speak what you believe not what you think you are supposed to say. 
 Find allies. Knowing that you have someone in the room who will support you, can give you the courage to stand out. 
 
<p>Networking for Professional Development</p>
<p></p>
<p>Career Development Facilitator Jennifer McCluskey then moved the discussion into a networking and professional development session. Attendees were able to share their anxieties and struggles with networking and Jennifer highlighted that these are common to ALL of us. What we need to do is shift our perception of networking from a negative, necessary, evil to a positive tool that can help us foster connections in our careers and everyday lives. Networking can help build our professional capital by giving us access to resources, information and influencers. It can give us the competitive edge we need to succeed. Attendees then took the opportunity to put those tools to the test, networking actively in several smaller breakout groups.</p>
<p>The Intersection of Identity and Privacy Panel Discussion</p>
<p>A panel discussion followed featuring Dr. Jenn Behrens, Becky Heironimus, Maggie Martin, Kimberly Sutherland and Sara Farmer. Panellists addressed several questions about privacy and identity and underscored the importance of communication and transparency when collecting and retaining data. Customers and users have a right to know what their information is being used for and,as a sector, it is our responsibility to make sure that they are informed and comfortable with the security of their data. Dr. Behrens suggested that more user friendly language around what is happening to our data in real time will help create an atmosphere of transparency.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, we need to provide customers with different authentication options. We can gradually increase the complexity of requirements as consumers become more comfortable with increasingly sophisticated technology.</p>
<p>The Power in YOU</p>
<p>Aparna Sarin, Vice President of Small Business Card at Capital One, then finished our conversation with an inspiring message: “As women, we have strengths that are hugely valuable.” Her personal journey of discovery includes overcoming bad, self-deprecating habits. She referenced How Women Rise by Sally Helgesen and Marshal Goldsmith and described several common bad habits including a reluctance to claim our achievements, putting your job before your career, falling into the perfection trap, and many more. Overcoming these habits will allow us to focus in on our strengths and give us the courage to be confident, assertive, fearless and empowered leaders.</p>
<p>We finished with an overview of Women in Identity including our mission, goals and member activities. This includes an invitation to all participants – and our readers (men and women) – to sign up!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/become-a-member.">https://www.womeninidentity.org/become-a-member.</a></p>

<p>The WiD Leadership team was out in force at KuppingerCole’s CusTech 2020 from 20-22 October.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a series of sessions across the event, we shared practical tips to encourage better leadership around DEI and considered ways to identify and control unconscious biases when building identity systems that work for ALL customers.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights included 2 great workshops both of which prompted follow up activity. we are actively looking at how we can get more of these sessions out into the public. Watch this space!</p>
 
 Identifying and Breaking Potential Bias in Identity Systems
 
 
 
 A great interactive session led by Colette d’Alessandro and Esther Hoeksema where attendees interacted with the WiD leadership team in small group discussions to share ideas on how to remove bias in identity systems. 
 
 
 
 
 Learning Path to Identity Diversity
 
 
 
 This session, led by Kay Chopard-Cohen, Diane Joyce and Karyn Bright focused on practical ways to make change. We concluded that change needs to start with our individual personal behaviour. From there we can grow into looking at the way our work groups and organizations operate.&nbsp; Try simple tactics like stopping yourself from speaking (if that is what you do!) and asking for the opinion of someone who often goes unheard. Or physically setting down your pen as a reminder to listen! Often the most subtle acts are the most powerful when building an inclusive environment. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>The positive response from audiences was a great indicator that we are seeing a general shift from simply understanding why diversity is important to understanding how we can create diverse environments and champion those that are underrepresented.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Designing for Diversity
 
 
 
 The keynote session with Canadian team leaders, Chanda Jackson and Nicole Landry, gave a great foundation for understanding the impact of bias and what it means when you’re looking to develop identity systems that are genuinely intended to work for everyone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Customers and the Identity Experience
 
 
 
 This final panel brought things full circle, reminding us all that ultimately we are trying to build systems that work for ALL our customers – regardless of their race, gender, financial status or their physical or technical ability. Ably moderated by Nicole Landry, Dia Banerji, Diane Joyce and Louise Maynard-Atem reminded us that while employees may be ‘stuck with’ a bad user experience (UX), our customers have a choice! The past year has seen the identity sector move faster than ever thought possible with products rolling out to meet new sector demands. The team challenged that we may not always fully consider UI/UX needs across the full intersectionality of humanity when doing so. KuppingerCole dubbed this session a “Powerhouse panel!” 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>This gave the Women in Identity team a great opportunity to work with colleagues across different geographies and time zones – a truly global event.</p>
<p>We look forward to more great opportunities and encourage ALL our members to get in touch if you’d like to be part of future discussions. Interested? Why not update your <a href="https://womeninidentity.org/members/">Women in Identity profile</a> with the topics that interest you most – we’ll be in touch!</p>

				 <p>aNewGovernance supports officially the living-in.eu initiative promoted by the European Commission, the European Committee of the Regions, European Network of Living Labs, Open and Agile Smart Cities (OASC) and Eurocities. “This is a natural fit, declares Eric Pol, Chairman of aNewGovernance. We promote human-centric data infrastructure, where citizen are empowered and can share their data in a managed, fair and transparent way, and where data holders are accountable. By definition, cities are the closest to citizen, delivering trusted daily services, from Mobility and Education to Energy and Culture. It seems reasonable that the City we live in can act as an independent data aggregator. We look forward to helping develop new services for citizen within cities across Europe!”</p>

				 <p>In times when cities and communities are looking to digital solutions to tackle a growing range of interconnected challenges, we must boost these efforts through a ‘European Way’ where digital solutions help to create places where people enjoy living and working.</p>
<p>Digital solutions are broad and include approaches to smart urban mobility, energy efficiency, sustainable housing, digital public services, and civic-led governance. Large-scale uptake and upscale of these solutions are crucial to help our cities and communities meet their climate targets and reduce their environmental footprint, while fostering citizen participation and bringing prosperity to all types of business, including SMEs and start-ups.</p>
<p>Through co-creation with citizens, we aim to bring the economic and social benefits of this transformation to all local communities and implement an inclusive digital Europe, with powerful digital services, technologies, infrastructures and skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>6 PRINCIPLES OF LIVING-IN.EU:<br> • a citizen-centric approach;<br> • a city-led approach at EU level;<br> • the city as a citizen-driven and open innovation ecosystem;<br> • ethical and socially responsible access, use, sharing and management of data;<br> • technologies as key enablers;<br> • interoperable digital platforms based on open standards and technical specifications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and shared data models. </p>

<p>By Jesús Salas, Associate, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>American consumers are increasingly concerned about privacy and data security when purchasing new products and services, which may be of a competitive advantage to companies that take action towards these consumer values, a new Consumer Reports (CR) study&nbsp;finds.</p><p>The new <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/downloads/CR_PrivacyFrontAndCenter_102020_vf.pdf">study,</a> “Privacy Front and Center: Meeting the Commercial Opportunity to Support Consumers Rights,” from CR’s Digital Lab with support from Omidyar Network, looks at the commercial benefits for companies that differentiate their products based on privacy and data security.</p><p>The report lays out a succinct timeline for the evolution of consumer attitudes toward privacy that culminates with a clear call to action for innovators. Through their comprehensive research methodologies, CR has been able to draw out the nuance around when, why, and how much privacy and security features matter for individuals looking to use and buy security cameras, connected cars, smart speakers, and other products. The report also contextualizes the role that both rule-making through regulation and the supply of better products can have to meet the growing market&nbsp;demand.</p><p>“This study shows that raising the standard for privacy and security is a win-win for consumers and the companies,” said Ben Moskowitz, the director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. “Given the rapid proliferation of internet connected devices, the rise in data breaches and cyber attacks, and the demand from consumers for heightened privacy and security measures, there’s an undeniable business case for companies to invest in creating more private and secure products.”</p><p>Here are some of the key findings from the&nbsp;study:</p>  According to CR’s February 2020 nationally representative survey, 74% of consumers are at least moderately concerned about the privacy of their personal&nbsp;data.  Nearly all Americans (96%) agree that more should be done to ensure that companies protect the privacy of consumers.  A majority of smart product owners (62%) worry about potential loss of privacy when buying them for their home or&nbsp;family.  The privacy and security conscious consumer class seems to include more men and people of&nbsp;color.  Experiencing a data breach correlates with a higher willingness to pay for privacy, and 30% of Americans have experienced one.  Of the Android users who switched to iPhones, 32% indicated doing so because of Apple’s perceived privacy or security benefits relative to&nbsp;Android.  <p>The study draws from a nationally representative CR survey of 5,085 adult U.S. residents conducted in February 2020, a meta-analysis of 25 years of public opinion studies, and a conjoint analysis that seeks to quantify how consumers weigh privacy and security in their hardware and software purchasing decisions.</p><p>Omidyar Network is honored to support this endeavor to both understand and inform the commercial case for investments in security and privacy-enhancing technology. While privacy should not be turned into an out-of-reach luxury, these findings do present an opportunity for companies to be among the first to differentiate and capture market share or leverage consumer’s willingness to pay in the short-term. Over time, we expect many privacy and data security features to become “table stakes,” in which case first movers will innovate and raise standards further.</p><p>Supporting efforts like this is key to our vision of enabling responsible technology that promotes well-being and individual liberty. To accomplish this, we support different levers that drive competition and innovation while safeguarding to manage risks and unintended consequences.</p><p>CR also recently launched an updated and expanded website for the <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard</a> with Omidyar Network joining as a strategic partner. The Digital Standard is an evolving, open source framework used by independent testing organizations, researchers and product teams to evaluate how technologies respect consumers’ privacy and security interests. It serves as a resource for companies looking to implement and take action on stronger privacy and security, as well as ownership and governance.</p><p>We encourage innovators to leverage and enhance this tool to collectively raise the standard on technology, and grow a culture of responsibility within companies overall.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/privacy-front-and-center-meeting-the-commercial-opportunity-to-support-consumers-rights-be9dda3f358a">Privacy Front and Center: Meeting the Commercial Opportunity to Support Consumers Rights</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Omidyar Network’s Statement on US v. Google, Filed Today by the US Department of&nbsp;Justice <p>Today marks a new chapter in the long history of US enforcement of antitrust law. The filing of this lawsuit is recognition that digital platforms, namely Google, have used illegal and improper means to maintain their dominance.</p><p>Over many years, Google has exercised tremendous control over the marketplace of online search. This complaint makes a strong case for how Google manipulated the online search market by paying billions to secure default positions on browsers and mobile handsets to exclude rivals, by denying interoperability to challengers, and by preferencing its own products and services in search&nbsp;results.</p><p>The DOJ did not sue Google because it has grown large or successful. Rather, the investigation yielded sufficient <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">evidence</a> to show Google has violated US antitrust law — a set of rules that apply to everyone, and are designed to make sure all of us benefit from free markets and fair competition.</p><p>The ideal outcome of this lawsuit is the restoration of competition and safer, more innovative choices for consumers in the online search market. We know that Google’s profit motive influences the content they deliver. Google searches often lead people to Google’s own goods and services, to those who pay Google for our attention, and down rabbit holes of misinformation, hate, and extremism. All of these “results” bolster time spent on the platforms and Google’s revenues. Surely, other search engines, if not excluded from the market, could design algorithms that were safer and more consistent with society’s values.</p><p>Today’s filing is an important first step in enforcing existing laws governing Google’s improper past conduct. But this journey is not over; the legal process could take many years to resolve, and other concerns will need to be addressed. For example, Google also used its online search dominance to develop another illegal monopoly in the digital advertising market. Americans deserve and expect that Google will be held accountable for all of its anti-competitive and otherwise harmful conduct as well as prevented from engaging in similar abuses in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Consumers, competition, our economy, and our democracy have already paid too high a price for what are seen as “free” services. Undoubtedly, Google has provided valuable, innovative services that have become essential to everyone’s lives, creating the foundation for how we live, work, and play. And like other necessities that are embedded in our lives — power, water, cars — technology companies should be held to the highest standards. However, if left <a href="https://omidyar.com/uncheckedpower-the-root-of-big-tech-issues/">unchecked</a>, Google’s practices will continue to create serious consequences for advertisers, publishers, foreclosed technological rivals, and the&nbsp;public.</p><p>To that end, and alongside this case, we call for federal attention toward the ad-tech stack and support for state-level antitrust cases directed at other aspects of Google’s sprawling businesses. Because antitrust action alone will not restore competition to these markets, Congress should also continue to pursue the development of <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3429">new laws and&nbsp;rules</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-networks-official-statement-on-united-states-et-al-78d7390fd8c">Omidyar Network’s Official Statement on United States, et al.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism. Standards are starting to connect and move towards functional interoperability, governed by testable protocols. Most of this work is happening on the level of VCs. However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon&nbsp;enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”</blockquote><blockquote>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for&nbsp;KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between&nbsp;nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records&nbsp;might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>,&nbsp;2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that&nbsp;anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”</blockquote><blockquote>Dr Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project&nbsp;lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_(PKI)_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root(s)_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of&nbsp;this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>. He has also worked with Consensys, contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">Seed Quest</a> project among others, soon to be donated to&nbsp;DIF.</p><p>Berlin-based <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom GmbH</a> has been a major interlocutor in the early development of KERI, since before the creation of the working group at DIF. Jolocom’s Charles Cunningham is the working group’s lead Rust developer, who has written a highly interesting post about mental models of <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">How KERI tackles the problem of trust</a> from a developer’s point of view for the Jolocom&nbsp;logbook.</p><p>Representing <a href="https://www.spherity.com">Spherity GmbH are the working group’s lead </a>JavaScript developer and note-taker. Spherity’s founder, Carsten Stöcker, has written a detailed piece for his company’s blog which called KERI “<a href="https://medium.com/spherity/introducing-keri-8f50ed1d8ed7">a more performant ledger for trusted identities</a>.”</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, has been co-developing on the Rust side as well, working in parallel and providing input on the design considerations. The Human Colossus Foundation has also put substantial energy into promoting and socializing KERI in the Trust-over-IP Foundation, the MyData community and in the Sovrin community, including featuring an hour-long KERI <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">session</a> prominently in a half-day <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">mini-conference</a> it organized.</p><p>At IIW31, the KERI developers will be demonstrating their initial work to date while there is still the opportunity to get involved and determine the course of KERI as the project moves from direct mode (two-party) to witness mode (multi-party, distributed consensus). Many sessions are planned for IIW, ranging from introductions to technical discussions to use-case and requirements gathering for KERI-based ideas. Additionally there will be a live demo of the working direct-mode prototype.</p><p>Introductory reading and video materials are collected at the main DIF <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">repository</a>, but even if you don’t watch them in advance (or fully understand them if you do), there are many ways to get involved and make this community project stronger and more&nbsp;diverse.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/keri-for-every-did-a-microledger-f9457fa80d2d">KERI: For every DID, a microledger</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When the ToIP Foundation launched in May 2020, our mission was to define a new model for achieving trust online—a model that breaks away from the thousands of siloed solutions for secure, privacy-enhancing digital identity and trust that do not work with each other. This lack of interoperability costs billions of dollars per year in complicated and time-consuming integration and hinders adoption by the very customers we are trying to serve.</p>



<p>Our goal is to drive adoption of a new model for digital trust based on open standard digital wallets and digital credentials that are every bit as interoperable as the physical wallets and paper or plastic credentials that we use every day—to do everything from getting on a plane to entering a hospital to signing a mortgage. As these new tools emerge as the primary mechanism for contactless identity verification, payments, and other online transactions, they will become as essential to our digital lives as browsers and email clients have become to the Web today.</p>



<p>As that happens, it is critical to avoid recreating the vendor-lock in and fragmentation of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>” that hindered the early days of the Web. Interoperable solutions that avoid vendor lock-in are paramount for a vibrant digital marketplace where consumers are free to choose their preferred digital wallet software from a variety of vendors and use digital credentials from any issuer as they choose.</p>



<p>The need for market-driven interoperability</p>



<p>Open standards alone do not produce interoperable market solutions—there are too many ways interoperability can still go off the rails. Testing labs are another step in the right direction—but vendors need incentives to use them, and those incentives can be scarce in a new market.</p>



<p>The ToIP Foundation recognized that, as our economy grows increasingly digital and collaboration tools grow steadily more powerful, there is a new path to interoperability: tapping market dynamics to drive incubation and adoption of truly interoperable solutions.</p>



<p>With this approach, vendors and customers voluntarily work together to develop interoperability testing requirements designed to meet explicit customer needs in the market. Vendors then satisfy those requirements by passing these interoperability tests with production-ready software.</p>



<p>Introducing the ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</p>



<p>To facilitate this new approach to market-driven interoperability, the Technology Stack Working Group of the ToIP Foundation developed the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/technical-stack-wg/blob/master/TIP_LIFECYCLE_MANAGEMENT.md">ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</a>. A TIP represents a specific combination of technologies that span each of the four layers of the ToIP technology stack in order to meet the requirements of a set of target customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TIPs can be designed, refined and supported by multiple vendors and customers wishing to collaborate on interoperability. A TIP typically includes the following elements critical to customer success:</p>



  Use cases capturing the specific requirements of customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.  Design principles that must be clearly defined when combining technology and business policies to formulate a solution architecture.&nbsp;  Documentation that clearly communicates the design, architecture, features, and benefits of a TIP to the digital trust ecosystems targeted for adoption.  Best practices and implementation guidance for adoption of a TIP, including how to incorporate policies from the ToIP governance stack.  Interoperability tests that enable vendors supporting the TIP to be certified for verifiable interoperability.  Adoption metrics and case study references that provide quantifiable evidence of the real market impact.  



<p>TIPs harness market forces to drive convergence on interoperability</p>



<p>Each TIP consists of two types of components:</p>



  Fully-standardized components of the ToIP stack. These components, called ToIP Standard Specifications (TSS), are standards that have already gained Foundation-wide approval.&nbsp;  Custom components that are specific to a TIP. Some places in the ToIP stack do not yet have agreed-upon specifications. For these gaps, a TIP must specify how it fills the gap via an open community specification that can be implemented by any vendor or open source project.  



<p>A conceptual “lego block” picture of a complete four-layer TIP—showing how it is constructed from a combination of standard TSS components and custom TIP-specific components—is shown in the figure below.</p>



  



<p>Launching the Saturn-V TIP</p>



<p>The first TIP published by the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group is named for the historically significant multi-stage rocket platform, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V">Saturn-V</a>. This TIP emerged from work begun at a 2019 Connect-a-Thon event held by the Hyperledger Indy community. When the ToIP Foundation was launched in May 2020, ToIP members including Commerzbank (Main-Incubator), esatus AG, Evernym, IBM, Trinsic and idRamp recognized the opportunity to coalesce their collaboration into a TIP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group was formed, it established the criteria for managing the lifecycle of TIP from incubation through design, demonstration, acceptance and adoption. The Saturn-V collaborators then proposed their TIP following this process and it was formally accepted as a Draft Deliverable by the Technology Stack Working Group at their 24 August 2020 meeting.</p>



<p>The next stage: mission-critical collaboration on interoperability testing</p>



<p>All the vendors participating in the Saturn-V TIP actively pair with developers from other participants to work through agreed-upon test plans. Having the Technology Stack Working Group oversee the TIP development life cycle on behalf of all participating vendors ensures a more transparent and robust joint testing project than a typical multi-vendor “plug-fest”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the technologies used for the Saturn-V TIP are Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries at<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/img/fig-1-toip-full-stack-2020-05-06.png?raw=true"> layers 1-3 of the ToIP Technology Stack</a>, the open source Aries Test suites will be used as the baseline for all test plans. Participating vendors are currently tackling the following stages of the Saturn-V Interop Test Plan One:</p>



  Self-Validation against Aries Protocol Test Suite for Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0  Peer-Validation
 
 Core Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries RFC 302</a>), which supports DID connections, issuing credentials, and fulfilling proofs 
 Connectionless Proofs using the Service Decorator (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0056-service-decorator">Aries RFC 56</a>), 
 HTTP over DIDComm (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0348-transition-msg-type-to-https">Aries RFC 348</a>). 
 
  



<p>Future missions</p>



<p>Once Test Plan One is complete, TIP Participants will define Saturn-V Interop Test Plan Two which intends to minimally include peer-to-peer validation for:</p>



  Core Aries Interop Profile v. 2.0 (content and scope not yet defined by community)  Out-of-Band Protocol (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0434-outofband">Aries RFC 434</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">End-to-End testing the Aries Agent Test Harness</a> (contributed by the Government of British Columbia)  



<p>Once these stages of interoperability testing are completed, the Technology Stack Working Group will be able to assess whether component specifications of this TIP meets the criteria to become a TSS. If so, these will be advanced to become their own Draft Deliverables for ultimate approval by the Working Group and then the ToIP Steering Committee.</p>

<p>In December last year members elected the first Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. The Council is the governing group for the association; providing guidance and direction as we navigate the developing world of digital identity in Aotearoa. Each Council member is elected for a two-year term, with elections held annually and results notified at the Annual Meeting in December. As&nbsp;we approach the end of the year it is time for us to call for nominations for the Council seats coming up for re-election.</p>



<p>This year we have&nbsp;four&nbsp;positions up for election, two each in the Major Corporate and SME/Startup categories.<br><br>When we formed the Executive Council last year we asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. You did that. The power of that diversity has shone through in the work of the Council this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.<br><br>As the Council has reflected on its own makeup we have identified a number of areas where diversity would continue to improve our ability to serve the community. We would particularly welcome nominations from those involved in healthcare and kaupapa Māori organisations. We are also encouraging nominations from young people from within your organisations, as a youth perspective is incredibly important and pertinent to the work we do.<br><br>Once elected in December, one of the first duties of the new Council is to elect leadership roles. David Morrison has held the Chair role since our inception in 2018, and is an exceptional Kaiārahi (guide/counsellor/leader). David’s term on Council extends to 2021, and he has indicated that he is likely to step down from the Executive Council at that time. Our plan this year is for the Council to select two co-chairs to aid in a smooth transition. The opportunity to chair is open to any Council member, and we encourage any who have a desire and passion to serve in this way to make themselves available for nomination.<br><br>2021 is a pivotal year for digital identity with the introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We are looking forward to some stellar nominations to help us in exploring and pursuing the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference in 2021 and beyond.</p>



<p>Executive Council Nominations</p>



<p>There is now an opportunity to put yourself forward or nominate someone else for a role on the Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. This year we have vacancies for the following positions:</p>



  Corporate&nbsp;– Major (2&nbsp;positions)  SME &amp; Start-up (2&nbsp;positions)  



<p>The nominees for the above positions must be from a Digital Identity NZ member organisation, and be from the same Digital Identity NZ Group that they are to represent on the Executive Council.<br><br>All nominations must be entered into the&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/3LRhbYXTWgVKx4Km8">online form here</a>&nbsp;by 5pm, Thursday 5 November 2020.</p>



<p>Digital Identity NZExecutive Council roles and responsibilities include:</p>



  Direct and supervise the business and affairs of Digital Identity NZ  Attend monthly Executive Council meetings, usually two&nbsp;hours in duration (video conferencing available)  Represent Digital Identity NZ at industry events and as part of&nbsp;delegations  Assist with managing and securing members of Digital Identity NZ  Participate in Digital Identity NZ working groups and projects  Where agreed by the Executive Council, act as a spokesperson for Digital Identity NZ on particular issues relating to working groups or projects  Be a vocal advocate of Digital Identity NZ  



<p>Online Voting</p>



<p>Voting will take place online in advance of the meeting. The results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. Please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2020/10/Digital-Identity-NZ-Charter-September-2020.pdf">Charter</a>&nbsp;for an outline of Executive Council Membership and election process. Each organisation has one vote that is allocated to the primary contact of the member organisation.</p>



<p>Annual Meeting Details</p>



<p>The Annual Meeting is scheduled for 9.30am on Thursday 10 December 2020 and is to be held via Zoom. Register for the event&nbsp;<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_sPfcBDJ2SR6gkCkU5PGoiA">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

It stretches your understanding about radically new technology and its implications on our lives — both the promising and perilous. The storytelling is riveting, the topics are supremely well chosen, and the show’s host — Internet serial entrepreneur and investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a> — masterfully guides listeners on unforgettable journeys alongside the inventors of our times. In each episode, Caterina engages with a groundbreaking technology — from contact tracing, to a robot caregiving, to deepfake video production — to ask the important questions. The show surrounds you with ideas and interpretations, but ultimately leaves it to you to decide if the tech should exist, and how it&nbsp;should.</p><p>We’re excited to support this show because the world is hungry for this kind of conversation, as we’ve seen with interest in <a href="https://ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer</a> and in Netflix’s recent The Social Dilemma. We want to imagine and guide technology to its greatest potential and help technologists navigate around unintended consequences that are so hard to anticipate.</p><p>After you subscribe <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">here</a> to the podcast, you might want to sign up to the <a href="http://eepurl.com/gnZTf9">weekly newsletter</a>.</p><p>Here’s a <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">custom link</a> to today’s show if you’d like to share, and below, you can read more about our first three episodes.</p><p>LISTEN: <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar</a></p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 14:<br>The deepfake detective<br>Chances are, you’ve seen a “deepfake” video. But did you know it? A new breed of tech detectives are building tools to spot these hyper-realistic videos — built with AI — where people say things they didn’t say or do things they’d never do. Some of these clips are just good, fanciful fun. But a deepfake deployed at the right moment could sway an election, or wreck a life. That’s why UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid is working on a “deepfake detective” — a tool to help media outlets know what’s real and what isn’t. But the same program could also give deepfakers a blueprint for how to make their work undetectable. Deepfake technology already exists. This episode asks: What should we do&nbsp;now?</p><p>Premieres Thursday, October 15:<br>Contact tracing: So promising. So invasive. <br>It’s one of the best weapons we have to contain a pandemic. But can it defeat the disease without spying on people who might carry it? MIT’s Kevin Esvelt has a bold idea: Let’s try a new form of contact tracing that could more than double the program’s impact. Bi-directional tracing looks both forward and backward from a known transmission, building a chart of the “undiscovered branches of the viral family tree” and identifying potential spreaders other systems can’t see. But how much of our data are we willing to give the government, even if it’s to fight Covid-19?</p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 21:<br>Grandma, here’s your robot<br>Is it the loneliest idea you’ve ever heard? Or an ingenious hack that helps human caregivers be more attentive and empathetic? You might have these questions when you meet the robot caregivers who roam the halls at retirement homes, doing basic tasks for residents and keeping them connected. Is elder care something we want a robot to do? Roboticist Conor McGinn from Trinity College Dublin actually moved into a retirement home in Washington, DC, to gain a deeper understanding of what residents might want from a robot. The answer surprised him, and it prompts deeper questions: As humans, what responsibility do we have toward our elders? When we fail them, should robots close the gap? And is that the future we want for ourselves?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/new-season-of-should-this-exist-supported-by-omidyar-network-a4ee34268c81">New Season of Should This Exist?, Supported by Omidyar Network</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What standards are and what it means to make them&nbsp;openly</p><p>I<a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">n our last post</a> in the series, we drilled down into a granular definition of “open-source” development and the thinking that goes into a choice of license. In this post, we drill down into what “standards” are, and the characteristics of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. In the next post in the series, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jimquenzer">Jim&nbsp;Quenzer</a><p>It is worth noting up front that the term standard has two slightly different usages. One is related to quality assurance or business process compliance — think of marketing that references “the highest standards of _____ ”. This refers to specifications and metrics used to grade outputs in a regulated industry or sector, like “Grade A Beef”. These are set and enforced by some combination of regulators, private-sector auditors and industry associations. Outside of software, this is usually what people refer to by “standardization:” and a specialist in any industry can wax eloquent on the politics and the consequences of decisions by standards bodies fixing those specifications and&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>In software and other IP-driven industries like medicine or engineering, standards have more to do with control and portability of data, enforcing measurable compatibility with the products of others. A common metaphor for this kind of standardization is the width or “gauge” of railway tracks — how far apart the rails are is a somewhat arbitrary decision but if they are different between two countries or regions they will have completely distinct rail systems. Software standards work much the same way, and for this reason standardization is often a prerequisite of procurements from government or substantial investments in the private sector. No one wants to invest in locomotives if all the places they want to take it… use different rails.</p><p>In the software world, as in the world of trains, standards define a given market for products and services. Compliance tests make objective (and far less controversial) the question of whether or not a given product meets a given set of requirements. Explicitly-defined, testable protocols make products provably swappable and/or interoperable. Open standards processes try to define those tests and protocols in the open, with input from initial and future contenders in that market, speeding up the timeline to legitimacy by incorporating major players and incorporating widely-sourced input.</p> Standards processes, as inherited from tangible industries <p>One way to explain standards processes is to begin with some examples in the physical world, which we learned about as matters of fact in our education. These evolved to support the creation of precise manufacturing methods and to support more seamless commerce, giving stability and safety to commodity markets. Weights and measures are classic standards that support for both: after all, there is nothing natural about our units of measure or currencies, as anyone who’s used both metric and non-metric measures knows all too well. How long is something? How heavy is something? How much liquid is in a gallon or&nbsp;liter?</p><p>Standardizing these kinds of measures was a quantum leap for commerce and mercantilism: it gave everyone a common reference point and enabled accounting systems (and “ledgers”) of vastly wider scope and simplicity. The fact that standards have been decided at the international level means it can happen on a global scale. The metric system, for example, is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, an international standards development organization (<a href="http://unicode.org/faq/sdos.html">SDO</a>). There is little debate in 2020 about what a gram is (it’s the weight of one milli-liter of water), but things like tolerance or accuracy in weighing and marking system is still an ongoing matter of debate and specification carried out&nbsp;there.</p><p>Another physical world standard is the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691170817/the-box">shipping container</a>. A whole global infrastructure has been built around this standard-sized container that allows it to be put on truck beds, shipped on train cars and put in ships that go around the world. It also means if you can fit whatever your thing is inside that box it can get to almost anywhere in the world because there is a standards based infrastructure that can handle it. Massive economies of scale (which have terraformed geopolitics by enabling high-throughput, high-efficiency global trade networks) are unlocked by this kind of standard, which enables the movement of containers (in most cases with no knowledge, or no direct knowledge, of what is inside them) to become a kind of commodity whose price stabilizes and steadies far-flung trade. The analogy to the “packets” or “data points” of modern information technology has been a mainstay of thinking about software business models for decades, and W3C Verifiable Credentials are <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">no exception</a>.</p><p>Similar standards also govern the electricity coming out of the walls in our houses, which has become so reliable and ubiquitous over the last century that few people outside of the relevant industries think much about it, or how dangerous it would be if standards were loosened. The “amount” (load and speed) of electricity, as well as the physical form factor of plugs, wiring, and circuit boards are all standardized at the national or regional level. This creates regional economies of scale in both the delivery of energy as a resource and in the manufacturing of electricity-powered products. Indeed, much of software engineering as an academic discipline and a labor market, as well as many standards around data and their governing standards bodies, evolved out of the electrical and communications infrastructure that preceded the advent of modern software.</p> Standards processes, for bits and&nbsp;bytes <p>Digital technology also needs explicit and testable standards, deliberated by specialists and engineers in a transparent process for the common good and for the stability of huge systems of capital and human effort. As the internet has evolved, the bulk of this effort has focused on the definition of common protocols that allow information to be exchanged by different computer systems, potentially written in very different languages and operating across very different topographies, with very different inputs and automations and governance structures.</p><p>The protocols that make up the modern internet were originally created by the group that began building the ARPA network. In 1986 the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Forcehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a>) formed and it is still the steward of many key protocols that form the basis of much of the internet, particularly around security and load-balancing at massive, infrastructure scale. The <a href="http://w3c.org/">Worldwide Web Consortium</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a>) was formed in 1994 and works to develop the software standards for the World Wide Web’s core technologies: browsers and&nbsp;servers.</p><p>One example we all use every day is E-mail, or as it was once known, “electronic mail”. How addressing and discovery can work, the limits and parameters of a universally-recognizable address, etc are all written up in authoritative specification documents. Colloquially, these documents are often referred to as “the standard,” or “the RFCs” (“Request[s] for Comment” referring to the collective editorial process by which standards are written). Email is typical, however, in that a patchwork of multiple interlocking protocols are actually required to send and receive&nbsp;emails.</p><p>Although this list of protocols needs to move slowly to give the end-consumer stability and assurance, the list is actually in a state of permanent minor flux, as individual protocols are iterated and upgrades, support for older versions fades away, and now protocols are added that take advantage of security or performance enhancements reaching critical mass elsewhere. For decades, the dominant protocols in email have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</a>, and underlying handshake/transport protocols like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>. As you can see clicking any of these links, the “standard” (current best practices and specifications) are compromised of a patchwork of iterating and component specifications with a more narrow scope, allowing for a kind of modular and incremental evolution allowing markets and applications to phase components and subsystems in and out over time without interruptions to service or sudden changes in user experience.</p><p>Another example we use every day is “web standards,” i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>. These protocols are the standards that let any web server present information according to prescriptive formats which will be displayed in roughly the same way by any compliant web browser. Here, as in weights and measures, or electricity, there are always slippages and margins for error, though, as any front-end developer can tell you) This enables a diversity of web servers and a diversity of browsers. There are of course open source examples of each (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache Server </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox Browsers</a> being two examples) but there are also proprietary versions of them as&nbsp;well.</p><p>To many observers, the degree of openness in the codebase matters less than the diversity and complexity of organizations involved in the governance of the protocols: in this regard, control of “browser standards” might be endangered by increasing market power on the part of browser vendors owned by private entities that also have outsized and direct control over operating systems and app store platforms, upon which any competing browser would depend directly. Neither open source nor open standards are a guarantee of a healthy and open market, although both generally contribute to that&nbsp;end.</p> Standards and Proto-standards <p>Standards development is generally a slow process taking years, driven by a balance between (rough) consensus between stakeholders refining and iterating requirements and running code against which these requirements can be measured or considered. Depending on the context, stakeholders can include vendors or commercial actors, regulators, consumer advocacy groups, affected industries, and/or individuals. The terms “running” and “code” both cover a lot of territory, but it would be impossible to arrive at a standard without at least two independent, functioning pieces of code that have been tested, audited, and hardened, ideally by some deployment at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>In some cases, this is where an open standards process begins: two maximally independent implementations decide to cooperate for greater adoption and maturity, and seek out a venue for the relevant stakeholders to debate the merits and trade-offs of their current codebases and future variations or possibilities. Different standards bodies can be more or less public in their processes, more or less transparent in their results, and more or less complex in their rules of engagement: indeed, some operate according to a rulebook as complex as that of a parliament, and a style guide as exacting as an academic institution.</p><p>For the most open of standards, however, it is possible to work in the open, deliberatively and transparently, long before this “first” step. Working in an industry group, trade association, or other neutral venue can speed up the work towards a standards by front-loading the collaboration, peer-review, market-testing, and process legitimacy needed to get an idea ready for the market and standardization sooner. These “pre-standards” venues are like containers where all those participating have signed an IPR agreement up front that means their work is unencumbered by patents or royalties and safe from being front-run or patent-trolled.</p><p>The products of these pre-standards processes are often called “pre-standard specifications” or “proto-standards” (if they are more ambitious and protocol-shaped). Groups that develop proto-standards often have explicitly-defined processes for how to publish a proto-standard, as well as when and how to hand off a sufficiently matured proto-standard to an SDO process for more formal and authoritative standardization.</p><p>We should not overstate the distinction between standards and pre-standards, however: there are many shares of grey in between. “Standards-track” and “non-standards-track” specifications alike can be more mature or legitimate depending on the parties involved, the pertinent SDOs (or lack thereof), and of course the process used to create them. For this reason, work items and working groups at the DIF avail themselves of multiple procedural options and tailor their processes to the context, which is why “scoping” and “chartering” processes can take months to hammer out between organizations and their legal departments. This is also specifications developed at DIF without being further hardened in a more formal standards body can sometimes be called “standards,” in the sense that they are adopted in the industry and function as standards. How the market and the relevant industries treat, and trust, and rely on a specification is the ultimate judge of when it can be called the authoritative text for a standard process or procedure!</p><p>In our next drill-down, we’ll go into more detail on DIF’s processes, how you can get involved, and what decisions go into assuming an active role in a working group or work&nbsp;item.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495">Drilling down: Open Standards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				<a href="https://www.sitra.fi/en/publications/towards-trustworthy-health-data-ecosystems/#foreword"></a>
			  
				
				
				 <p>In the spring of 2020, Sitra and aNewGovernance published their “35 proposals to make the European data strategy work” as a response to the European Commission Communication “A European strategy for data”. This new data strategy was part of a wider package of strategic documents that also included a communication entitled “Shaping Europe’s digital future” and the “White Paper on Artificial Intelligence – A European approach to excellence and trust”.</p>
<p>Those papers call for a move from platform-centric to human-centric data infrastructure, with an underlying concept: TRUST. This is particularly true in Health. With the ageing of the population, the raising costs of healthcare and the current pandemic, it is high time to shift the paradigm of Health and centre it around individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of this paper from Sitra is to encourage us all to rethink the role of the individual in healthcare systems. It is intentional that there is no clear discipline in focus in this paper. The future is made today and it needs to be made in dialogue with a variety of stakeholders. High-level experts contributed to this paper and commentators all had very different views on the field of health and well-being: only by working together can we make the European data strategy work for us all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sitra is now leading the European Commission Joint Initiative on the European Health Data Space*. aNewGovernance looks forward to participating to this great enterprise for the benefit of the European citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*: Mission Statement of the “Towards the European Health Data Space (TEHDAS) Joint Action” – The Joint Action helps member states and the Commission develop an ecosystem where health data is shared more freely, boosting the wellbeing of citizens, the public health system, treatment of illnesses, and the research and innovation activities in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, citizens, communities and companies in Europe will benefit from a protected, secure and seamless access to health data, regardless of where it is stored.</p>

<p>A crash-course in the complex world of variously-open software licensing</p><p>The ostensibly binary distinction between “open” and “closed” software gets bandied about in many contexts, often in a dangerously simplified form, as though there were only two, mutually-exclusive options. It can also be extended to standards in an imprecise or oversimplified way. Sometimes people refer to groups like DIF “working on open-source standards,” but speaking precise, no such thing&nbsp;exists!</p><p>Only software code can be open-source, since after all, “source” is short for “source code” (pre-compiled software). Standards, whether open or not, are not code — instead, they are functional definitions and specifications that define and specify protocols that one application (or code base) uses to talk to another (or code base). Each standard can be understood as a benchmark for testing specific implementations, dividing existing and future codebases into those fully, partly, or non-compliant with its requirements.</p>“Lean Startup workshop” in Amsterdam, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus">Daria Nepriakhina</a><p>Code, whether open-source or not, can implement or “build to” a pre-existing standard, which can be developed in a variously open or closed manner; there is no inherent link or dependency between the openness or rigor of the two processes. Similarly, a standard can be “written around” one or more existing implementations, in such a way that the existing code is definitively compliant with the resulting standard tailored to it. This latter operation is an important function in open-source communities, in that it invites future developers to make new code that will be interchangeable or interoperable with that precedent. Even if that pre-existing code is closed, the resulting standard can be of great use to open-source development, particularly if the process used to write it was also “open” and participated in by the designers and implementers of that closed-source precedent.</p><p>In this series of three brief explanatory posts, we’ll first explain open-source development as a process rather than defining it by its results. In the next post, we will explain the characteristics and optionalities of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. Lastly, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p> Source Code and Intellectual Property&nbsp;Law <p>At their lowest level, computers are just machines that exercise millions of structured computations every second. They take inputs, perform computation, and produce&nbsp;outputs.</p>(public domain)<p>These computations can be combined into complex structures of data and decision-making called “programs” that interface with humans to make useful and meaningful outputs. At the lowest level, these computations still look like oceans of 1s and 0s to the untrained eye, but decades of refinement of operating systems, programming languages, scripting languages, and other abstractions make it easy for engineers to deal only with “source code” as a kind of human-readable abstraction at higher levels. This is “compiled” into more efficient, machine-readable “binaries” (ones and zeros) that can be deployed to standardized hardware in the real world where it is “run” (live software is often referred to as “runtime”).</p>by <a href="https://scs.senecac.on.ca/~chris.szalwinski">Chris Szalwinski</a> from <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp100/pages/content/compi.html">The C Program</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ca/">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada&nbsp;License</a>.<p>Because it is human-readable and because licenses apply to compiled binaries and functional software in specific jurisdictions, the software industry has largely applied practices analogous to academic “peer review” for sharing and critiquing core pieces of source code. This complicates the open/closed distinction further, since a closed-source project and a licensed binary might still offer key components up for review through github or other channels traditionally used for open development. Furthermore, the many gradients between complete “open” or “closed” software depends on the ownership and licensing of a given piece of software, which can evolve over time or differ in its enforceability across jurisdictions. Like all legal matters, mileage may vary and always consult a licensed&nbsp;expert!</p> A thumbnail history of licensing <p>There is a range of different licensing regimes for source code. Among open-source licenses, different functions can be enabled or facilitated independently of one another: external review, attribution, innovation, maintenance, and even revenue-sharing and other conditions on business practices.</p><p>Proprietary code bases are released under closed-source licenses, which are optimized for secrecy, exclusivity, and/or sale of the results through licensing-based revenue models. For decades, this was how Microsoft licensed not only its proprietary stand-alone software, but even the bulk of the Windows operating system. The licensing landscape is much more diverse today, but before the 1990s very little commercial software was developed in the open or had its source code published after the&nbsp;fact.</p><p>The culture of academia is one of sharing and publishing intellectual work for peers to see and review — open peer-review is as central in academic computer science as it is in the hard sciences. The internet was originally imagined, architected, prototyped, and built by academics, and tinkerers, primarily supported by military and government funding. These three cultures (the military, academia, and independent “hacker”/tinkerer types) formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Galaxy">basis of internet culture</a>. A fourth culture was added later when the general public’s access to the internet evolved into a massive commercial industry in the early&nbsp;1990s.</p><p>For our purposes here, we can limit ourselves to the fairly direct link, sometimes biographical, between the anomalous, non-commercial origins of the internet and the development of the open-source movement within the software industry. One “origin myth” that exemplifies this link is the story of a young Richard Stallman, then working in an early Artificial Intelligence lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wanted to customize some printer software for an expensive new printer shared across all the floors of a busy research building. To do so, he needed to get the source code from the manufacturer, which he had done to customize the previous “workhorse” printer in the same building.</p><p>The manufacturer of the new model, however, surprised Stallman by refusing to hand over the code on grounds of licensing and intellectual property rights. Stallman, to whom the motto “software wants to be free” is often misattributed, often <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823">credits the incident</a> for his deeply-held belief that the end-users of software have a right to modify and participate in the software they use, whether they paid directly for it or benefited from the procurements of governments. To this day, the details and boundaries of this right are still being debated, not only in open-source requirements for government procurements, but also in “right to repair” laws that extend these rights into the domain of hardware and the physical (and 3D-printed) world.</p> Varying degrees of “Software Freedom” <p>Stallman went on to found the Free Software Foundation and play a pivotal role in the elaboration of an open-source (and “free open source”) movement. He also created the first GNU Public Licence (GPL), still a major and influential family of licenses. All versions of the GPL have within them some version of these 4 essential “freedoms”:</p><blockquote>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (“freedom 0”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (“freedom 1”). Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (“freedom 2”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (“freedom 3”). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><p>Honoring these four freedoms textually and fully can make it very hard to sell software commercially for many reasons, salient among them that freely-available source code in a major language is trivial to compile into functioning binaries; commercial or “closed” software is generally sold as compiled binaries, keeping the source code&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Furthermore, many early open-source licenses like GPL explicitly forbid so-called “enclosure” of the code, i.e., incorporating pieces or subsets of the licensed code into a new, close-source product. Anti-enclosure licensing is often referred to as “copyleft” (because it prohibits future copyrighting!) or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license">viral</a> licensing,” since it cannot be mixed and matched with other licensing without overriding more restrictive licensing. This severely limits commercial potential of “forks” or derived variants. The entire Linux family of operating systems are licensed this way, which keeps Linux development squarely in the camp of maximally-open development throughout.</p><p>Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, the open-source movement grew and at some point the software industry could not afford to ignore it, even if directly participating with licenses like GPL was not feasible for most companies of any size. This period saw the first “compromise-licenses” and hybrid open/closed business-models evolve around them. Many of the licenses still popular today date to these early experiments. For instance, the license originally created for the University of California, Berkeley’s fork of Unix, and still known today as the Berkeley Software Development (BSD) license, is one such “commercially lenient” open-source licenses. These licenses allow developers to take code that was originally open, make significant changes to modified versions of it, and license or even sell those under more classically commercial licenses.</p><p>Similarly, more lenient variants of the Apache and MIT licenses date to this period as well. It is worth noting that Apache web servers were one of the first open-source pieces of software that replaced a dominant commercial product. Apache web server software reaching a dominant position in the previously closed-license, commercial niche was a watershed moment for open-source software.</p><p>Apache is often held up, alongside Linux, as an example of where open-source software optimizes for standardization and safety of mission-critical infrastructure, largely due to the thorough and ongoing auditing and maintenance enabled by its core components being completely open to review, testing, and improvement proposals. Conversely, however, some historians of software development point out that allowing enclosure to the degree that Apache licenses do can lead to simultaneous or “parallel” development of various (partially closed-source) forks to evolve in tandem according to various divergent business agendas. Over time, this can splinter development, wicking off talent, attention, and manpower into closed development and creating a major coordination problem for the open-source “parent” of the family tree. In the most severe cases, this can greatly diminish and forfeit the standardization and security gains that made sharing an open-source parent so desirable in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Today and&nbsp;Tomorrow <p>Today, cloud-based business models and Software-as-a-Service have revived and expanded the toolkit for closed-source development, and in turn breathed new life into the debate about how hybrid models could make open-source infrastructure sustainable by revenue shares from closed-source products that depend on it. Similarly, the so called “cloud loophole” in older GPL licenses, whereby software could be run but not “distributed,” was closed by the newer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero GPL</a> that applies to cloud environments.</p><p>Another interesting frontier in the evolving licensing landscape is being opened up in recent years by distributing computing and distributed ledgers. One key assumption of traditional licensing is that software runs on a finite set of distinct pieces of hardware, with ownership and liability that follow straightforwardly from there. Distributed computing, however, where computation work is spread out over a more diffuse and indeterminate numbers of computers, which might have limited or no insight into the “big picture” of the software they are running, muddy the waters even further than traditional cloud environment. On the radically open side of the spectrum, the distributed-computing ecosystem project HoloChain has innovated the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">Cryptographic Autonomy Licence </a>to empower users (and the software running in their name) by protecting them with encryption.</p><p>New forms of “confidential computing” and encrypted, self-sovereign networking take this even further, making the boundaries of software and runtime environments similarly porous. Attempts at licensing for these new topographies have been <a href="https://sdtimes.com/os/osi-co-founder-leaves-initiative-over-new-license/">controversial</a> at times, but they are also an important precedent and context for work happening in the DIF, such as that of the Secure Data Storage <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working&nbsp;group</a>.</p><p>There are even more radical experiments and movements happening in the open-licensing problem space, which would restrict usage not [only] according to commercial terms or enclosure, but according to non-monetary and non-licensing rubrics as well. For instance, the “ICE breaker” <a href="https://icebreaker.dev">project </a>has brought more attention to the movement to license software according to so-called “<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/">ethical licenses</a>.” These restrict derivative use anywhere it can be proven to support of human rights violations, such as in military applications or for “predictive policing” and other use-cases that run afoul of international authorities on human rights and discrimination. The provisions or triggers for such licensing might be as hard to enforce as international human rights law (i.e., very hard), but it sends a signal that specifications and standards from other disciplines such as human rights law and ethical philosophy might someday find their place among the commercial and attribution clauses in open-source licenses.</p> Further reading <p>All code developed under the DIF umbrella is strictly open source, and while DIF accepts donations of previously-closed source code, it is expected that all ongoing iterations of them will take place in the open. The original vision for DIF as a project within the <a href="https://www.jointdevelopment.org/about1.html">Joint Development Foundation</a> was to host code development, and it has since expanded to include co-developed pre-standards specifications and other educational and non-technical <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/education/home">materials</a> as well. Take a spin through our github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/">repositories</a> if you’d like to see an overview of historical and ongoing projects.</p><p>In this quick overview, we have only scratched the surface, though, and we encourage anyone working in the open software space to educate themselves further. The Open Source Initiative <a href="https://opensource.org/trademark-guidelines#Usage_That_Does_Not_Require_Permission">holds the trademark </a>on the phrase “open source” and maintains a very helpful list of licenses that it has decided are fully conformant with its principles. The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">list of approved licenses</a> that they maintain is a great place to start if you are researching the licensing landscape, and they also hold <a href="https://opensource.org/events">events</a> and offer a substantial offering of <a href="https://opensource.org/osi-open-source-education">educational materials</a>.</p><p>In our next installment, we’ll turn to Open Standards and the work of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">Drilling down: Open Source</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Zeenab Aneez &amp; Neha&nbsp;Mujumdar  Session <p>It was media theorist Marshall McLuhan who popularised the phrase ‘the medium is the message’; to him, different kinds of media engage the senses in different ways, affecting how we process it and engage with its contents. Before situating research in the digital space, it is important to ask ourselves: what is the nature of the medium are we dealing with here? How do people interact with it? What are the opportunities it provides and the risks it poses? How can we study new digital objects, such as online-first news outlets, podcasts, etc in a way that recognises the medium’s&nbsp;newness?</p><p>The proposed session is an exploration of a methodology that is informed and defined by specific characteristics of the medium, with a special focus on digital news and journalism in India. Through this, it seeks to tackle the first of the four key focus areas of the conference: How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?</p><p>Keeping this key question in mind, we ask: how can digital methods research contribute to the study of news and journalism in the digital space? How can we use digital objects such as tags, Likes, and Comments to understand how user feedback works in the new information economy? What can the interface of a news creation platform tell us about the changing roles of Indian journalists in today’s media environment? How can we formulate a methodology for studying the metamorphosis of a news story by using Twitter and what skills are required to gather and process information for research of this&nbsp;nature?</p><p>In order to inform our responses to such questions, we borrow from Richard Rogers’ adage ‘Follow the medium’ (Rogers 2013), which argues that “natively digital”(Ibid. 19) objects like tags, links, Likes or Comments, which originate in digital networks, cannot be fully understood with methods, such as, say content analysis; an example of a non-digital method that does not recognise its digital nature. The proposed session will make use of the general philosophy embodied by Rogers’ approach and urge participants to acknowledge the specific properties of the Internet as a medium and look at news and journalism as part of the larger media ecology of the web. This calls for the use of new methods that are digital in nature; the discussion on contemporary news should expand from how the news industry is coping with the digital transition, to how we can better understand the specific elements of this transition and use this understanding to reflect upon the changing nature of journalism and news&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In order to channel the discussion, the session proposes using the framework from one particular field of digital research: platform studies. With the advent of Web 2.0 and the emergence of the ‘web as platform’ (O’Reilly 2007) and the strengthening relationship between the news industry and social media platforms(‘Reuters Institute Digital News Report’ 2015), traditional as well as digital-born news sites are increasingly adopting a platform model. Therefore, platform studies makes for a fitting framework within which to understand the workings of these platforms, their technological and formal structures, and the specific ways in which they allow users to interact with news&nbsp;content.</p> Plan <p>The session will begin with a brief introduction to digital methods (Rogers 2013) and the field of ‘platform studies’ (Bogost and Montfort 2009; Gillespie 2010; Dijck 2013), which will serve as a loose framework through which to study existing news platforms as well as perform analyses on social media platforms as sites for news and journalism. This will be supplemented by the works of Anne Helmond (2015) and Tarleton Gillespie (2010).</p><p>Following this, participants will be divided into groups of four-six, with each group anchored by a volunteer, with added support from the two co-leaders. They will then be given the task of formulating a research question that makes use of one or more of the digital methods presented and are also required to frame a methodology that makes allowances for the particularities of the Indian news environment. The session will conclude with a brief discussion based on their findings.</p><p>The goal of the workshop will be to explore how digital methods can be aligned with current concerns about news and journalism in India, and open up avenues for research that acknowledges that online news occupies a space that includes natively digital objects and information architectures and hence demands research methods specific to this environment. The workshop also aims at reflecting on potential collaborations between researchers in media studies, data scientists and technologists in developing a comprehensive methodology using which to study digital media in&nbsp;India.</p> Readings <p>Gillespie, Tarleton. “The Politics of ‘Platforms’.” New Media &amp; Society 12, no. 3 (2010):&nbsp;347–364.</p><p>Rogers, Richard. “The End of the Virtual: Digital Methods,” Digital Methods.

<p>We sat down with CYNAM Director, Madeline Howard, to find out what makes this ‘woman in identity’ tick….</p>
Madeline Howard
 What do you do and what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m delighted to wear a few different hats! My day job is the Socio-Technical Engagement Manager at Cygenta, where I work on the human side of cyber security. I particularly focus on awareness, behaviour and cultural change. I love my field of work as I constantly feel as though I’m making a positive difference to help people and organisations to live more secure lives.</p>
<p>Cygenta also supports me as an <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/industry-100-introduction">i100 for the National Cyber Security Center</a> and their CyberFirst Schools programme. I dedicate one day a week to this – and I absolutely LOVE this part of my job.</p>
<p>Here, I get to work with amazing international, national and local companies to inspire, excite and enthuse the next generation about computer science and cyber security. It’s so rewarding to make a difference to the futures of young people while also supporting the industry talent pipeline.</p>
<p>Finally in my spare time, I’m a Director of Cyber Cheltenham, CyNam. It is a real privilege to be a Director of the UK’s largest cyber cluster and support the development of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>So what gets me out of bed in the morning? Well I’m passionate about making a positive difference. Whether that is in improving organisations and individuals cyber security awareness, exciting the next generation about their future opportunities or developing the incredible cyber security ecosystem we have, I always want to make a positive impact.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>It was not exactly a ‘traditional’ route! I studied Geography at Newcastle University and really didn’t know what I wanted to do. Well that’s a lie, I knew my dream job was to be a weather girl… still true! When I finished university, I started in a role within cyber security working in business development. In months I knew I’d found my niche! I loved the pace at which this sector moves and it’s great to be constantly learning about how we engage with technology.</p>
<p>I was keen to pursue a career, raising awareness about cyber security. At Cygenta, I am extremely lucky enough to work for – and be mentored by – Dr Jessica Barker. One thing I recognise is that I’ve always been really lucky to have lots of fantastic people to turn to for advice and guidance and support when I’ve had to make tough decisions during my career.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned is to go with your gut, ALWAYS.</p>
<p>I’ve had lots of great opportunities but I nearly turned down some of these simply because I over-thought things. Sometimes things can feel like a risk but if it feels right in your gut it normally is . And, if it doesn’t work out, you’ll still have learned so much simply by learning to take a risk – it’ll all help to shape the future you.</p>
 What’s your advice to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>STOP: Thinking that your employees are your ‘human firewall’ against cyber attacks and incidents. The human firewall suggests your employees should prevent attacks and incidents. When it comes to cyber attacks, you can’t prevent every incident, and so this is a totally unrealistic ask on individuals. It also doesn’t prepare people for what to do when something does go wrong.</p>
<p>START: Developing individuals as ‘Human Sensors’. The concept of human sensors suggests that individuals know how to detect and respond to incidents. They understand the indicators of compromise and feel empowered to approach the correct individuals or platforms to report incidents. This ultimately minimises the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) they may have when they think an incident has occurred.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: Investing in cyber security – not just the technology but talent development and people skills. Ensure your employees feel confident and empowered to positively engage with cyber security to improve your response and resilience capabilities.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In all aspects of life, diversity is the enabler for growth, innovation, collaboration and positive change.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://thegogiver.com/"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://thegogiver.com/">“The Go-Giver”</a>.</p>
<p>It really resonated with me. In short, it suggests we shouldn’t do things because we expect something in return but because we just want to help. It is a fantastic ethos to live by – it’ll empower you to become the best version of yourself!</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Care less about what people think of you.</p>
<p>It’s not ‘uncool’ to want to achieve.</p>
<p>Go with your gut and everything will work out.</p>
<p>And, finally, accept that you can’t be in control of everything.</p>
<p>I tell myself everyday ‘I wonder if the stars will align?’. If something works out, the stars have aligned. I don’t know anything about the stars but sometimes when things work out, it’s nice to visualise the stars aligning and shining for you.</p>

<p>A cross-community effort to standardize on common, DID-anchored capabilities</p><p>If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented. The addresses take the form of a long, opaque “string” (a long block of letters and numbers, in this case of a fixed length), and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID “documents”</a> that get returned when they are queried contain some cryptographic key material and, depending on the particularities of the returning system, maybe a few other pieces of information or addresses.</p><p>Identity systems have traditionally been largely hierarchical, focusing on asymmetrical or vertical relationships. The most open system that allows horizontal communications between users in different systems is email, and even there, user-to-user communications are mediated by servers, which banlist each other based on a federated reputation system. DIDCommunications (DIDComm), on the other hand, is a set of tools to allow horizontal (or at least, power-neutral) and bidirectional channels of communication between two entities that know each other’s DIDs and nothing else. It resembles today’s end-to-end encryption systems like Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp more than it resembles traditional email.</p> How DIDComm&nbsp;works <p>DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that&nbsp;DID.</p><p>This architecture is powerful because it provides a way to do mutual authentication between any two parties. Right now many systems of messaging and communication on the open web don’t provide for mutual authentication with cryptography; they ask individuals to authenticate to sites or businesses (nowadays mostly with single-sign on integrations, i.e. “log in with your XXX account” buttons), and these businesses vouch for and secure the end-user. In exchange, businesses get valuable insight into the communications or commercial activity they facilitate — insights they often sell to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Furthermore, while the onus is on individuals to authenticate themselves to these enabling institutions and middlemen, the business themselves do little to authenticate themselves reciprocally. Over time, the “lock icon” next to URLs in modern browsers has come to be a useful norm (and users have been habituated to reacting suspiciously to any website which cannot provide on). However, phishing attacks, where intercepted or falsified communications lead users to malicious websites impersonating ones they trust, continue to be a major attack vector for fraud and identity theft. By supporting mutual authentication, a more uniform and democratic protocol is established for secure communications, which raises the bar for user expectations for security assurances from institutions and websites.</p> A Quick History of DIDComm and the Aries Protocols <p>DIDComm was first developed within an international and collaborative open source co-development project called <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> (hosted at <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger</a>) and under a IPR regime <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs#about">designed to cover</a> software but not specifications. Aries was spun out of the earlier Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> project, to both iterate, expand, and make more blockchain-agnostic the codebase and tooling created earlier for the identity blockchain Indy. In the same process, Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Ursa</a> was also created to advance the underlying cryptographic elements independently of the blockchain and the identity systems relying on it. The Indy project continues evolving as well, from a single blockchain to a family of <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36734079">interoperable</a> ones.</p><p>The name “DIDComm” and version 1 of its libraries and designs evolved in this context: it adapted the Indy-specific horizontal communications libraries to a more agnostic Aries context and iterated them to be more configurable for new contexts and implementations. At some point, however, it became clear that further interoperability would be best served not by writing specifications based on existing Aries implementations, but by a more “green-field”, specification-first design process with interlocutors from further afield. This work came to be co-sponsored by DIF and Hyperledger partly to engage these outside interlocutors, and partly because the IPR protections of DIF were more appropriate to a specification-first open-standards process. The charter of the DIDComm working group at DIF&nbsp;.</p>Source: CHAPI101/DIDComm101 <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">joint session</a> at&nbsp;#<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a> The Future of&nbsp;DIDComm <p>Since the chartering process began in September of 2019 at the post-IIW DIF Face to Face, the work of designing a new core for DIDComm and thinking through new features and structure has proceeded at a steady clip. The implementations and details are still being hammered out in some places, but the feature set is stable. The benefits of the new protocol will&nbsp;include:</p>  Mutual authentication  Robust, email-like threading support for relying messaging systems (including error-handling and other machine-readable messaging systems)  Support for new security and transport primitives like the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">JWM&nbsp;envelope</a>  Asynchronous by default, but with synchronous communication modes also supported  Offline support so that two agents who are not online can exchange information via bluetooth or QR&nbsp;Code  Easy to support with a web server (among many other topographies)  Many of the positive qualities of the earlier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12/">SOAP</a> protocol, include message format standards, routing, transport agnostic support, and subprotocols.  <p>This effort has the direct support and participation of many core members of the Aries community. It is within the plans of the Aries community to migrate to DIDComm V2 as it becomes ready for use and tested. In both existing DIDComms (many of which are already in production), protocols relying on a DIDComm-encrypted channel for authentication or communications functions will be moved over. The relationship between DIDComm and these relying “subprotocols” is quite similar to the relationship between HTTP and the APIs created on top of HTTP — an upgrade to the underlying security or feature set will not affect the relying applications that just need a secure&nbsp;channel.</p><p>There is <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/111">some consternation</a> about the use of the term “DIDComm Protocols” to describe the various different types of exchange or transactions that could be built on a DIDComm foundation. Regardless of whether one chooses to call them “protocols” or something else, a cross-community standard will be crucial to co-developing broadly interoperable capabilities and common libraries on the basis of secure, authenticated DIDComm channels. Some examples of what these would&nbsp;include:</p>  Secure user messaging or even chat-like instant messaging  Issuing a credential  Presenting a credential or an identity&nbsp;proof  Interactions with IOT systems or even directly with specific, authenticated devices  Payment coordination   Getting involved <p>A good place to jump in would be this video recorded by DIDComm WG Chair Sam Curren at the June DIF Face-to-face meeting:</p><p>With this background, a read through the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_DIDcomm_WG_Charter_v1.pdf">charter</a>, the mailing list <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/didcomm-wg/topics">archives</a>, the github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/DIDComm-js">repository</a>, or the Slack channel of the DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">working group</a> at DIF will make a lot more sense; as will DIDComm sessions at the new IIW and F2F meetings.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Whether, why, and how to attend the biannual conference along with&nbsp;DIF</p><p>The <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a> is an interactive “un-conference” that has convened various kinds of researchers, identity technology companies, and thinkers since 2005. It brings together a wide swath of people working towards great control of the digital representations of themselves, incorporating theoretical, market-building, research, and policy-oriented projects. This coming month, the 31st edition will be held entirely only on the Qiqochat platform, like the 30th edition before&nbsp;it.</p> The Storied History of&nbsp;IIW <p>Kaliya Young, Doc Searls and Phil Windley founded the conference in 2005. At the time, all three were active in a group known as “the Identity Gang”. They had been discussing identity technology concepts in detail on a mailing list since meeting each other at Digital Identity World in the fall of 2004; after a year of passionate discussions, there came a point where an in-person meeting felt necessary. The first meeting was in Berkeley, California, and ever since it has been hosted at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. It has moved online-only since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early&nbsp;2020.</p><p>In 2005, many in the community were blogging and writing about identity and related themes. Some had made broad and widely acclaimed pronouncements like Kim Cameron, most known in this regard for his essay, <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">The Seven Laws of Identity.</a> One early collaboration within the community was a <a href="http://wiki.idcommons.net/Lexicon">Lexicon</a> that has aged well. Many were also writing code and founding projects to realize their various visions. At the first IIW, eight different projects gave structured presentations on the first day, while the second day was devoted to a more open-ended and collaborative synthesis, facilitated by Kaliya Young using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space Technology</a>.</p><p>At that first event, several of the projects focused on using URLs as identifiers for individuals, who could authenticate against these as they moved around the early Web 2.0, commenting on different sites. Conversations at the event were formative on the OpenID protocols and the OpenID Foundation. Since then, many different protocols have been conceived and/or nested at the conference, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, <a href="http://www.simplecloud.info/">SCIM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Resource_Identifier">XRI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDI">XDI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger">Web Finger</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_(protocol)">Salmon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub">PubSubHubbub</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>The event attracts people from all over the world and continues to be the “biggest tent” for collaboration and ideation across the various user-centric identity spheres and communities, particularly for what is now called “decentralized identity” or “self-sovereign identity”. You can see the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">book of proceedings</a> from most of the IIWs for the last 15 years, refined and edited in the month after each organic and <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/engagement-guidelines/">self-organizing</a> event.</p> The Decentralized Identity Foundation at&nbsp;IIW <p>IIW has always been a neutral venue where diverse groups across the community focused on the decentralized identity, that often work in parallel between IIWs, come together to report out and understand each other’s projects. Furthermore, many attendees come from established sectors of the software industry, such as Enterprise Identity and Access Management (EIAM), Cybersecurity, or Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). This creates a healthy mix of specialists, professionals, activists, and novices, balancing the “bikeshedding” of technology specifics with societal conversations and industry-wide trends and roadmaps. The open culture of DIF and its commitment to integrations with today’s identity technologies thrive in this environment, and many key DIF collaborations have begun or successfully recruited new participants at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>Anyone who attends from any of the myriad organizations in the space can put agenda/discussion topics forward, which also makes it a very generative place for researchers, innovators, and market-watchers. Many of the DIF working groups present their latest work at the event for technical or business review, and it is a key venue for soliciting insightful feedback from related organizations and industry stakeholders. Sometimes projects in early stages of development, specification, or scoping even do requirements gathering or technical sanity-checks at the&nbsp;event.</p><p>Historically, the DIF has hosted a one-day face-to-face meeting immediately before or after the IIW conference proper to take advantage of the geographic co-location of so many key players. This time around, however, DIF is experimenting with a more spaced-out approach to allow for a period of processing of the IIW sessions to allow for a more complementary role 5 or 6 weeks after the fact. Stay tuned for more details about design or development sprints to take place bookended by the two&nbsp;events.</p> Hot Topics across #IIW30 and&nbsp;#IIW31 <p>At the last IIW, DIF working groups put forward these sessions:</p>  The internal governance group shared its new <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Code_of_Conduct_-_at_DIF">Code of Conduct </a>and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Group</a> also gave a presentation on its <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/finding-the-bell-curve-of-meaning-61a1d22b7bdd">methodology</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Glossary_Results_-_Credentials,_Wallets,_Agents_Defined._%2B_Next_Steps">results</a>  There were four different sessions presenting and gathering feedback on four different aspects <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/%22KERI_(A)_Key_Event_Receipt_Infrastructure._A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">of</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_-Part_B_Key_Event_Reciept_Infrastructure.A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">the</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">KERI&nbsp;</a><a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_Implementation:_Whats_Next_DID:UNI_Method._Ref_Imp._DIF_Project.">project</a>.  Similarly, there were multiple presentations on the BBS+ signature suite at the heart of both the Aries <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/BBS%2B_JSON-LD_ZKPs_and_Aries_%26_Indy._Your_Thoughts%3F">AnonCreds2</a> system for verifiable presentations and a novel <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD_using_BBS%2B_-_Round_2">JSON-LD-based system</a>, development of which continues to be lead by Mattr&nbsp;Global.  The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a> WG gave a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/DIDComm_WG_Progress_Update">progress report</a>, which was particularly important to many stakeholders in the Aries community not involved in the autonomous research &amp; development project. A separate session was held on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/JSON_Web_Messaging_(JWM):_What_are_they_and_why_are_they_useful_for_secure_messaging_sytems%3F">JSON Web Messaging (JWM)</a> proposal that the DIDComm WG submitted to the&nbsp;IETF.  Similarly, there was a well-attended joint progress report on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Sidetree_Protocol_/_Element_DID_and_Friends">SideTree Protocol / Element DID and Friends</a>&nbsp;, as well as an update from the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/TxAuth_and_XYZ_(and_Maybe_someday_OAuth_3)">XYZ project</a> to iterate the OAuth protocol.  A breakthrough <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">panel</a> (which was recorded — see previous link) explored the potential interaction or combination of the complementary browser-based CHAPI communications/transport protocol and the more browser-independent work of the DIDComm&nbsp;WG  Frameworks and ecosystem maps were presented by the new Trust-over-IP foundation, the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Understanding_MyData_Operators_-_white_paper_published_today">Operators</a> <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">project</a> of MyData Global; certification programs were announced and outlined by the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Intro_to_the_Me2B_Alliance_Testing_Specification">Me2B Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ID2020_Certification:_feedback_and_next_steps">ID2020</a>&nbsp;project.  For a more detailed overview of highlights, see Juan Caballero’s <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/lessons-from-the-internet-identity-workshop-2020-89a4915c4658">detailed recap</a> for the <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">company blog</a> of DIF member organization, Spherity&nbsp;GmbH  For the complete, edited notes from all sessions, see the <a href="https://github.com/windley/IIW_homepage/raw/gh-pages/assets/proceedings/IIW_30_Book_of_Proceedings.pdf">Proceedings Book</a> (sponsored by DIF member organization, Jolocom&nbsp;GmbH)   Heading into the 31st IIW, we can expect significant interest and attendance at sessions on these&nbsp;topics:   A progress report on the alignment of the browser-native Presentation Exchange DIF specification and the relevant Aries RFCs and libraries  Moving KERI from prototype to actual implementations (and integrations!), as well as Drummond Reed’s less-technical introduction entitled “KERI for Mere&nbsp;Mortals”  Cross-method interoperability and portability, within and beyond Indy networks (which are proliferating quickly in&nbsp;Europe!)  Test Suites and a process to incentivize (or even fund?) revisions of major specifications to include more explicit test&nbsp;vectors  Lessons from the mid-2020 DID-Core sprint and PING W3C Security&nbsp;Review  Updates on OIDC-DID bridging work, OAuth &amp; GNAP, and fast-moving regulatory changes in Europe and North&nbsp;America   Making your IIW&nbsp;plan <p>DIF has had great success presenting work at IIW — and increasingly, it is becoming an important aspect of our educational and outreach efforts to post recordings of these presentations on our youtube <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ?c=UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ">channel</a>. We’re hoping this tradition will build more momentum at the upcoming&nbsp;IIW!</p><p>The event is a great opportunity for those who are already very active in the community working on standards and code related to decentralized identity. It is also a great opportunity for those who are very new to get up to speed quickly via what language professors call “deep immersion.” It is very welcoming and friendly, and since each session includes experts from different fields, there are few assumptions and much level-setting. DIF leadership attends the event and encourages its membership to actively participate.</p><p>For those already planning to attend, please note that a skeletal structure is already <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/schedule/">posted</a>. The most important sessions to attend are each day’s “agenda creation” sessions; the “demo hour” sessions for live demos of new products and prototypes, and the “closing circle” readouts from each day’s events are close seconds. Cordoning off those timeslots in your calendar weeks in advance is highly recommended, as a way of keeping those timeslots free of conflicts in your home time&nbsp;zone!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-at-iiw31-f8aafe64c985">DIF at #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>OwnYourData &amp; Human Colossus Foundation have been selected to take part in the Data Portability &amp; Services Incubator (DAPSI), a 3-year EU-funded project that empowers internet innovators to develop new solutions in the data portability field.</p><p>What is DAPSI ?</p><p>The Data Portability and Services Incubator (DAPSI) is an EU-funded project, under the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, to empower top internet innovators to develop human-centric solutions, addressing the challenge of personal data portability on the internet. As foreseen under the GDPR, this will make it significantly easier for citizens to transmit data from one service provider to another.</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>DAPSI will support top-notch projects through a 9-month incubation programme where experts in diverse fields will provide a successful working methodology, access to top infrastructure, training in business and data related topics, coaching, mentoring, and a vibrant ecosystem. On top of that, each DAPSI project can receive up to €150k equity-free funding.</p><p><a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/dip/">Digital Immunization Passport</a> (DIP) is taking part in DAPSI to create a state-of-the-art digital certificate of vaccination. Currently, vaccination and immunisation information are spread over different organisations like labs and hospitals as well as pharmaceutical companies together with government agencies. A patient usually only has a paper certificate that provides vaccination treatments with often difficult-to-read handwritten additional information. In the proposed solution, OwnYourData and Human Colossus Foundation will develop an end-to-end data flow that:</p>  <p>connects to various immunisation information providers;</p>  <p>aggregates, harmonises, and semantically annotates the data;</p>  <p>makes this data set available in an open format accessible for Personal Data Stores (PDS), compliant to the MyData Operator guidelines;</p>    <p>provide a human-centric data management platform for health information;</p>  <p>allows to prove immunisation status through Verifiable Credentials*; and</p>  <p>packages selected health data for processing by 3rd parties together with a well-defined usage policy and a provenance trail.</p>  <p>The main focus of this project is on Data Interoperability &amp; Compatibility through establishing interfaces between the health industry and individuals, as well as pushing forward on standardised interfaces for PDSs. Additionally, we address Data Transparency (Usage Policies and Data Provenance in Semantic Containers) and Security &amp; Privacy (by applying blockchain technology and digital watermarking on data sharing).</p><p>* Note:&nbsp;The characteristic of verifiability refers to the signatures on the&nbsp;credential which are verifiable. It does not refer to the&nbsp;authenticability of the claims within the credential itself. A Verifiable Credential can therefore be thought of as an&nbsp;authenticable credential that can be verified.</p><p></p><p>How does it work?&nbsp;</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>In the two-phase supporting programme, the projects will develop advanced solutions in the Data Portability field. From September 2020 to February 2021 (Kick-Start phase), they will develop a solution related to a specific use case. The best projects will progress to the second phase (Booster) where the use cases will be fostered to evolve into solid projects to gain enough traction for deployment and market readiness.</p><p>Follow our journey through DAPSI!&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at the DAPSI <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/">project portfolio</a> to see more information about the selected innovators.</p><p>To read more about DAPSI, please visit the website: <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">dapsi.ngi.eu</a></p><p>Press contact and social media</p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:dapsi@ngi.eu">dapsi@ngi.eu</a></p><p>Website: <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">https://dapsi.ngi.eu/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/NGI_DAPSI">https://twitter.com/NGI_DAPSI</a></p><p>LinkedIn&nbsp;: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/ngi-dapsi">https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/ngi-dapsi</a></p><p>Facebook&nbsp;: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NGI.DAPSI">https://www.facebook.com/NGI.DAPSI</a></p><p><a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/ujalo98s00b93gh7gqkuqd3lfj52xq">Permalink</a></p><p></p>

				 <p>Winning the Future: Private Sector is Critical for the SDGs</p> 
			      
				
				
				 <p>There are important moments, when values are afloat and when change may happen. Moments where the zeitgeist is changing. Those moments often grow out of crisis.</p>
<p>Initiated by the pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis and fueled by the energy of the protests against racial injustice and the emergence of a new generation demanding change, we may find ourselves in such a moment as we face the disruptive forces of the Covid-pandemic.</p>
<p>2020 gave us the most serious health crisis in 100 years. The Covid-pandemic has stolen lives, rattled societies and led us straight into the most serious economic crisis in peacetime.</p>
<p>This crisis has ruthlessly exposed societal weaknesses and has shredded away decades of economic growth and job gains, leaving us vulnerable to the many other serious crises we face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking across the globe, the crisis has also reminded us of the importance of government -of collaboration between government and the private sector – and the fact, that concerted planned action works, and can advance development.</p>
<p>The pandemic has offered important learnings.</p>
 
 On rapid, constrained innovation as we searched for remedies, or lateral innovation such as when car manufacturers learned to produce ventilators or winemakers produce hand sanitizers. 
 We have learned new ways of working and made digital leaps toward the online transition and on accelerating other useful digitalization by years. Inclusive Digitization is important as we find our way out of the crisis. An example is <a href="https://caspar.ai/">Casper.AI</a> where academics have come together to start a company that brings the power of distributed AI to help the elderly life a safe and comfortable live in their homes.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Perhaps most important though is the realization of the level of interconnectedness of our lives and how important it is to stand and work together.&nbsp; How directly our actions impact the lives of others and how we can mobilize and be innovative in collaboration for a more responsible and sustainable approach; how everyone comes out ahead, when we do that.&nbsp; The facemask, and the active choice in caring for others by wearing it, is a strong symbol of this. 
 
<p>As we find our way out of the current crisis, we should reflect on these learnings.&nbsp; This is important for our continued efforts to fight global warming and the many other challenges we face. As we focus on the current crisis, small steps continue to be made in the area of more sustainable development and solving some of the other important issues at hand.</p>
<p>Embracing the Sustainable Development Goals Framework – Doing Business As Unusual</p>
<p>It’s important that we realize the seriousness of the challenges ahead of us, and that we understand the huge opportunity for change. This calls for active involvement of industry and for a new type of responsible leadership and collaboration via the UN sustainable development goals framework.</p>
<p>World leaders agreed to the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">17 Sustainable Development Goals</a> in New York in 2015 in acknowledgement of the existential crisis we find ourselves in – combating climate change, tackling massive inequality and more. See <a href="https://sdgintegration.undp.org/?fbclid=IwAR1Tnsja2jh3ozETfS9x1Tm0fJ7NLGNIG0Pbo8P866ulGKIjcuobAZhMp8w">UNDP video on&nbsp; integrated&nbsp; solutions</a>. These goals weave together social, economic and environmental challenges and solutions – they recognize the interconnectedness of the challenges and have the deep spirit of leaving no one behind. Governments, philanthropy and civil society organizations around the world have embraced this global call to action and are collaborating on advancing the SDGs.</p>
<p>As we celebrate the 5th anniversary of the SDG’s, there is agreement across sectors that we need deeper private sector engagement and a new type of business leadership to achieve the SDGs in the remaining 10 years. Doing Business as Usual will not suffice – business leaders need to focus on generating value to society and minimize harmful externalities – not just on profits for a few individuals.</p>
<p>The celebration of the 5th anniversary of the SDG’s should serve as a call for active and joined effort by governments, civil society and business for a better world. The United Nation Sustainable Goals provide a substantial framework and metrics for a new responsible leadership.</p>
<p>The Business Case for Corporate Responsible Digital Leadership</p>
<p>This is not just a moral imperative for the private sector; consumers, markets, customers, employees also drive this shift. Industries leading the way will achieve a competitive advantage in this new era.</p>
<p>Some businesses are showing leadership. Examples include Maersk and Unilever, benefiting from demonstrating responsible leadership. Patagonia is a trailblazer on transforming by developing their core brand around a sustainable and inclusive approach to business. These companies reap the financial benefits of responsible business as consumers vote with their dollars, develop strong brand loyalty and have employees experiencing a deeper connection with their employer. Salesforce is has set an example for the Tech Sector by explicitly stating that the Business of Business is to Improve the State of the World and this may be a factor in it’s growth &amp; success.</p>
<p>We also live in a moment when tech is transforming everything at an unprecedented pace and impact we have never seen before – for good and bad. Tech provides the infrastructure of the future and policy-makers will not be able to keep up by themselves. However, in collaboration with Business leaders they can better anticipate and design policy to mitigate the harmful effects of tech to society and on the organization. An example is recent significant challenges faced by Tech sector giants of Silicon Valley who have been summoned by US congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the norms, societal expectations and requirements for business were to assume their full responsibility to society including on the digital front – measured on the value they bring to society and not just the profits they generate for&nbsp; their shareholders, we would be much further along on the SDGs and businesses would prosper financially. The growing impact investing trend shows that investors are eager to fund businesses with a double bottom line. We need investors, customers and other stakeholders to focus similarly on rewarding businesses focused on Responsible Digital leadership.</p>
<p>The Power of Collective Action: Public Private Partnerships and Unorthodox Collaborations&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one expects an individual company to tackle the SDGs,&nbsp; but how a business sees its role in individual and collectively contributing to solutions and taking responsibility for not doing harm will be a game-changer in solving the many challenges we face. This is especially true in the digital realm increasingly becoming foundational infrastructure to businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collaboration across sectors with businesses partnering with governments, UN, foundations can achieve the seemingly unsurmountable challenges and co-create solutions to tackle digital challenges and scale digital opportunities to advance the SDGs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kenya SDG Platform is one example of cross-sectoral collaboration with partners across the world. The UN and Kenya have launched this platform inviting private sector actors, foundations, academics and innovators from across the world to help advance 4 prioritized SDGs. The Kenya SDG Accelerator Lab will bring together practitioners and academics from within country and beyond to explore cutting edge tech innovations from Kenya, Stanford, Berkeley and Silicon Valley to advance 4 SDGs. See Reuter’s article on the&nbsp; <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20180209112650-s1njv/">Africa’s quest to achieve health care for all needs an unorthodox approach</a> on how such partnerships are being catalyzed to advance primary health care for all (SDG 3) in Kenya.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar example of innovative partnerships for change is the adoption of 13 Climate Partnerships by the Danish Government.&nbsp; The collaborative initiative invites industry and industry competences to develop solutions to achieve ambitious climate goals in 13 different areas such as finance, production, life science, aviation and agriculture through active and ambitious co-creational partnerships with the Danish Government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus we are pleased to be able to collaborate with Matthias De Bièvre, the aNewGovernance initiative (<a href="http://anewgovernance.org/">anewgovernance.org</a>) and the Skills Alliance (<a href="http://skills-alliance.org/">skills-alliance.org</a>) which unites public, private and academic organizations to form a Public Private Partnership to create human-centric data ecosystems, at the service of major societal issues such as employment, education and responsible mobility while at the same time bringing great value to businesses and organizations.&nbsp; Broader, shared and ethical access to data enables us to address many of the issues facing us collectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this subject, Laurent Vidal, professor and research director at the University Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne and vice-president of the Institute for Digital Fundamental Rights (<a href="http://idfrights.org/">idfrights.org</a>) states: «&nbsp;Today the evolution of law and human rights on subjects as complex as digital and artificial intelligence must be done hand in hand with the organizations and companies creating and using these technologies to ensure that regulation and legislation correspond to the realities on the ground”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is Responsible Digital Leadership?</p>
<p>We need innovative solutions – efficient energy solutions, better and cleaner propulsion and more efficient solutions in a very high number of areas.&nbsp;Tech, data and innovation play an important role in fighting climate change and tackling the challenges we face. Artificial intelligence, autonomous technological solutions and better analysis through big data offers hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Covid crisis has underscored the need to process large amounts of data for good, in order to rapidly develop effective and innovative solutions. To effectively stop global warming and advance the human development on hunger, health care and education we will have to develop transformative digital solutions.</p>
<p>But to do that we need to remember to be mindful and responsible. We need trust.</p>
<p>The past years a very high number of guidelines have been presented to curb the adversarial effects of technology. These will have to be integrated into the way we conduct business. We need a new approach to responsible digital leadership. The World Benchmarking Alliance’s <a href="https://www.worldbenchmarkingalliance.org/digital-inclusion/">Digital Inclusion Benchmark</a> is going to be ranking ICT companies.</p>
<p>Business will need to focus on issues such as including stakeholders in decisions, systems thinking, responsible innovation and impact. This means a strong focus on basic values such as fairness, transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Industry will have to revisit their values and redefine their visions and core missions to ensure relevant focus not just on profit, but also on long term impact.</p>
<p>For most, this means developing new internal roles and organizational bodies such as ethics committees, platforms for stakeholder engagement, revitalized board dialogues and mechanisms to ensure diversity and strong internal discourse of feedback and pushback to ensure a culture of responsible thinking.&nbsp; The carrot for the weary to take this jump is, that this is also necessary to promote the culture of responsible innovation we need to drive business in the 21st century.</p>
<p>The fact that culture is crucial has been coined in many ways and has never been truer. Whereas governance and guidelines are necessary and useful, a culture driven by transparent and bold responsible leadership is key to this development. The means to this end is continuous learning and an ongoing dialogue about values and impact until it seeps into the DNA of the organization.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing these kinds of digital challenges and opportunities in their core business practice/offerings, it is critical that businesses look at technology impact and the SDGs with a global citizen lens looking outwards into the ecosystem. In it’s <a href="http://report.hdr.undp.org/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_medium=homepage&amp;utm_campaign=hdr19">2019 Human Development Report</a> UN Development Program (UNDP) says that Climate change and technology rather than wealth and income are the modern-day wedges increasingly dividing the haves from the have-nots. «&nbsp;The climate crisis is already&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/poor-nations-pay-price-millions-flee-climate-chaos-oxfam-191202005945945.html">hitting the poorest hardest</a>, while technological advances such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can leave behind entire groups of people, even countries. «&nbsp;Allowing these new inequalities to grow could be «&nbsp;extremely dangerous and highly volatile,&nbsp;» said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner.</p>
<p>We believe that bringing multiple actors from the corporate sector to collaborate on a framework for Responsible Digital Leadership is important.&nbsp; In this spirit we convened a handful of forward-thinking leaders from the financial sector in Europe at Stanford University in late 2019. Along with leading academics from Stanford University and U.C. Berkeley we brainstormed on co-creating a framework for Responsible Digital leadership. <a href="http://www.responsibletech.io">www.responsibletech.io</a> and launched an initiative on Responsible Digital Leadership described in this <a href="https://humanrights.stanford.edu/news/fellows-launch-responsible-digital-leadership-project">recent Stanford Press Release</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transforming Challenges into Sustainable Solutions to achieve the SDGs</p>
<p>The private sector has a long history of developing innovative solutions to solve big problems. In this moment of existential crisis, who better than visionary private sector leaders to turn the challenges articulated in the SDG into business opportunities – by leveraging the power of innovative technology and new win-win business models – to bring sustainable transformation within the organizations and without, in their supply chains and in their communities, to create win-win solutions for business and society.&nbsp; We call on all business leaders across the world to embrace Responsible Digital leadership and the SDG framework.&nbsp; We call on them to bring the SDGs front and center in the core of their business, not just as a side CSR activity and design create win-win solutions that tackle the grand challenges of our times.</p>
<p>Corporate leaders who boldly institutionalize Responsible Digital Leadership to advance the SDGs can come out as winners.</p>

				 <p>&nbsp;Data has become the most fluid and in-demand commodity of the 21st century. Digitalized societies and the use of data and AI pose a high number of questions and challenges for the rights of individuals. Social media has been boundlessly integrated into our lives without regard. And further, data is now the basis for exercising a number of basic freedoms and human rights. How do we secure the right to privacy and basic human rights in the digital world? And how do we protect those rights? Which governance models do we need to create? How can we leverage recent innovations of Silicon Valley to propel this process? How can we empower people with their data?</p>
<p>&nbsp;This discourse on Governance Models will feed into<a href="http://anewgovernance.org">&nbsp;aNewGovernance </a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://idfrights.org/">The Digital Fundamental Rights Institute</a> which are collaborating to build standards (legal, technical, business, design) for a human centric data circulation infrastructure. The results are expected to be presented at a Conference on Digital Human Rights at Stanford University.</p>

In the Covid-19&nbsp;context, in order to be more&nbsp; resilient, we need&nbsp;to reinvent mobility more than ever. Mobility is by essence&nbsp;a domain where personal data is&nbsp;scattered&nbsp;across various types of actors. As information is the main trigger for people’s decisions, allowing them to be in control and circulate their data will greatly&nbsp;help to address all those challenges.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Anei mātou te hāpori o Digital Identity NZ e mihi ana ki a koutou i tēnei wiki hirahira, ko te wiki o Te Reo Māori. Arohatia te reo, kia kaha te reo Māori! Warmest greetings to you all during te wiki o Te Reo Māori. Toku ingoa ko, my name is Janelle Riki-Waaka, Pouherenga Waka, Relationships Manager and Kaihuawaere, Consultant Core Education and Digital Identity member.<br><br>Ko te kai a te rangatira, he kōrero – the substance of chiefs is to engage in kōrero. We, here at DINZ, have been engaging in lots of kōrero recently about how we can give mana to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and be tiriti-honouring in our intent and actions. We’ve been on a learning journey together and we are in the process of formalising our thinking into a Te Tiriti o Waitangi Action Plan that will guide our DINZ mahi ensuring we are striving for equity in Aotearoa. Our statement of intent is: “Digital Identity New Zealand is committed to being tiriti honouring by giving mana to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and upholding our responsibilities as effective treaty partners with Māori (Tāngata Tiriti).”<br><br>In thinking about how the articles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi relate to digital identity, here are just a few examples of our recent whakaaro: Article 1 – Kāwanatanga (Honourable Governance): DINZ understands our position as tangata tiriti and we affirm Māori as tangata whenua. Article 2 – Rangatiratanga (Māori Self-determination): We will seek to work alongside tangata whenua to support their aspirations and ensure their needs are addressed in the digital identity space. Article 3 – Ōritetanga (Equity): DINZ will work alongside iwi/hapū to ensure their voices are represented in kōrero about digital identity and their aspirations are realised in terms of digital identity solutions and developments. Article 4 – The Spoke Promise: Te Reo Māori will be celebrated in the digital identity ecosystem in Aotearoa and participating organisations will demonstrate and act on an understanding of their role as Tangata Tiriti. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital Identity New Zealand is on a journey and we are firmly in the waka with hoe (paddle) in hand! We understand the need for us to ensure Māori perspectives relating to identity are leading our hearts, minds and actions. Identity is a taonga (precious possession) and as such must be protected. The connection our tamariki (children) have with their language, culture and identity will shape our future in Aotearoa.<br><br>He tina ki runga, he tāmore ki raro. ‘Contentment above, firmly rooted below.’&nbsp; A good connection to your identity, culture and heritage will find contentment in life.</p>



<p>Janelle Riki-Waaka<br>DINZ Executive Council</p>



 



<p>Kia ora, thank you, Janelle. It is wonderful to have such a skilled and passionate kaiārahi (guide) in our DINZ Executive Council whanau, especially during te wiki o Te Reo Maori.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re pleased to announce our first two DINZ Discussion Forum events: A legal analysis of AML Reliance (members only) 7 October – join us as we share a report commissioned by DINZ members on the challenges and opportunities in the sharing and re-use of identity information used for customer due diligence in AML&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/online-event-dinz-report-aml-reliance-and-re-use/">Register here</a>. Deep dive into our 2020 Trust and Identity research (members only) 30 September – we will share the full research report and explore its implications and the collaborative action we can take to address some of the issues highlighted&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/online-event-exploring-the-trust-and-identity-research/">Register here</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>



<p>And based on the success of our member spotlight sessions during Techweek, we are launching a quarterly member showcase series.&nbsp;The first of these will be a Spring Showcase on Thursday, 5th November.&nbsp;You can register your interest in presenting <a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz?subject=Spring%20Showcase%20presenter">here</a>.<br><br>For more information on joining DINZ head to the <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/join/">Get Involved</a> section of our website.&nbsp;Next month we will be communicating with members on our <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a> elections, which take place early December.&nbsp;We have four positions open for election/re-election.<br><br>Lastly, Happy International Identity Day!&nbsp;September 16 is International Identity Day (otherwise called “<a href="https://www.id-day.org/">ID-Day</a>”).&nbsp;It is an initiative led by <a href="https://id4africa.com/">ID4Africa</a> to raise awareness about the important role identity plays in empowering individuals to exercise their rights and responsibilities fairly and equitably in a modern society.&nbsp;The&nbsp; date 16 September was chosen in commemoration of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16.9 which calls for legal identity for all including birth registration by 2030.</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CMO&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights_Actions_to_Counter_Email-Based_Attacks_on_Election-Related_S508C.pdf">&nbsp;issued an advisory</a> Thursday recommending cyber attack remedies for election-related activities&nbsp; including the use of FIDO authentication to thwart phishing&nbsp; attempts and account takeover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advisory, entitled “ACTIONS TO COUNTER EMAIL-BASED ATTACKS ON ELECTION RELATED ENTITIES” noted that 78 percent of cyber-espionage incidents are enabled by phishing. CISA makes specific recommendations on protecting against cyber attacks to aid organizations involved in election-related activities.</p>



<p>Among other recommendations, FIDO Authentication was highlighted to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover for cloud email and other high-value services. Specifically, CISA cites <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> Security Keys as a tool that campaigns and organizations can, and should, use to protect themselves. The advisory also recommends that, when available, campaigns and organizations should enroll users in advanced protection services such as <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">Google Advanced Protection</a>, which leverages FIDO Security Keys as a best practice over other 2FA methodologies to protect workforces from account takeovers related to malicious attacks.</p>



<p>FIDO security keys offer protection against phishing attacks by working as a second, physical factor of authentication and only authenticating when a user is on the correct website. Thus, even if a user is tricked into supplying their password to a phishing website, the physical security key will still block attackers from accessing their account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phishing continues to be a problem and remains one of the most popular means by which cybercriminals obtain data. Embracing FIDO technology is smart politics, and smart policy for those who understand the gravity of the cyber threat. As the election draws near, we’re increasingly seeing foreign agents <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-campaign-firm-hit-by-suspected-kremlin-hacking-attack">attempting</a> to infiltrate, influence and disrupt our elections.</p>



<p>As the CISA advisory implies, phishing and other cyber attacks are a critical issue with widespread and damaging implications to U.S. national security. The CISA advisory highlights the importance of locking down email systems, which have become a preferred vector for malicious activity. The CISA recommendations are intended as a preferred method for protecting the 2020 and future political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June, NIST put out a call for comments on the next iteration of its Digital Identity Guidelines, SP 800-63-4. We welcomed the opportunity to comment; read our full comments in the <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FIDO-ALLIANCE-Response-to-NIST-800-63-3-call-for-comments.pdf">Government &amp; Public Policy area of the website</a>.</p>



<p>Up front, we note that SP 800-63-3 represented a significant improvement in NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines, taking a more modern approach to identity proofing, authentication, and federation. That said, technology and threat are both never static, and we are encouraged to see that NIST is embarking on another revision of the document.</p>



<p>In our comments, we make three recommendations for SP 800-63-4:</p>



<p>1. NIST should adjust its approach to AALs to help implementers clearly differentiate between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, a variety of authenticators based on shared secrets – including Look-Up Secrets, Out-of-Band Devices (i.e., Push), and OTP apps and tokens – are given the same weight in AAL2 as authenticators based on asymmetric public key cryptography, such as FIDO. Given how attackers have caught up with the former, it no longer makes sense to combine&nbsp; these two types of authenticators under a single designation. Doing so misleads implementers into thinking these two categories of authenticators are equivalent in strength or resiliency. In our comments, we provide NIST with several ideas for how it can adjust the AALs to provide more differentiation between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. NIST should engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements</p>



<p>When SP 800-63-3 was first published, it created a path for some FIPS 140 validated FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 – if those authenticators were deployed in concert with Token Binding to deliver Verifier Impersonation Resistance. Since that time, most major browser vendors have withdrawn support for token binding. Per discussions with NIST, we understand that this means that FIDO authenticators can no longer meet AAL3 without implementing other approaches to mitigate the loss of token binding. As NIST embarks on the next revision of SP 800-63, we urge NIST to engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements.</p>



<p>3. Provide more direct references to FIDO</p>



<p>SP 800-63B describes Requirements by Authenticator Type but is inconsistent in how it points to standards that support that type. This has created some confusion in the marketplace when implementers consult SP 800-63B and see reference to standards like OTP and PKI but do not see any specific reference to FIDO. In our comments, we offer three suggestions for how the guidance can directly reference FIDO so that implementers have a clearer understanding of where FIDO fits in and supports the requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We greatly appreciate NIST’s consideration of our comments and look forward to ongoing dialogue and collaboration as they seek to update the Digital Identity Guidance.</p>

<p>Providing a standardised global solution for immutable data capture</p><p>The post-millennial generation has witnessed an explosion of captured data points which has sparked profound possibilities in both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. This has spawned the collective realisation that society’s current technological infrastructure is simply not equipped to fully protect personally identifiable information (PII) or to entice corporations to break down internal data silos, streamline data harmonisation processes and ultimately resolve worldwide data duplication and storage resource issues.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR Data Principles</a> (Wilkinson et al., 2016), a set of guiding principles to make data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, provide guidance for scientific data management and stewardship and are relevant to all stakeholders in the digital economy. In light of current data management deficiencies, Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) was born in accordance with the FAIR principles and courtesy of practical knowledge and experience gained from managing data within the complex realm of clinical trials. This blog post provides an introduction to OCA, an architecture purposefully designed to act as a catalyst for data language unification and a seed component in the enablement of a new <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-first-contact">dynamic data economy</a> (DDE).</p><p>The cognitive framework available for data management requirements across all industry sectors continues to be hampered by limitations to the foundational structure of currently deployed electronic capture solutions. In terms of schema design, OCA represents a schema as a multi-dimensional object consisting of a stable schema base and interoperable overlays. By introducing overlays as task-oriented linked data objects within the schema stack, OCA offers an optimal level of both efficiency and interoperability in alignment with FAIR principles. The architecture provides a stable infrastructure to facilitate seamless data harmonisation and interoperability processes, not only between internal departments and functions, but also between external companies working under a multi-layered governance framework as defined by, for instance, an industry consortium. </p>&nbsp; OCA: a cornerstone in a new Dynamic Data Economy <p>In terms of the creation of a fully-fledged DDE, we are still in the early turbulent stages of business, legal, technological and social innovation. To support a new paradigm of decentralised interactions, processes and practices such as de-identification, dissolution of corporate “walled-garden” storage, worldwide data harmonisation and single-source master data retrieval, new data-centric innovation is required. Despite these required revisions, one thing is for certain, civic society is heading into an era where siloed data ownership will be superseded by consented access to subsets of decentralised data. A new and finer understanding of how data is entered and captured in an ever-expanding and intrusive Internet continues to fuel a decentralisation movement consisting of <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/active-and-passive-identifiers">active and passive identifiers</a> to enable the interaction of authenticable data inputs and immutable semantic items beyond the confines of siloed data management solutions. The concept of self-determination regarding personal data is rapidly evolving in technological circles with the advancement of decentralised digital identity solutions.</p><p>If decentralised digital identity establishes whether or not data inputs can be trusted as having come from an assured source under the governance of an entity, decentralised semantic items ensure that the meaning and use of inputted data remains unaltered for all interacting actors. It is within the context of these two domains that informed consent can be defined for auditing data portability in a DDE and OCA is the catalyst to enable consented data flows.</p><p>OCA is the cornerstone for a safe and secure data sharing economy. The architecture provides an interoperable data capture solution for both centralised and decentralised networks. Blockchains and other distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have the potential to drive uniform data processing mechanisms, verifiable proof of consent, secure data portability and decentralised digital identity. With OCA providing a standardised global solution for data capture, community-driven data standards, interoperable data capture objects and sensitive attribute flagging capability can also be realised. These core public utility technologies provide an ideal evolutionary bridge between the current data economy and a new DDE where data-centric and user-centric characteristics become synonymous whether the user is a human, an organisation, a country or a thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Data-centric innovation points to a future society where new values and services will be created continuously, making people’s lives more conformable and sustainable. Developing and deploying the right data capture architecture will improve the quality of externally pooled data for future AI and IoT solutions. OCA was conceived for this purpose.</p>&nbsp; Interoperable Schema <p>OCA harmonises database models. It&nbsp;is a solution to semantic harmonisation between data models and data representation formats. Primarily devised for data object interoperability and privacy compliant data sharing, OCA is a&nbsp;standardised global solution for data capture that promises to significantly enhance the ability to pool data more effectively in terms of simplicity, accuracy, and allocation of resources.</p><p>A schema, a machine-readable definition of the semantics of a data structure, is typically created as a single data object. However, OCA represents a schema as a multi-dimensional object consisting of a stable schema base and linked overlays, data objects that provide additional extensions, colouration, and functionality to the base object. Any issuer can use a pre-existing schema base and build their own suite of overlays to add extra context to transform how information is displayed to a viewer or to guide an agent in how to apply a custom process to schema data.</p><p>The degree of separation between schema bases and overlays allows multiple parties to use the same base objects for similar data capture requirements thus providing a standard base from which to decentralise data. The ingredients provided by the interoperable data objects enables an ontology-driven, dynamic approach to data management. </p>

  OCA offers many advantages   <p>Simplified data pooling. Decoupling can occur at any time as overlays are linked objects. With all colouration stored in the overlays, combining data from related sources becomes much easier. Overlays can be removed from the base objects before the data merging process begins and reapplied to ensure consistent colouration post data pooling.</p>  <p>Stable schema bases. Most schema updates tend to be done at the application stage. In the case of OCA, all extension, colouration, and functionality definitions are applied in the overlays. This enables issuers to edit one or more of the linked objects to create simple updates rather than having to reissue schema bases on an ongoing basis.</p>  <p>Flagged attributes for encryption. By referencing the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/blinding-identity-taxonomyreducing-the-risk-of-identifying-governing-entities-in-blinded-datasets">Blinding Identity Taxonomy</a> (BIT), issuers can flag attributes in the schema base that could potentially unblind the identity of a governing entity. With attributes flagged at the base object layer, all corresponding data can be treated as sensitive throughout the data lifecycle and encrypted or removed at any stage making associated governing entity identification impossible.</p>  <p>Data decentralisation. Schema base definitions can remain in their purest form thus providing a standard base from which to decentralise data. Once the data holder has given adequate consent, data controllers can contribute anonymous data to decentralised data sharing hubs upon which 3rd parties can trigger accurate criteria searches for matched data. This eliminates the need for data silos and encourages consented data sharing. The data holder is empowered by self-determination regarding secondary use of their personal data.</p>  <p>Internationalisation. As character set encoding definitions are captured in a separate linked data object, a single report definition can contain different attribute forms for different languages available to users, based on a user’s locale and other language preferences.</p>  &nbsp; Method and Defined Data Objects <p>Rather than a schema being defined as a single data object, OCA represents a schema as a multi-dimensional object consisting of a schema base and linked overlays. Each of these data objects serve a specific function in the overall schema definition which, when amalgamated, provide a set of metadata that adequately describes a single set of data.&nbsp;</p><p>Each data object contains its own decentralised resource identifier (DRI), a type of passive identifier containing a cryptographic hash of content which is globally unique, resolvable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. In order for an overlay to be linked to a schema base, the DRI of the base object must be referenced in the metadata block of the overlay.</p>  SCHEMA BASE <p>A schema base is a stable base object that defines a single set of data in its purest form thus providing a standard base from which to decentralise data.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from any metadata relating to the object, attribute names and types are defined in the schema base. The construct also contains a blinding block which allows the issuer to flag any attributes that could potentially unblind the identity of a governing entity. With these attributes flagged at the base layer, all corresponding data can be treated as sensitive throughout the data lifecycle and encrypted or removed at any stage thus reducing the risk of identifying governing entities in blinded datasets.</p> MASKING OVERLAY <p>A masking overlay is an optional linked object that can be used to add data masks to schema attributes that have been flagged in the schema base. This overlay type is useful when implementing data anonymisation techniques during the capturing process.</p> SOURCE OVERLAY <p>A source overlay is an optional linked object that can be used to specify endpoints where dynamic data can be located. This overlay type is useful when ingesting streamed data where (i.) the source location is known but the data is not or (ii.) data is being generated in real-time. For example, a source overlay might be used when capturing medical health data generated by a patient monitoring device.</p> CHARACTER ENCODING OVERLAY <p>A character encoding overlay is a core linked object that can be used to define the character set encoding (e.g. UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, Windows-1251, Base58Check, etc.). This overlay type is useful when implementing solutions that facilitate data inputs across multiple languages.</p> ENTRY OVERLAY <p>An entry overlay is a core linked object that can be used to add predefined field values in a specified language to schema attributes. To minimize the risk of capturing unforeseen PII, the implementation of free form text fields is best avoided. This overlay type enables structured data to be entered thereby negating the risk of capturing and subsequently storing dangerous data.</p> LABEL OVERLAY <p>A label overlay is a core linked object that can be used to add labels in a specified language to schema attributes and categories. This overlay type enables labels to be displayed in a specific language at the presentation layer for better comprehensibility to the end user.</p> FORMAT OVERLAY <p>A format overlay is a core linked object that can be used to add formats and field lengths to schema attributes.</p> MAPPING OVERLAY <p>A mapping overlay is an optional linked object that can be used to map schema attributes to internal system identifiers. This overlay type is useful when integrating with legacy systems that are unable to read new data structures.</p> INFORMATION OVERLAY <p>An information overlay is an optional linked object that can be used to add instructional, informational or legal prose to assist the data entry process.</p> SUBSET OVERLAY <p>A subset overlay is an optional linked object that can be used to create a schema subset.</p> SENSITIVE OVERLAY (HOLDER ONLY) <p>In contrast to other overlay types which are assigned by an issuer, a sensitive overlay is an optional object assigned by the data holder that can be used to flag user-defined sensitive attributes. For example, gender is not defined as a PII element in its most common presentation of male or female as, in isolation, it cannot identify an individual. However, Thailand has 18 gender identities that are recognised in the local lexicon which, due to the narrower subgroups, may be deemed as sensitive to a Thai citizen. In this case, a sensitive overlay could be coupled to a data vault on a personal device or a data repository held by a trusted agent to flag the element.</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
          
          
            <p>Figure 2. A sensitive overlay allows a data holder to flag user-defined sensitive attributes. Rather than coupling the object to a schema base, a sensitive overlay can be coupled to a data vault on a personal device or a data repository held by a trusted agent.</p>
          
        
      
        
      

    
  


  


&nbsp; Conclusion and Current Developments <p>Primarily devised for data object interoperability and privacy compliant data sharing, OCA significantly enhances the ability to pool data more effectively in terms of simplicity, accuracy, and allocation of resources. The degree of separation between schema bases and overlays allows multiple parties to use the same base objects for similar data capture requirements thus providing a standard base from which to decentralise data.&nbsp;</p><p>OCA enables the unification of data languages and aims to provide a standardised global solution for data capture which can facilitate decentralisation of non-sensitive data for societal benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>Within <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, a Linux Foundation Project, trustees of the Human Colossus Foundation have convened an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+and+Semantics+Working+Group">Inputs and Semantics Working Group</a> (ISWG), subdivided into an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+Domain+Group">Inputs Domain Group</a> (ISWG-I) and a <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Semantic+Domain+Group">Semantic Domain Group</a> (ISWG-S). The mission of the ISWG-S is to define an Internet-scale data capture architecture consisting of immutable schema bases and interoperable overlays where multiple parties can interact with and contribute to the schema structure without having to change the schema base definition.

There are a growing number of interpretations and implementations of various decentralized standards. These standards are at different stages in their development lifecycles, harmonizing gradually. As a result, there are lots of data, from lots of sources, that, without a little planning, won’t play nicely with other data. It is exciting to see the enthusiasm around the standards we know and love and to watch the proliferation of verifiable and portable data. With implementation boundaries as a hindrance, data interoperability will continue to be difficult. We could lose much utility and portability of the data. Luckily, in the midst of this excitement, a great opportunity presents itself: to forge bridges between data islands and promote the cross-pollination of methodologies for generating and exchanging verifiable data. Enter: the Presentation Exchange specification.</p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims &amp; Credentials working group</a> has been hard at work on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange specification</a> for months. The effort, starting in January 2020, began to provide a solution to the question, “How should we request and exchange credentials across implementations and systems?” Though <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">a few solutions</a> <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof">have been proposed</a> <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">before</a>, none have been as inclusive in the data model and transport agnosticism, or able to attract broad adoption, as Presentation Exchange. The working group is working towards the first release — at the time of writing, we have made over 100 commits and closed 37 GitHub&nbsp;issues.</p><p>The specification prides itself on its adaptability, aiming to be “both credential format and transport envelope agnostic, meaning an implementer can use JWTs, VCs, JWT-VCs, or any other credential format, and convey them via OIDC, DIDComm, CHAPI, or any other transport envelope.” At the same time, Presentation Exchange has garnered the interest and support of many key-players throughout the ecosystem, a step crucial to fulfilling the ambitions of the specification.</p><p>You may be wondering, what’s up with the title? Isn’t interoperability much broader than sharing credentials? Yes! Absolutely. Sharing credentials is only part of interoperability. Universal wallets, secure data storage, transports, identifiers, DIDComm, and so many more pieces are paramount to thriving in an interoperable, decentralized ecosystem. At the heart of many of these interactions, we find ourselves exchanging verifiable data. By driving a standardized method for requesting and returning verifiable data, which adapts to many data models and functional use cases, we cross an important threshold in making interoperability possible. Without working software to back up the specification, it is merely an interesting idea. We need to go further — to make it an interesting reality.</p><p>Recognizing how important the Presentation Exchange spec and reference implementations could be for accelerating real interoperability and healthy competition, we, on the <a href="http://credentials.workday.com">Workday Credentials</a> team, are involved in the specification’s development and are investing significantly in one of its first demonstrable implementations. Workday has been a very active member of DIF since 2019. Our interests lie across the DIF stack, with a focus on standards compliance, affording us opportunities to interoperate with community members and standards adopters alike. Towards that end, we have <a href="https://github.com/workdaycredentials">open-sourced much of our code and specifications</a> relating to decentralized identity. For Presentation Exchange, we have <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange-implementations">recently pushed a Golang representation</a> of the object model that can be useful in building and validating presentation definitions, submissions, and verifiable presentations (as defined by the W3C standards). We are building out more Presentation Exchange logic that we plan to open source in the coming months. We intend to adopt Presentation Exchange at Workday as we gain confidence in the specification and its other implementations. We are considering different ways Presentation Exchange can be useful in interoperating with verifiable data that does not originate on our platform.</p><p>We are looking forward to seeing others contribute reference implementations in other languages and we encourage you to consider contributing to Presentation Exchange and DIF!

 Silpa Mukherjee, Ankita Deb &amp; Rahul&nbsp;Kumar  Session <p>We propose to design the panel as a workshop with three paper presentations followed by an open discussion with the house exploring the key question of media objects‟ (in the form of film/film music/memes/gifs/trolls) changing relations with law; copyright and piracy having attained newer connotations in the age of media convergence. While we deal with the materiality of cinema in the new media moment, the session will open out debates on the mutability of media objects in a networked digital terrain ushered in by fast growing and cost-effective internet culture in urban&nbsp;India.</p><p>In terms of methodology the panel deploys media archaeology to trace the mutations that film culture has undergone in the digital age. The coexistence of the obsolete media copyright with its meme and its digitally re-mastered copy on torrent informs the research that the three papers involve. A certain engagement with the logic of informed/fan-cinephilic digital labour that unwittingly maintains and updates the algorithmic database of Web 2.0 services will run through the presentations. Along with archival research and interviews with professionals involved with online media companies and “users” who are now the “pirate/prosumer-cinephiles” of media objects, we will carry out extensive digital ethnography to map the chimera of digital territory that user traffic based internet culture in India helped&nbsp;produce.</p><p>The digital is a space of intervention: a space for the users to intervene and play with the material online. It is a constant form of participation underscoring a potential for democratic authorship. The definitive notion of authorship voices the overarching body of the state through its legal status. Thus copyright as a legal entity produces a discourse of power through this form of authorship. The contemporary medium or rather the multi-media constellation driven by internet culture in India produces an alternative discourse on authorship, complicating the notion of copyright and piracy at the same time. This charged terrain of (il)legality is also due to the nature of piracy in the digital domain, which does not exist in isolation but have now created bodies or spheres where it has been appropriated as a sub-cultural practice. The figure of the “pirate”/ the “troll”/ the “fan” and the “cinephile” now merges with the technologically enabled body of the user of new media who negotiates with the medium in multiple ways (and morphs it) and thereby touches all kinds of spaces within and outside the webspace. It has changed the physical scope of cinephilia as addressed in the paper “A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar,” where the culture of networked sharing evolves from and further complicates physical stations. It has permeated into the body of film music in the paper “Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item numbers and the web”, which interrogates the layers of user-based morphs that the text of a dance number in Bollywood undergoes in the culture of web based remixing and hacking. It changes the way protected materials like films circulate in the space designated as YouTube, marked by its ability to reproduce copyright materials without violating the law as the third paper titled “Online Streaming in the Era of Digital Cinephilia” points out; the logic of the obsolete license of old Hindi films which gains a new viral life on YouTube with its official upload vying with the multiple hacker-user uploads.</p><p>Thus the panel intends to explore the dizzying overlaps that produce this internet induced distinct zone of ambiguity that neither the law nor the state or the author can claim ownership over. The very embodiment of the material in the digital is in transition i.e. in a state of being morphedby the blurring of the identities of the multiple bodies at work at each moment. Through the three papers we intend to chart this transitional aesthetic sometimes contained and sometimes flowing out of the body of the media text onto the physical, technological and extra textual objects as well. The panel seeks to position this new world of media objects that overlap and form an uncontainable entity, seeking newer forms of negotiations with the older existing order. We seek to explore then what happens to the very essence of author(ity)ship when digital enters its&nbsp;domain.</p> Plan <p>A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar</p><p>With the changes technology has brought to contemporary life, cinephiles — for whom movies are a way of life, films and how they are experienced have undergone major changes. The classic cinephile, as the term was adopted in the 1960s has undergone a major change in the era of internet piracy. I will look at the way pirated films via torrent downloads are consumed by students in certain pockets in New Delhi especially around Mukherjee Nagar area. These students who come from the upwardly mobile Indian middle class families are engaged inpreparations of competitive exams to land a lucrative government job. Circumstances dictate that these students own a laptop to watch films but not a high speed internet connection. To fuel their cinephilic urge, they are dependent upon soft copy vendors of pirated films. These vendors are like a video library, the repository here being a laptop and a storage drive. These professional film pirates depend upon the p2p file sharing commonly referred as “torrent.” DVD and Blu Rays released by official sources are ripped at a bigger size by certain uploaderswhich are downloaded by another one who rips it to an even smaller size, fit enough to be downloaded by pirates with a slower broadband till it reaches places like Mukherjee Nagar. Using this particular case study, where the world of online film piracy merges with a third world piracy domain, I plan to interrogate the logistics of a new kind of cinephilia and try and frame this particular form of informal circuit of media production and consumption into a coherent perspective.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://kat.cr/">https://kat.cr</a>, <a href="https://yts.la/">https://yts.la/</a>, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/">https://torrentfreak.com</a>.</p><p>Relevant software: Handbrake, uTorrent / Deluge /&nbsp;Vuze.</p><p>Relevant reading: Treske, Andreas. The Inner Life of Video Spheres: Theory for the YouTube Generation. Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam, 2013</p><p>Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item Numbers and the&nbsp;Web</p><p>The coming of new digital technologies has rendered the relationship of media objects’ with law extremely malleable and volatile. It urges us to rethink certain categories we have been working with, viz. piracy and copyright. The specific focus of the paper will be on item numbers’ relationship with changing technology and the law. The proprioceptive body being the central node of enquiry here: the law that affects the body that moves on screen and the body that is moved by the screen is made flexible in the digital age with Web 2.0’s unique design that spawns hackability and remixability. Through the registers of music licensing to YouTube, circulation of content offline as MP3 downloads in cheap mass storage devices, user generated morphed content related to item numbers (in the form of memes, GIFs, trolls, posters, tumblr blogs and listicles) spawned by amateur digital culture and remixing videos of film content the paper traces the gray zone between web based music piracy and its copyright rules. It will interrogate the moment when the entertainment industry has recognized the clear shift of its spectatorship from the older media to the more digital platforms and appropriates the contingency brought in by the algorithmic anxiety of Web 2.0 and its unique relationship with law and hence censorship regulations to innovate newer means of mass circulation and bypassing censorship.</p><p>Relevant content: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok</a>.</p><p>Relevant user-traffic-oriented platforms: <a href="http://www.memegenerator.com/">http://www.memegenerator.com</a>, <a href="http://www.trolldekho.com/">http://www.trolldekho.com</a>, <a href="https://www.imgur.com/">http://www.imgur.com</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">https://www.tumblr.com/</a>.</p><p>Relevant curated online media platforms: <a href="http://scoopwhoop.com/">ScoopWhoop</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/india">Buzzfeed India</a>, <a href="http://blog.erosnow.com/">blog.erosnow.com</a>.</p><p>Online Streaming in the era of Digital Cinephilia</p><p>Digital piracy has allowed for certain democratization of film distribution and consumption through a parallel economy of piracy. The lack of control over these channels of distribution produces a blatant threat to the copyright and intellectual property rights that are quintessential to the mainstream culture of commercial film distribution. This paper will focus on the intersection of these two dichotomous cultures through the experience of watching old films via online streaming. The resurfacing of old films hosted by big corporations like Shemaroo, Venus and Ultra who began as film rights and video rights owners at one point host their old video content in a user generated space called youtube. The video content is a very specific form here. It is an obsolete entity, defined by its ambiguity with copyright that is able to make a legal transgression in order to circulate.</p><p>The circulation of the feature films in a web space that is primarily known for its clip culture also provides an interesting paradigm for the copyright material. The big corporate copyright floats in a culture of pirated experiences where the legal domain becomes a dizzying site of contradictions. Through this paper I will draw parallels between the history of these companies and their work in the field of film circulation and to the creation of a new form of cinephilia and its complicated relationship to the law. I will use a variety of archival sources, legal documents and discourses on online streaming to contextualize my argument.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt">https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies">https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour">https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour</a></p> Readings <p>None.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day1.DigitalDesires">IRC 2016: Day 1 #Digital Desires : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Silpa Mukherjee is a Delhi based research scholar.

<p>A significant investment, and an Augmented Reality Deal, all in a&nbsp;week</p><p>Last week, KABN Systems NA Holdings Corp. (KABN:CSE) received subscription agreements for C $2,970,000 investment. 9 million shares issued at $0.33 with half-warrants at $0.37. Read the full release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accesswire.com/viewarticle.aspx?id=602223">here</a>.</p><p>The whole team, in particular CEO Ben Kessler and President David Lucatch, worked extremely hard over the past many weeks to liaise with the investor, a U.S. Family Office and foreign investors, to assist with their analysis and become vetted as innovators.</p><p>These investors focus on undervalued tech investments and creating long term strategic partnerships. This is why they were prepared to pay roughly twice the value of the common stock to make this partnership happen. Any sophisticated investor knows you are really making an investment in a team. The concepts, in particular Liquid Avatar (liquidavatar.com) are unique and innovative. But the investment at its core is in the Management Team and the belief of successful execution.</p><p>In the famous words of Michael&nbsp;Dell,</p><p>“Ideas are a commodity. Execution of them is&nbsp;not.”</p><p>Speaking of Execution — the very next day an Augmented Reality (AR) agreement was announced</p><p>KABN announced the very next day a partnership with a Europe-based Augmented Reality pioneer. The press release is very detailed so I will provide analytical support rather than repetition.</p><p>This deal is symbiotic to KABN’s core business and this partnership makes a ton of sense. The key point is that KABN will ultimately have an enhanced product suite. To use a B-school term, this is potentially first-mover advantage. Companies are scrambling to catch up. Geo-location, and seamless interaction with existing retail and mobile platforms and data monetization will enhance the product suite that KABN has already spent years developing. This will equally benefit consumers and businesses.

These days it refers to adding those additional features in a computerized setting, but its founding was pre-computers. In 1957, a cinematographer created the Sensorama, a box which the user would enter, where sounds, vibrations, additional visuals and even smells would be added. Fast forward to today, and AR has come to mean three things: the user is: 1. experiencing real and virtual worlds, 2. real-time interaction, and 3. accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. Wow that was easy to explain. There will be a test&nbsp;later.</p><p>A few fun facts about AR and why it should matter to you. I’d like to offer an analogy. It’s a bit like Cannabis when that was going into the initial opening period, when the growth in the businesses catering to this new market was enormous and the potential was limitless. Then we see with increased competition, the weaker players eventually are exposed and you see a retraction.</p><p>An important difference is that AR, when implemented correctly, will garner stickier (mind the pun) customers because of the integration with long-term partners and the importance of data. This will still require immense attention to execution and security.</p><p>The proliferation of AR is becoming more apparent. You can see the anticipated explosive growth in AR utility and usage over the coming immediate future.</p><p>Key Stats and some interpretation by&nbsp;me.</p><p>1.) Insane growth&nbsp;rate.</p><p>• Global market for AR was ~US$1.8 BN in 2018 and expected at ~US$198 BN by&nbsp;2025</p><p>• I calculate that implies a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of&nbsp;96%</p><p>2.) It’s already adopted, and plays into transactions</p><p>• Approximately 70MM users are now expected to use AR at least once per&nbsp;month</p><p>• The number of mobile augmented reality users is expected to hit 3.5 BN by&nbsp;2022</p><p>3.) Possibly as big as mobile,&nbsp;soon.</p><p>• Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Square fame said awhile back, to paraphrase, “why are we referring to them as “smartphones.” There’s no such thing as a “dumb phone”&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>• In a survey of 200 senior startup executives, 39% said AR will be as ubiquitous as smartphones by&nbsp;2025.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://leftronic.com">leftronic.com</a></p><p>Well that’s all I’ve got for now.

<p>Just before the age of COVID began in earnest, The New York Times ran a feature on “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/education/learning/education-technology.html">How Technology Is Changing the Future of Higher Education</a>.” The rise of remote learning and other pandemic-related changes and challenges have added to the need and opportunity for technology-driven advances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Hyperledger community is doing its part to help the higher education market adapt to an increasingly digital world. Below we look at five Hyperledger-powered solutions that are at work now in the education market. They are helping colleges and universities modernize how they tackle a number of core tasks, including issuing and verifying academic credits, automating on-campus payments and managing students’ identity and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on for more about these #HyperledgerEdu solutions, built using a mix of Hyperledger technologies:</p>



<p>Byacco, an on-campus payment system</p>



<p>Soramitsu has officially released <a href="https://soramitsu.co.jp/byacco">Byacco</a>, a payment system based on Hyperledger Iroha, for the University of Aizu, Japan. Byacco is a system that allows students and staff of the University of Aizu to use an application on their phones to pay for goods in the cafeteria and university store and to transfer funds within the campus. To make a transaction, all they need is to scan or to provide a QR code, depending on the operation. Byacco’s technology also has high standards for transfers: it follows the EMV® QR Code specification and has bank application level financial security protocols. The keys that are used to authorise transactions on the blockchain are stored only on the device, in a secure storage, so that no one except the owner can access the funds. Students of the university can join the development of the system, thus acquiring skills in creating financial systems based on Hyperledger technologies.</p>



<p>DoDream, a “Study Abroad Platform”</p>



<p><a href="http://www.dainleaders.com/view/en.php">Dain Leaders</a> is an education solution provider for universities in Korea. It serves more than 45 Korean universities by providing services for students’ career path development. As part of that effort, Dain Leader is introducing its “Study Abroad Platform,” called DoDream, to support the extended education ecosystem of the universities, accreditation and related agencies, and prospective employers. Based on Oracle Blockchain Platform Cloud Service (which is powered by Hyperledger Fabric), the platform is an O2O service that provides foreign students with information on studying in Korea and a matching service with Korean universities.</p>



<p>Oracle Digital Certificates Solution</p>



<p>In the face of fast-changing demographic and economic drivers and student expectations, the current processes for issuing and verifying student certificates are too inefficient and time consuming. They can also lead to fraudulent or counterfeit certifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Oracle Digital Certificates Solution, built on the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/blockchain">Oracle Blockchain Platform</a> (based on Hyperledger Fabric), provides a complete, end-to-end solution for educational institutions to issue verifiable tamper-proof and secure credential certification that improves the student experience after graduation and improves operational efficiency. The solution enables institutions to issue digital certificates along with transcripts and provide self-sovereign capability to the students who can share them securely with third parties through an access token.</p>



<p>This solution has been successfully deployed in production by customers like China Distance Education Holdings Limited (CDEL) and Taibah Valley University. CDEL uses Oracle Blockchain to share educational records and professional certifications across many educational institutions to help employers and recruiters verify the educational credentials claimed by individuals.<a href="https://www.theblockchaindomain.info/topics/apps-and-use-cases/articles/441270-oracle-adds-functionality-blockcha-platform-drive-development.htm">&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Many other institutions like national universities, employment agencies, government organizations, professional skills academies and universities that provide student grants/scholarships are using this solution as part of ongoing or planned pilots.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>PwC Smart Credentials</p>



<p>Data is the new gravity in the world today and organisations are gravitating to and concentrating around trust as the ultimate currency in this data driven world. This trust is crucial for people to exchange information, especially in this digital age when trust is often violated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that premise, PwC developed <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/blockchain/smart-credentials.html">Smart Credentials</a>, a credential issuance, sharing, reviewing and revocation platform levegering the inherent core benefits of blockchain technology such as immutability, tamper-proof nature, transparency, authenticity and security.</p>



<p>Built using Hyperleder Indy and Hyperledger Aries to support the verification process, Smart Credentials has two key pillars: Authentication (you are who you say you are) and Authorization (genuine claim). Both are crucial ingredients of building trust in any ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smart Credentials recently won a “Bronze” medal for the Best Global Blockchain Innovation 2019 at the Reimagine Innovation awards (Backed by Wharton and QS) and is a finalist in the DataIQ 2020 awards “Best data product/ service” of the year category.</p>



<p>Verified.Me</p>



<p>As higher education moves deeper into online and remote learning for traditional and non-traditional students, colleges and universities are now offering a broader array of services that extend the campus experience to the digital realm. Beyond the advent of digital programming, educational institutions are also privy to sensitive personal student, faculty and alumni data from income and payment information to disciplinary records, healthcare and insurance information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SecureKey Technologies’ <a href="https://verified.me/education/">Verified.Me service</a> is one approach that supports education’s new digital and data privacy demands. This new digital identity verification service can help verify students, alumni and faculty in a timely and secure manner, strengthening educational institutions’ ability to expand their digital offerings with confidence – while also providing much-needed cost savings. Verified.Me is built using the IBM Blockchain Platform, which is based on Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Fabric.</p>

<p>August 26, 2020 – Today, the <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">Baseline Protocol</a>, an <a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/projects/">OASIS</a> open source initiative, published the first major dot-release of its reference implementation, clearing the way for standards development.</p>



<p><a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/">Launched in March</a> of this year, the Baseline Protocol uses advances in peer-to-peer messaging, zero-knowledge cryptography and blockchain technology to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises without moving company data out of traditional systems of record.&nbsp; Today, over 600 companies and individuals are actively participating in the initiative, which coordinates with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance’s Mainnet Working Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several proofs of concept have been released to showcase how to ‘baseline’ systems such as <a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/open-source-proof-of-concept-ethereum-mainnet">SAP, Microsoft Dynamics</a> and <a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/baseline-protocol-initiative-integrates-google-sheets-and-microsoft-dynamics-365-using-public-ethereum-blockchain">Google Sheets</a>. Recently, major brands have announced projects using the protocol, and more are known to be in private development.</p>



<p>Today’s release of Baseline Protocol v0.1 represents a significant milestone, because it provides a set of standard interfaces for developers to implement solutions easily and for vendors to provide their own modules that comply with the specification. Official OASIS standards development based on the v0.1 reference implementation will commence in September.</p>



<p>Today at 12pm US-ET, the development team will host an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BaselineProtocol/live">open walk-through</a> of the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MadHATTERs Weekly is taking some time out. The MadHATTERs Editorial, 26 August&nbsp;2020</p><p>Nearly four years ago in Nov 2016, MadHATTERs was born. Launched as HATs went public for the first time ­– the first 500 HAT accounts were deployed into the world that day. What a long way we’ve come since then.<br> <br>MadHATTERs began with the aim of providing a weekly dose of curated tech news but with a HAT perspective: the world as seen through our bias towards personal data and digital empowerment, greater control, privacy, security, confidentiality and freedom. And through our pro-innovation and pro-economy stance. <br> <br>We believe we’ve done just that over the past few years, and in the process we’ve built a community of people who care about the same issues that matter to us, informing each other as we learnt together. Through HAT News we’ve also strived to keep you in touch with what’s going on in this community of developers and makers, researchers and innovators, start-ups and funders. <br> <br>But today’s world of tech is a different place from when we first brought MadHATTERs — and HATs — into the world. Notably, personal data is now a huge thing and so is the data economy. Specifically, what we call the <a href="https://www.dataswift.io/concepts/data-economy-2">Data Economy 2.0</a>: where the value of data benefits individuals, organisations and society (<a href="https://www.dataswift.io/concepts/data-economy-2">Dataswift CEO Irene Ng explains further here</a>). <br> <br>The sheer volume of news about data today has necessitated a daily newsletter to cover the pace of information exchange online. Launched last month, Dataswift’s <a href="https://www.dataswift.io/news/a-matter-of-life-and-death">Data News</a> is now your go-to for the latest in the data economy, so make sure you’re <a href="https://dataswift.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=bf49285ca77275f68a5263b83&amp;id=113f789c74">subscribed to receive it in your inbox on weekday mornings</a>. <br> <br>As for MadHATTERs, we’re saying so long for now with Issue 188. But it’s not farewell as we’re taking some time out to refocus our role in the HAT community and fine-tune our voice on furthering the mission and vision of Data Economy 2.0. Onwards and upwards, as they say. <br> <br>Do keep watching this space as the next chapter of MadHATTERs will begin in a month’s&nbsp;time.</p><p>Yours in&nbsp;HAT,</p> Leila Trilby, Editor-in-Chief <p>MadHATTERs is a weekly newsletter covering technology, personal data, and the Internet. Its perspective championing decentralised personal data is led by <a href="https://dataswift.io">Dataswift </a>with the Hub of All Things (HAT) technology.

<p>Members of the <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> Alliance are united in the belief that identity is a fundamental and universal human right and that we all deserve better ways to prove who we are — both in the physical world and&nbsp;online.</p><p>As a community of technologists, advocates, implementers, and funders, we also believe that ethically implemented, privacy-protecting, user-managed, and portable digital ID solutions offer a better alternative to the current “data as a commodity” paradigm.</p><p>A new report from KPMG entitled, <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2020/new-imperative-corporate-data-responsibility.html">The New Imperative for Corporate Data Responsibility</a>, suggests that the American public increasingly agrees with this perspective. Based on a survey of 1,000 respondents, the report concludes that consumers expect corporations to “take significant steps to better protect, manage, and ethically use their&nbsp;data.”</p><blockquote>“The findings are unmistakable,” says Orson Lucas, Principal, KPMG Cyber Security Services. “Data privacy and protection are clear priorities for consumers. Close attention to customer data handling, management, and protection practices are key, foundational elements of establishing and maintaining digital&nbsp;trust.”</blockquote><p>The report outlines valuable findings regarding how the public feels about the security of their data, the issues that concern them, and who they believe bears responsibility for creating a more secure and trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p><p>Key Findings: Beliefs</p>  97 percent of respondents say that data privacy is important to&nbsp;them  87 percent believe that data privacy is a human&nbsp;right  86 percent believe that data privacy is a growing&nbsp;concern  68 percent don’t trust companies to ethically sell their private&nbsp;data  54 percent don’t trust companies to use their personal data in an ethical&nbsp;way  53 percent don’t trust companies to collect data in an ethical&nbsp;way  50 percent don’t trust companies to protect their personal&nbsp;data  <p>These insights should not surprise us. After all, a majority of Americans have, at one time or another, been personally affected by a data breach. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see that public opinion is shifting; our experiences have made us all more cognizant of how our identity and personal data are being misused and mismanaged. On the other hand, these experiences are also contributing to a growing mistrust of all forms of digital ID. For those who work in this space, this is a timely reminder that, as we develop and deploy new forms of digital ID, we must do so with an intentional focus and abiding commitment to rebuild and maintain public&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Key Findings: Concerns</p>  83 percent of respondents worry most about the theft of their Social Security Number, followed by their credit card number (69 percent), and their passwords (49&nbsp;percent)  Only 16 percent are worried about their medical records being stolen. Medical records are the most commonly cited example of data that consumers trust companies to protect (57&nbsp;percent)  <p>Given these rapidly changing consumer opinions, and with our vision of good digital ID for all as our guiding star, we at ID2020 regularly revisit the question: how do we get&nbsp;there?</p><p>The data suggest what we have long believed: that, in the coming years, market forces (i.e. consumer demands) will drive tectonic shifts in the data economy. But will market forces be&nbsp;enough?</p><p>Most telling in the data is that the public is most likely to trust healthcare companies to protect the privacy of their medical records. Laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) establish robust data protections and stiff penalties for companies that mishandle data. These offer the public a degree of confidence that their health information will be held sacrosanct.</p><p>The house is on fire and that the public is finally smelling the smoke when it comes to data security. Market forces can be extremely powerful, but we expect that governments will play an equally important, catalytic role by establishing the regulatory frameworks and consumer protections necessary to rebuild trust and encourage the broad adoption of safe and secure digital ID applications.</p><p>Here as well, the KPMG data provides some valuable insights for policymakers.</p><p>Key Findings: Who is Responsible</p>  91 percent of respondents say that corporations should take the lead in establishing corporate data responsibility  56 percent say that companies should prioritize giving consumers more control over their data in&nbsp;2020  84 percent are open to state legislatures giving consumers more control over their&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Data privacy issues are not going to go away,” says KPMG Cyber Security Services Principle, Steve Stein. “In fact, consumer protections around data privacy, like the ones provided by the CCPA, are very likely to be codified in other states and eventually at the federal level. Simply put, privacy laws are only going to increase in volume and rigor. That’s why visibility, protection, and trust is gaining such momentum in the marketplace and also why leading-edge companies are not looking at data privacy as just another compliance or check-the-box exercise. They see privacy as one of the pathways to growing their business by improving trust with their customers.”</blockquote><p>So…How DO We Get&nbsp;There?</p><p>Identity systems rely on trust to function; trust between issuers of identity and relying parties and, critically, that of those who use the system to prove their identity to access various goods, services, and privileges.</p><p>ID2020 was established in 2016 to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions. To achieve this vision, we are working simultaneously along three&nbsp;tracks.</p><p>We are helping shape the market through the ID2020 Certification, which applies 41 rigorous, outcome-based Technical Requirements to certify best-in-class digital ID solutions. We are working with policymakers in the United States and internationally to advocate for the ethical implementation of better forms of digital ID. And, as the technologies continue to evolve, we are implementing programs in the field to test and apply what we learn as these systems are replicated and brought to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Fully realizing the potential of digital ID will require businesses, technology providers, policymakers, and civil society to collaborate — and quickly — to build and implement functional, privacy-preserving, user-managed ID systems, and work to overcome the mistrust which could impede their broad adoption. We developed the ID2020 Alliance model to foster this collaboration.</p><p>The road to good ID for all is riddled with potholes…and we have one chance to get this&nbsp;right.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights, while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/new-report-highlights-public-concerns-about-data-privacy-6cfd1e248d49">New Report Highlights Public Concerns About Data Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>In the last month we have shared with you our latest research findings on&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2020/07/27/new-nz-research-highlights-work-needed-to-improve-care-of-personal-information/">Digital Identity and Trust</a>, and just last week the DIA’s DITP team shared with us their exciting news on the formal development of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/news/development-of-digital-identity-trust-framework-confirmed/">Digital Identity Trust Framework</a>,&nbsp;see the webinar recording&nbsp;<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/play/78Z4d7r--z43HdycswSDBad4W43rf_6s0XAWq6BfmE_kUHZROwGjYbBBNrBmqGFQWxHai3IAv3KyDKzt?continueMode=true">here</a>&nbsp;for Aotearoa/New Zealand.<br><br>Both are important foundations that collectively give us the confidence to take definitive action.</p>



<p>The overriding theme of the Trust and Identity research was one of the organisations and their technology partners taking on a greater share of responsibility when it comes to trustworthy management of personal information and data.&nbsp;This involved recognising that Identity is a Taonga, and understanding (and acting upon) their role as kaitiaki (custodians) of that precious information.&nbsp;Digital Identity NZ has an important role to play&nbsp;in helping organisations on that journey.</p>



<p>The news from the DIA that the Government will introduce a Digital Identity Bill in 2021 is a huge boost to those of us committed to developing a trustworthy digital identity ecosystem in Aotearoa.&nbsp;A definitive trajectory embracing collaboration allows organisations to develop new and innovative technologies and business models that enhance privacy, security and trust while reducing complexity and cost.&nbsp;We welcome and applaud the announcement, and acknowledge the amazing efforts of the DITP team in making it happen.</p>



<p>The research and Trust Framework announcements happily coincide with a new phase of community activity in Digital Identity NZ.&nbsp;From this week we will be forming a number of member-led projects around a number of action-oriented initiatives:</p>



<p>1: Development of an Aotearoa Digital Identity Ecosystem Map (this kicked off on Monday with a pilot survey to member organisations)</p>



<p>2: Further analysis and followup following the high-level findings from our 2020 Research, including a deeper analysis of Māori, Pacifika, and Senior communities, as well as those who may experience accessibility challenges</p>



<p>3: Release of a piece of legal and technical analysis of digital identity’s role in enabling customer onboarding for organisations with AML/CFT responsibilities, and formation of one or more project teams to discuss and explore options for furthering reuse and/or reliance of identity credentials</p>



<p>4: Development of a Digital Identity education roadmap incorporating the principles of Kāwanatanga (Honourable Governance), Rangatiratanga (Self Determination &amp; Agency), Ōritetanga (Equity &amp; Partnership) and freedom of choice.</p>



<p>We will be working closely with the DIPT team as they develop the Interim Trust Framework for the remainder of 2020.&nbsp;Further initiative-based project teams will be formed as we move through that progress.&nbsp;Similarly, we will be&nbsp;gauging&nbsp;member interest in&nbsp;developing a community submission on&nbsp;the Consumer Data Right, in response to MBIE’s request for feedback on their discussion document ‘<a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/11625-discussion-document-options-for-establishing-a-consumer-data-right-in-new-zealand">Options for establishing a consumer data right in New&nbsp;Zealand</a>’.</p>



<p>We will be communicating with you to gather expressions of interest and to invite you to initial exploratory Zoom sessions as each of the initiatives kicks off.&nbsp;In the meantime please feel free to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:andrew.weaver@digitalidentity.nz">contact me</a>&nbsp;directly.</p>



<p>Now more than ever is a great time for you to&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/join/">join DINZ</a>&nbsp;if you are not yet a member.&nbsp;Participating in the project teams and some of our research material is limited to member organisations only, and joining now will also allow you to consider nominating for a role on our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>&nbsp;elections towards the end of the year.&nbsp;Join us as we shift into this exciting phase of action.</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

It is decentralized in its processes as well as its topography. Learning the “lay of the land” entails bouncing around a network more than surveying a city from a high vantage point. But that’s ok! We recommend starting from the least familiar of these links and bouncing around, rather than reading start to&nbsp;finish.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@benjaminjohnelliott">Benjamin&nbsp;Elliot</a> —Video Introductions to&nbsp;SSI   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djhYZZ3CkuM">An Introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity</a> 9min<br>This presentation by the “SSI Ambassador” (Adrian Doerk of the LISSI project, headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany) touches on the psychology and sociology of identity definitions. It highlights why digital identity offers many different ways to present ourselves and walks through the basics of how ID today is dominated by mega-IdPs (identity providers). It gets to the conceptual heart of what SSI is about. It also shows a real live demonstration of a scooter-authorization project spearheaded by T-Mobile&nbsp;Germany.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GkdBRmsbE&amp;t=9s">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Foam Figure Explainer v2</a> 9min<br>John Phillips from 460 Degrees, a consulting firm from Sydney, AU, updated his earlier video in January of 2020. This level-setting and first-introduction was designed to help Phillips’ clients understand what SSI looks like from a business-process perspective, which is the key perspective from which large enterprises are mostly likely to decide how much to invest in researching and considering SSI solutions. For more guidance on B2B sales and education, see his longer <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/explaining-ssi-c-suite-executives-anyone-else-john-phillips-webinar-48/">February presentation</a> at SSI Meetup about how to explain SSI to C-Level executives.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AydQmOTcECk">The True Meaning of Identity </a>38 min<br>In September 2019, Kaliya Young presented to SIBOS (the conference of the SWIFT settlement network central to global banking) in their Innovation Track. The video introduces the concept of identity and how it has evolved over time, before sharing at a high level how Self-Sovereign Identity works and why it solves widespread business problems.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfi11GZjbWM">Domains of Identity</a> — 33 min<br>In July of 2018, Kaliya Young presented to the MyData Conference and tied together her research work developing the <a href="https://www.anthempress.com/the-domains-of-identity-hb">Domains of Identity</a> and how the various domains connects to the usage of decentralized identity technology — decentralized identifier and verifiable credentials.  <p>The <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/">SSIMeetup</a> series run out of Madrid, Spain by the indefatigable Alex Preukchat has been assembling a video archive of their live webinar series for years. For these, they invite leaders of influential SSI projects from around the world. These events have a loyal following of regular attendees, making for a spirited Q&amp;A session at the end of each video. While most of the videos tend towards deep dives in specific technical, governance, business, or regional topics, some of them can be useful, accessible, and inspiring for novices. Here are a few we recommend in particular as “novice-friendlier deep&nbsp;dives”:</p>  At the Core of SSI is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcfy9wd5bZI">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> 50min by Drummond&nbsp;Reed  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/self-sovereign-identity-explained-cios-steve-manning-webinar-44/">CIO Brief: Why SSI is Important</a> 65min by Steve&nbsp;Magennis  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/hyperledger-aries-open-source-interoperable-identity-solutions-nathan-george-webinar-30/">Introduction to Hyperledger Aries</a> 71min by Nathan&nbsp;George  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/sovereignty-historical-context-self-sovereign-identity-natalie-smolenski-webinar-18/">Sovereignty in Historical Context</a> 55min by Natalie Smolenski  <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/self-sovereign-identity-healthcare-dr-manreet-nijjar-webinar-21/">SSI In Healthcare</a> 63min by Manreet&nbsp;Nijjar   — Organizational Centers of Gravity in&nbsp;SSI  <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (you are&nbsp;here) <p>This organization was formed as a Joint Development Foundation project in 2017 and has grown to be a major venue for IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players. It has historically focused on the development of both working open-source code and pre-standard specifications for decentralized identity, but it is starting to branch out into non-technical forms of cooperation for the purposes of market-building and to promote all open decentralized identity technology, whether created in DIF or elsewhere.</p> <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">The W3C Credentials Community Group</a> <p>This public discussion group is affiliated with the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), a standards organization for web technologies supported by membership dues and responsible for the management of core protocols like HTML and TLS. The Credential Community Group (CCG) is not an official working group of the W3C, but is still protected under a version of W3C’s IPR regime. <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/community/work_items.html">Work items</a> can be proposed by W3C non-members, and these often include specifications that go on to be standardized. CCG meets every week and is a hub for coordinating activity. Their meetings are recorded and minuted, often including <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/presentations/">presentations</a>. They also have coordinate other discussion groups open to non-members, such as the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">Education Credentials Task Force</a> (“vc-ed”).</p> <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">The Internet Identity&nbsp;Workshop</a> <p>This biannual event has been the convening at the heart of the decentralized identity community for 15 years, held at the Computer History Museum in the heart of Silicon Valley. It is uniquely co-created by its participants in a mostly-organic and community-driven way, with no pre-picked speakers, keynotes, or commercial presentations aside from a demo hour. True to its name, workshopping, whiteboarding, and open (but detailed and concrete!) discussion on a massive scale are the core of the event. The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">books of proceedings</a> organize and refine all of the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">notes</a> taken live during all the sessions convened at each&nbsp;event.</p> <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> <p>This influential and egalitarian global organization grew out of a series of <a href="https://online2020.mydata.org">conferences</a> first held in 2016. They advocate for a human-centric and rights-driven vision where individuals can get digital services that support them to collect their data, not just safeguarding and well serving but even empowering the data subject. Organizational members and individual members come together to create an ongoing dialogue between “consumers” and ethical businesses to shape new types of markets for digital services. Rooted in the values of the <a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData Declaration</a>, they focus primarily on elaborating refined, nuance, and bottoms-up models for data governance; only from a solid governance foundation do they begin to make policy, business, and technology decisions. They recently published the <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">MyData Operators paper</a>, bringing their policy, business, and technological goals more squarely into the realm of decentralized identity.</p> <a href="https://sovrin.org/">The Sovrin Foundation</a> <p>Since the early days of decentralized identity, Sovrin has been one of the major hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship, serving as a kind of all-in-one community, codebase, blockchain, and better business bureau. They have also published many canonical educational and marketing texts that have been foundational to the development of “self-sovereign identity” as a sector of the software industry. The Aries project (housed in the Hyperledger Foundation) and the Trust-over-IP foundation are, in a sense, spin-outs of the Sovrin foundation, and both remain loosely based (sometimes by design, sometimes by momentum) on the Sovrin community’s codebase, ledger, and design principles. The fastest way to familiarize yourself with these is the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/">whitepaper library</a> on the Foundation’s website.</p> Standards organizations <p>These centers of gravity are where ideas and business models evolve in broad conversation. Inevitably, structuring ground rules and governance models for these eventually have to be negotiated between technical experts and standards adopted before major investments (of capital, but also of legislation and public good will) can be approved. See Nader Helmy’s great <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards-f82efd9ab6c7">tour</a> of standards organizations relevant to these centers of&nbsp;gravity.</p> — Government Initiatives:  United States Federal Government <p>Anil John, head of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program run under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology directorate has been funding the development of standards and business models in the nascent field for years. Their website hosts an <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">overview</a> of related projects <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blockchain-portfolio">articles by them</a>, as well as guidance documents such as the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/white-paper/2020/01/14/a-taxonomic-approach-to-understanding-emerging-blockchain-idms/final">Taxonomic Approach</a> to Understanding Emerging Blockchain Identity Management Systems. Anil’s blog hosted by CyberForge includes many thoughtful pieces, such as Anil’s recent thoughts on interoperability or his article on the role of government in free-market technology, <a href="https://www.cyberforge.com/can-less-be-more/">Can LESS be&nbsp;more</a>?</p> The British Columbia Provincial Government <p>“BCGov” has invested significantly in the SSI IT management model and has pioneered an approach to verifiable public data represented by the <a href="https://vonx.io">Verifiable Organizations Network</a> (“VON”). This network provides public-record credentials about registered business in a publicly accessible repository of Verifiable Credentials, bringing the traditional “orgBook” into the decentralized era. By directing much of their IT budgets towards open-source development and participating heavily in the emerging open-source community around this project, they have provided invaluable leadership, particularly within the Aries community, including such major contributions as the core of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-plugin-toolbox">Aca-Py Codebase</a>.</p> The European&nbsp;Union <p>ESSIF (European SSI Framework) is an ongoing open-source initiative to seed and accelerate the role of SSI in the EU digital “single market” strategy. It is housed jointly between the directorate-generals responsible for IT planning and policy in Brussels and the independent European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Get+Started+EBSI">EBSI</a>), a 30-country collaboration of EU and EU-affiliated countries working together to build a shared infrastructure for government blockchain projects. SSI Meetups are the best way to learn more about ESSIF and its role in the EU’s broader digital initiatives:</p>  An <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/understanding-european-self-sovereign-identity-framework-essif-daniel-du-seuil-carlos-pastor-webinar-32/">overview</a> by ESSIF Convenors Daniel du Seuil and Carlos Pastor (July&nbsp;2019)  ESSIF Chief Legal Counsel Nacho Alamillo gave an introduction to ESSIF’s approach to eIDAS in <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/eidas-regulation-anchoring-trust-self-sovereign-identity-systems-ignacio-alamillo-webinar-49/">February 2020</a> and a more detailed overview of the official report of the legal review based on that approach in <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/introducing-ssi-eidas-legal-report-ignacio-alamillo-webinar-55/">May of&nbsp;2020</a>  ESSIF-LAB program coordinators Oskar van Deventer and Rieks Joosten (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVMVyLARr-4">TNO</a>, the Hague) gave an <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/essif-lab-creating-funding-interoperable-ssi-infrastructure-europe-webinar-52/">overview</a> of how their program incentivizes interoperability and European contributions to the broader SSI landscape (March&nbsp;2020)  Interested parties are encouraged to check the ec.europa.eu website for current <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-identity-and-trust-commission-launches-public-consultation-eidas-regulation">public consultations</a> and calls for&nbsp;comment.   Other Notable International Consortia: <p>The <a href="https://ktdi.org">Known Traveler Digital Identity</a> project is led by the World Economic Forum and brings together the governments of Canada and the Netherlands, two Airlines and three airports to create a proof of concept that schedule to start real-world trials in the ill-fated Spring of 2020. Interrupted roadmaps aside, it has produced a significant corpus of <a href="https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/known-traveller-digital-identity-specifications-guidance">documentation</a>, policy recommendations, debate, and interest among governments and technical industries.</p> — Whitepapers and Publications:   <a href="https://www.egiz.gv.at/files/download/Self-Sovereign-Identity-Whitepaper.pdf">The Concept of Self-Sovereign Identity including its Potential</a> by eGovernment Innovationszentrum, Gratz University of Technology  <a href="https://bundesblock.de/new-position-paper-self-sovereign-identity-defined/">Self-sovereign Identity</a>: A position paper on blockchain enabled identity and the road ahead, by the Identity Working Group of the German Blockchain Association  <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2DjfY">Decentralized Identity</a>: Own and control your identity by Microsoft  <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/">Decentralized-ID.com</a> is a sprawling and truly bottomless collection of resources culled from conference annals, github, and technical publications.

Some recent and still-topical highlights include:</p>  Co-organizer Joe Andreiu’s <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">Primer on Functional Identity</a>  Eric Welton’s <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/bearing-witness.md">Bearing Witness</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/f10d5b26862dffd9a7f35b1d2e1bd49dc694a6cd/topics-and-advance-readings/ecosystem-bootstrapping-via-notary-vcs.md">Ecosystem bootstrapping via Notary&nbsp;VCs</a>  Pamela Dingle, Daniel Hardman, et al’s <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/alice-attempts-abuse-verifiable-credential.pdf">Alice attempts abuse</a> on attack modeling the SSI credential exchange&nbsp;model  Michael Shea, Sam Smith, and Carsten Stöcker, <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/CooperationBeatsAggregation.pdf">Cooperation beats Aggregation</a>  Kaliya Young et al., <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/reputation-interpretation.pdf">Reputation Interpretation</a>   — Monographs:   Comprehensive Guide to <a href="https://ssiscoop.com/">Self Sovereign Identity (2019)</a> — Kaliya Young / Heather&nbsp;Vescent  Spherity’s <a href="https://bit.ly/spherityGUIDEtoSSI">SSI 101 Series on Medium (2020)</a> — Juan Caballero  <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self Sovereign Identity</a> (2021) — Alex Preukschat / Drummond&nbsp;Reed   — Podcasts:   <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/definitely-identity-tim-bouma-xjifCqyG6Qk/">Definitely Identity</a> by Tim Bouma who leads trust framework and identity projects for the IT authority of the federal government of Canada.

PSA stands for Privacy Surveillance and Anonymity, and covers a wide range of data rights&nbsp;topics.  <p>There is, of course, much more to be recommended for deeper dives into specific technologies, business problem spaces, policy histories, and governance thinking. But we have to draw the line somewhere, and by the time you get to those advanced topics, are you really reading “introductory” texts anymore? Stay tuned for more curation, more knowledge bases, and more network exploration.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/where-to-begin-b2a55b898b3">Where to begin?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
