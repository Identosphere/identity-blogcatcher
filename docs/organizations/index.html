 Partnering with YeloPlay and BeatFarm Elastos shows the potential of the New Age of Bitcoin 
 Creators and Artists can eliminate intermediaries, reduce fees, retain ownership and drive immediate revenue 
 
<p>Singapore September 20th 2024 – Elastos, a SmartWeb ecosystem provider, today created the World’s first live music inscription at its <a href="https://lu.ma/aw0flgk4">Asia OnChain Real World Assets (RWA) event</a> at Token 2049. Elastos, part of the Group supported by the Singapore headquartered Elastos Foundation, used its <a href="https://escription.io/">eScription</a> technology to create a recording that was not only inscribed live to Bitcoin and the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) but now remains available to artists and fans for all time as a minted collectible of the occasion. This is a significant example of the New Age of Bitcoin, where artists and creators can eliminate intermediaries, reduce fees and drive immediate revenues, while retaining an immutable record of their work.</p>
<p>This first recording was supported by Elastos partners, YeloPlay, a Web3 platform with a catalog of Indian and Sri Lankan soundtracks, film scores, and hits and BeatFarm, a transformative music industry platform focused on the development of new inscription technology and blockchain-based music consumption models. Today’s demonstration is a significant moment in showing the potential for Bitcoin and the Bitcoin infrastructure to deliver a new economic model. The song being inscribed is “Back to the start” composed and performed by Mike De Zilva, Kat Sonata and Charth Fernando.</p>
<p><a href="https://beatfarm.io/">BeatFarm</a> enables this inscription by inscribing an Ordinal on Bitcoin and an eScription on ESC, which is attractive to Bitcoin holders as it maintains the benefits of the currency’s security and integrity to protect their investment. For creators and artists, it means Bitcoin owners can easily use their currency without bridging, wrapping or otherwise interfering with the Bitcoin layer. The inclusion of ESC is important, as it avoids network congestion and additional fees that would otherwise result, allowing users to establish Smart Contracts on their own terms, ultimately becoming an attractive alternative way to commercialize content.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Growth, Elastos explains: “This is a key moment for Web3 models and the music industry as for the first time an instantaneous record of a performance can be created and monetized using Bitcoin and crypto technologies. This gives artists ownership rights and control, as well as a direct relationship with their fans cutting out intermediaries and their fees. This approach has the potential to transform how music is made, consumed and stored, empowering everyone to enjoy and cherish the creative product.”</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of the <a>Elastos BIT Index</a> is that BRIC nations and the Global South are moving quicker to embrace Bitcoin. For example, 24% of tech-savvy Indian consumers and 26% of UAE respondents use Bitcoin every day as their currency of choice compared to the global average of 18% while only 11% of Germans, 13% of UK respondents, 14% of South Koreans and 15% of US tech-savvy consumers are prepared to do the same. Furthermore, 91% of Nigerians and 90% of Indians see a time when Bitcoin could become a type of ‘default’ current compared to only 70% in Germany and 73% in the UK and South Korea, and 75% in the US. Therefore, it is perhaps no surprise that YeloPlay, whose back catalogue includes material from some of Sri Lanka’s most famous artists such as Roshan de Silva, Mariazel Goonathilaka, Nalin Perera, Mike De Zilva, Shane Vincent, and Joel Fernando, has participated in this project.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves continues: “Although today’s first live inscription signals both a technological and creative revolution, it also enables cultural renaissance where artists from anywhere in the world, such as these Sri Lankan and Indian artists supported by YeloPlay, can experience new artistic and economic opportunities.&nbsp; It means every community can promote and share a unique cultural record by preserving it on the Bitcoin infrastructure forever.”</p>
<p>Beatfarm’s Co-Founder, Alex Panos shared:&nbsp; “Crucial to this revolution, BeatFarm is providing artists the tools and resources to control their content, collaborate, and take advantage of new ways to connect with their super fans in ways which we haven’t seen before, supporting communities and social media movements who want to share musical culture.”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MikeDeZilva?t=gr0B5293Ps8lb_PidF3C7g&amp;s=09">Mike de Zilva</a>, Founder and CEO of YeloPlay, describes completion of the live eScription as a milestone for the creative and music industries:</p>
<p>“The World’s first live eScription, literally, signals the moment when artists regained control over their creations – it’s massive. And it’s not limited to content, Bitcoin-backed eScriptions will enable artists to develop and define completely new relationships with their audiences, incentivising super fans, for instance, with exclusive content, access and experiences. All on the artist’s terms,” says Mike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About BeatFarm</p>
<p><a href="https://beatfarm.io/">BeatFarm</a> is a Web3 music distribution platform that enables artists to mint and inscribe their music onto multiple blockchains simultaneously, while also connecting directly with their superfans. BeatFarm aims to democratize music distribution by leveraging blockchain technology to provide artists with unprecedented control over their work and direct access to their fans.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is delighted to announce that it is one of 15 parties to a <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNIST/bulletins/3ae9367">Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)</a> with the National Cybersecurity Council Center of Excellence. This project will accelerate digital identity adoption in the United States. Its first use case supports financial institutions to meet their Know-Your-Customer requirements using <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/digital-identities-mdl">Mobile Drivers License (mDL) technologies and standards</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation and its members are passionate about the role that standards play in catalyzing ecosystems. We are grateful to NIST for the opportunity to engage in this project and for its continuing contributions to industry standards, including their active participation in OpenID Foundation Work Groups.</p>
<p>In this case, we are excited to test the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/specifications/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a> family of specifications, especially <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-sd-jwt-vc-1_0.html">OpenID for Verifiable Presentations</a>, to support financial use cases.

 Development vs Engagement in a Collaborative Setting <p>Our new Mozilla Foundation-funded Friends of the Earth ‘Green Screen’ project has the express aim of developing a set of AI principles that the climate movement can use. The project involves desk research and a gathering of experts to influence and contribute to these principles, creating a co-designed starter for ten that others can build upon. We will then take what we’ve learned to report for <a href="https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk">the Friends of the Earth policy&nbsp;site</a>.</p><p>Part of this involves setting up an online roundtable to gather insights from a diverse range of experts. In our project kickoff call last week, we realised that clarifying the ambitions and aims of such an event is something we do instinctively.</p><p>We’re big fans of <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/expertise/community-calls/">community calls</a>, but the roundtable we will be putting together is something slightly different. In this post, we’re going to give you a few things to think about when you’re gathering people together to co-design a policy or set of best practices — or when you’re more on the development side of the continuum.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO The Development-Engagement continuum <p>First off, there’s tons of value in getting people together and working collaboratively towards something. There is also a lot of nuance in such an endeavour, so it’s best to understand what your long term goal for the project might be. We like to determine where on a continuum between ’development’ and ’engagement’ a particular project might&nbsp;sit.</p><p>Development is the side of the continuum that focuses on the final output of the project. This could be, for example, a report, article, or set of recommendations. Engagement, on the other hand, can serve as a launchpad for building community. While there may be outputs along the way, the main goal is to find and engage with people who are interested in a particular topic. As it happens, we’ve written extensively about <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/How-to-build-a-CoP.pdf">how to build a community of practice</a> in this short (and free!) resource.</p><p>If you’re mostly focusing on development, as we are with our Friends of the Earth (FoE) roundtable, you will need a different kind of preparation and facilitation than if you’re focused on a longer term community- building initiative.</p><p>Of course, many projects have an eye on both the short term and the longer term, and so are looking to do development and engagement. However, it’s important to understand that community building requires designated moderation, facilitation and a place to interact. If there is no one to actively manage and engage the community, it can become stagnant!</p> Co-designing for Development <p>It’s important to note that every collaborative effort does not need to lead to a fully fledged community. For example, with our FoE Green Screen project, the focus is very much on the set of principles that other organisations can build&nbsp;upon.</p><p>If you find yourself looking to engage a group of people around a particular project, like policy development or a set of principles, you should have a think about how your co-design event fits into the “project management triangle”.</p><p>Let’s take each point in&nbsp;turn.</p>PM triangle cc-by Laura Hilliger for&nbsp;WAO 1. Funding <p>How much funding is available for the co-design piece of your project? Can you afford to pay people to participate?</p><p>If you can pay people for their input, you absolutely should. Even a small portion of your overall budget can work, offering people a one-time fee or goodwill payment shows them that you value their contribution. However, we know that sometimes remuneration is not possible.</p><p>If there isn’t enough funding to pay people for their time, make sure you plan to spotlight their contribution in other ways. You can issue badges to contributors, ensure all contributors are named in final outputs and publicly thank people when you share the final&nbsp;outputs.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO 2. Scope <p>Based on the funding available, what is the scope of the collaboration? How can you ensure that you are building collaboratively?</p><p>Will you host a single event? You might also have three events or five of them. You might set a six month timeline for your project. Be clear about what you’re asking of people as you are asking them to participate. Are you inviting them to the first of a series of events or a singular event? Is there prep work or ‘homework’ involved? How will their contributions be attributed?</p><p>Together with other contributors, you’ll need to establish procedures to receive feedback and inputs, as well as how you will process them to create iterations. As always, documentation goes a long way and writing openly about the scope and decisions made along the way will help contributors understand the&nbsp;plan.</p> 3. Time <p>How much time and effort can you ethically ask others to put in? How much time are you putting&nbsp;in?</p><p>Depending on your budget, you’ll need to figure out how much time you need to complete your policy, principles, best practices or whatever the output actually is. You’ll also want to think about how much time you require from the people you’d like to&nbsp;invite.</p><p>If you are looking for open contributions to your project, it’s best to try to minimise the amount of time other people will need to participate. Help contributors give good insight quickly by asking specific questions and giving people the opportunity to give feedback via email or a voice&nbsp;text.</p> Bringing things&nbsp;together <p>The three sides of the project management triangle play together to shape your co-design event. Depending on your parameters, it might make sense to do some of the development work on your own and then ask for input and feedback. Alternatively, you might want to get everyone involved from the beginning and co-design the entire project through a series of events. Be adaptable and flexible as you begin to work with others and refer back to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">the 5 principles of open</a> to remind yourself of what it means to work&nbsp;openly.</p><p>Knowing where you sit on the ‘development/engagement’ continuum and mapping out your funding, scope and time will help you plan a codesign event that leads to great outputs and strengthened relationships.</p><p>Need help figuring out how to design your co-design initiative? <a href="https://weareopen.coop">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-a-co-design-event-39492530daad">How to build a co-design event</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Launch of “New Bretton Woods Project” (NBW): A Harvard-led initiative, soon to be incubated at Harvard Innovation Labs, tackling the global debt crisis through decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;Native Bitcoin Stablecoin: NBW is developing a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin via BeL2 infrastructure, offering stability while preserving Bitcoin’s decentralization and security.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;Economic Disruption and Resilience: The project aims to reshape global finance by leveraging Bitcoin and DeFi to promote economic stability and empower users in the face of rising global debt.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Cambridge, MA, September 19th 2024 — In a bold step to transform the global financial landscape, the Digital Economy Research Initiative, led by a dynamic group of Harvard students and alumni, has officially launched the “New Bretton Woods Project” (NBW). This pioneering blockchain-based initiative has secured membership in Harvard’s prestigious Innovation Labs and is set to begin incubation there in the coming weeks. NBW aims to tackle the escalating global debt crisis by offering innovative, technology-driven solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of the project is the development of a native Bitcoin stablecoin, leveraging the transformative potential of decentralized finance (DeFi). Built on the innovative <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-bitcoin-financial-freedom/">BeL2 infrastructure</a>, NBW aims to reshape global financial systems, unlocking new possibilities for debt management and financial stability across nations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the power of DeFi and blockchain, NBW stands poised to disrupt the status quo, offering a bold new path toward economic resilience in the face of one of the greatest challenges of our time. This initiative signals not just a step, but a leap toward a decentralized, stable and secure economic future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project reframes Bitcoin as not just a store of value but the foundation of a decentralized financial system. Using <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>—Bitcoin’s second-layer solution—the NBW project enables smart contracts for Bitcoin-backed stablecoin construction, empowering users to engage in decentralized finance while preserving Bitcoin’s core principles of decentralization and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Harvard Innovation Labs will help turn our vision into reality,” said Jacob, Lead Member of New Bretton Woods (NBW) at Harvard University. “Our goal is to create a ‘New Bretton Woods’ system anchored in Bitcoin, bringing stability through the utility of a stablecoin. This stablecoin allows users to bypass Bitcoin’s price volatility while retaining the potential for long-term gain, making the product practical for daily use.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The native Bitcoin stablecoin will be fully backed by Bitcoin, enabling users to experience the stability of fiat currency without liquidating their Bitcoin holdings. This offers a balance of algorithmic security using Bitcoin miners and the opportunity for long-term growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The BeL2 infrastructure allows for decentralized finance applications, where Bitcoin remains securely on the main network. Bitcoin can be used as collateral for Layer 2 applications such as decentralized exchanges, loans, and stablecoin issuance. The NBW team ensures that all Bitcoin-related settlements occur on the Bitcoin main network for maximum security. Instead of transferring assets across chains, messages are sent to Ethereum-compatible networks to issue stablecoin, uniting technologies and supporting a robust decentralized economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Financial empowerment comes from both freedom and stability,” added Sasha Mitchell, Head of Operations at BeL2. “By offering a stablecoin backed by Bitcoin on the BeL2 platform, NBW is giving people a way to protect their wealth and access new financial opportunities, especially in times of economic volatility.” Sash presented The New Bretton Woods Project on stage at Token2049, signalling a big moment to the industry in advancing technologies and institutional support.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“This initiative comes at a crucial time as global debt reaches record levels. By combining Bitcoin’s decentralized structure with the stability of a pegged currency, the project offers a financial system that mitigates the risks of traditional economies, highlighting the real-world benefits of financial security and sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our stablecoin isn’t just another digital currency; it’s a tool for global financial stability,” said Jacob, Lead Member of the NBW project. “We believe that offering a decentralized and stable currency helps individuals and communities navigate the growing challenges posed by the global debt crisis.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NBW team invites those who share their vision for a decentralized and secure financial future to explore how they can contribute. Whether you’re a developer, an investor, or a policymaker interested in sustainable financial solutions, this project offers a unique chance to shape a future focused on security, accessibility, and freedom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>About New Bretton Woods Project (NBW) <br>
The project is led by Digital Economy Research Initiative, a team of Harvard students and alumni. NBW is set to be incubated at Harvard Innovation Labs in the coming weeks. Focused on bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems, the team is committed to advancing financial inclusivity and economic stability.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-lambert-gb/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Nick Lambert</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dock</a>, has been a driving force in the digital identity space for over a decade, consistently working towards empowering individuals with control over their personal data. His decentralized identity journey began at MaidSafe, where as COO he spearheaded the SAFE Network, an ambitious project aimed at creating an autonomous data network that prioritizes user privacy and data sovereignty. At Dock, Nick continues his mission to revolutionize digital identity, focusing on solutions that streamline processes and reduce friction for both individuals and organizations.</p><p>Nick joined us to share his insights on the evolving landscape of decentralized identity. He discusses the <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/dock-and-cheqd-form-alliance-to-accelerate-global-adoption-of-decentralized-id?ref=blog.identity.foundation">recently announced blockchain merger with Cheqd</a>, Dock's unique approach in the market, and key sectors for growth in the coming years. Nick emphasizes that the collaborative approach in decentralized identity, with shared standards and toolsets, accelerates innovation towards user empowerment, with industry players "all pointed in roughly the same direction."&nbsp;</p><p>Your journey from MaidSafe to founding Dock reflects a long-standing interest in digital identity and personal data control. How did these experiences shape your vision for Dock?</p><p>It started back around 2012. I was a technology marketer and wasn't very familiar with decentralized technology. We were a startup looking to decentralize web services: enabling users to store their own data and provide it back to social media networks or other service providers. This introduced me to relevant decentralized technology, and also the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>It made me realize how important it is that we control our own data, whether that's documents we store, music, or academic files, and to be able to control it on our own device. You also don't want companies removing your access to it, which they can do and have done, even by mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>When I left MaidSafe and saw Dock, it made sense that the most important type of data you have is your identity data. Identity takes many forms, but it seemed like a critical area with work still to be done. Dock was an opportunity to take a narrower view (than MaidSafe) and ensure we could provide people with the ability to control their own identity. And for the last twelve years, that's what's really got me out of bed in the morning.</p><p>Your path perfectly captures how long-term builders and leaders in the space become focused on giving people control over their identity data. Can you elaborate on that?</p><p>Absolutely. It's such a big problem, but what's encouraging about the identity space is that it's a more focused challenge compared to something like decentralized storage. With identity, there's a much larger group of people working on the problem with, for the most part, an agreed-upon set of tools and standards. It's almost like a movement of companies and organizations solving it together.</p><p>We might have minor disagreements about implementation details, but we're all pointed in roughly the same direction. That's what makes it feel solvable. We're not all trying to work in isolation - we're collaborating, building on each other's work, and moving towards a common goal.</p><p>This approach is crucial because giving people control over their identity data is too big and important a problem for any one company to solve alone. By working together, sharing standards, and building interoperable tools, we're making real progress.&nbsp;</p><p>How does Dock's approach to verifiable credentials and digital identity differ from other solutions in the market?</p><p>We have a big focus on the business aspect. It's easy to fall in love with the technology, but it's the problems it solves that ensure technology is adopted and builders can make their solutions operate effectively as a business. We focus on tools that can enable business models.</p><p>An essential part is an online trust registry. Just because something's in a system or blockchain doesn't mean it's true. You need a linkage between real-world verification of a company or individual and their representation within a system. Trust registries (and the appropriate business partners) provide this, and having them programmatically exist inside your system is key.</p><p>Once you have that, it enables businesses to think about how they wish to monetize the credentials. This is important because it's very hard to get businesses to change unless you can point them to a specific business model. We're enabling credential issuers to turn what today is a cost center into a revenue source. When you combine that with our ecosystem enablement and the rest of our stack, it makes us differentiated in the market.</p><p>You've been at the forefront of communicating the business value of decentralized identity, including popularizing the term "reusable identity." Tell us your perspective on the evolution of narrative over time.</p><p>At the start, many focus their communications on the tooling -- that it's decentralized, uses certain types of cryptography, etc. You put that all over your website, thinking people will care. But the only people who care are others building those solutions.</p><p>The companies that will use and pay for these solutions are looking for solutions to problems. They don't care whether it's decentralized or what type of cryptography you're using - they just want a problem fixed.</p><p>We've made a conscious effort with our communications to focus more on the benefits we can provide. We try to understand the specific problem a group of prospects and customers are having and how we can fix it. Then we build the narrative around that. This has been the biggest shift we've had, and we're starting to see some success from it.</p><p>When discussing decentralized identity with investors, what aspects do you focus on to convey its potential value?&nbsp;</p><p>Investors are typically looking for returns within a defined time period. They're looking for things like size of opportunity and potential market growth. They also want to see something that doesn't completely disrupt existing businesses. Evolutionary changes that complement existing businesses in a relatively easy-to-integrate way are often more interesting to investors.</p><p>We also talk about market drivers pushing adoption, like eIDAS regulations, mobile driver's license initiatives in the US, World Bank investments in digital identity, LinkedIn's use of Microsoft Entra ID for credentials, and Google's recent release of the Credentials API. These developments indicate the level of adoption we're likely to see, which excites investors.</p><p>What are some common questions or misconceptions about decentralized identity that you encounter, and how do you address them?</p><p>One common misconception is that identity only refers to government-backed identity, like a driver's license. In reality, we're talking about identity in a much broader sense. It can be anything from a website's understanding of who you are to your access to their system. Fundamentally, it's about control over your data.</p><p>Another misconception about <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.identity.foundation">decentralized identity</a> is that every single aspect of it must be decentralized. What we're really talking about is the decentralized consumption of data - the presentation and verification. This typically happens in a wallet where the individual has control. They're presenting a credential given to them by a third party to another entity, who can verify it without knowing who they're verifying or what they're verifying. That's the important part of decentralization. Of course, you'll still have centralized entities issuing those credentials.</p><p>The recent merger between Dock and cheqd is significant news. What was the vision behind this decision?</p><p>Keep in mind it's a blockchain merge rather than a full company merger; the legal entities are remaining separate. We're migrating all of our chain-related elements (like revocation registries, DIDs, testnets) over to Cheqd.</p><p>The vision behind this is to allow Dock to focus on what differentiates us in the market: our issuing and verification platform, API, and our various platform features. Not all of these innovations take place at the blockchain layer but above it. As a small team, managing the entire stack was becoming a challenge.</p><p>We feel our strengths lie in the areas above the chain, and Cheqd is highly competent in the blockchain area. This allows us to focus on what really interests us and where we think we can make the most difference for our customers.</p><p>Additionally, being part of the Cheqd ecosystem with other great projects feels like a big step towards interoperability with a number of other providers. This addresses a concern I had about Dock potentially isolating itself on its own chain.</p><p>Your partnership with the University of Arkansas involves anonymous cyber incident reporting. How does this project demonstrate the capabilities of verifiable credentials?</p><p>The University of Arkansas, Little Rock is involved with some Department of Defense and energy-related projects. They're building what they call ET-ISAC (Emerging Threat Information Sharing and Analysis Center). They needed a way for people to report things anonymously, like a whistleblowing service, without fear of reprisal.</p><p>Using Dock's technology, they've created a system where someone can become a member and use that membership credential to access the reporting tool in a way where the system knows they're a member but doesn't know who they are. This is achieved using zero-knowledge proof technology.</p><p>A member of ET-ISAC receives a credential, which they can use to create a QR code in a wallet on their phone. They can then scan that QR code to gain access to the site and report an incident anonymously.</p><p>It's a unique use case that demonstrates the versatility of <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.identity.foundation">verifiable credentials</a> and zero-knowledge proofs in solving real-world problems.</p><p>What use cases for decentralized identity have you found to be particularly impactful or promising?</p><p>Our current focus is on KYC (Know Your Customer) and biometrics companies. We see this as a market that's ready for innovation, especially with regulations like <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/eidas-2?ref=blog.identity.foundation">eIDAS 2.0</a> and mDL coming into play. We can make their verification checks portable, which is what <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/reusable-kyc?ref=blog.identity.foundation">reusable KYC</a> is all about.</p><p>There's a good value transfer throughout the KYC process:</p>  Companies can make their verifications portable and generate new revenue streams.  Individuals get more control over their data and can short-circuit painful onboarding processes.  Relying parties (verifiers) don't have to start from scratch and can benefit from previous verification checks.  <p>Beyond that, I'm excited about Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM). Many large corporations, especially in the US, have different divisions that often act as separate entities. Regulations sometimes prevent them from sharing information about individuals across these divisions. This leads to tremendous pain for both the company and the individual.</p><p>Imagine if they could give individuals control over their information, allowing them to consent and decide what they want to release to another business unit within the same corporation. This could solve many problems for large companies and enable individuals to manage their own information seamlessly.</p><p>The challenge with CIAM is that it's a slow-moving, risk-averse industry. They're just getting used to passkeys, so introducing verifiable credentials and different applications for managing those credentials might take some time. However, the potential is enormous, and I'm excited to see what happens in the next year or two.</p>

 <a href="https://www.bitlen.io/">BitLen</a> developing peer-to-peer Bitcoin loan application based on Elastos’ BeL2 protocol 
 <a href="https://www.bqlabs.xyz/">BQ Labs</a> to build the World’s first decentralized insurance protocol for the Bitcoin ecosystem 
 Increasing variety of financial services products being developed in the World’s most popular decentralized currency signals the emergence of a ‘new Bretton Woods’ based on Bitcoin (Bitcoin finance (‘BitFi’)) 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore: September 18, 2024 – Elastos today announced two more partnerships to develop and deliver financial services products in native Bitcoin.&nbsp; The developments – being undertaken with BitLen and BQ Labs, respectively – confirm the momentum building around Bitcoin-denominated decentralized finance (‘BitFi’).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitlen.io/">BitLen</a> is developing a peer-to-peer Bitcoin-denominated loan offering based around Elastos’ <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-bel2-bitcoin-layer-2-solution/">Bitcoin Elastos Layer2</a> protocol – codenamed ‘BeL2’; a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, enabling multiple functionalities such as staking and smart contracts to be denominated directly in the World’s most popular digital currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resulting loan mechanism will enable Bitcoin users to collateralize up to 80% of their assets in return for L2 credit (stable coins, for instance) based on terms defined in a Bitcoin-assured smart contract. Thanks to the BeL2 protocol, this process can be completed without bridging, wrapping or otherwise interfering with the Bitcoin layer; this both assures the integrity of the currency and avoids network congestion, additional fees, and security compromises that would otherwise result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The BeL2 protocol perfectly reflects what <a href="https://www.bitlen.io/">BitLen</a> is all about; increasing Bitcoin liquidity without compromising its integrity.&nbsp; The result will be a genuinely peer-to-peer loan product; it’s not simply Bitcoin-based credit, but completely disintermediated and anonymous,” says Leon Jiang, CEO of BitLen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bqlabs.xyz/">BQ Labs</a> is a Bitcoin-focused platform that provides decentralized insurance and risk management solutions for Bitcoin Layer 2 protocols and validators. Through the partnership, BQ Labs’ Risk Engine product will be incorporated into the Elastos ecosystem and dApps, to help users plan and mitigate operational and compliance risk when transacting in Bitcoin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our mission is to facilitate and secure the 21 million BTC&nbsp;currently onboarding to DeFi, across all stages of the ecosystem from hodlers to validators, providing them with a set of tools and protocols to manage and mitigate their risk. Our partnership with Elastos reflects our shared vision of Bitcoin-denominated DeFi with all the benefits of true decentralization,” says Akshay Agrawal, CBO of BQ Labs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves, Elastos’ Global Head of Growth, describes the partnerships as ‘irrefutable proof’ of the momentum now gathering around Bitcoin-based financial instruments.</p>
<p>“Both projects demonstrate the benefits that native Bitcoin can bring to decentralized finance in terms of integrity, security and validation, as long as the token itself is not compromised in the process.&nbsp; Our BitLen partnership, for instance, represents the perfect example of the potential of what can be achieved with Bitcoin-based smart contracts that – thanks to BeL2’s unique ZK-proof process – ensure complete interoperability while leaving the Bitcoin layer entirely untouched,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>”With BQ Labs, it’s about incorporating tools and protocols that make it easier and safer to transact in Bitcoin; specifically to help Bitcoin-denominated L2 projects build trust and credibility while simultaneously reducing their operational and regulatory headaches,” Jonathan adds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Both these partnerships demonstrate Elastos’ commitment and role in supporting a DeFi ecosystem with Bitcoin at its heart.&nbsp; And this is where the big opportunity lies – the establishment of what we call a ‘new Bretton Woods’; a reserve currency whose supply is fixed and guaranteed (just like the Gold Standard), complete with integrity and security, but which – unlike traditional reserves such as gold bullion – can be subdivided, stored and transferred at zero cost.&nbsp; Native Bitcoin embodies all the qualities of an alternative reserve currency, and – as these partnerships demonstrate – the era of ‘BitFi’ is now upon us,” he concludes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>BitLen will be joining executives from Elastos at the Token 2049 side event, <a href="https://lu.ma/aw0flgk4">Asia OnChain – RWA, DePIN &amp; DAO</a>, 19 September ‘24.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About BitLen&nbsp;</p>
<p>BitLen aims to be a community-driven, cross-chain liquidity-boosting platform offering stability through its Bitcoin-pegged HEX token, diverse yield strategies via lending, and restaking capabilities within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>About BQLabs&nbsp;</p>
<p>BQLabs is transforming risk management in the Bitcoin ecosystem with its innovative decentralized insurance protocol. At the heart of this transformation is the BQ Protocol, which provides a comprehensive technical, operational, and legal infrastructure to facilitate the underwriting, trading of risks, and insurance cover purchases.

 Abstract 



<p>For enterprises that have implemented a second factor, such as SMS OTP, to mitigate the risk of credential stuffing, this paper will provide guidance on displacing passwords + OTP with passkeys.</p>



 Audience 



<p>This white paper is intended for ISRM and IT staff tasked with deploying and maintaining multi-factor authentication (MFA) sign-in processes.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>Many enterprises aiming to secure their workforces have deployed SMS and application-based one-time passcodes (OTPs) as an additional factor of authentication to passwords. This whitepaper is aimed at these organizations that are now considering a move to FIDO authentication with passkeys. While this whitepaper focuses on OTPs specifically, the discussion and recommendations can be generalized to any system using phishable second factors including application-based OTP and push notifications.</p>



<p>This whitepaper compares OTPs as an additional authentication factor to passwords and passkeys in terms of security, user experience and ease of deployment. And it provides general guidance about migrating from OTPs to passkeys in order to improve user experience while strengthening the organization’s overall security posture. The guidance within this paper will cover key steps for moving towards passkeys, including planning, use case identification and documentation, pilot considerations, as well as deployment and training guidance. This document targets low-assurance use cases, including internal authentication, external authentication and third party and B2B authentication strategies. Given that organizations typically implement OTPs as the second factor to passwords, for this document all references to OTPs should be assumed as being used as a second factor to passwords.</p>



<p>This document will not cover specific vendor technologies or implementations. For guidance on moderate or high assurance use cases please refer to additional <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">whitepapers published by the FIDO Alliance</a> [1]. As this document is a part of a series of whitepapers, it is recommended that the reader start with the <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/June-26-FIDO-EDWG-Spring-2023_Paper-1_Introduction-FINAL.docx.pdf">introductory document</a> [2].</p>

 2. OTP MFA vs Passkeys: Why Choose Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys offer several benefits to security, user experience, and ease of deployment when compared to OTPs.</p>



<p>2.1 Security </p>



<p>OTP-based MFA has been widely adopted to mitigate the risk of credential stuffing and reuse. SMS and authenticator application-based OTP are the most commonly deployed solutions due to their relative low-cost and ease of deployment across a broad set of users and use cases. The relative simplicity of this type of MFA, however, leaves it vulnerable to social engineering and many MFA bypass toolkits, because no bidirectional communication exists between the secrets generator and the validating identity provider (IDP), meaning that an OTP can be intercepted and used by a third party without the knowledge of the end user or IDP.</p>



<p>Additionally, OTP-based MFA requires trust in a device that an organization may not manage nor have visibility into its security posture. This means that organizations are relying on end-users to maintain the security of their own device and their ability to discern phishing attempts. While user training can help to address some of these attacks, historic guidance like checking for secure connections and familiar URLs, still relies on an ever-vigilant user base.</p>



<p>Passkeys provide phishing-resistant, replay-resistant sign-ins that reduce the cognitive load on users and strengthen organizations’ overall security posture. This is achieved because passkeys implement a cryptographic challenge-response protocol scoped to the relying party’s domain. The authenticators then rely on secure behaviors, like biometric proofs or PINS to unlock the credentials on the authenticator while retaining a user-friendly experience. With passkeys, an organization can have a strong first-factor of authentication for passwordless scenarios OR a strong second factor for traditional MFA workflows.</p>



<p>2.2 User Experience</p>



 
 Passkeys improve the user experience over passwords and OTPs in several ways, including: 



 Passkeys work even when there is poor cell coverage whereas SMS OTPs require mobile network connectivity. For example, a user can have wireless access on an airplane but are not permitted to use SMS. In this instance, the SMS OTP cannot be delivered whereas passkeys can be used to authenticate. 



 <a href="https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#autofill-ui">AutoFill UI</a> enables seamless integration within browsers on mobile devices and on desktops. 



 <a href="https://resources.yubico.com/53ZDUYE6/at/6r45gck4rfvbrspjxwrmcsr/Forrester_Report_Total_Economic_Impact_of_Yubico_YubiKeys.pdf?format=pdf">Up to four times faster login</a>, no need to wait for code delivery [3] 



 Protection against mis-keyed passwords and codes 



 Passkeys build on common behaviors for authentication like biometric proofs (face or fingerprint). 
 



<p>2.3 Ease of Deployment</p>



<p>For some micro, small, and medium sized businesses without large, dedicated support staff, end-user deployment of dedicated<br>authentication hardware tokens can create roadblocks. This includes both OTP hardware tokens or FIDO security Keys. Historically, the ease of deployment of SMS/App based OTPs made them a more favorable option. Procurement, logistics, and configuration are a constant battle fought by operations and IT teams. With updates to the FIDO2 ecosystem to expand the authenticator landscape, this problem is alleviated and allows the use of many different devices as passkey stores.</p>



 
 All of this comes together to mean that the deployment of passkeys is much easier and less costly compared to SMS OTP for a few reasons: 



 There is no SMS integration required. Enterprises will not need to configure or maintain interfaces with mobile carriers or third-party SMS vendors which reduces deployment complexity. 



 Enterprises will not have to pay per-transaction fees associated with SMS OTP therefore reducing the total cost of ownership for authentication. 



 FIDO authentication uses passkeys. Passkeys are simple to implement across a range of devices and applications. 



 SMS OTP rely on carrier-specific APIs or third-party vendor APIs that are not standardized which increases risk of vendor lock-in and lack of interoperability. 



 No time-synchronization is needed. Passkeys avoid the time-synchronization requirements of SMS time-bound OTPs (TOTPs). Codes don’t need to be entered within a short time window, and deliverability issues with SMS do not result in login failures. 
 



<p>FIDO authentication with passkeys has been embraced by operating system (OS) and browser providers. This existing OS support from most major vendors means that, in most cases, existing hardware in the enterprise, such as laptops, phones, and tables, can be leveraged to deploy FIDO with passkeys without costly updates and replacements.</p>



<p>In some cases, enterprises use shared, single user devices such as iPads. For these use cases, a passkey stored in the integrated platform authenticator may not be appropriate, since any user of the device has access to the credential. In these cases, organizations should use roaming authenticators (hardware security keys) to generate and store passkeys for use on the shared device. This offers the same ease of use and convenience. Keep in mind, there may be an additional cost to purchase and manage these hardware keys for users. In many cases using hardware keys there may be a need to issue users a second hardware key as a backup to reduce the risk of the user being locked out of their account(s).</p>



 3. Deployment Strategy for Migration from OTP to Passkeys 



<p>3.1 Identifying the Deployment Model</p>



<p>Planning for a successful passkey deployment requires organizations to consider the needs of the user and the computing devices they use in their role to maximize the utility of passkeys for staff. At a minimum, organizations should consider the following questions when planning a passkey deployment in order to make passkeys accessible to the broadest audience possible:</p>



 
 What kind of computing devices are used? 



 Are your users working on laptops or desktop computers? Mobile devices? Tablets? 



 Are the devices single user devices or multi-user (e.g., shared) devices? 



 Are the devices provisioned by the company or are users using their own personal devices at work? 



 Are there limitations on using USB ports, Bluetooth, or NFC? 



 Are there limitations on access to the internet? 



 Are your users commonly wearing gloves or masks which limit the use of on-device biometrics? 
 



<p>Based on the answers to the previous questions, organizations can choose one of a few types of authenticators to store user’s passkeys. The flexibility of passkeys means that organizations can mix and match as their security posture and UX needs dictate. Other documents in this series go into more detail on each type of authenticator.</p>



<p>3.2 Deployment Testing</p>



<p>After determining the deployment model and deploying a FIDO server with applications integrated, it is recommended that organizations use pilot groups to test registration, authentication, and recovery processes (see below) with users. Then use the feedback from the pilot to improve processes and address issues raised by the pilot population before embarking on a broad rollout of passkeys.</p>



 3.3 User Experience 



<p>3.3.1 Registration</p>



<p>Enterprises should implement a reliable registration process to ensure that users are correctly and securely associated with their passkeys, as stated in earlier FIDO whitepapers. The registration experience is critical to consider because it is a user’s first interaction with passkeys. Here are a few elements to consider when it comes to designing the registration experience:</p>



 
 Identity Proofing – Physically or remotely having the user prove their identity at the start of the registration process is recommended to ensure a strong, abuse resistant process. This may involve SMS OTP for the final time. 



 Self-service registration – Users use their existing credentials to bootstrap a new passkey. 



 Supervised registration – work with IT/helpdesk for registration. This reduces the risk associated with self-service models that are vulnerable to phishing the original creds. 



 Pre-provisioned credentials – high effort, high assurance, but a mechanism is needed to get the credential into the user’s hands. 



 Remote users – self-service or pre-provisioned, but a mechanism is needed to provide the PIN to the user to unlock the device the first time. 
 



<p>3.3.2 Sign-In</p>



<p>The first step in designing a FIDO deployment with passkeys is to understand the user base, common work paradigms, and available devices – phones, tablets, laptops, desktops. This step is critical because enabling user-friendly workflows that work with the user’s existing devices is core to developing a successful rollout.</p>



<p>Common users’ environments and equivalent suggestions include:</p>



 
 Environments with users who primarily operate on mobile devices or tablets – Look into built-in unlock capabilities. 



 Mixed device environments or environments that rely on a variety of SaaS tools – Leverage SSO provided by IDP or build flexible login workflows. 



 Shared accounts – FIDO RPs can be configured to allow for more than one credential to be associated with a login. Investigate<br>cross device hybrid authentication or roaming authenticators. 
 



<p>3.3.3 Recovery</p>



<p>Any authentication process is only as strong as its weakest point, which is why recovery processes have often been abused by attackers to compromise systems. Synced passkeys are durable credentials that can survive device loss and unintentional wiping by restoring from a passkey provider and reduce the need to perform account recovery to establish new credentials for the user. With passkeys, users are expected to lose their credentials less frequently. However, there may be cases where passkeys, or access to the passkeys, is lost, thus requiring account recovery.</p>



<p>For passkey implementations utilizing device-bound passkeys that cannot be backed up or recovered, account recovery should be performed using the backup authentication method, such as using a backup authenticator, to bootstrap enrollment of a new authenticator. In the event that a backup authentication mechanism is not available, organizations must provide alternative pathways to recovery. Organizations should take a risk-based approach to designing and implementing account recovery systems. The specific implementation details will vary widely depending upon organizational requirements. In general, recovery mechanisms should never depend on weaker factors than the credential that the user is trying to recover. In the case where passkeys need to be re-registered, organizations should design mechanisms, either automated or manual, to prevent the use of passkeys no longer registered to that user.</p>



<p>For passkey implementations where synchronized passkeys are used, be sure to document the bootstrapping/enrolment process for new devices as well as building a risk averse process (including identity proofing) for full provider account recovery or replacement. While these catastrophic events should be low, it may still be necessary to have users go through this process. Knowing the proper process ahead of time will insulate organizations against manipulations and stop work events.</p>



<p>For additional considerations around account recovery, please see the FIDO Alliance’s <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FIDO_Account_Recovery_Best_Practices-1.pdf">Recommended Account Recovery Practices for FIDO Relying Parties</a>. [5]</p>



<p>3.4 Admin Considerations:</p>



<p>Monitoring of implementation and adoption metrics are critical to ensuring the success of the deployment and ensuring that the security benefits of FIDO authentication with passkeys is realized. Below are recommendations for metrics and processes that are indicative of the success of enterprise passkey migrations.</p>



<p>3.4.1 Monitoring and Visibility into Utilization</p>



<p>Admins are strongly encouraged to use groups or other segmentation structures to allow graceful transition of subsets of users and applications to passkeys. Pilot populations should be carefully constructed and should be composed of a variety of end user types and levels in the organization. Monitoring the usage of items below, both before and after the migration, will provide critical insights into the effectiveness of the program and guide important adjustments.</p>



 
 Device enrollment:
 
 How long did it take the user to enroll their first device? 
 
 



 Security events:
 
 Where was the device at time of onboarding? 



 What, if any, identity proofing approaches were used to ensure that the correct user was onboarded? 



 If manager, IT support, or peer approval workflows were used, who provided attestation? 



 Are there any time of day or device location anomalies that did not previously exist? 
 
 



 User authentication:
 
 Was the user able to successfully authenticate? 



 Are there any observable changes in their daily authentication patterns that would suggest problems or added friction? 



 Does analysis of day-of-week and time-of-day suggest any issues? 
 
 



 Key management:
 
 Are keys being used as expected and only from known devices? Some authenticators support device attestation which provides key provenance and assurance of the identity of the authenticator. If the source of the passkey is an important security control for your implementation, be sure to verify if your chosen authenticator solution supports this kind of attestation. 



 How many keys are associated with an individual’s account? Normal guidance would be to expect the number of passkeys associated with a user’s account to be close to the number of devices that a user leverages. For example, if your users use Android phones &amp; Windows laptops then you should expect to see two to three passkeys associated with a users’ account, one stored on each platform authenticator, and possibly one backup from a security key. In this scenario if an account had five to six passkeys registered, then it would be time to investigate and potentially remove excessive keys. Every organization’s definition of excessive may vary, and should be defined based on observations from their environment. Additionally, depending on your deployment, consider the number of applications that you have enabled for passkey authentication. If you deployed passkeys as credentials for an SSO integration, your users may only have one passkey per device. If you deployed passkeys on an application-specific basis, there may be one passkey per device per application. Organizations are recommended to monitor the number of keys associated with each user and use this data as context for informing passkey management. 
 
 



 Whose keys are associated with administrative/service/break-glass accounts? In the same way that it is best practice to segregate administrative access from normal user access, generating a separate set of passkeys for administrative accounts is also recommended. If they are shared, be sure to include rotation, monitoring, and good cleanup practices. 



 How will passkeys be removed?If an employee leaves the company or moves into a different role, their accounts should be disabled, deleted, or access should be evaluated and vetted. In situations where this is not reasonable due to legal requirements, passkeys should be promptly removed to prevent unauthorized account access as part of the disablement process. Similarly, if a user reports a device missing or stolen, any passkeys associated with those devices should also be removed. 



 Compatibility assurance:
 
 Do any combinations of applications and endpoint platforms show unusual changes or decline in authentication events? 



 Are all invocation methods for passkey authentication continuously functioning, including after upgrades? 
 
 
 



 Next Steps: Get Started Today 



 
 Enterprise organizations should consider migrating to FIDO authentication where possible. 



 Use FIDO standards. 



 Think about what your relying parties are supporting as well as your own enterprise security requirements. 



 Passkeys are far more secure than traditional OTP mechanisms. 



 Passkeys are far more secure than passwords. Look for the passkey icon on websites and applications that support passkeys.

<p>By Eric Drury</p>



<p>If you’re in the digital trust space, like me you might be encouraged by the number and variety of inspiring developments—appearing on an almost weekly basis—which illustrate the momentum that responsible technology is gaining in the drive towards a more trustworthy and sustainable future.</p>



<p>One of the latest and more interesting initiatives comes—yet again—from the Kingdom of Bhutan in the form of <a href="https://gmc.bt/">Gelephu Mindfulness City</a> (GMC). GMC is the Kingdom’s unique version of a smart city. They call it a Special Administrative Region, integrating economic growth with mindfulness, holistic living, and sustainability.</p>



<p>How does digital trust fit into GMC?</p>



<p>In October of last year, Bhutan launched the world’s first self-sovereign national digital identity system, <a href="https://www.bhutanndi.com/">Bhutan NDI</a>. And as a pillar of digital public infrastructure (DPI), a digital identity system forms the basis for trusted interactions between individuals, government, and business.</p>



<p>The NDI system, which Bhutan is currently rolling out nation-wide, will be part of the core infrastructure that provides cutting-edge digital connectivity for GMC. As such, this is an exciting opportunity to further cement the viability of emerging SSI and other trust technologies for implementation at population scale.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP is proud to have contributed to Bhutan’s NDI system both formally and informally.</p>



<p>Drummond Reed, one of ToIP’s founding board members, provided inspiration—and a road map of sorts—for the development of SSI systems via the book he co-authored called ‘<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity – Decentralized Digital Identity and Verifiable Credentials</a>’. Drummond and other ToIP members also provided expertise and input for Bhutan’s National Digital Identity Act, the <a href="https://parliament.bt/uploads/topics/16920885498838.pdf">NDI Act of Bhutan</a>, relying heavily on the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/02/01/the-toip-foundation-releases-its-first-official-governance-specifications/">ToIP governance metamodel</a> which was developed by the ToIP’s Governance Stack Working Group led by Scott Perry.</p>



<p>For an in-depth case study on the Bhutan NDI program, refer to <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Case-Study-Bhutan-NDI-National-Digital-Identity-ToIP-Digital-Trust-Ecosystems-V1.0-2024-05-21.ext_.pdf">Bhutan NDI, Digital Trust Ecosystem</a>, written by DHI’s Pallavi Sharma and Eric Drury, co-chair of ToIP’s Ecosystem Foundry Working Group.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP and Gelephu Mindfulness City further align in that both espouse the intertwining of governance and technology as a core enabler of digital trust.</p>



 
 From a governance perspective, GMC blends robust policies that ‘build trust and accountability with mindful incentives designed to empower both residents and businesses alike to reach their fullest potential’. 



 From a technology perspective, Gelephu Mindfulness City will be built on a foundation of ‘world-class infrastructure seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art technology with sustainable practices’. 
 



<p>In support of GMC, the Kingdom is convening the first <a href="https://www.bhutan-innovation-forum.org/">Bhutan Innovation Forum</a> (BIF), a global initiative uniting international leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs to support Bhutan’s vision of a Mindfulness City.</p>



<p>The BIF takes place in less than two weeks, October 1-3, 2024. ToIP members Drummond Reed and Eric Drury are honored to be invited to attend, representing the ToIP community and continuing the engagement with Bhutan’s digital trust community.</p>



<p>Drummond and Eric will appear on panels to promote the principles of digital trust and will share their experience and expertise on all things digital trust, including the emergence of cross-border digital trust networks.</p>



<p>ToIP is thrilled to once again walk the path with Bhutan towards a more sustainable, trustworthy, and equitable digital future. We look forward to sharing our learnings after the Forum so that the entire digital trust community benefits.</p>

  <p>As we enter the second half of 2024, a time full of global digital governance initiatives, we're excited to share our progress at the Human Colossus Foundation from the governance perspective. This update encapsulates the recent strides of the Swiss E-ID, G20 Digital Public Infrastructure, UN Development Program, and the inaugural event for European Digital Independence.</p> Distributed Governance  Progress update <p>In the summer of 2023, the Human Colossus Foundation published Part 1 of the HCF Distributed Governance Model<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.07280">[1]</a>. The model, though abstract in concept, tackles governance through the lens of the Principal-Agent problem. The core idea is to view information systems (i.e. technology) as agents serving users (i.e. humans) -whether individuals, businesses or any sovereign organisation with a decision power.&nbsp;</p>





















  
  














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                

            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>In today's hyper connected digital society, we lose control over information. It has become challenging to know what happens to the data we share and even more difficult to assess the accuracy of the data we use. Part 1 addressed this need for control and accuracy by introducing a governance framework integrating digital technology with existing (non-digital) frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>While Part 1 lays the conceptual foundation, Part 2 turns theory into action. By collaborating directly with the key players in digital transformation across various sectors, we are building the technology stack that will demonstrate the crucial role of data authenticity and integrity in shaping a digital governance model. This practical approach is a prerequisite to our future work on AI governance for example.</p><p>Therefore, Part 2 develops a concept into a reality we shape through multiple projects. We are well underway and excited to share the progress here.</p> <br>Switzerland’s E-ID - a Sovereign Digital Legal Identity

  <p>Sep.10 -Bern The Swiss parliament's high chamber (States Council) agreed to the design principles of the Swiss E-ID by a clear 43 against 1 vote<a href="https://www.parlament.ch/de/services/news/Seiten/2024/20240910100146714194158159026_bsd059.aspx">[2]</a>. Together with the low chamber (National Council), they will iron out the remaining differences and pave the way for parliamentary approval in 2024. This agreement further confirms the readiness of the legislative basis for introducing the Swiss E-ID<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-politics/parliament-gets-closer-to-finalising-new-digital-id-scheme/87522181">[3]</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>HCF Contribution: Digital independence requires technological independence. The Human Colossus develops an Open-Source distributed technology stack to implement applications based on a distributed governance model. Creating these technologies and making them accessible to everyone requires developing an ecosystem of tools to harmonise data across multiple stakeholders (possibly millions) and ensure interoperability across different jurisdictions. The Foundation is creating some of these tools as part of the digital healthcare <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101136962">NextGen EU Horizon project[6]</a> with funding from the EU, Switzerland and UK to integrate sensitive health data (including genomics) in personalised medicine for cardiology. <a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/heart-patients-set-to-receive-treatment-tailored-to-their-genetic-and-health-inf">The press release of the European Society of Cardiology provides more information [7]</a>.</p>

  <p>HCF Contribution: In 2023, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) published a <a href="https://www.governance4id.org">Legal Digital Entity Framework[7]</a>. Within that framework, UNDP develops the model governance assessment for data exchanges that respect the country's (i.e. sovereign entities) existing governance and fundamental Human Rights principles. The Human Colossus Foundation is part of a UNDP Advisory Board that provides its expertise in developing this work.</p>





















  
  



 


   Current Work at the Foundation: <p>The above initiatives provide input for the continuous development of the core HCF technologies. They help to demonstrate the essential relevance of accurate data for digital governance. From a governance perspective, we can summarise them as follows:</p>  <p>The 'Ambient Infrastructure' is a reputation-based authentication system built upon the decentralised key management infrastructure KERI (Key Events Log Receipts Infrastructure). Launched in 2023 as part of the <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/decentralized-key-management-infrastructure-for-ssi-by-the-human-colossus-foundation/">EU Horizon 2020 eSSIF-Lab project[9]</a>, the Ambient Infrastructure is now advancing in NextGen, an EU Horizon project focused on personalised cardiovascular medicine.</p>  <p><a href="https://oca.colossi.network">Version 2.0 of the OCA specification[4]</a>  supporting the OCA ecosystem. Decentralised semantics architectures are significant developments for digital governance to&nbsp; ensure the respect of different sovereign digital governance.</p>  <p>OCA Ecosystem v1.0. Community based solutions and tooling including extensions (i.e. overlays not part of the core specification). The Human Colossus Research and Technology Councils have open a dedicated focus group to collect community requirements.</p>  <p>This ecosystem, featuring a suite of tools and protocols, ensures consistent and interoperable&nbsp; data flows across multiple stakeholders and jurisdictions.</p> Conclusion <p>The Human Colossus Foundation has a busy autumn ahead. If you would like to help map a distributed governance framework into real-world applications, the HCF Research Council invites you to join its new Focus Group.</p><p>Joining this group will provide you with the opportunity to work closely with our team, share your expertise, and help shape the future of digital governance.

<p><a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos</a> imagines a future where individuals are empowered to control every aspect of their digital lives—owning their data, managing digital assets, and running decentralised nodes. Within this framework, Elacity plays a pivotal role by offering a <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elacity-revolutionising-drm-in-the-digital-transformation-era/">decentralised Digital Rights Management (dDRM) platform</a> that ensures creators can protect, manage, and monetise their content in a fully transparent and decentralised manner.</p>
<p>As part of a partnership with hardware manufacturers, Elacity is integrating these capabilities into physical devices, allowing for a easy connection between decentralised digital rights and real-world products. This collaboration is expected to come to fruition by Q1 2025 and opens up the possibility of running decentralised, blockchain-governed nodes on hardware, making the Elastos SmartWeb vision of millions of globally distributed nodes a reality. So, what actually is it? Let’s dive in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Elastos Vision: SmartWeb for Everyone 
<p>The SmartWeb concept is central to Elastos’ mission—creating a decentralised version of the internet where individuals, rather than corporations, hold full control over their data, assets, and online presence. This decentralised framework ensures that users own their data and digital creations while transacting and interacting through a secure blockchain infrastructure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the internet continues to grow and expand, so does the SmartWeb, but it’s driven by people, not centralised servers. By combining blockchain, decentralised identity, and peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies, the SmartWeb enables a future where users operate their own nodes and manage their online experiences on their terms.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Elacity dDRM v2: Redefining Digital Ownership 
<p>Elacity’s dDRM v2 is an upcoming decentralised Smart-Contract as a Service system for managing digital rights through blockchain-powered licencing agreements, offering features such as time-based access NFTs, channels with subscription models, and fractionalised royalty markets. It allows content creators to define who has access to their digital content, when, and under what conditions—all secured and enforced by smart contracts on the blockchain.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Key New Features of Elacity dDRM v2:</p>
 
 Subscription Models with Time-Based NFTs: Creators can offer access to a library of content for a set period using time-limited NFTs, providing a flexible and easy way for users to engage with digital content. 
 Fractionalised Royalty Markets: Creators and stakeholders can issue and trade royalty tokens, where each token represents a fractional percentage (e.g., 0.01%) of future revenue from digital content. Payments are automatic, happening in real time whenever content is accessed or sold. 
 
<p>These features enable a robust and decentralised digital economy, where creators, consumers, and other stakeholders engage in transparent and immediate transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Runtime: Secure Rights Enforcement on Hardware Devices 
<p>A critical element in Elacity’s strategy is Runtime, WebAssemby software which runs locally via browser and can be installed into hardware devices to act as part of the decentralised ecosystem. With Runtime installed, hardware devices can verify user rights on the blockchain before receiving licences from smartcontracts to decrypt and play content, ensuring that only those with the appropriate NFTs or access tokens can use the content.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How Runtime Works:</p>
 
 Blockchain Verification: Runtime queries the blockchain to check for access rights in real-time, ensuring that content is only accessible by authorised users. 
 On-Device Decryption: Once access is verified, the device decrypts the content locally, providing a secure and private experience that doesn’t rely on centralised servers. 
 
<p>This technology allows hardware to become an integral part of the SmartWeb, enabling secure digital rights management and content playback directly from consumer devices like smart cameras, digital frames, and more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-World Elacity B2B DePIN Use Cases 
<p>The combination of Runtime and decentralised node hosting unlocks powerful use cases for businesses in the DePIN ecosystem. These include real-time, automated payments and decentralised hosting for digital content, enabling businesses to create new revenue streams and engage with customers in a more transparent and secure way.</p>
<p>Examples of B2B DePIN Use Cases:</p>
 
 Decentralised Advertising: Hardware devices can host digital signage and operate as decentralised nodes where advertisers pay based on blockchain-verified engagement metrics. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Private Content Channels: Businesses can create their own private content channels hosted on DePIN nodes, where users subscribe to curated content directly from the company. Payments and royalties are distributed instantly based on blockchain records. 
 
<p></p>
 
 Subscription-Based Digital Content: With time-based NFTs, businesses can offer subscription services to their content libraries. Devices like smart frames or cameras ensure that only authorised users have access during their subscription period. 
 
<p></p>
<p>These use cases demonstrate how businesses can move beyond traditional infrastructure and adopt a decentralized model that offers transparent payment distribution and independent content hosting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Elacity Channels Hosted on DePIN Nodes &amp; Hardware Devices 
<p>Elacity’s partnership with hardware manufacturers presents a unique opportunity for users to host their own channels and services on DePIN (Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Networks) nodes directly from their devices. These devices will not only serve as access points for dDRM-protected content but also as SmartWeb nodes in a global decentralised network for other services and solutions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Independent Hosting on DePIN Nodes:</p>
 
 Elastos Hive / IPFS: Devices can act as storage nodes using the <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/hive/intro">Elastos Hive</a> system, which is built on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This allows users to store, access, and share content securely and independently, without relying on centralised services. 
 Elastos Carrier: For peer-to-peer communication, devices can also run <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/carrier/intro/">Elastos Carrier</a> nodes, which facilitate secure and private messaging or data transfers directly between users. 
 DePIN and Other Decentralised Protocols: Users can run additional decentralised nodes like <a href="https://nostr.com/">Nostr</a> and DePIN solutions, supporting censorship-resistant communication, GPU rendering for AI and bandwidth support for content, allowing for fully independent, user-owned networks which reward owners for decentralised cloud solutions. 
 
<p>With these systems in place, every device becomes a part of the decentralised web, hosting content, managing communication, and enabling real-time transactions on behalf of its users. This enables Elacity’s services to function on a truly decentralised scale, where millions of nodes can operate across the globe.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 A Decentralised Economy in Action 
<p>With Elacity’s dDRM v2, channels and licencing services can be independently hosted on devices acting as decentralised SmartWeb nodes. This global network of decentralised devices on the <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos SmartWeb</a>, powered by blockchain, peer-to-peer communication, and secure storage, ensures that users and businesses have complete control over their digital lives. As decentralised nodes become commonplace, Elastos’ SmartWeb vision becomes a reality—an open, user-controlled internet where digital assets and communications flow freely, securely, and independently.</p>
<p>Elacity’s expansion with partners into real-world devices and its integration of dDRM, decentralised nodes, and Runtime mark a significant step toward achieving Elastos’ SmartWeb vision. With opportunities for users and businesses to host their own channels, run decentralised nodes, and engage in peer-to-peer transactions, the future of decentralised digital ownership is just beginning. As we continue to build this decentralised infrastructure, we invite everyone to follow <a href="https://docs.ela.city/">Elacity</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ElastosInfo">join us</a> in creating a digital world where the people who use them fully own data, assets, and networks.</p>

 Part 3: Identifying leverage&nbsp;points <p>This is the third in a series of posts about Systems Thinking, an approach that helps us make sense of complex situations by considering the whole system rather than just the individual pieces from which it is constituted.</p><p>This series is made up&nbsp;of:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-51d6e4f9df0b">Part 1: Three Key Principles</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-77eb29d510a4">Part 2: Understanding Feedback&nbsp;Loops</a>  Part 3: Identifying Leverage Points (this&nbsp;post)  <p>In the first post, we laid the groundwork by exploring the foundational principles of Systems Thinking. We then explored feedback loops in the second post, examining how they drive system behaviour and contribute to stability or&nbsp;change.</p><p>In this concluding post, we turn our attention to Leverage Points — those critical areas within a system where a small shift can lead to profound changes. By understanding and identifying these points, you can uncover powerful opportunities for intervention, allowing you to drive meaningful and lasting change within complex&nbsp;systems.</p> 1. What are leverage&nbsp;points? <p>“When we must deal with problems, we instinctively refuse to try the way that leads through darkness and obscurity. We wish to hear only of unequivocal results, and completely forget that these results can only be brought about when we have ventured into and emerged again from the darkness.” — Carl&nbsp;Jung</p><p>Leverage points are specific areas within a system where a small change can produce a significant impact on the entire system. These points often require careful analysis and a deep understanding of the system’s structure and behaviour, as they are not always immediately obvious. Identifying leverage points can be challenging because they are often hidden beneath the surface of the system’s visible components.</p><p>For example, in the world of technology, offering short, simple, clear (e.g. no legalese) ‘Terms and Conditions’ might be a leverage point. By helping users understand exactly how your organisation uses their data, you might improve customer satisfaction, increase trust, and reduce misunderstandings — all by making it easy for people to understand your company’s policy on&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Leverage points, therefore, offer a way to create meaningful change by focusing on areas where even minimal effort can lead to substantial results. Recognising these points requires stepping back and viewing the system holistically, understanding not just the individual parts but how they interact and influence each&nbsp;other.</p> 2. The role of paradigms in leverage&nbsp;points <p>“Inquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole.” — John&nbsp;Dewey</p><p>Paradigms are the underlying beliefs and assumptions that shape how we understand and interact with a system. These paradigms represent some of the most powerful leverage points, as changing a paradigm can fundamentally alter the way a system operates. Shifting these beliefs requires questioning what is often taken for granted and being open to new perspectives.</p><p>To go back to our Terms and Conditions example, a paradigm shift from prioritising user convenience to emphasising data privacy can serve as a transformative leverage point. Traditionally, many tech companies have focused on creating products that are easy to use, often at the expense of data privacy. However, as the paradigm shifts towards valuing privacy, we see significant changes in how technologies are designed and deployed.</p><p>This shift has been significantly driven by policy changes, such as the implementation of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR has forced companies to rethink how they collect, store, and manage user data, prioritising privacy by design. As a result, this new perspective has encouraged the development of more secure products, the adoption of stricter data management practices, and an overall increase in consumer trust. The influence of GDPR illustrates how policy can drive paradigm shifts, leading to widespread changes not just in product development but also in corporate strategies, legal frameworks, and consumer expectations. This example demonstrates the profound impact that changing a paradigm, supported by regulatory measures, can have on an entire&nbsp;system.</p><p>By addressing paradigms, especially through supportive policies, you are working at the root of the system’s behaviour. Changing the underlying beliefs that drive a system can lead to widespread and lasting change, making paradigm shifts one of the most effective leverage points in Systems Thinking.</p> 3. Small, incremental changes as leverage&nbsp;points <p>“Of any stopping place in life, it is good to ask whether it will be a good place from which to go on as well as a good place to remain.” — Mary Catherine Bateson</p><p>Small, well-placed actions can serve as powerful leverage points within a system. These might involve slight adjustments in policy, processes, or resource allocation. The key is to identify where these small changes can have a disproportionately large impact, leading to significant shifts in the system without the need for extensive interventions.</p><p>For example, in the context of data privacy, implementing a small but strategic change, such as requiring explicit user consent for data sharing, can have a profound impact. A great example of this is the introduction of GDPR-compliant consent forms across digital platforms in the EU. This seemingly minor policy change has led to a significant increase in user awareness and control over their personal data, contributing to greater trust in online services. The increased transparency and control have demonstrated how a small, well-placed policy change can lead to substantial benefits for both users and organisations, highlighting the power of incremental changes at the right leverage&nbsp;points.</p><p>The success of such small interventions lies in their ability to trigger widespread behavioural changes without the need for drastic overhauls. By carefully identifying and implementing these changes, we can achieve meaningful and lasting impacts across various&nbsp;systems.</p> 4. Communication as a leverage&nbsp;point <p>“We are changed not only by being talked to but also by hearing ourselves talk to others, which is one way of talking to ourselves. More exactly, we are changed by making explicit what we suppose to have been awaiting expression a moment before.” — Geoffrey&nbsp;Vickers</p><p>Communication within a system can serve as a crucial leverage point. The way information is shared and understood can significantly influence the system’s behaviour, impacting everything from decision-making processes to overall system efficiency. Improving communication channels, ensuring transparency, and making sure all stakeholders are heard can lead to more effective decision-making and positive outcomes.</p><p>For instance, in our work at We Are Open Co-op, practicing open communication and transparency is central to our project management approach. By sharing progress, challenges, and decision-making processes openly with all stakeholders, we foster a culture of trust and collaboration. This openness extends to how we handle privacy; by being transparent about how we collect, use, and protect data, we build confidence among our partners and clients. Implementing tools that enable open documentation and communication, such as public repositories or shared workspaces, not only keeps everyone informed but also reinforces accountability and integrity in our practices. This small adjustment in how information is shared and protected can lead to significant improvements in project outcomes, ensuring that tasks are completed effectively while respecting privacy concerns.</p><p>The power of communication as a leverage point lies in its ability to unify and align the various components of a system. By enhancing the flow of information and ensuring that all voices are heard, you can create a more cohesive, responsive, and effective system.</p> 5. Feedback Loops as Leverage&nbsp;Points <p>“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think.” — Gregory&nbsp;Bateson</p><p>Feedback loops, as discussed in the second post, can also act as leverage points within a system. By altering how these loops operate, you can influence the system’s overall behaviour. Identifying and adjusting these loops — whether reinforcing (positive) or balancing (negative) — can be a powerful way to steer the system toward desired outcomes.</p><p>For example, in the context of data privacy, feedback loops between user behaviour and data management practices can be effectively leveraged to enhance privacy protection. By providing users with real-time feedback on how their data is being used and giving them the ability to adjust their privacy settings, you create a positive feedback loop. As users become more aware of how their data is handled, they are often motivated to take greater control over their privacy settings. This increased control leads to further trust in the platform, encouraging users to engage more actively with privacy tools. Over time, this feedback loop can significantly strengthen overall data protection practices, leading to better compliance with regulations and higher user satisfaction.</p><p>This example highlights how adjusting feedback loops can lead to substantial changes in system behaviour with relatively simple interventions. By strategically modifying these loops, you can achieve desired outcomes more effectively and sustainably.</p> Conclusion <p>Leverage points offer powerful opportunities to influence complex systems with relatively small, strategic actions. By identifying where these points lie and understanding how to use them effectively, you can create meaningful and lasting change within any system. Whether you are looking to improve organisational processes, drive social change, or enhance personal decision-making, the principles of Systems Thinking can help you navigate complexity with greater clarity and&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>This post, along with the previous two in this series, provides an introduction to the foundational principles of Systems Thinking and their practical applications. These insights are drawn from my studies toward an MSc in Systems Thinking in Practice through the Open University, and they are just the beginning of what Systems Thinking can&nbsp;offer.</p><p>If you’re interested in applying these principles to your work, We Are Open Co-op is here to help you implement effective systemic interventions tailored to your unique challenges. Thank you for following this series — your journey into Systems Thinking doesn’t have to end here. Continue to explore, apply, and refine these concepts, and watch how they can transform the way you approach complex problems.</p> References   Ackoff, R.L. (1974).

 Dear OpenID Foundation Members,<p></p>
 
 
 
 A subgroup of OpenID Foundation board members and key staff have been working to update the “OpenID Process” document based on issues raised by some board members to ensure the document aligns with how the Foundation currently works. This update addresses those original issues and also identified a significant number of mainly editorial issues and improvements that were possible. It also highlighted inconsistencies and&nbsp;other issues that required coordinating revisions&nbsp;with the “Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy,” so that has been added to the scope and improvements proposed. 
 
 
 The changes were unanimously approved&nbsp;by the board at the September 12, 2024 board meeting. Approving these changes also requires a 21-day review and 14-day vote of the membership. 
 
 
 <br>Process Document Material Changes 
 
 
 Throughout the document addition to include the intended “, and Final Specifications Incorporating Errata Corrections” in the various clauses of artifact 
 Addition of 4 new defined terms for clarity “Non-Core Decision”, “Core Decision”, “Quorum Requirement”, “Substantive Change” 
 Updated definition of “Specifications Council” and edit of Section 2 to address Specs Council membership requirements 
 Moved the descriptions of elements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 into “Table 1 – Work Group Decision points” 
 Table 2 – Re-drafting for clarity the decision options for Inter-WG Core decision and updated the Quorum requirement to be more realistic “20% of the Active Contributors to the applicable WG or 20 Contributors to the applicable WG, whichever is lower.” 
 Sections 4.4, 4.7, 4.10 replace “will promptly be submitted to a vote of the OIDF membership” with “will promptly be submitted for a Supermajority confirmation vote of the Board” 
 Section 4.8 adds “Work Group Repositories” to places where “work of a WG will be conducted” 
 Section 4.8 updates “WG documents” to “Implementers Drafts, Final Specifications, and Final Specifications Incorporating Errata Corrections” 
 Section 4.10 (and corresponding part of Table 2) defines WG meeting quorum and Intra-WG non-core as at least six Contributors 
 Section 5.1 is redrafted to reflect the real stages of the Specification approval process and to make it clearer 
 
 
 <br>IPR Policy Material Changes 
 
 
 Throughout the document addition to include the intended “, and Final Specifications Incorporating Errata Corrections” in the various clauses 
 Addition of “Table 1: Overview of IPR applicability” – This is intended to help the reader comprehend the rest of the document and to which document types the rights and obligations apply 
 Addition of the defined term “Errata corrections” 
 Addition of the defined term “Final Specification Incorporating Errata Corrections” 
 Significant re-draft to the definition of “Specification” 
 Addition of the defined term “Work Group Draft” 
 Re-organisation of section “V. Copyrights” to improve the clarity and to be much clearer about the two artifact types and which rights and obligations apply to each. 
 Addition of a new paragraph entitles “(b) License” which explains the license that the OIDF grants to others

 Since announcing their partnership at Bitcoin Nashville, Elastos and Particle Network have quickly reached a key milestone in simplifying user onboarding. 
 Developers can now build dApps that make it easier for Web2 users to get started, expanding adoption. 
 
<p>Singapore September 12th 2024 – Elastos, a SmartWeb ecosystem provider, today announced that Particle Network, an L1 blockchain aggregator, has integrated the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) Mainnet. This marks the first major milestone since their partnership announcement at Bitcoin Nashville 2024. The development allows users to interact with Elastos decentralized applications (dApps) using familiar Web2 logins, like Google, for a smoother onboarding experience. This step helps Elastos developers attract Web2 users to their dApps, opening new opportunities for revenue.</p>
<p>By simplifying the typically complex blockchain onboarding process, users can now engage with Elastos dApps without needing crypto wallets, seed phrase management, or paying gas fees. For example, a user can log in with a Bitcoin wallet to take out a stablecoin loan using collateralized Bitcoin via Elastos’ <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>. This funding can be used immediately on the <a href="https://docs.ela.city/">Elacity</a> marketplace without needing <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elacity-partners-with-particle-network/">ELA for gas</a>, as those fees are covered automatically in the background. This makes the process more convenient while retaining the benefits of decentralization, including control over personal data, direct peer-to-peer interactions, and strong security and integrity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ability to hide complexity from users is a strategic driver for Elastos. By working with Particle Network, Elastos can simplify the process for users to interact with decentralized applications and BTC-backed services. This complements the work it has been doing with the BeL2 protocol to keep Bitcoin secure on its main network using zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions and transfer collateral information across chains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pengyu Wang, Particle Network’s Founder, describes Particle Network’s effort toward simplifying the Web3 user experience as a major milestone in making Web3 experiences a part of everyday life.</p>
<p>“Web3 has introduced a wide array of blockchains and protocols that developers and users need to manage. Simplification is essential to improving this experience, enabling users to have a single, unified on-chain address and balance across various blockchains,” said Wang.</p>
<p>“Our mainnet launch in collaboration with Elastos reflects our shared vision of making it easier for developers and users to build and experience Web3 services.”</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves, Elastos’s Global Head of Growth, explained that, to truly rival Web2 in terms of adoption, one of the key milestones for Web3 is making it easy to interact with a dApp.</p>
<p>“The significance of this announcement is the simplicity that Particle Network brings to the table allowing multiple technologies to deliver a Web3 experience in an environment that will feel exactly the same as any current social media or sharing app, all assured by the World’s most ubiquitous, popular and integral decentralized currency through Elastos’ BeL2 protocol,” continued Jonathan.</p>
<p>Elastos’ <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a> protocol enables users to operate easily using Bitcoin – as if they were operating in a purely native Bitcoin environment – without actually impacting the BTC layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Building out a robust ecosystem around the BeL2 protocol with partners like Particle Network will be key to enabling a new economic model based around Native Bitcoin. At Token 2049, we will be hosting an event at RWA which will further demonstrate how working with our partners we will enable developers to build a whole new range of decentralized finance, music and entertainment applications.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Elastos</p>
<p>Elastos is a public blockchain project that integrates blockchain technology with a suite of reimagined platform components to produce a modern Internet infrastructure that provides intrinsic protection for privacy and digital asset ownership.

<p>The Elastos SmartWeb platform enables organizations to recalibrate how the Internet works for them to better control their own data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Particle Network</p>
<p>Particle Network is addressing Web3’s fragmentation of users and liquidity through Universal Accounts. Particle’s chain abstraction is powered by a Cosmos SDK L1 blockchain enabling the experience of a single account, balance, and address that can be used across all chains, allowing users to interact with any dApp and pay gas with any token.</p>

<p>In decentralised finance (DeFi), Bitcoin has always been the gold standard for financial security. But despite its dominance, Bitcoin’s potential has remained somewhat locked—until now. BeL2, an <a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos SmartWeb</a> technology, is unlocking the full power of Bitcoin, transforming it from a store of value into a platform for decentralised finance, smart contracts, and more, all while protecting Bitcoin’s integrity without changing it. With <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>, Bitcoin holders can fully participate in decentralised finance without ever leaving the safety of the Bitcoin mainnet. No custodians, no middlemen, no need to trust centralised entities. This is financial freedom without compromise.</p>
 Freedom and Empowerment: A New Bretton Woods 
<p>BeL2 represents the next phase of Bitcoin’s evolution. Much like the <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-new-bretton-woods-system/">Bretton Woods agreement</a> once set the foundation for a global financial system based on gold, BeL2 positions Bitcoin at the heart of a new decentralised economy. This time, it’s digital. With BeL2, Bitcoin can now be the anchor of a financial system that is decentralised, secure, and untouchable. BeL2 isn’t just about tech—it’s about escaping the traditional financial system, and the $305 trillion <a href="https://elastos.info/news/global-debt-crises-bel2-solution/">global debt crises</a>. For those exhausted by inflation and the limitations and risks of centralised systems, BeL2 offers true financial independence beyond a store of value. The days of being tied to banks or institutions are over. With BeL2, Bitcoin holders can borrow, lend, and trade fiat in BTC-backed finance, in a completely decentralised way.</p>
<p></p>
 Bitcoin’s Second Layer for Real-World Use 
<p>BeL2 keeps Bitcoin exactly where it belongs—on the Bitcoin network. BeL2 is Bitcoin’s second layer for real-world use, allowing users to unlock smart contracts and decentralised applications (DApps) without having to move their Bitcoin off-chain. This is decentralised finance without custodians, allowing you to use Bitcoin to its full potential without sacrificing security. Want to borrow against your Bitcoin? BeL2 makes that easy. Need to lend your Bitcoin to earn interest? BeL2 has that covered. And all this happens while your Bitcoin remains safe on the Bitcoin network, free from custodial risks. No more relying on middlemen—you are in full control of your assets. <a href="https://scan.bel2.org/">BeL2 uses advanced zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology</a> to ensure that Bitcoin stays secure on the native chain while talking with other blockchains which execute smart applications. This makes Bitcoin unstoppable, offering a secure way to participate in decentralised finance without ever moving your Bitcoin off its native chain. For Bitcoin maximalists, this is a dream come true: full DeFi functionality without any compromise on security and, most importantly, <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-new-bretton-woods-system/">no wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeL2 is about real people taking back control of their financial future. Take Alice, a Bitcoin holder who wants to <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">borrow against her Bitcoin</a> without third-party platforms holding her Bitcoin or the fear of liquidation. With BeL2, she can execute business peer-to-peer with lenders—without her BTC ever leaving the Bitcoin network or relying on a centralized entity, instead using Bitcoin miner-secured locking scripts. Or think of Bob, a developer who’s always wanted to build decentralised apps but was concerned about the security of other platforms. With BeL2, Bob can build on Bitcoin, knowing he’s operating on the most secure blockchain in the world. These are not just rumours. These are stories of freedom and empowerment—stories that show how BeL2 is enabling individuals to take back control of their financial future. BeL2 is giving people the tools to build a better, decentralised world backed by Bitcoin.</p>
<p></p>
 Escape from the Traditional Financial System 
<p>People are losing faith in traditional financial systems. From banking crises to inflation, the old systems are failing. BeL2 is the solution, offering freedom from the limitations of centralised systems. With BeL2, you can participate in a decentralised economy that runs on Bitcoin—the most secure and trusted blockchain in the world. Bitcoin has long been viewed as a store of value, but BeL2 takes it further, turning Bitcoin into a financial powerhouse, a new financial order. Through BeL2, Bitcoin can now be used for smart contracts, DeFi, and more—all while staying safely on the Bitcoin mainnet. This makes BeL2 the foundation for a new financial system—one that is decentralised, secure, and independent from traditional control.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, it’s clear that BeL2 is more than just a tool—it’s the gateway to financial freedom. BeL2 is unleashing the full power of Bitcoin, giving individuals the power to take control of their finances in a truly decentralised way. Whether you’re a developer, an investor, or just someone looking for a way to protect your assets in a changing world, BeL2 is here to offer the solution. Enjoyed this article?

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation is at the forefront of innovating standards and technologies for decentralized digital identity. Today, we're excited to announce the launch of two new work items within our <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>, aimed at improving the functionality and security of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markus-sabadello-353a0821?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Markus Sabadello</a>, Founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://danubetech.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DanubeTech</a>, DIF Steering Committee member, and Co-Chair of the ID &amp; Discovery WG, emphasizes the importance of these new initiatives: </p><blockquote>"The I&amp;D WG recognizes that identifiers will always be the foundation of any digital identity system. For this reason, I am excited about the two latest work items in our working group - DID Traits and Trust DID Web. Both will be extraordinarily useful in our continued quest to build strong and useful identifier systems that other technologies and protocols can rely on."</blockquote> DID Traits <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcebersbach/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">JC Ebersbach</a>, CEO of <a href="https://identinet.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">identinet GmbH</a> and newly-added Co-Chair of the ID &amp; Discovery WG, initiated the <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-traits/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DID Traits work item</a>. DID Traits focuses on helping implementers choose the most appropriate DID method for their specific use cases.</p><p>Key aspects of the DID Traits work item include:</p>  Identifying and defining key traits of identifiers that have proven significant  Providing a JSON schema for DID method authors to present their method's characteristics in a structured, machine-readable format  Enabling third-party systems, such as DID resolvers, to utilize this structured information effectively  <p>The DID Traits work builds upon existing literature and specifications in the field, aiming to streamline the process of DID method selection and implementation.</p><p>JC shares his motivation behind the DID Traits initiative:</p><blockquote>"The introduction of Trust DID Web (did:tdw) at IIW 39 inspired me to initiate the DID Traits work item. I’m thrilled that both initiatives have been adopted by the ID &amp; Discovery working group. My aim is to provide implementers with simple, practical tools that will lead to more widespread integration of Self-Sovereign Identity technologies. With DID Traits, we aim to simplify the process of selecting the most appropriate DID method for specific use cases, making adoption easier and more effective."</blockquote> Trust DID Web <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-w-curran/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Stephen Curran</a>, Founder of <a href="https://cloudcompass.ca/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Cloud Compass Computing</a> and Chair of the <a href="https://sovrin.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Sovrin Foundation</a> Board of Trustees, leads the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Trust DID Web work item</a>. This initiative introduces the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trustdidweb/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:tdw method specification</a> as an enhancement to the existing <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:web method</a>. </p><p>Key features of Trust DID Web DIDs include:</p>  Ongoing publication of all DID Document versions  A verifiable chain of updates from genesis to deactivation  Self-certifying identifiers for DIDs, enabling portability  Signed proofs for DID Document updates  Optional mechanisms for pre-rotation keys and collaborating witnesses  Standardized DID URL path handling  A "/whois" path for returning a verifiable presentation about the DID  <p>Trust DID Web aims to provide greater trust and security while maintaining the simplicity of did:web, fostering a more trusted and secure web environment for decentralized digital identities.</p><p>Stephen Curran explains the goals of the Trust DID Web initiative:</p><blockquote>"I’m happy to lead the new Trust DID Web (did:tdw) initiative at DIF. Our goal is to enhance did:web with important security and verifiability features from the world of ledger-based DIDs, while keeping the simplicity that makes web-based DIDs so accessible. These improvements are designed to boost trust and security without adding complexity. We think that did:tdw provides a solid foundation for decentralized digital identities that are secure and easy to deploy for a variety of applications."</blockquote> Join Us <p>We invite everyone to join us in these exciting new initiatives. As Markus Sabadello notes, "We welcome anyone to our working group who would like to contribute to these new work items, or propose any other identifier-related topic."</p><p>Both meetings are bi-weekly:</p>  DID Traits on Tuesdays at 8:00 Pacific / 17:00 Central Europe  Trust DID Web on Thursdays at 9:00 Pacific / 18:00 Central Europe  <p>To participate in these and other DIF work items:</p><p>👉 <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Join DIF</a><br>📆 Subscribe to the <a href="http://bit.ly/dif-calendar?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Calendar</a><br>📧 Contact <a href="mailto:membership@identity.foundation">membership@identity.foundation</a> with questions</p><p>Stay tuned for updates as we progress with these important work items that will shape the future of decentralized identity.</p>

 What to Do When Your User Research Project Starts to Veer Off&nbsp;Course <p>User research is a journey, and like any journey, it doesn’t always go exactly as planned. We’ve written previously about <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/demystifying-user-research-e345d309abab">starting your own user research journey</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/key-questions-for-user-research-design-5edfab6046dd">questions to ask</a> that can help get you off on the right&nbsp;foot.</p><p>Sometimes though, despite all best intentions and diligent planning with your chosen selection of <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/pre-mortem/">pre-mortems</a>, checklists, Gantt charts, or Kanban boards, a user research project can still go off&nbsp;course.</p><p>There are many reasons why this might happen, and many may seem well beyond your control. In this post, we’ll share some strategies we’ve found helpful in regaining momentum and getting a project back on&nbsp;track.</p> Common Issues in User&nbsp;Research cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a><p>Before we explore solutions, it’s important to recognise some of the issues that can derail a user research&nbsp;project.</p>  Unclear Objectives<br>Without a clear understanding of what you want to find out, your project can quickly lose focus. For example, if you’re researching a digital tool’s usability but haven’t defined whether you’re focusing on ease of navigation, visual design, or performance, you may end up collecting feedback that’s too broad or irrelevant. This can lead to scattered efforts and data that doesn’t fully answer the questions you initially set out to explore. Clarity in your objectives also helps you stay within scope — after all, projects that become too complex or overly broad can be difficult to&nbsp;manage.  Recruitment Challenges<br>Finding the right participants is crucial, but sometimes, despite your best efforts, recruitment doesn’t go as planned. You may find that a particular community or demographic is underrepresented or face difficulty finding enough respondents due to limited access or poor engagement. This can delay your project and result in a participant pool that’s not as diverse or representative as it needs to&nbsp;be.  External Dependencies<br>Often, research projects rely on external factors like stakeholder input, third-party data, or collaboration with other teams. For example, you could be relying on receiving data from a partner organisation or feedback from a legal team before being able to proceed. When these dependencies fall through, your project can come to a standstill.   Strategies to Get Back on&nbsp;Track cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a><p>Now that we’ve identified some common issues, let’s look at how you can regain momentum and steer your project back on&nbsp;course.</p>  Revisit and Refine Objectives<br>If your project is losing direction, it might be time to revisit your initial objectives. What is the overarching research question you’re trying to answer? Is your objective still relevant? Do they need to be refined based on what you’ve learned so far? Narrowing or reaffirming your focus can help streamline your efforts and ensure that the data you collect is meaningful and actionable.  Simplify Your Scope<br>If you’ve taken on more than you can manage, don’t hesitate to simplify your project’s scope. Focus on the most critical questions and the areas that will have the greatest impact. It’s better to complete a smaller, focused project successfully than to stretch resources too thin across a larger, unfocused one.  Adapt Your Recruitment Approach<br>When recruitment isn’t going as planned, consider adapting your approach. If your initial outreach didn’t yield the desired results, explore alternative channels or adjust your criteria. Techniques like reaching out through community organisations or leveraging existing networks can help you connect with a broader range of participants while maintaining diversity and inclusivity.  Adjust Your Methods<br>If certain methods aren’t yielding results, be flexible and try different approaches. For example, if individual interviews aren’t providing the depth of insight you need, consider adding focus groups? The ability to adjust and adapt is a strength in user research.  Communicate and Realign with Stakeholders<br>If external dependencies are causing delays, clear communication is key. Communicate with stakeholders regularly to identify any roadblocks and realign expectations. Perhaps your pre-mortem <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/pre-mortem/">foresaw some of the issues that have emerged and have a plan to mitigate already in place</a>? Sometimes, simply clarifying timelines or adjusting deadlines can help get things moving&nbsp;again.  Refresh the Team<br>If a project is dragging on and fatigue is setting in, prioritise tasks based on their impact and feasibility. Reassign team members or bring in extra help if possible.

A Principal Engineer at <a href="https://www.dentity.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dentity</a>, Moises is at the forefront of decentralized identity technology with expertise in Web3/Web5, Decentralized Web Nodes, distributed architectures, and in general a broad range of SSI tech. Moises is also a previous winner of the DID:Hack Contest and TBD’s Hackathon.&nbsp;</p><p>Moises’ work at Dentity is pushing the boundaries of digital identity, as evidenced by <a href="https://decrypt.co/245677/ens-labs-partners-with-dentity-to-advance-real-world-credentials-for-web3?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dentity’s recent groundbreaking partnership with ENS Labs</a>. Moises's expertise makes him an ideal guide to help us understand the future of digital identity in both Web2, Web3, and Web5 spaces.</p><p>Your career spans a broad range of software development. What specifically drew you to decentralized identity, and how has it shaped your professional journey?</p><p>I've been in software development for almost 30 years, mostly on the Microsoft stack. Around the mid-2010s, while working for a digital audience measurement company, I realized how data was being commoditized, often without people's awareness. This commoditization was rewarding the wrong parties - data brokers and middlemen.</p><p>Reading <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Who-Owns-the-Future/Jaron-Lanier/9781451654974?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Jason Lanier's book "Who Owns the Future"</a> cemented my thinking that this model was broken. Then in 2017, I discovered Ethereum and its programmable nature. I participated in a hackathon sponsored by Consensys, addressing the opioid epidemic. Our team won second place for a project tokenizing painkiller prescriptions on the blockchain.</p><p>The idea was to represent prescriptions as entries in a smart contract, allowing pharmacists to verify the authenticity of the prescription and the doctor's signature. This would prevent the abuse of paper prescriptions across state lines, which was a significant problem, especially in areas like D.C., Maryland, and Virginia.</p><p>This experience led me to explore blockchain in healthcare, which is how I discovered self-sovereign identity (SSI). I started working with Hyperledger Indy and eventually joined Lumedic, a pioneering SSI company. We worked on issuing COVID vaccine credentials during the pandemic.</p><p>After Lumedic was acquired, I continued with SSI, joining DIF as an independent contributor. I worked on the secure storage group, where I learned everything about decentralized web nodes, and I think they’re amazing. All these experiences ultimately led me to my current role at Dentity.</p><p>You were a winner in the DID:Hack contest and TBD’s Hackathon. Could you share a key insight from that experience, and perhaps offer advice for participants in DIF's upcoming hackathon?</p><p>For the DID:Hack contest, I focused on exploring Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), which were in their early stages. I saw the hackathon as an opportunity to prove whether this technology actually worked in a controlled environment. I learned that DWNs were more capable than many realized - they were pretty darn good, and almost ready for production. Winning the contest was exciting, but the real value was in the learning experience.</p><p>My advice for future hackathon participants:</p>  Go wild with your ideas! There's no fear of failure in a hackathon. Worst case is you learn a lot. So push yourself beyond your comfort zone.  Treating deadlines as mission-critical helps maintain discipline and simulate real-life situations.  Have fun! Hackathons are designed to be enjoyable learning experiences.  Leverage the resources provided by the organizers – they're there to help you succeed.  <p>What brought you to Dentity, and how does your role there align with your vision for decentralized identity?</p><p>I met Dentity through TBD contacts. What drew me was their approach to solving real-world problems, particularly in identity verification. During my time at Lumedic, I realized the critical need for identity verification services, especially in healthcare where compliance with regulations like HIPAA is crucial.</p><p>Throughout my SSI career, I consistently encountered the challenge of ensuring that the person we're dealing with is who they claim to be. Dentity offers a valuable service that addresses this problem directly, so joining was a no-brainer.</p><p>What I love about Dentity is the energy and pragmatism in bringing real solutions to market. Earlier in my SSI career, I was more dogmatic about fully decentralized technologies. Now, I've become more pragmatic, recognizing the need to balance ideals with practical implementation.</p><p>This perspective aligns perfectly with Dentity's approach. We focus on solving immediate problems while abstracting away the nuances and complexities of SSI and decentralized technologies. This strategy is especially effective when working with traditional Web2.0 businesses.</p><p>The Dentity-ENS Labs partnership aims to bring real-world identities on chain. Could you explain the significance of this for both everyday users and the broader decentralized ecosystem?</p><p>ENS offers an interesting service in the Web3 world. The Web3 community values privacy and anonymity, so a public profile that broadcasts information feels like it's against that ethos. At the same time, establishing trust in transactions is essential. By integrating Dentity's identity verification with ENS profiles, we're giving users a higher degree of certainty about who they're transacting with.</p><p>I’ll give you a practical example. There was a major crypto scam where hackers created a deep fake video of Elon Musk saying that he would send crypto to anyone that sent ether to an address. That scammed people out of millions of dollars in crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, if users had the ability to check addresses against a verified identity, they would have known it wasn't really Elon's address. In general, the idea is that this could reduce the number of similar scams in the future.</p><p>How does the Dentity-ENS integration empower users to control their digital identity? Could you walk us through a practical scenario that illustrates this?</p><p>Users need to own an ENS profile and authenticate with their wallet against ENS. They're then given the choice to verify their social accounts. A button routes them to our Dentity profile, where we've integrated several workflows.</p><p>One optional workflow is our full IDV process, which issues a proof of personhood credential to their public ENS profile. Currently, we only support full KYC, but we're planning to enable a biometric check without government documents in the future. This aligns with the Web3 ethos, as many users distrust sharing official documents.</p><p>Once the workflow is complete, the user chooses how much information to share with ENS. This creates a "long-lived token" that resides on-chain. The user pays for gas, and ENS has modified their code to leverage this token. When someone views the ENS profile, it invokes our API to retrieve only the information the user consented to share publicly.</p><p>Dentity utilizes self-sovereign identity standards like W3C Verifiable Credentials and DIDs. For our more technical readers, can you offer us a deep-dive into how the ENS integration works? And more generally, what tangible benefits does this offer to end-users?</p><p>Dentity adopts standards from W3C, DIF, and OpenID Foundation, including DIDs, verifiable credentials, and OpenID Connect for verifiable presentations. We approached ENS integration similarly to a typical relying party or verifier, modifying our protocol to enable integration.</p><p>We couldn't store the verifiable presentation on-chain due to PII concerns and gas prices. Instead, we store a small string on-chain as a reference. This approach offers the best of both worlds: users can disclose PII if they choose, while we guard that information from being stored directly on-chain.</p><p>The benefits to end users include enhanced trust and counterparty verification. For example, in transactions through ENS, we enable trust because users can verify who they're dealing with. It provides full consent and control over shared information, essentially creating counterparty trust.</p><p>This partnership has potential to expand blockchain use cases beyond cryptocurrency. What are some compelling non-financial applications of decentralized identity that you envision this enabling?</p><p>While DeFi is obviously a major beneficiary, we're seeing interesting applications emerge in other areas:</p>  DAO Governance: There's growing interest in using this technology for voting in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. It can help ensure they're not dealing with Sybil attacks or bots trying to manipulate DAO governance.  Content Authenticity and Provenance: This could be leveraged for verifying the authenticity and origin of content, particularly on social media platforms. If you're distributing content on Twitter, whether it's politically charged or aimed at combating scams, you can check for the provenance of these tweets. This helps ensure the content really belongs to a person and not a disinformation bot trying to skew elections or change opinions.  <p>In your view, what are the most significant challenges in achieving widespread adoption of decentralized identity solutions, and how is Dentity positioning itself to address these?</p><p>To paraphrase <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-alan-schwartz/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Jeffrey [Schwartz, CEO of Dentity]</a>, we have the technology, sound protocols, and emerging trust registries. The challenge now is being pragmatic and choosing the right problems to solve. Not everything is solvable through SSI, so we must carefully assess whether this technology fits a particular problem.</p><p>Dentity addresses this by targeting traditional Web2.0 businesses, which hold the largest market share. We use familiar technologies like OpenID Connect for verifiable presentations, making it easier for these businesses to integrate our solutions. We abstract SSI's complexity to focus on practical solutions to real-world problems.</p><p>In my previous SSI experiences, convincing enterprises to adopt was difficult because it required understanding new protocols, mediators, and agents. It wasn't practical to address their problems with these technologies then. At Dentity, we've scaled back, allowing for gradual adoption. We don't lead with "we do SSI," but rather with solving problems without the SSI complexity.</p><p>Looking ahead, what emerging trends or technologies in decentralized identity do you find most promising, and why?</p><p>While there are exciting technological developments like proof of personhood, fully homomorphic encryption, and zero-knowledge proofs, I'm most excited about the regulatory landscape. Regulators are increasingly forcing companies to comply with data privacy acts, which is driving innovation in the SSI space.</p><p>For example, the European eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) regulation is spurring competition among SSI companies to offer the best solutions. In the U.S., although moving at a slower pace, traditional big data companies are beginning to realize that the massive amounts of data they hold are a liability. This realization is pushing them to explore what the SSI community has to offer.</p><p>These regulatory pressures are the engine that's going to force us to create standards and companies to comply with those standards. It's about more than just technology - whether you love it or hate it, we need regulations to drive adoption and interoperability in the decentralized identity space.</p>

<p>Centralised, trust-based models have long controlled the financial and digital ecosystems, dependent on intermediaries and gatekeepers to manage transactions, assets, and user data. These traditional structures rely heavily on the belief that these entities will act in our best interest, whether safeguarding money or handling personal information. Yet, with the advent of blockchain technology, a significant shift is underway, as we move away from reliance on trust and into an era defined by verifiable truth.</p>
<p>Blockchain introduces an entirely new framework where transparency, security, and control are embedded directly into the system. It presents a distributed ledger that records all transactions in a way that cannot be altered or hidden, providing a level of accountability that was previously impossible. This shift has allowed for a more decentralised approach, removing the need for intermediaries and enabling individuals to take control of their assets and information.</p>
<p>This transition is not limited to finance. The <a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos SmartWeb</a> represents the next step, where the entire internet can operate in a decentralised way, putting the user in charge. Rather than simply applying blockchain to financial systems, Elastos builds on this foundation to decentralise the web itself. Through the SmartWeb, users can control their identities, data, and digital interactions without needing to trust centralised authorities.</p>
 Escaping Centralised Systems and the Compliance Mindset 
<p></p>
<p>In the current economy, many people are stuck in a cycle where they rely on their jobs and debt to survive, limiting their ability to take risks or explore new financial opportunities. This mindset creates a sense of dependency and conformity, as individuals prioritise short-term security over long-term growth. The high levels of debt and lack of available cash make it difficult for many to invest in new opportunities, especially those that seem volatile or uncertain, like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>To further add to this <a href="https://elastos.info/news/global-debt-crises-bel2-solution/">global debt crisis</a>, the actions of central banks—such as raising interest rates to curb inflation—have led to mixed outcomes across different segments of the economy. The result has been what many describe as a “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/k-shaped-recovery-5080086#:~:text=W%2DShaped%20Recovery-,What%20Is%20a%20K%2DShaped%20Recovery%3F,industries%2C%20or%20groups%20of%20people.">K-shaped</a>” recovery, where wealthier individuals and institutions benefit from market movements while lower-income groups face mounting financial struggles. This divide has only grown, with many lower-income individuals experiencing significant economic pressure due to increased debt and stagnant wages. The structure of the U.S. financial system, especially its reliance on long-term fixed-rate debt, makes it less responsive to rate changes than other economies. This creates instability, as large movements in capital could shift investment away from U.S. markets and toward other global opportunities if rates are adjusted. In the past, such shifts have led to significant realignments in global economic power.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Blockchain technology, and the Elastos SmartWeb in particular, offer a solution to the challenges posed by the K-shaped recovery. By decentralising finance and ownership, Elastos allows individuals to bypass traditional systems that disproportionately favor the wealthy. Escaping this trust-based mindset requires embracing truth-based tools and platforms that offer more control and independence.</p>
<p>The Elastos SmartWeb provides such tools by decentralising products and allowing individuals to take control of their digital and financial lives. These tools support a mindset of ownership and independence, helping people to break free from the limitations of centralised systems. By creating new opportunities for wealth generation and self-sovereignty, Elastos opens the door to economic freedom and long-term success, reducing the need to rely on systems that exacerbate inequality.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 BeL2: Extending Bitcoin’s Reach 
<p></p>
<p>Bitcoin has been a fundamental driver of the shift from trust-based to truth-based systems. Through its secure, transparent network, Bitcoin has empowered individuals to manage their wealth independently of banks or other financial intermediaries. <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2 (Bitcoin-Elastos Layer 2)</a> extends Bitcoin’s reach by enabling it to interact with smart contracts across different blockchains. This creates a new layer of financial possibilities without removing Bitcoin from its secure foundation.</p>
<p>BeL2 doesn’t just offer financial applications. By connecting Bitcoin with Elastos SmartWeb, BeL2 allows users to integrate Bitcoin’s value into a wide array of decentralised applications. Whether used for <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">decentralised financial services</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://docs.ela.city/">managing digital assets</a>, BeL2 empowers users to connect Bitcoin’s value with decentralised applications and participate in a world where control is truly in their hands.</p>
<p>This expanded capability is crucial for truth-based <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835">decentralised finance (DeFi)</a>. With BeL2, users can engage in financial activities like loans or staking without traditional financial intermediaries. Transparency is embedded in the system, offering a powerful alternative for managing finances. For example, lenders can offer loans with APY directly to Bitcoin holders. Through a transparent ledger, Bitcoin holders can view available loans and collateralise their Bitcoin without bridging to another blockchain, keeping everything secure within Bitcoin’s network. The flow is simple:</p>
 
 Lender offers loan: Lenders list loan terms (APY, collateral, etc.) on the blockchain. 
 Holder collateralises: Bitcoin holders lock collateral directly within BeL2, staying on Bitcoin’s network. 
 Loan execution: Smart contracts handle the loan process automatically and securely. 
 Repayment or liquidation: If repaid, the collateral is returned; otherwise, the collateral is liquidated per the contract. 
 
<p></p>
<p>This allows Bitcoin holders to participate in truth-based DeFi without leaving Bitcoin’s secure ecosystem, and what’s more, provides decentralised nodes with the ability to support transactions and earn income, using the Elastos SmartWebs <a href="https://elastos.info/about/tokenomics/">ELA</a> as collateral to enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The New Player in a Decentralised World 
<p>To succeed in this new financial and digital environment, individuals must adopt a mindset that encourages critical thinking and adaptability. Those who can learn quickly and take calculated risks will be well-positioned to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise. In this decentralised landscape, every individual can become a key player in the emerging digital economy, free from the constraints of centralised control.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elastos SmartWeb empowers users to become more than just participants—they can take control of their online identities, assets, and interactions. With BeL2, Bitcoin’s value can be leveraged not only in financial transactions but in all aspects of the decentralised internet. By integrating decentralised finance with a user-owned web, Elastos allows individuals to become truly independent, capable of navigating the evolving digital world with confidence.

<p>Image sourced from Chat GPT</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is proud to co-host two Hackathons with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in support of their Mobile Drivers License (mDL) pilot.</p>
 What is the Project? 
<p>In 2021, the California legislature authorized the DMV to start an <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/">mDL pilot</a>, and since the launch in August 2023, more than 500K Californians now have access to digital versions of their driving license or ID (“mDLs”).&nbsp; The California pilot will encompass up to 1.5M Californian residents holding a California Driving License or ID Card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is delighted that the California DMV is not only a member of the OpenID Foundation, but that the CA DMV selected <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-sd-jwt-vc-1_0.html#OIDF.OID4VCI">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-sd-jwt-vc-1_0.html#OIDF.OID4VP">OpenID for Verifiable Presentation</a> as a part of their architecture.&nbsp; Co-hosting the California Hackathon was a natural progression of this relationship to ensure the community had support building out use cases and demonstrating the value of digital identity credentials as a public good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first use cases for acceptance of California mDLs have included TSA security checks, proof of age at convenience stores, online login to CA DMV websites, and the ability to present mDLs “peer to peer” between mobile devices. The Hackathons are a mechanism to help a wider set of relying parties to experiment with the technology with the help of community subject matter experts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Hackathons will focus on the capabilities currently enabled by the CA DMV Wallet. However Relying Parties that choose to participate will benefit from market momentum, since <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/08/23/californians-can-now-add-their-mobile-drivers-license-to-google-wallet/">Governor Gavin Newsom’s August announcement</a> that California will enable both Apple and Google Wallets, with Google Wallet launched August 23rd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few of the reasons why the OpenID Foundation applauds the CA DMV’s community-based approach.</p>
 Verifier Benefits 
<p>At the OpenID Foundation, we are committed to supporting ecosystem growth. Any ecosystem struggles with the “Cold Start Problem,” which refers to the struggle to gain traction on all sides of the market (i.e., buyers, sellers, users). In the case of emerging identity standards, the more difficult side of the marketplace tends to be the “Verifiers” – those businesses and entities that need to consume and verify identity information for any number of use cases (often referred to as “Relying Parties”). The Hackathons are laser focused on this problem – actively engaging Verifiers to drive adoption.</p>
<p>You can catch OpenID Foundation Member and Chair of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">Digital Credentials Protocol Working Group</a>, Kristina Yasuda, making this argument (brilliantly, we might add) in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-mainstream-eic24">her keynote</a> at the European Identity and Cloud Conference.</p>
 Simplified Implementation &amp; Optionality 
<p>In order to support a wide range of Verifier use cases, the CA DMV is issuing mDLs in two standardized formats: one that follows the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO 18013-5</a> standard and the other following the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials v1.1 specification</a>. This “Dual Issuance” is invisible to the user but enables Verifiers to, well, verify to the specification that suits their use case. It’s a smart move that enables an ecosystem to grow as the constellation of standards develops. You can find more for developers looking at the CA DMV approach <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/mdl-for-technology-developers/">on their website</a>.</p>
 Wide Range of Participant Types &amp; Use Cases 
<p>Applications have already come in from a wide range of entities and use cases. We have received applications from small and large entities, and a wide range of industry and government verticals and use cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two upcoming Hackathons:</p>
 
 October 1 (Mountain View) will focus on private entities 
 November 1 (Sacramento) will engage government Verifiers in California, the US Government, and (potentially) other governments 
 
<p>Applications for the private sector event on October 1st are now closed, but stay tuned for more news on Participants and their use cases! Applications for the government event are <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/mdl-for-technology-developers/hackathons-2024/">still open, and will be accepted through September 11th</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Public-Private Collaboration 
<p>Another reason we are proud and excited to be a part of this project with the CA DMV is the example it sets for public-private engagement and community-wide support. Some participants will be experts and others will be completely new to the technology. By creating a safe, vendor-neutral environment, government and private entities alike can collaborate more easily with global experts such as non-profits, standards bodies, and trade associations. They can efficiently gather the information needed to build a minimum viable product, demonstrate its value, and share those insights with executives, partners, officials, compliance experts, and any of their stakeholders. These are tangible steps towards a production implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 The OpenID Community 
<p>Finally, this initiative is great for the OpenID Foundation community. Hackathon participants have not been announced as yet, but rest assured that members of our community are heavily represented. The strong representation of OIDF members is in part because of the <a href="https://www.openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance and OpenID for Verifiable Presentation specs</a> in the California architecture, an architecture that also closely mirrors the European Commission’s Architectural Reference Framework. &nbsp; Events like these Hackathons, also help ensure that OpenID Foundation workgroups and other standards bodies benefit&nbsp; from implementors rolling out the specifications, and sometimes providing feedback to help mature the underlying specifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation is just one entity proud to offer its support to the Hackathon participants, to help them achieve success with the use case(s) that matter to them.&nbsp; We hope to see these Hackathons play a meaningful role to help early adopters cross the chasm and accelerate their speed to market.&nbsp; We would like to thank the CA DMV for inviting the OIDF and other community experts into this process, helping to improve our standards, and help mature the entire ecosystem along the way!&nbsp;</p>

 The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

<p>Singapore: September 03, 2024 – Elastos is joining forces with <a href="https://yeloplay.xyz/">YeloPlay</a>, a Web3 ecosystem for creators to distribute and monetize their content, to make a compendium of Indian and Sri Lankan soundtracks, film scores, and hits available through Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Through the partnership, YeloPlay’s catalogue of original work will be converted into individual ‘<a href="https://escription.io/tokens">EScriptions</a>’ enabling them to be accessed, distributed and, even, traded directly in Bitcoin. Elastos’ EScriptions enable Bitcoin-denominated smart contracts to be generated at a fraction of the cost of alternative and importantly – since the Bitcoin remains untouched and on the BTC network throughout the process – resulting contracts enjoy all the security and integrity of any ‘native’ Bitcoin transaction.</p>
<p>YeloPlay’s back catalogue includes material from some of Sri Lanka’s most famous artists such as Roshan de Silva, Mariazel Goonathilaka, Nalin Perera, Mike De Zilva, Shane Vincent, and Joel Fernando; curated for both local and export markets</p>
<p></p>
<p>The partnership is being marked by a live performance at this year’s <a href="https://www.asia.token2049.com/tickets">Token 2049</a> in Singapore, which itself will be recorded and subsequently registered and accessible to fans via an EScription.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MikeDeZilva?t=gr0B5293Ps8lb_PidF3C7g&amp;s=09">Mike de Zilva</a>, Founder and CEO of YeloPlay, describes eScriptions not only as the future of music royalties but of a deeper relationship between artists and their audiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“EScriptions represent the perfect vehicle, not just to make music available, directly on the artist’s terms, but to establish deeper and more exclusive relationship with audiences.&nbsp; EScriptions offer the possibility of sharing and protecting, for instance, early releases, re-mixes, even, personalized versions according to a criteria of an artist’s choosing,” says Mike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For instance, an artist could choose to specifically recognize long term fans, or new ones; those who have attended a recent movie or concert; or those how have contributed in some other manner.&nbsp; BTC-denominated Smart Contracts – EScriptions – offer a way to, not just distribute, but build these types of relationships at scale.”</p>
<p>This partnership will also be supported by <a href="https://beatfarm.io/">BeatFarm</a>, a Web3 platform which helps to put musicians and artists in control of their work, who they work with and how the resulting work is monetized. Through the collaboration, artists will have direct and secure access to all aspects of the music ecosystem – from composition and production, to merchandising and promotion as well as genuine ‘superfans.’&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, the goal is to have a direct integration with Bitcoin-backed EScriptions for music inscriptions or finance using Elastos’ recently launched <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-bel2-bitcoin-layer-2-solution/">BeL2</a> technology. This will enable direct denomination in Bitcoin since the process doesn’t require bridging, wrapping or otherwise interfering with the Bitcoin layer. This will assure the security and integrity of the currency, while avoiding network congestion and additional fees that would otherwise result, allowing users to establish Smart Contracts on their own terms and remunerated direct in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jonathan Hargreaves, Elastos’ Global Head of Growth, emphasizes that throughout the process, the Bitcoin integrity remains uncompromised since – unlike bridging or wrapping alternatives – through the principle of “no cross-chain assets, only cross-chain information – the Bitcoin network remains absolutely untouched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The ability to stake native Bitcoin – without interfering or compromising any of its fundamentals – makes the possibility of a truly decentralized economy a reality. Our partnership with YeloPlay demonstrates how this new model can create and distribute value in completely new and innovative ways. What’s at stake – literally – is the possibility of unlocking up to $1.3 trillion of otherwise ‘dormant’ Bitcoin and putting it to use,” says Jonathan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The entertainment, art and cultural sectors will be some of the first to benefit from such news models which will create opportunities to – not just deploy and monetize content or experiences – but create entirely new relationships with audiences.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership will be inaugurated on 19 September at the Asia On-chain RWA, DePIN &amp; DAO <a href="https://lu.ma/aw0flgk4">side event</a> including a live performance by YeloPlay’s first Web3 artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  🚀 Decentralized Identity Foundation News 
 Personhood Credentials <p>DIF is proud to announce its contribution to a groundbreaking paper on "<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Personhood Credentials</a>" (PHCs), authored by researchers from prestigious institutions including OpenAI, Harvard, and MIT. This collaboration underscores the critical importance of new approaches in addressing online human-AI distinction challenges. The paper proposes PHCs as a privacy-preserving solution, with requirements aligning closely with DIF's long-standing work on Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity standards. This recognition from leading organizations validates DIF's approach and highlights the urgent need for new approaches based on decentralized identity as AI risks grow.

<p>Most of us today are accustomed to unlocking our smartphones with a simple glance or touch. In the blink of the tech industry’s eye, biometric authentication has quickly become a normal part of our daily lives.</p>



<p>Consumers love the convenience and security of biometrics, which has helped propel its growth and mainstream adoption. In the FIDO Alliance’s last global <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/barometer-2023/">barometer survey</a>, biometrics ranked top as the most secure and the preferred way to log in by consumers.</p>



<p>But for biometrics to continue its success, there is a reputation issue and ‘elephant in the room’ that is holding back consumers, governments, and other implementers alike from full trust and confidence: bias.</p>



 Are biometric technologies biased? 



<p>Concerns have been circulating for some time about the accuracy of biometric systems in processing diverse demographics. In the UK in 2021, for example, Uber drivers from diverse ethnic backgrounds took <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/ex-uber-driver-takes-legal-action-over-racist-face-recognition-software">legal action</a> over claims its software had illegally terminated their contracts as its software was unable to recognize them.</p>



<p>In the FIDO Alliance’s recent study, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/remote-identity-verification-biometric-systems-consumer-insights-2024">Remote ID Verification – Bringing Confidence to Biometric Systems Consumer Insights 2024</a>, consumers made clear that they are concerned about bias in biometric facial verification systems.</p>



<p>While over half of respondents indicated they believe face biometrics can accurately identify individuals (56%), others in the survey report a different experience.&nbsp;</p>







<p>A quarter of respondents felt they had been discriminated against by biometric face verification systems (25%).</p>







<p>Organizations like NIST have been closely<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software"> monitoring</a> the disparities in bias performance for some time – with NIST’s most recent <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_demographics.html">evaluation</a> ​​of solutions across different demographics released this year. The headline is: Not all biometric systems are created equal.</p>



<p>As face verification has become adopted globally, the accuracy in identifying diverse demographics has gone from weakness to strength, with most leading solutions today operating with extremely small margins of error. However, less sophisticated solutions do exist and are perpetuating a far bigger reputational and adoption challenge.</p>



 Inclusivity and accessibility in remote identity 



<p>Inclusivity is just one part of the problem. Bias impacts the entire user experience and erodes faith in the technology overall. Half of American and British consumers in the survey said they would <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-addresses-accuracy-bias-in-remote-biometric-identity-verification-technologies-industry-first-testing-certification-program/">lose trust</a> in a brand or institution if it were found to have a biased biometric system, and 22% would stop using the service entirely.</p>







<p>Remote identity solutions unlock huge benefits for governments, organizations, and consumers alike. Consider already how many more scenarios where we are asked to prove who we are virtually today – starting a new job, opening a bank account, signing legal documents. And, as outlined earlier, we know consumers already love using biometrics – 48% of those we surveyed preferred biometrics to enroll and verify themselves remotely.</p>



<p>However, the excitement of more remote identity solutions is understandably mixed with these bias concerns, causing some organizations to delay or reconsider implementation. We’re in an age where digital inclusivity is highly scrutinized, especially for public services, and governments are increasingly calling for a way to demonstrate equity.</p>



<p>Equitable biometrics systems are both a practical and a moral imperative. So how do we get there?&nbsp;</p>



 Addressing bias in biometric systems 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a> program, with mitigating bias as a key priority. It assesses a face verification system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender, in addition to far more wide-reaching security and&nbsp; performance tests.</p>



 Why is independent certification for biometrics important? 



<p>Currently, testing levels are completed on a case-by-case basis, per organization. This means it’s expensive and time-consuming, and what ‘good’ looks like varies widely. The FIDO Alliance’s program is based on proven ISO standards and has been developed by a diverse, international panel of industry, government, and subject matter experts. This means it is unrivaled in its ability to set equitable performance benchmarks.</p>



<p>More broadly, certification and independent global testing catalyze innovation and technological adoption. Whether launching an identity verification solution or including it in related regulations, open standards and certification set a clear performance benchmark. It removes considerable duplicated efforts, improves the confidence of all stakeholders, and ultimately drives up the performance of all solutions on the market.</p>



 How is bias evaluated? 



<p>At this time, the FIDO Alliance program considers false reject rate (FRR) for bias, using FRR methodology, and is measured at the transaction level across skin tone, age, and gender. ISO 19795-10 has multiple options for measuring differential performance. One option is described in the Section: Reporting differential performance against a benchmark (Section 7.4.2). In this approach, testers seek to compare the performance of one or more demographic groups to a specific benchmark. FIDO has chosen this approach given the small sample size of the individual groups (50+ per group). For skin tone, groups are defined and distributed across three brackets based on the Monk Scale. For gender, groups are defined and distributed across male, female, and other. For age, groups are defined and evenly distributed across four age brackets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benchmarks are set at 6% (95% confidence interval), based on bootstrapping simulations. These simulations covered a spectrum of scenarios, population sizes, correlation between attempts. The benchmark chosen reduces the probability that a group will be considered different when it actually is not, i.e., finding a difference by chance (&lt;5%).</p>



 What is the value of certification for Biometric Vendors? 



 
 Independent validation of biometric performance 



 Opportunity to understand gaps in product performance to then improve and align with market demands 



 Demonstrate product performance to potential customers&nbsp; 



 Improve market adoption by holding an industry-trusted certification 



 Leverage one certification for many customers/relying parties&nbsp; 



 Benefit from FIDO delta and derivative certifications for minor updates and extendability to vendor customers 



 Reduce need to repeatedly participate in vendor bake-offs 
 



 What is the value of certification for Relying Parties? 



 
 One-of-a-kind, independent, third-party validation of biometric performance assessing accuracy, fairness and robustness against spoofing attacks 



 Provides a consistent, independent comparison of vendor products – eliminating the burden of maintaining own program for evaluating biometric products 



 Accelerates FIDO adoption to password-less 



 Commitment to ensure quality products for customers of the relying parties&nbsp; 



 Requirements developed by a diverse, international group of stakeholders from industry, government, and subject matter experts 



 Conforms to ISO 



 FIDO Annex published in ISO standards 
 



 What is the value of certification with FIDO accredited laboratories? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/laboratory-overview/">FIDO Accredited Laboratories</a> are available worldwide and follow a common set of requirements and rigorous evaluation processes, defined by the FIDO Alliance Biometrics Working Group (BWG) and follow all relevant ISO standards. These laboratories are audited and trained by the FIDO Biometric Secretariat to ensure lab testing methodologies are compliant and utilize governance mechanisms per FIDO requirements. Laboratories perform biometric evaluations in alignment with audited FIDO accreditation processes. In contrast, bespoke, single laboratory biometric evaluations may not garner sufficient trust from relying parties for authentication and remote identity verification use cases.</p>



 What are the other ISO Standards that FIDO certification conforms to? 



<p>In addition to ISO/IEC 19795-10, vendors and their accredited lab are adhering to the following ISO standards:</p>



Terminology<br>ISO/IEC 2382-37:2022 Information technology — Vocabulary — Part 37: BiometricsPresentation Attack Detection<br>ISO/IEC 30107-3:2023 Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 3: Testing and reporting<br>ISO/IEC 30107-4:2020 Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 4: Profile for testing of mobile devices <br>– FIDO Annex, published 2024Performance (e.g., FRR, FAR)<br>ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 1: Principles and framework<br>ISO/IEC 19795-9:2019 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 9: Testing on mobile devices <br>– FIDO Annex, published 2019Bias (differentials due to demographics)<br>ISO/IEC 19795-10:2024 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 10: Quantifying biometric system performance variation across demographic groups – FIDO Annex, under developmentLaboratory<br>ISO/IEC 17025:2017, General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories

 Part 2: Understanding Feedback&nbsp;Loops <p>This is the second post in a series exploring the fundamentals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">Systems Thinking</a>. This is an approach that helps us make sense of complex situations by considering the whole system rather than just its individual parts.</p><p>This series is made up&nbsp;of:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-51d6e4f9df0b">Part 1: Three Key Principles</a>  Part 2: Understanding Feedback Loops (this&nbsp;post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-8af6844edacd">Part 3: Identifying Leverage&nbsp;Points</a>  <p>In the first post, we explored the foundational principles of Systems Thinking: Drawing a Boundary, Multiple Perspectives, and Holistic Thinking. Now, we’ll build on that foundation by examining Feedback Loops, another crucial concept in Systems Thinking.</p><p>Feedback loops are essential for understanding how systems behave, adapt, and evolve over time. By mastering the dynamics of feedback loops, you can identify how small changes can ripple through a system, leading to significant outcomes, whether intended or unintended.</p> 1. What are feedback&nbsp;loops? <p>“You think that because you understand ‘one’ that you must therefore understand ‘two’ because one and one makes two. But you forget that you must also understand ‘and.’” — Donella&nbsp;Meadows</p><p>Feedback loops are the mechanisms by which systems regulate themselves. They can either reinforce a particular behaviour (positive feedback) or counteract it to maintain stability (negative feedback). Understanding these loops helps us see how systems respond to internal and external changes, leading to growth, adaptation, or stability.</p><p>For instance, a classic example of a negative feedback loop is a thermostat regulating room temperature. When the temperature rises above the set point, the thermostat turns off the heating. When the temperature drops below the set point, the thermostat turns the heating back on. This loop maintains the room’s temperature within a desired range, counteracting any deviations. The thermostat example clearly demonstrates how negative feedback loops work to maintain stability within a system, bringing it back to a set equilibrium when it deviates.</p><p>On the other hand, social media platforms often rely on positive feedback loops to increase user engagement. When a user interacts with content, the platform’s algorithm shows more similar content, increasing the likelihood of further engagement. This creates a reinforcing cycle where user behaviour drives more of the same behaviour, leading to increased overall engagement. This example illustrates how positive feedback loops can amplify behaviours, sometimes leading to rapid growth or creating echo chambers where only certain types of content are repeatedly reinforced.</p><p>Feedback loops are crucial for identifying how systems behave over time, which ties back to the principles we discussed in the first post, particularly the importance of considering Holistic Thinking.</p> 2. Negative feedback&nbsp;loops <p>“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think.” — Gregory&nbsp;Bateson</p><p>Negative feedback loops work to stabilise a system by counteracting changes. These loops are vital for maintaining equilibrium and preventing a system from spiralling out of&nbsp;control.</p><p>For example, in economics, the supply and demand mechanism operates as a negative feedback loop. When the supply of a product exceeds demand, prices tend to fall, which in turn reduces supply as producers cut back on production. Conversely, when demand exceeds supply, prices rise, encouraging increased production. This self-regulating process helps to stabilise markets by bringing supply and demand into equilibrium, preventing extreme fluctuations in prices and availability.</p><p>It’s important to understand that in the context of Systems Thinking, “negative” doesn’t imply something bad or undesirable. Instead, it refers to the type of feedback that counteracts changes, helping to stabilise a system and maintain equilibrium. Negative feedback loops are essential for preventing systems from spiralling out of control, ensuring they remain balanced and functional.</p> 3. Positive feedback&nbsp;loops <p>“The only thing harder than starting something new is stopping something old.” — Russell&nbsp;Ackoff</p><p>Positive feedback loops amplify changes in a system, often leading to exponential growth or decline. These loops are self-reinforcing, meaning that as a particular change occurs, it triggers more of the same change, leading to potentially dramatic&nbsp;effects.</p><p>For example, in the context of climate change, positive feedback loops play a significant role in accelerating global warming. One such loop involves the melting of polar ice. As the ice melts, less sunlight is reflected back into space, and more heat is absorbed by the Earth’s surface, which in turn leads to further ice melt. This self-reinforcing loop accelerates the warming of the planet, contributing to increasingly severe climate&nbsp;impacts.</p><p>Again, it’s important to note that a “positive” feedback loop doesn’t necessarily have morally beneficial consequences — rather, it refers to the amplifying nature of the loop itself, which can drive both beneficial and harmful&nbsp;changes.</p> 4. The interaction of Feedback Loops in&nbsp;Systems <p>“The purpose of a system is what it does.” — Stafford&nbsp;Beer</p><p>In most systems, positive and negative feedback loops do not operate in isolation; they interact with each other, creating complex and dynamic behaviours. This interaction can make systems resilient, allowing them to adapt to changes and maintain stability, or it can make them vulnerable, leading to oscillations, chaotic behaviour, or even collapse if not properly managed. Understanding how these loops interplay is crucial for effective system management and intervention.</p><p>In product management, the balance between feature usage and product complexity is shaped by the interaction of feedback loops. When a feature is widely used and appreciated, customer satisfaction increases, leading the product team to enhance or expand the feature (positive feedback). As the feature becomes more complex, it may introduce usability issues, decreasing customer satisfaction (negative feedback). This interaction helps maintain a balance within the product, ensuring it continues to meet customer needs without becoming overly complicated.</p><p>A similar interplay of feedback loops occurs when managing product adjustments. Increasing customer satisfaction through positive feedback can prompt further enhancements, which might initially appear beneficial. Yet, if these enhancements lead to excessive complexity, they may cause usability issues, frustrating users and resulting in negative feedback. This process highlights the delicate balance product managers must maintain to keep their product both innovative and user-friendly, illustrating the challenges of managing feedback loops in product development.</p><p>By recognising and analysing these interactions, systems thinkers can identify points of leverage where interventions can either reinforce desirable behaviours or counteract negative trends, leading to more stable and resilient systems.</p> 5. Recognising feedback loops in your&nbsp;work <p>“Taking action to improve a problematical situation will of course itself change that situation, so that the learning cycle could in principle begin again.” — Peter Checkland</p><p>Identifying and understanding feedback loops in your work or organisational context can be a game-changer. These loops are often the invisible threads that weave through processes, projects, and relationships, dictating outcomes and driving behaviours. By recognising these loops, you can gain a deeper understanding of the forces at play and make more informed decisions that lead to sustainable success.</p><p>Get started identifying feedback&nbsp;loops:</p>  Think of an area in your work where specific actions lead to similar&nbsp;outcomes  Identify the underlying feedback mechanism — is it positive or negative or are multiple loops at&nbsp;play?  Make adjustments to one part of the system and observe how the system&nbsp;changes  <p>Here’s an&nbsp;example:</p>  When our team meets a deadline, team morale improves and I’ve noticed that we often meet our deadlines with the same enthusiasm  This is a positive feedback loop — success breeds further&nbsp;success.  Figure out what works, and further incentivise it.  <p>Conversely:</p>  When our team misses a deadline, we tend to become stressed leading to further&nbsp;delays.  This is a negative feedback loop — the more stressed we are, the more we miss our deadlines.  We need a win, let’s deprioritise X and focus on Y because it’s an easier task. Then we’ll come back to X when team morale is improved.  <p>Recognising these loops allows you to take proactive steps. If you identify a positive feedback loop that is driving beneficial outcomes, consider how you might reinforce or expand this loop. Perhaps you could introduce additional incentives or recognition programs to further enhance the team’s motivation and productivity. On the other hand, if you uncover a negative feedback loop that is leading to undesirable results, it’s crucial to intervene early. For example, introducing stress management resources or adjusting timelines could help break the cycle and restore&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Feedback loops are not limited to project management; they are pervasive in all areas of work, from customer service to organisational culture. In customer service, a positive feedback loop might occur when excellent service leads to customer satisfaction, which in turn results in positive reviews and repeat business. Recognising this loop could lead to further investments in training and support for customer service teams. In organisational culture, a feedback loop could exist where open communication leads to trust, which fosters more open communication, creating a virtuous cycle of collaboration and innovation.</p><p>By consciously identifying and managing these loops, you can transform potential challenges into opportunities for growth and continuous improvement. This approach not only helps in achieving immediate goals but also contributes to the long-term resilience and adaptability of your organisation.</p> Conclusion <p>Feedback loops are a fundamental aspect of Systems Thinking, providing crucial insights into how systems evolve, adapt, and maintain stability. By identifying and analysing these loops, we gain the ability to predict the outcomes of our actions more accurately and craft interventions that are not only effective but sustainable.</p><p>At We Are Open Co-op, we specialise in applying Systems Thinking principles, including the detailed analysis of feedback loops, to help organisations navigate and resolve complex challenges. Whether you’re looking to enhance organisational processes, improve project outcomes, or foster better relationships within your team, understanding feedback loops can be transformative.</p><p>If you’re curious about how feedback loops influence your work or how Systems Thinking can be integrated into your approach, we’re here to help. Reach out to us to explore the possibilities. And stay tuned for the final post in this series, where we’ll dive into identifying and leveraging key points within systems to drive meaningful and lasting&nbsp;change.</p> References   Ackoff, R.L.

 Abstract 



<p>Enterprises should consider using passkeys, especially if they are currently relying on passwords. By replacing these credentials with passkeys, enterprises will immediately reduce the risk of phishing and eliminate credential reuse, improving authentication service security. Different types of FIDO authenticators may be used to meet users’ needs with a balance between convenience and security. For enterprises that require high levels of identity assurance, internal security policies, or regulatory requirements, additional scrutiny is needed to determine the appropriate type of passkey. It is important to look at both the enterprise as a whole, as well as parts of the organization because high assurance requirements may not apply to the entire enterprise.</p>



<p>For many high assurance scenarios, attested device-bound passkeys may be more desirable. Relying parties with high assurance requirements will need to decide whether to accept all types of authenticators and adapt their authentication flow based on the attestation characteristics or reject registrations from unattested or unacceptable authenticators at the risk of a poor user experience.</p>



 Audience 



<p>This white paper is intended for IT administrators and enterprise security architects who are considering deploying FIDO authentication across their enterprises and defining life cycle management policies. This paper provides an overview of the different use cases for multi-factor authentication MFA and the FIDO Authenticator choices available to administrators. The intent is to help guide administrators in choosing the right authenticator types for their specific environment. Companies requiring higher levels of security, such as those involved in healthcare, government organizations, or financial institutions that have a hard requirement around the control of the credential, in particular should read this white paper.</p>



<p>It is assumed that the reader has an understanding of FIDO architecture, relying parties, protocols, and has read “FIDO EDWG 2023 Papers – Introduction” that introduces key concepts used in this white paper.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>This document focuses on deploying passkeys for enterprise users in high assurance environments.<br>Readers can find an introduction to the series of papers here. The introductory whitepaper provides additional descriptions and links to all papers in the series, which cover an array of use cases from low to high assurance. Most enterprises will likely have use cases that span more than one of these papers, and readers are encouraged to review the white papers relevant to their deployment environment.</p>



<p>This white paper examines what it means to be in a high assurance environment and how that may influence how FIDO is used. More specifically, the document addresses the challenges with password-only authentication and proposes passkeys as a stronger, phishing-resistant alternative to using passwords to authenticate users. Additionally, the document provides some adoption considerations for IT and security professionals to consider to ensure compliance with regulatory and security requirements for high assurance authentication scenarios. This white paper examines the use cases of registering a device, using a registered device, and dealing with recovering a lost device.</p>



<p>A key part in deciding if a passkey should be allowed in an environment is based on attestations. Attestations can be provided for credentials as part of the registration process, which relying parties can trust as provenance of the authenticator being used. For high assurance enterprise scenarios, attestations should always be requested. What can be discovered from the attestation associated with the credential, or the absence of any attestation, can help drive policy decisions about whether to accept the registration. Without any attestation, it may be difficult for the relying party to decide if the credential should be allowed. They may reject the registration outright, making for a poor user experience, or the enterprise may choose to employ additional, conditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) along with FIDO authentication to meet the high assurance requirements. With an attestation, the enterprise has assurances about the provenance, manufacture type, certifications, and features of the authenticator and often can rely on these assurances as MFA devices, providing multiple factors like credentials and a PIN to unlock the authenticator.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys work well in many use cases and can still work for some high assurance scenarios, depending on the security or regulatory requirements of the enterprise. Synced passkeys are attractive because of their recoverability and ease of use; however, they also change where credentials reside and who controls them. Given this external control of the credentials, some additional MFA may be desired for synced passkeys where the enterprise has control of the lifecycle management of the MFA method.</p>



<p>The remainder of this white paper will examine enterprises or organizations that have high assurance requirements based on Authenticator Assurance Levels [7] and FIDO Certified Authenticator Levels [8] to operate.</p>

 2. Passkey Use Cases 



<p>This section will focus on use cases around passkeys in an enterprise or an organization. There are many use cases for enterprises where synced passkeys work very well for ease and convenience in registering devices, using devices, and recovering lost devices since the credentials are available on other devices. It is highly recommended that organizations look at all the benefits of synced passkeys to determine if they are appropriate for the organization. However, the use of synced passkeys, while convenient, may not meet all the security requirements for an enterprise or organization needing high assurance (e.g., AAL3 requirements). AAL3 level has several requirements with the most significant being the use of a hardware-based authenticator. Please refer to NIST for more detail on the different levels of Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL) [7]. Quite often, AAL3 applies to companies and organizations requiring higher levels of security, such as those involved in healthcare, government, or finance, which have a hard requirement around the control of the credential, specifically, that it is device-bound and never copied.</p>



<p>2.1. Registration<br>The enterprise or organization should first consider what device(s) they will support in their environment and how they will manage the provisioning of devices. For example, an organization may support an environment where users can bring their own device (e.g., mobile phone), or an organization may have very strict requirements around issued devices that meet specific security requirements such as PIN length, particular user presence features, or even specific hardware models. Finally, organizations need to consider whether they will allow passkeys to reside on multiple devices or just a single device. This has both security and recovery implications that need to be considered.</p>



<p>Organizations may have use cases that require credentials to be device-bound and not copyable at all, in which case synced passkeys are not recommended. Organizations may choose to allow synced passkeys alongside traditional MFA mechanisms, replacing the password with a passkey. However, if the organization has strict requirements for where the credentials can reside, they should look closely at restricting use to device-bound passkeys. These factors will decide how organizations manage registration. All these cases put some added burden on the relying party if types of passkeys need to be restricted.</p>



<p>The relying party may need to check if some requirements are met during the registration process, such as requiring an authenticator that meets or exceeds the FIDO L1+ certification [8]. To assess the authenticator’s compliance with these requirements, the authenticator must provide an attestation that can be validated and examined. If an authenticator does not meet the requirements of L1+ then, the relying party may be forced to reject the registration since nothing can be proven about the provenance of the credential, or the party may consider an implementation with additional MFA to meet the requirements of high assurance.</p>



<p>If an attestation is provided, the relying party can check what type of device it is and if it meets the requirements of the enterprise or organization. The relying party may also want to restrict based on the unique identifier for the authenticator, provided an attestation is available. The unique identifier, known as an Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier (AAGUID), can be used to look up the details against the FIDO Alliance Metadata Service [2] to understand what type of device is being registered, the certification level, and what features it provides.</p>



<p>Enterprise Attestation is another form of attestation that can be leveraged during registration. This is implemented by some authenticator vendors to add additional information that is unique to the organization. Including this additional information as part of the attestation and narrowing allowed authenticators can be used to further enhance the registration experience.</p>



<p>Similarly, there may be flags about whether the credential is eligible for backup and/or if it has been backed up. These flags cannot be trusted, however, without some attestation that the device is certified. A relying party might decide to allow or deny the registration based on this information as well as other information provided at runtime.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if the relying party fails the registration of a credential, it forces the user to repeat the registration process again with a different authenticator at step one. Although WebAuthn [5] does not support a preflight mechanism to identify suitable authenticators, relying parties may provide feedback to the user before registration to identify acceptable authenticators. Additional guidance can be provided after failed registration to guide the user’s choice of authenticator. This guidance should be explicit and identify why the authenticator was rejected during registration, which authenticators meet the RP’s requirements, and guidance on managing browser-mandated optionality on communicating attestations.</p>



<p>Relying parties should be able to be more prescriptive in describing requirements of authenticators, allowing for a much better user experience where the end user can only select authenticators that meet the requirements and remove this burden from relying parties. These changes have been proposed to WebAuthn, but they have not yet gathered the support of platform vendors.</p>



<p>Another approach for enterprises might be not to offer any registration use case exposed to the end user. Instead, the enterprise would manage the lifecycle of registering the devices before they are provisioned to users. Similarly, the enterprise might provide some form of supervised registration experience to ensure only authorized authenticators are provisioned and registered. This avoids a number of pitfalls with the user experience mentioned above but puts more lifecycle management burden on the enterprise.</p>



<p>2.2. Sign In<br>Once a credential has been registered, FIDO credentials can be accessed when needed at authentication. The application(s) will leverage the WebAuthn browser API or platform passkey APIs to perform a FIDO authentication using a registered device. Depending on the type of registered device, there will be multiple factors involved in the authentication, like the entering of a PIN or a user presence challenge. The requirement for these interactions is there is a high level of assurance that the user is who they say they are, and they are not impersonating any user. These requirements need to be enforced during the registration process to ensure devices are allowed to meet the requirements of the enterprise or organization.</p>



<p>The only difference in this use case between synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys is what needs to be authenticated. For device-bound passkeys, the original hardware device used during the registration process is needed. Synced passkeys may be accessed from multiple devices that have access to an account hosted by a passkey provider. Furthermore, some synced passkeys may be shared after registration. Relying parties do not have a mechanism for identifying shared credentials in the current specifications, making it harder to understand and manage the lifecycle of synced passkeys.</p>



<p>There are several enterprise use cases covered in the white paper on “Choosing FIDO Authenticators for Enterprise Use Cases” [4]. Organizations should review these to evaluate how FIDO is leveraged. In particular, an organization planning to rely on FIDO as a first factor (passwordless) or a second factor is a key decision, and the white paper may help organizations understand what truly requires high assurance. For example, there may be a specific project, or a use case may apply to an entire industry driven by government or regulatory requirements. Employees might be allowed to use a synced passkey to access a laptop for example, but then need to use a device-bound passkey to sign in to a specific application restricted to certain employees with a particular clearance level.</p>



<p>2.3. Recovery/Lost Device<br>Recovery is where a synced passkey shines. If one loses a FIDO device that holds a credential, they can just access the credential from a different device that shares the same platform account. This is convenient, but also means that a passkey is only as secure as the platform account with which it is associated. Enterprises should examine the vendor solutions to understand how secure it is before relying on a service external to the organization. For example, does it provide end-to-end encryption with keys that are not known to the vendor? What additional measures like MFA are used to secure the user’s account? What process is used for account recovery? End users may not be concerned about such matters, but these details may represent a security concern for the organization’s security administrators. The organization’s security requirements need to be examined to see if an external party can store and manage credentials. Furthermore, without requiring attestations, the relying party has no idea who or what is the issuer of a credential—whether it be the platform, a roaming authenticator, a browser plug-in, or something else. As a result, the relying party cannot provide any guidance as to how to recover access to the credentials while providing high assurance. An alternative form of account recovery external to recovering the FIDO credential would be needed to verify the identity of the user and issue a new device and credentials. Finally, the recovery of a passkey from a provider when using synced is not known to the relying party. This represents a potential attack that the enterprise is unaware of.</p>



<p>For device-bound passkeys, the recovery process is more involved and will likely require the involvement of a help desk [6] to issue a new device and possibly revoke access for the old device. This is a security-first approach over convenience that allows an enterprise or organization to control who has devices. It does mean there are additional steps needed for the end user before they can regain access. However, this gives enterprises more control over the lifecycle of the credentials, allowing enterprises to revoke or expire authenticators at any point and be able to guarantee that credentials are not copied or do not exist outside enterprise controls. Some enterprises have solved this by provisioning multiple devices so users can self-recover. Ultimately, there is a business decision to be made regarding recovery models. In some cases, it may be appropriate to block access until the user can receive a new device, taking loss of productivity over a lower security model. The extra burden highlighted in the registration step if an enterprise chooses to manage the registration experience has a direct impact on the recovery/replacement experience.</p>



<p>2.4. Unregistering<br>At some point an employee will either leave a project or the enterprise overall. The enterprise will want to be sure they have control over credentials and unregister their use so access is no longer possible. This is a bigger consideration when it comes to synced passkeys where the enterprise does not have full control of the lifecycle and management of the credentials. If synced passkeys require additional MFA, the enterprise can control the MFA aspect, expiring the factors involved so authentications no longer are allowed. Device-bound passkey environments have much more control over unregistering devices, either by physically handing in a device and knowing no copies were made, or invalidating/expiring the device so subsequent authentication attempts fail.</p>



<p>The credential lifecycle requires the ability to disable or remove a credential, whether due to a change in status of an employee, such as a leave of absence or separation from the organization, or due to the potential loss or compromise of a credential. Passkeys differ from passwords in these instances since the user may have multiple passkeys registered with the relying party, as opposed to passwords, where the user is expected to only have one password per relying party. In the case of a permanent separation between the user and enterprise, disabling the user account and/or rotating the credential in the service is standard practice to ensure the user is no longer able to authenticate. If the separation is temporary, such as for leave of absence, enterprises may choose to rotate all the user’s credentials or disable the user account until the user returns.</p>



<p>In the case of credential loss, the next steps are dependent upon the deployment scenario. Users with device-bound passkeys who lose their security key should have the credential revoked by the service. Synced passkeys create additional challenges. If the device has been compromised, all credentials resident on the device, including those resident in different passkey providers, should be treated as compromised and revoked by the RP. If the user’s passkey provider account has been compromised, the impacted credential(s) stored with the provider must be revoked. To facilitate revocation in these scenarios, RPs should allow credentials to be named or otherwise identified by the user during registration to facilitate the revocation of specific credentials where possible. Administrative controls must narrow their focus on eliminating credentials from the RP rather than removing the credential private key material from either hardware security keys or a passkey provider’s sync fabric, which may not be possible.</p>



 3. Deployment Strategy 



<p>In a high assurance environment, the enterprise is likely going to want to manage the distribution and retirement of all authenticators. Device-bound passkeys would be managed by IT and provisioned to individuals. Relying parties would need to check for attestations and only allow the registration of authenticators that are managed by the enterprise or organization. If attestations are absent or do not meet the security requirements, the registration should fail. Processes should be established to manage the pool of authenticators to ensure they are retired when individuals leave or no longer require high-level access. Lastly, the organization or enterprise should define what the process looks like for recovering lost/stolen devices. Depending on how critical the access is to the continuity of the business, multiple hardware devices might be issued for a given individual to ensure they always have access.</p>



 4. Conclusion 



<p>There is no argument that passkeys are a strong phishing-resistant alternative option to traditional passwords. In an enterprise environment, it is important to look at security and regulatory requirements to determine if synced passkeys work, or if there are stricter constraints such as internal security policies, regulatory, or compliance requirements that require the use of device-bound passkeys. With either approach, enterprises should spend the time to understand how registration, management, and recovery of FIDO credentials will be managed. This includes important use cases like storage of credentials (external), recovery of lost credentials, and unregistering devices when employees leave. Based on the requirements of the enterprise, passkeys may work without any customizations, or enterprises may need to invest to ensure their authentication experience is more managed and filtered to specific devices.</p>



 5. Next Steps: Get Started Today 



 
 Use FIDO standards. 



 Think about what your relying parties are supporting and consider your enterprise security requirements. 



 Passkeys are far more secure than passwords. Look for the passkey icon on websites and applications that support it.

 Abstract 



<p>The intent of this whitepaper is to provide guidance for organizations as they analyze the abilities and features of both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to determine how both credential types can be utilized in a moderate assurance environment. In this paper, the term “moderate assurance” refers to an environment or organization where the legal, regulatory, and security requirements are flexible enough to allow for the use of both types of credentials, using synced passkeys to replace passwords and multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for standard user accounts and device-bound passkeys for user accounts that require the highest level of protection and assurance. The paper is designed to provide a comparison of features and requirements that are supported by device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys, providing a vision of how both types of credentials can be utilized together in an organization that has moderate assurance needs.</p>



 Audience 



<p>This white paper is one in a series of white papers intended for anyone who is considering deploying FIDO Authentication across their organization, including IT administrators, enterprise security architects, and executives.</p>



<p>Readers can find an introduction to the series of papers <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">here</a>. The introductory white paper provides additional descriptions and links to all papers in the series, covering an array of use cases from low to high assurance. We expect that most enterprises will have use cases that span more than one of these papers and encourage readers to review the white papers that are relevant to their deployment requirements.</p>



<p>The white paper assumes that the reader has a foundational understanding of FIDO2 credentials and the role they play in the<br>authentication process; introductory information on FIDO2 can be found here: <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 – FIDO Alliance</a>.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>The initial implementations of FIDO2 credentials were created as device-bound passkeys on either a roaming authenticator or platform authenticator, where the private key of the credential is stored on the device’s authenticator and not allowed to be exported, copied, backed up, or synchronized from the authenticator. This configuration presents a very secure and phishing-resistant solution for authentication that gives relying parties (e.g., web sites or service providers), a very high level of confidence that the user and the device are legitimate users of the system. With this high level of assurance, however, comes some challenges – primarily regarding usability and account recovery. For example, because there is no way to get the private key off the authenticator, if the device the private key is stored on becomes lost or damaged, then access to the resources that key authenticated would be lost. With device-bound passkeys, the solution is to register a second device-bound passkey with every relying party. This creates a more difficult user experience as the user would be required to register both authenticators. This is somewhat reduced for organizations that have consolidated their authentication flow by using an identity provider (IdP) to federate access to their applications, as the relying party is then the IdP itself.</p>



<p>To solve these challenges, in May 2022 Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced their intent to support synced passkeys in their operating systems. Synced passkeys have many of the same characteristics of device-bound passkeys, including the continued use of private and public key pairs. One significant difference, however, is that synced passkeys allow for the private key of the credential to be synchronized to other devices the user owns that exist in the same vendor’s synchronization fabric ecosystem (e.g., iCloud in the Apple ecosystem). Synced passkeys also allow for the creation of a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. All passkeys share several common security properties, are highly phishing resistant, and use unique key pairs to enable strong authentication. However, it is also important to note the difference between synced and device-bound passkeys. For example, synced passkeys introduce new security considerations when analyzed against a device-bound passkey. Conversely, synced passkeys can more easily address account recovery challenges.</p>



<p>As organizations work to evaluate how and where both credential types can be utilized in their environment, they will need to review and understand their organization’s legal, regulatory, and security requirements. When organizations evaluate these requirements, they will many times refer to the combination of these requirements as an authentication assurance level (AAL) and will reference documentation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which provides guidance and recommendation for different assurance levels. While there is currently work underway by NIST to update these assurance levels to better incorporate synced passkeys, the current standards can be helpful when evaluating the implementation of device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys into an organization. More information regarding NIST and AALs can be found here: Authenticator Assurance Levels (nist.gov).</p>



<p>In terms of this white paper, a moderate assurance environment is an organization that has several different authentication use case scenarios that can be met by a combination of AAL1 and/or AAL2 as well as AAL3 levels of assurance. This white paper will dive deeper into the advantages and disadvantages of both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to provide a comparison between the two that an organization can use along with their own legal, regulatory, and security requirements to determine how and where they can implement both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys into their moderate assurance environment so that they can take advantage of the secure, phishing-resistant, and user friendly authentication process that FIDO2 credentials provide in all parts of their organization.</p>

 2. FIDO Credential Adoption Considerations 



<p>When organizations are evaluating the use of both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to support the AAL1, AAL2, and AAL3 requirements of their organization, there are several factors that they should consider. These factors are described below and are intended to provide the organization with the information they need to help analyze both types of credentials and determine where they can be used in their enterprise.</p>



<p>2.1. User Experience<br>In terms of user experience, the goal of using FIDO credentials to authenticate to a system has always been to provide an easy-to-use and effortless process for the user. The original FIDO implementations provided a streamlined sign-in experience, but still presented some user experience challenges.</p>



<p>Passkeys introduce several enhancements to help provide improve user experience including a new feature called “passkeys Autofill UI” that provides users easier access to the creation of the passkeys and provides an autofill-like experience where users simply pick the credential they want to use when authenticating and no longer type in their username or password. This experience becomes quite easy to use and is very similar to the experience that most users already like and are comfortable with when using solutions such as password managers. Creating a passkey user experience that users like more than their current password experience removes the hurdle to adoption that has been seen with previous passkey implementations.</p>



<p>2.1.1 Backup, Lost Devices, and Recovery<br>With device-bound passkeys, the private key is stored on and not allowed to leave the authenticator. This creates a very secure solution but does create challenges for users and enterprises regarding backup of the key data, loss of the authenticator, and addition of new authenticators for the user. While there are recommended recovery practices for device-bound passkeys (<a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FIDO_Account_Recovery_Best_Practices-1.pdf">FIDO_Account_Recovery_Best_Practices-1.pdf (fidoalliance.org)</a>), synced passkeys work to resolve these challenges in a more user friendly manner. With the implementation of a synced passkey solution, the user no longer must register multiple authenticators with a relying party to ensure continued access in the event of a lost authenticator. If an authenticator is lost, a user can recover their passkey by using the recovery process provided by the passkey provider. Additionally, synced passkeys make for a better user experience as a user does not have to register unique credentials per device or maintain multiple device-bound passkeys to minimize the risk of credential loss. Once configured, synced passkeys are available across all devices synced with the passkey provider.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys do, however, create a dependency on the passkey provider and their synchronization fabric. Each provider implements their own synchronization fabric, which includes their own security controls and mechanisms to protect credentials from being misused. Organizations with specific security or compliance requirements should assess which provider(s) or hardware security keys meet their requirements.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys have a lower security posture as they allow the private key on the authenticator to be synchronized to authenticators of other devices the user has in the same vendor’s ecosystem. Organizations should also be aware that there currently are no standards or systems that allow them to keep track of what devices these credentials have been created and stored on, nor mechanisms to identify when the credential has been shared with another person. For use cases in an organization that require a high level of assurance, the fact that this information cannot be determined or obtained means that synced passkeys would not be a good solution for those specific organizational use cases, and they should look to device-bound passkeys to support those use cases.</p>



<p>2.3 Attestation and Enforcement of Credential Type<br>Attestation is a feature that is designed to enhance the security of the registration process. Attestation mechanisms are defined by the specifications as an optional feature, though most hardware security keys implement it. Attestation is the ability of the authenticator to provide metadata about itself back to the relying party so that the relying party can make an informed decision on whether to allow the authenticator to interact with it. This metadata includes items such as an Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier (AAGUID), which is a unique ID that represents the vendor and model of the authenticator, the type of encryption that the authenticator uses, and the PIN and biometric capabilities of the authenticator. Some authenticator vendors also support a feature called Enterprise Attestation that allows an organization to add additional uniquely identifying information in an attestation that is included with an authenticator registration request, with the intent to use this additional information to support a controlled deployment within the enterprise where the<br>organization wants to allow the registration of only a specific set of authenticators. Additional information about Enterprise Attestation can be found in this white paper: <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FIDO-White-Paper-Choosing-FIDO-Authenticators-for-Enterprise-Use-Cases-RD10-2022.03.01.pdf">FIDO-White-Paper-Choosing-FIDO-Authenticators-for-Enterprise-Use-Cases-RD10-2022.03.01.pdf (fidoalliance.org)</a>.</p>



<p>At the time of publication, synced passkeys do not implement attestation, which means they are not an appropriate solution for scenarios with highly privileged users that require higher levels of assurance or for organizations that want to implement Enterprise Attestation. To support these highly privileged users, relying parties and organizations have historically looked to, and will need to continue to look to, device-bound passkeys and authenticators from vendors that support and include attestation in their solutions. For organizations that have regulatory, legal, or security requirements that require all users to be treated as high privilege users or have a need to implement Enterprise Attestation, it is recommended that only device-bound passkeys be implemented in their environment. A companion white paper, “High Assurance Enterprise Authentication,” provides details on this scenario and can be found here: <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FIDO-EDWG-Spring-2023_Paper-5_High-Assurance-Enterprise-FINAL5.docx-1.pdf">https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FIDO-EDWG-Spring-2023_Paper-5_High-Assurance-EnterpriseFINAL5.docx-1.pdf</a>. Moderate assurance organizations can support all their users by implementing synced passkeys for their standard users to replace passwords and MFA with a more secure solution and then use device-bound passkeys for highly privileged users and their access to resources that require the highest level of assurance.</p>



<p>Implementing both types of passkeys in the same authentication domain does however create an additional challenge that will require organizations to take additional steps to ensure that the correct type of passkey is used when accessing resources: for example, ensuring that a highly privileged user is using a device-bound passkey and not a synced passkey when accessing a resource that requires a high level of assurance. Organizations can leverage the user risk evaluation and policy engine framework of their Identity Provider to solve this challenge. Watermarking the user’s session with an identifier representing the AAL (or other properties of their choosing) to be used in downstream authorization decisions can also be used to solve this challenge. In federated authentication environments, this may be communicated using standards such as the Authentication Method Reference (amr, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8176">RFC8176</a>) standardized by OpenID Connect.</p>



 3. Conclusion 



<p>In moderate assurance environments, both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys may be implemented together to provide a more secure authentication solution for all use cases of the organization. The more user-friendly synced passkeys can be implemented to replace passwords and MFA for users with standard assurance level requirements, giving them a more secure authentication method that is also easier to use. For highly privileged users in the organization that require the highest level of security, device-bound passkeys can be issued that provide an even higher level of security and an additional level of trust in the authentication process. The white paper provides information comparing synced passkeys, with their better user experience, against device-bound passkeys, with their enhanced security features. Using this information, organizations can evaluate device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to determine how both can be leveraged in their organization to provide easy-to-use and secure authentication methods that meet and exceed the requirements of their moderate assurance environment.</p>



 4. Next Steps 



<p>The next step for organizations is to start the evaluation of FIDO2 credentials so that organizations can move away from passwords, which are susceptible to phishing and are well documented to be a significant weakness in their overall security posture. Organizations that have a moderate assurance need and will implement both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys should determine which credential type will provide the best return on investment, work towards implementing that credential type first, and then follow up by completing the deployment of the other credential type when possible. Implementing either type of FIDO2 credential is a large step forward in moving to a passwordless environment and significantly increasing the overall security posture of the organization.</p>

 Abstract 



<p>This white paper describes the need for a more secure and convenient solution for authentication. Passwords have long been the standard for authentication, but the risks inherent to passwords reduce their efficacy as an authentication mechanism. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions have been on market for some time, but their widespread adoption has been slow due to various barriers. Passkeys are an authentication solution that reduces the adoption barriers of traditional MFA mechanisms, while offering improved security, ease of use, and scalability over passwords and classic MFA solutions. Passkeys utilize on-device biometrics or PINs for authentication and provide a seamless user experience. This white paper outlines the benefits of passkeys, the user experience, and adoption considerations for enterprises.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>Passwords have long been the standard for authentication, but their inherent security flaws make them exploitable. Many passwords can be easily guessed or obtained through data breaches, and the reuse of passwords across multiple accounts only exacerbates the problem. This vulnerability makes them susceptible to credential stuffing attacks, which use leaked or commonly used passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. In fact, passwords are the root cause of over <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/">80% of data breaches, with up to 51% of passwords being reused</a>. Despite these security concerns, many consumers and organizations continue to rely solely on passwords for authentication. According to a recent research by the FIDO Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">59% of consumers use only a pass</a><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">w</a><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">ord</a> for their work computer or account.</p>



<p>Traditional multi-factor (MFA) mechanisms, such as one time passwords (OTPs) delivered via SMS, email, or an authenticator app, are used by organizations to reduce the risk associated with a single-factor, password-based authentication system. Organizations using single-factor authentication with passwords, or those that have deployed OTPs to reduce phishing and credential stuffing, can implement passkeys as a password replacement to provide an improved user experience, less authentication friction, and improved security properties using devices that users already use—laptops, desktops, and mobile devices. For an introduction to passkeys and the terminology, please see the FIDO Alliance’s passkeys <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">resource page</a>. In the following pages, we will focus on migrating existing password-only use cases to passkeys. For additional use cases, please see <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">here</a>.</p>

 2. Why Are Passkeys Better than Passwords? 



<p>Passkeys are a superior alternative to passwords for authentication purposes and offer improved usability over traditional MFA methods. They offer several benefits such as better user experience, reduced cost of lost credentials, phishing resistance, and protection against credential compromise.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys offer a consistent authentication experience for users across multiple devices. This is made possible by leveraging the operating system platform (or a third party synchronization fabric such as that from password managers) to synchronize cryptographic keys for FIDO credentials. This allows for quick and easy sign-in using biometrics or a device PIN. Synced passkeys also improve scalability and credential recovery. With synced passkeys users do not have to enroll a new FIDO credential on every device they own, ensuring that they always have access to their passkeys, regardless of whether they replace their device.</p>



<p>On the other hand, device-bound passkeys such as security keys can be used on multiple devices allowing for cross-device portability. Unlike synced passkeys that are accessible on any synchronized device, device-bound passkeys are tied to the specific physical security key.</p>



<p>In terms of security, passkeys are built on the FIDO authentication standards, providing strong resistance against the threats of phishing and credential stuffing. Additionally, passkeys rely on existing on-device security capabilities, making it easier for small and medium enterprises to adopt stronger authentication methods.</p>



<p>Finally, passkeys offer a comprehensive solution for secure and efficient authentication that is better than passwords and traditional MFA authentication methods. With a seamless user experience, improved scalability, and enhanced security, passkeys are a valuable solution for organizations of all sizes.</p>



 3. Passkeys User Experience

 4. Adoption Considerations for Enterprises 



<p>Within businesses large and small, there are systems and services dependent upon single factor authentication using passwords. We collectively refer to these use cases as “low assurance use cases.” For low assurance use cases, technology leaders can displace password-only authentication mechanisms with passkeys, dramatically reducing the risk of phishing, and eliminating password reuse and  credential stuffing. However, even for low assurance use cases, businesses must consider factors that will influence their choice of technology and implementation, which we outline below.</p>



<p>As a prerequisite to deploying passkeys in the enterprise, leaders must clearly define the set of use cases, users, and the suitability of passkeys for this set.</p>



<p>4.1 Does the relying party (RP) support passkeys?<br>At the time of writing (Q2 2023), passkeys are a relatively new technology, and as such broad-based support is not guaranteed. As organizations review their systems to identify candidates for migration to passkeys, leaders must start by identifying where passkeys are supported within their ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, for in-house developed/managed applications, how can passkey support be added to the application(s)?If a single-sign on (SSO) mechanism is used to federate multiple applications and services, adding passkey support to the Identity Provider (IdP) can propagate support for passkeys to numerous federated applications, creating a rich ecosystem of services supporting passkeys with engineering efforts focused on the SSO IdP. Conversely, if the environment uses multiple independent applications, each of which uses password-based authentication, organizations will have to prioritize FIDO implementation across their suite of applications to leverage passkeys, or consider migrating to a federated authentication model where the IdP supports passkeys.</p>



<p>Second, third-party developed or hosted applications may or may not support passkeys. If an organization’s service provider does not support passkeys today, inquire when support is expected. Alternatively, if the organization is pursuing a federated identity model, does the service provider support inbound federation?If so, end users can authenticate to the IdP with a passkey before federating to the service providers’ systems.</p>



<p>4.2 Which devices are used to create, manage, and authenticate with passkeys?<br>After identifying a set of targeted applications or IdPs, identify the users of the applications and the devices they use to access the same. Generally speaking, users on modern operating systems, browsers, and hardware will have broad support for passkeys registered on a platform device, using a credential manager, or with a hardware security key. There are tradeoffs with each mechanism.</p>



<p>Today, passkey providers allow users to register passkeys that are synchronized to all of the devices the user registered with the sync fabric. Passkeys providers may be part of the operating system, browser, or a credential manager which stores and manages passkeys on behalf of the user. If the user loses or replaces their device, the passkeys can be synchronized to a new device, minimizing the impact on users. Typically, this is a good solution for users who use a small number of devices on a regular basis.</p>



<p>Conversely, hardware security keys create device-bound passkeys; they never leave the device. If a user loses their hardware key, they must have a backup or perform account recovery for all credentials stored on the device. Passkeys may be shared with other users if they are not hardware bound.</p>



<p>Hardware security keys require connectivity to the user’s computing device through USB, Bluetooth, or NFC whereas providers are always available on the user’s devices once bootstrapped. Platform credentials may be used to authenticate on nearby devices using the <a href="https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#cross-device-authentication-cda">FIDO Cross-Device Authentication</a>. Enterprises should consider whether users who move between a number of shared devices should synchronize passkeys across all the shared devices, use hardware keys, or use the hybrid flow to best support their work style.</p>



<p>When users operate on shared devices using a single account (or profile), passkeys registered to the platform or credential managers are not a good fit. Device bound passkeys on a hardware key are recommended for this scenario. If the user carries a mobile device, consider registering a passkey on the device and using the cross device authentication flow to authenticate users.</p>



<p>Unlike passwords, all of the passkey solutions reviewed above provide strong phishing resistance and eliminate credential theft from the RP and reuse.</p>



<p>4.3 Registration &amp; Recovery<br>If there are no restrictions on which device(s) or platform(s) the user can register their passkeys, users may self-provision passkeys by bootstrapping a new credential from their existing password using the device(s) of the user’s choice. If using hardware security keys, organizations should provide two per user to allow for a backup credential.</p>



<p>As long as a password remains active on the user account, the user can recover from credential loss following the self-provisioning described above. This step is only required if the user is unable to restore their credentials from their passkey provider.</p>



 5. Conclusion 



<p>Passkeys offer a significant improvement in security compared to traditional passwords, but it is important to carefully evaluate and understand the adoption considerations before proceeding with an implementation. Organizations should ensure its technical requirements, security, and management preferences align with the passkey solution. Not all use cases are suitable for a passkey-only implementation. For additional deployment patterns, see the other white papers in this series here.</p>



 6. Next Steps: Get Started Today 



<p>Organizations should upgrade their authentication method and take advantage of the stronger security that passkeys provide. Based on the FIDO authentication standards, passkeys offer a robust solution to the growing threat of phishing attacks. Look for the passkey icon on websites and applications that support it, and take the first step towards a more secure future. Don’t wait. Make the switch to passkeys today!</p>

 1. Introduction 



<p>Last year FIDO Alliance, Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced their intentions to support passkeys— FIDO credentials that may be backed up and made available across devices that are registered to the same passkey provider. Since then, we have seen the support for passkeys and beta implementations by multiple platforms and password managers. Enterprises have expressed interest in passkeys but do not know where to start, what type of passkeys work in their environment, or how passkeys fit in their authentication strategy.</p>



<p>It is important to note that FIDO Alliance has embraced the term “passkey” to describe any passwordless FIDO credential. This includes synced passkeys(consistent with the original announcement and intent) as well as device-bound passkeys – which are FIDO authentication credentials that cannot leave the issued device (e.g., on a FIDO Security Key).</p>



<p>In the following series of papers, the FIDO Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) will provide guidance to leaders and practitioners on deploying FIDO solutions scaling from SMBs to large enterprises. With recognition that there are a variety of different use cases for FIDO credentials, from synced passkeys to device-bound passkeys, this series will identify key decision points for identifying which solution(s) are a good fit across different enterprise use cases. Enterprises are likely to find there are multiple FIDO-based solutions required to meet their different use cases.</p>



<p>As organizations evaluate how to use passkeys in their environment, they will need to determine the legal, regulatory, and security requirements of their organization and evaluate how both synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys can meet these requirements.</p>



<p>We assume that the reader has a high level understanding of the FIDO protocols, if not, please consult&nbsp;<a href="https://passkeys.dev/">https://passkeys.dev/</a>.</p>

 2. Why Choose Passkeys? 



<p>Passwords are the root cause of over 80% of data breaches, and up to 51% of passwords are reused, making them subject to credential stuffing attacks. FIDO credentials are inherently more secure than passwords due to their design. These credentials are unique cryptographic key pairs scoped to a specific origin (e.g., https://fidoalliance.org/) to prevent discovery by unrelated services. Unlike passwords, FIDO credentials are highly phishing resistant, and the credential—a private key—cannot be stolen from the relying party (RP) servers.</p>



<p>FIDO credentials can be utilized across a variety of use cases—from low to high assurance, balancing user experience, convenience, and security. Authenticators—ranging from hardware security keys to biometric hardware in phones, tablets, and laptops to password managers—enable enterprises to choose the right tools for their unique environments.</p>



<p>While all FIDO credentials are based on cryptographic key pairs, they do not exhibit the same security characteristics, nor are they all suitable for all use cases. For example, hardware security keys may be FIPS certified devices with device-bound passkeys. RPs can identify these credentials based upon the attestation statements provided at registration. On the other hand, synced passkey implementations synchronize key material through a cloud-based service. The export and management of credentials in a third-party service introduces additional considerations and may not meet every organization’s security requirements. The table on page 4 summarizes the use cases and properties of device-bound and synced passkeys.</p>



<p>As you read the series you may encounter terminology that is unique to the FIDO ecosystem. Please consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/common-specs/fido-glossary-v2.1-ps-20220523.html">FIDO Technical Glossary</a>&nbsp;for definitions of these terms.</p>



<p>We expect that most enterprises will have use cases that span more than one of these papers. Wherever organizations find themselves on this journey, they can start using FIDO credentials today to reduce credential reuse, phishing, and credential stuffing.</p>



<p>In the first paper, we examine how organizations can deploy passkeys to their users who are using passwords as their only authentication factor. By deploying passkeys, companies can immediately reduce the risk of phishing or credential stuffing for their staff while using corporate or personal devices for authentication.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>



<p>There are many organizations that have deployed classic second factor authentication solutions such as SMS OTP, TOTP, and HOTP. In many cases, these deployments were tactical responses to reduce the success of phishing attacks. However, none of these mechanisms are immune to phishing. In the second paper of the series, we examine how passkeys can displace less phishing resistant mechanisms while improving the authentication user experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>



<p>Enterprises in regulated industries may be obligated to utilize higher assurance authentication for some, or all, of their staff. These companies (or other companies with stringent security requirements) may be able to deploy synced passkeys, device-bound passkeys, or both to meet their authentication requirements. The third paper in the series provides guidance on deciding which FIDO-based solution(s) can meet these requirements.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>



<p>The final paper describes using device-bound passkeys where functional or regulatory requirements require high assurance<br>authentication. These scenarios use attestation data to securely validate the hardware devices used to generate and manage passkeys.</p>



<p>This attestation data can be used to ensure compliance with regulatory and security requirements for regulated enterprises and use cases.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>

 Abstract 



<p>This document intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of attestation’s role in enhancing and advancing the digital security landscape, specifically with respect to authentication. It focuses on the core function of attestation: verifying the origin and integrity of user devices and their authentication materials. FIDO credentials are discussed with a focus on how they offer more secure alternatives than traditional password-based systems and how FIDO attestation enhances authentication security for both Relying Parties (RPs) and end-users. In this document, RPs are those entities that provide websites, applications and online services that require the need for secure user access by confirming the identity of users or other entities. FIDO Alliance’s historical journey is presented with practical analogies for understanding FIDO attestation, its enterprise-specific technical solutions, and privacy aspects involved in the attestation process.</p>



 Audience 



<p>Targeted for CISOs, security engineers, architects, and identity engineers, this white paper serves as a guide for professionals considering the adoption of FIDO within their enterprise ecosystem. Readers should possess a baseline understanding of FIDO technologies, the meaning of attestation, and have a desire to understand why and how to implement attestation.</p>

 1. Introduction 



 
<p>While authentication is widely understood, attestation may be less familiar to many practitioners in the information technology field. Attestation, as understood within the FIDO protocols, confirms a set of properties or characteristics of the authenticator. In the physical world, we can rely on examining an object to inspect its properties and verify its authenticity. In the interconnected digital world, physical inspection is not practical. Devices used for FIDO authentication should be carefully checked before use, especially if their source or contents are uncertain. Certain transactions, especially those related to government, healthcare, or financial institutions, demand higher assurance, and it is vital that the Relying Party (RP)&nbsp; confirms the authenticator’s legitimacy in these cases. To ensure that high-assurance transactions are legitimate, RPs can employ attestation to verify the authenticity and properties of the authenticator.</p>



<p>A note on terminology: The term “key” and “key pair” is common to several types of keys described in this paper. To alleviate this confusion the term “passkey” will always be used when referring to a key used to authenticate a user. Use of other instances of the term ‘key’ will be specific by either the context or a modifier such as Attestation Key.</p>



<p>In traditional password-based systems, it may be assumed that users and RPs keep passwords confidential. Because this assumption is not consistently enforced, breaches can occur. Using passkeys instead of passwords is a significant improvement, but some RPs may need more stringent policies to verify the authenticity of the authenticator and its properties.</p>



<p>Unlike passwords, passkeys use securely generated key material allowing access to websites and apps. Users and RPs rely on the authenticator for storage and management of this key material and therefore share the responsibility for secure handling of passkeys.&nbsp; All actors and components of the FIDO solution, including the authenticator, RP, and the passkey provider (when applicable), together ensure a robust security framework. This is in contrast to passwords, where the secure handling of passwords depends primarily on the user’s memory, behavior, the RP, and password managers (if used). RPs can leverage attestations to verify that passkeys are securely handled within&nbsp; properly implemented FIDO certified devices.</p>



<p>Attestation provides RPs with information about the authenticator protecting the user’s passkeys. This provides a means for the RP to enforce security policies for FIDO authentication. In the following sections, we delve deeper into the concept of attestation, its purpose, real-life scenario comparisons, and the problems attestation solves.</p>



<p>1.1 Real-World Analogies for FIDO Attestation</p>



<p>Drawing parallels with everyday security protocols offers significant insights. Both digital and physical environments demand rigorous checks and balances to validate identities and fortify trust. FIDO Attestation reflects the trust and verification processes familiar in the physical world.</p>



<p>To understand the pivotal role of FIDO attestation, consider its application in real-world identification and verification practices. These analogies underscore its integral function and efficacy:</p>



 
 Identity Document Verification: Just as individuals may produce official documents such as passports or driver’s licenses to authenticate identity, the verifier (e.g., immigration official) wants proof of the document’s authenticity and therefore checks for the relevant seals and marks. FIDO attestation provides proof of the authenticity of a user’s authenticator, offers statements for examination, and provides cryptographic signatures for verifying the authenticity of the authenticator and the statements. 



 Gaining Trust Through Authentication: Think of moments where trust is contingent on proof of identity or authority.&nbsp; For example, accessing a secure facility where a guard authenticates you based on your identity documents, authorizing access to the facility. FIDO attestation fosters trust in digital environments when used to confirm the authenticator provenance and authenticity during online registration. 



 Countering Threats and Weaknesses: In real-world scenarios, ID checks exist to counteract impersonation, forgery, and fraud. FIDO attestation identifies the origins of authenticators and assists RPs to detect registrations from devices with known vulnerabilities, thereby enabling them to ensure that users employ only secure devices. 
 
 



 2. Practical Implications and Use-Cases of FIDO Attestation 



 
<p>2.1 From the Perspective of a Relying Party&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delving deeper into FIDO attestation provides invaluable insights into critical roles fortifying authentication systems:</p>



 
 Assured Authenticator Security and Compliance: For RPs operating in sensitive sectors, for example,&nbsp; finance or the public domain, there’s a heightened need to ascertain that authentication devices are secure and meet specific standards. FIDO attestation helps ensure that authenticators accessing services are not only secure, but also adhere to specific standards and regulations. 



 Authenticator Model Specificity and Trust in FIDO Authenticator Models: FIDO attestation is tailored to distinct authenticator models, ensuring that cryptographic proofs during registrations validate said authenticator model authenticity. Beyond general trust in the attestation process, this specificity allows the RP to confirm that the passkey used in the registration request originates from a particular FIDO authenticator model. Such granularity is paramount for RPs where the details of authenticator models are crucial due to regulatory or security reasons. 



 Verification Through Attestation Signature: As a user sets up a new account, the onboarding RP can authenticate that the “attestation signature” linked to the freshly generated passkey is indeed from a genuine authenticator model. 



 Incident handling and Response: If a vulnerability is discovered in an authenticator, RPs checking attestations have the ability to discover which authenticators may be affected and require additional authentication factors or registration of a new credential for impacted users.&nbsp; 
 



<p>2.2 From the Perspective of the End-User</p>



<p>Although end users may not be aware of the technical details, FIDO attestation can enhance their online security:</p>



 
 Enhanced Trust in Services: When using services, particularly in high-assurance sectors such as&nbsp; banking or government portals, users can experience increased confidence. They understand that the RP isn’t just authenticating but is also ensuring that authenticators accessing the platform adhere to specific standards. 



 Authenticator Compliance: FIDO attestation assures RPs of authenticator compliance and security,&nbsp; giving users the benefit of reliable functionality of their authentication devices paired with desired RP-related services. 



 Transparent Registration and Onboarding: &nbsp;The registration process is designed for seamlessness, but includes an additional step when an RP requests attestation of a FIDO authenticator.&nbsp; At this step, users must provide their consent to share the attestation metadata with the RP. This ensures that while backend verifications related to attestations, certification path validations, and authenticator compliance are streamlined, the user is aware of and has approved the process. 
 
 



 3. FIDO Attestation Explained 



 
<p>In this section we describe FIDO attestation and FIDO attestation types.</p>



<p>3.1 What is FIDO Attestation?</p>



<p>Within the FIDO authentication framework, attestation is a process for verifying the authenticity of a user’s authenticator during the authentication process. The attestation can be used in conjunction with the FIDO Alliance’s metadata service [1] to get more information about the authenticator including the model and certification level. An optional level of attestation, known as enterprise attestation, allows for further verification of specific authenticators, see section 4.5.</p>



<p>Note that the term ‘attestation’ might have&nbsp; different meanings outside of the context of FIDO. This paper discusses attestation only within the scope of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>In FIDO registration, a key step is the creation of a user authentication passkey, which occurs regardless of whether attestation is involved. During this process, the user’s authenticator—such as a smartphone—generates a unique cryptographic key pair for each RP. The private key is securely stored within the authenticator, while the public key is shared with the RP, establishing a secure authentication framework. Additionally, during registration, the authenticator may provide an attestation, offering further assurance about the authenticator’s integrity.</p>



<p>In addition to generating the user’s authentication passkey, the FIDO authentication framework includes an optional attestation process. When attestation is requested, the authenticator may provide an attestation (synced passkeys do not currently provide attestations) by using an Attestation Key to sign the AAGUID&nbsp; (Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique ID) along with the passkey public key, creating signed evidence that establishes a trust anchor for the RP to validate that the authenticator properties meet the RP conditions through the MDS (FIDO Alliance’s Metadata Service [<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.4bvk7pj">1</a>], see section 3.3 for additional information).&nbsp; If the authenticator cannot provide an attestation, the RP can authenticate the user with the passkey, and may obtain authenticator information (e.g. AAGUID), but it may not obtain verifiable evidence that the required authenticator properties are present.</p>



<p>This attestation process helps protect against supply chain attacks, such as the introduction of substitute or counterfeit authenticators. By verifying the authenticity of the authenticator, the RP understands the properties of the authenticator and assesses whether it meets the expected security standards, particularly during the registration phase, to ensure the device’s legitimacy.</p>



<p>FIDO attestation is thus a key component of the broader security and privacy objectives of the framework. It minimizes reliance on passwords, fosters strong device authentication based on public-key cryptography, and aims to offer a standardized and interoperable approach to authentication across different platforms and devices.</p>



<p>3.2 Types of FIDO Attestation</p>



<p>There are several types of FIDO attestation which differ in how the attestation statement is signed. Note that none of these attestation types except Enterprise Attestation provide information about the specific authenticator. This is to preserve user privacy.</p>



 
 Self-attestation: The attestation statement is signed by the user’s passkey. This provides integrity protection for the attestation statement and provides no other assurances. 



 Basic attestation: The attestation statement is signed by a key created by the authenticator’s manufacturer and embedded into the authenticator. This provides integrity protection of the attestation statement and proof of the authenticator’s manufacturer. For privacy purposes, this key must be duplicated across many of the same authenticator’s model (current FIDO Alliance requirement is &gt;100,000 devices). It is not unique to a specific authenticator instance. 



 Attestation CA (AttCA) or Anonymization CA (AnonCA): This is similar to basic attestation, except the attestation statement is signed by a TPM Attestation Key. In this case, the TPM, a hardware-based module where cryptographic operations occur and secrets are stored securely without leaving the module, has its Attestation Key’s certificate signed by a trusted authority managing the authenticator. 



 Enterprise attestation: This is discussed in section 4.5, 
 



<p>It should be noted that the FIDO2 Specifications work along with the WebAuthn specification <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.4bvk7pj">[2].</a> The type of attestation used is determined by examining fields within the attestation object which are defined in the WebAuthn specification. Further definitions provided by the WebAuthn specification includes a number of different types of formats, for example: packed, TPM, and Android-key as well as supporting custom formats if needed.</p>



<p>3.3 Using AAGUID</p>



<p>The Authenticator Attestation GUID or simply AAGUID, uniquely identifies the authenticator’s make (manufacturer) and model. It does not uniquely identify the specific authenticator. The AAGUID&nbsp; is returned by the authenticator when attestation is requested by the RP and&nbsp; the RP may use it to determine if the authenticator’s make and model meets its policies. Among other uses, the AAGUID is the lookup value within the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/">FIDO (MDS)</a> [1] providing the RP detailed information about the authenticator.</p>



<p>The authenticator’s conveyance of the AAGUID provides no proof of its integrity or authenticity. The RP must trust the specific authenticator to provide truthful information.</p>



<p>This point is important to emphasize:</p>



 
 The AAGUID without attestation is “informational” only and does not provide any assurance of its authenticity. 



 Attestation provides a signature providing a level of assurance (depending on the type of attestation) of the authenticator’s identity. 
 
 



 4. Technical Solutions&nbsp; 



 
<p>This section describes the sequence of events and involved components that make up FIDO attestation.</p>



<p>4.1 Authentication vs. Attestation Keys&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of keys and methods for user authentication from FIDO have been introduced in previous documents, but the use of&nbsp; keys and methods used for attestation may not be familiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 User Authentication: This is the process where the user demonstrates possession of the correct system credentials, utilizing a passkey instead of the traditional password, which is a common application of FIDO technology. 



 Attestation: This is the process of the authenticator using a key that is not assigned to a user, but instead&nbsp; assigned to the authenticator,&nbsp; to digitally sign a message providing proof of the message’s authenticity. The message involved is called the “attestation statement” and contains information about the authenticator. When the attestation statement is digitally signed by the authenticator’s attestation key, the RP can verify the validity of the attestation statement. 
 



<p>In summary:</p>



 
 A passkey authenticates the user to an RP 



 An attestation key signs an attestation statement to authenticate its origin 
 



<p>As stated in section 3.3 an RP may obtain the authenticator’s make and model by simply checking the authenticator’s AAGUID against the Metadata Service to get this information. Without being digitally signed by a key trusted by the RP, the RP has no proof this information is authentic or associated with the authenticator being queried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: As discussed in section 3.2, there are several attestation types. One of these, “self-attestation”, uses the User Authentication key to sign the attestation statement. This is not technically a contradiction, but a simplification provided to allow integrity protection, not authenticity, of the attestation statement.</p>



<p>4.2 Trust in the Attestation Key – Trust Chain</p>



<p>Fundamental to attestation is the RP’s trust in the Attestation Key. The Attestation Key must be generated by a trusted source and protected by the authenticator. The trusted source is typically the authenticator’s manufacturer however, in the case of “Attestation CA (AttCA) or Anonymization CA (AnonCA)”, a trusted agent or Certification Authority (CA) is asserting the authenticity of the authenticator. The public part of the Attestation Key is obtained by the RP using a trusted channel, typically the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/">FIDO MDS</a> [1], mentioned previously.</p>



<p>4.3 FIDO Attestation Sequence</p>



<p>Attestation uses a key pair associated with an authenticator, not a user. It is important that all authenticators of the same make and model return the same attestation statement. The format of the attestation is examined later in this section, but it is important to understand that, at a high level, the attestation provides information about the type of authenticator, and it is not specific to a single device.</p>



<p>The following steps (1.a or 1.b then 2.) summarize a FIDO authenticator’s attestation lifecycle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Authenticator Manufacturing: There are two models for provisioning the Attestation Key: case “a” for roaming authenticators, such as smartphones or USB security keys used across multiple platforms, and case “b” for platform authenticators, which are built-in authentication mechanisms within devices like laptops or smartphones.</p>



<p>Note: This two-model distinction is not architecturally required by the FIDO Specification, but it is the practical implementation known today and provides a simplified explanation for the purpose of this paper. Also, the descriptions are generalizations and manufacturers may deploy different methods than described here – this is only a generalization.</p>



 
 Roaming Authenticator: The authenticator manufacturer generates an Attestation Keypair (AK) for a specific authenticator model. The manufacturer creates a certificate with the AK’s public key. The AK Certificate is commonly put into the MDS. This allows a RP to retrieve the AK Certificate from a trusted source, MDS, when an AAGUID is provided. The AK Certificate itself is usually signed with the authenticator’s manufacturer’s issuer key. This creates a verifiable cryptographic chain from the authenticator back to its manufacturer. 



 Platform Authenticator: The authenticator is not shipped from its manufacturer with an attestation key that can be used for FIDO attestation. Instead, it relies on persistent keys within the platform authenticator. These keys are crucial cryptographic elements that the attestation service uses to generate a FIDO Attestation Key. The attestation service is trusted by the Relying Party to provide assurance in the platform authenticator’s integrity and compliance. The attestation service creates an attestation key that is used to sign an attestation object which asserts the properties of the authenticator. The RP must trust the attestation service in the same way it trusts the roaming authenticator’s manufacturer. 
 



<p>2. User Provisioning with Attestation: During registration (setting up the new account), a new User Credential (a passkey) is created with a unique cryptographic key pair, and the public key is sent to the RP. The RP may optionally require an attestation. Note that the User or the authenticator may ignore the requirement for attestation. If the authenticator possesses an attestation key and it is allowed by the User, the user’s public passkey (along with the attestation statement) will be sent to the RP signed with the attestation private key. This allows the RP to verify the attestation statement which includes the User’s Public passkey for the newly created User. Therefore, providing confidence/proof that the User’s private passkey originated from a specific authenticator with known properties.</p>



<p>4.4 A General Description of the Attestation Lifecycle</p>







<p>The attestation key generally has an associated attestation certificate, which links to a trusted root certificate of the Manufacturer. Once the RP has determined the authenticity of the signed attestation statement, the RP can use the attestation statement along with the MDS to learn more about the authenticator. For example, the RP may want to understand what level of encryption is used and what type of activation secrets is leveraged (e.g., biometrics) with a certain level of accuracy, etc. In order to get details about the authenticator an AAGUID value identifying the authenticator model is sent to the RP along with the newly created public passkey. Since the&nbsp; AAGUID represents a specific group of authenticator instances such as specific product release with a specific characteristic, specific form factor, or enterprise branding, an RP can use this AAGUID to lookup more information about the authenticator from the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/">MDS</a>.</p>



<p>As shown in the diagram, the attestation object, if provided, will indicate the format of the attestation statement, and then include some data the RP can examine. The attestation object includes a statement that typically contains a signature as well as a certificate or similar data providing provenance information for the attestation public key.&nbsp; Detail of the attestation object is provided in section <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.3cqmetx">9.1</a> of the Appendix.</p>



<p>RPs should first verify the signature of the attestation statement and once verified, then examine the attestation statement.&nbsp; Once the RP has identified the attestation statement’s format and type, the RP then reviews the contents and compares the contents against its policy.</p>



<p>An example attestation response resulting from a&nbsp; direct request to the authenticator by an RP is provided in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.1rvwp1q">9.2</a> of the Appendix. The AAGUID provided in the attestation response can be used to obtain additional&nbsp; details about the authenticator from the FIDO Metadata Service.</p>



<p>4.5 Enterprise Attestation</p>



<p>By default, FIDO allows an authenticator to provide only product information using the AAGUID and high-level information about its type and capabilities, explicitly prohibiting an authenticator from providing uniquely identifying information.&nbsp; However, Enterprise attestation removes that limitation, as it binds a unique authenticator key pair to a serial number or equivalent unique identifier.</p>



<p>4.5.1 Use Cases</p>



<p>Enterprises actively manage authenticators for various purposes and are essential for securing high-value assets. While employees may select their own authenticators, enterprises may limit authenticators per employee and revoke them upon a departure or loss, as they oversee the entire process from purchase to collection. Additionally, enterprises may prioritize manageability and traceability to safeguard resources. Upon a threat incident, forensic investigations may need to trace activities related to a particular authenticator and correlate the authenticator’s usage activity patterns in order to discover anomalies or the source of threat. Tight management enhances their ability to ensure non-repudiation for transactions. High-risk users may be assigned dedicated authenticators from the enterprise for access to restricted sensitive information or services. These authenticators are assigned specific PINs and are acquired through trusted supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certain enterprise deployments require the use of FIDO authenticators with enterprise attestation in order to identify specific device identities (e.g. device serial numbers). Enterprise Attestation validation must also be supported by the organization’s specific Relying Parties. These practices actively address enterprise-specific needs for improved control over device provisioning and lifecycle management.</p>



<p>4.5.2 Process</p>







<p>4.5.2.1 Provisioning&nbsp;</p>



<p>Provisioning for enterprise attestation, is modified from the process described in section 4.3 to include both authenticator unique information in the attestation statement and to add any specific RPs permitted to receive this unique information from any set of RPs permanently “burned” into the authenticator by the authenticator’s manufacturer. The authenticator performs enterprise attestation only to those RPs provisioned to the authenticator. Other RPs may still perform any other type of attestation that excludes the unique identifier.</p>



<p>Authenticators that have the enterprise attestation burned into them must not be sold on the open market and may only be supplied directly from the authenticator’s manufacturer to the RP.&nbsp; An RP wanting an enterprise attestation enabled authenticator will order them directly from the authenticator’s manufacturer by providing a list of RP IDs (RPIDs). These specific RPIDs are the ones permanently burned/written to the authenticator.</p>



<p>4.5.2.2 User Registration with Enterprise Attestation</p>



<p>During a FIDO user registration described in section 4.3, the RP may indicate the need for enterprise attestation. This will uniquely associate the user with the specific authenticator by providing proof of the authenticator’s unique identifier. During user registration the authenticator verifies that the requesting RP (using its RPID) is among those listed in the permanently provisioned list of RPID permitted to perform enterprise attestation. If approved, this unique identifier is added to the attestation object and signed by the Attestation Key. The RP should validate the attestation object and, optionally, the certificate link/chain used to sign the attestation object. The RP can then verify, at user registration time, that the unique identifier was indeed purchased by the enterprise and may include that verification in its records.</p>



<p>The implementation used by an RP to authenticate the uniquely identifying information varies by authenticator. Some authenticators may use vendor facilitated methods where the enterprise provides a list of the RP IDs to the manufacturer and those are imprinted into the authenticators. Another is where some enterprise managed platforms maintain a policy, such as an enterprise managed browser. Rather than imprinting the list of allowed RPs into the authenticator, an enterprise managed platform will make the determination if the enterprise attestation is provided to the RP based on the policy.</p>
 



 5. Privacy Implications and Considerations 



 
<p>While attestation provides a valuable assertion of trust for authenticators, privacy concerns can arise from the information shared during attestation. Some privacy considerations include:</p>



 
 While the attestation properties described in this paper include a broad set of privacy controls, implementers should consider these capabilities against regional and local privacy policies. 



 Attestation enables sharing information, such as authenticator’s make and model, firmware version, or manufacturer details, with the RP. Concerns may arise regarding the potential exposure of sensitive authenticator-specific data and the subsequent tracking or profiling of users based on this information.&nbsp; For this very reason, an attestation batch of at least 100,000 is recommended so it is not a small pool to identify devices from. 



 Non-enterprise attestation prevents the association of multiple passkeys within an authenticator with different RPs, thus safeguarding user privacy. For example, a person using a single authenticator may create a User Authentication passkey (passkey1) for RP 1 (RP1), then create a new User Authentication passkey (passkey2) for RP 2 (RP2). Even though the person is using the same physical authenticator for both RPs and using attestation, even if RP1 and RP2 collaborate, they cannot determine that passkey1 and passkey2 are from the same authenticator, therefore, they cannot determine the transactions are from the same person. 



 Enterprise attestation adds uniquely identifying information (e.g., a device serial number) allowing an authorized RP to track the use of a specific authenticator across several pre-provisioned RPs within the enterprise. It is expected that users in this environment have an understanding of this property and the value it adds to the enterprise.&nbsp; 
 
 



 6. Adoption and Deployment Considerations 



 
<p>RPs can determine the registration requirements for a FIDO authenticator, as&nbsp; reflected in their preference for attestation conveyance. Some RPs may not require attestations to decide if registration is allowed. Other RPs may have security requirements that require an attestation object in order to make risk decisions. Security requirements may be based on characteristics of the authenticator (e.g., whether it requires a PIN) or could be as specific as the model of authenticator(s) allowed. Finally, in more protected environments, some RPs may require additional enterprise attestations to ensure an authenticator is known, controlled, and trusted by the enterprise.</p>
 



 7. Conclusion 



 
<p>FIDO attestation, a component of the FIDO and WebAuthn standards, validates the authenticity of a user’s authenticator. This process provides a defense against various threats such as supply chain attacks, counterfeit authenticators, and substitution attacks. For RPs requiring higher authentication assurance, attestation is a FIDO-centric mechanism to obtain that assurance. For RPs that need to ensure the authenticity of specific authenticators,&nbsp; attestation provides these RPs assurance that they are dealing with a known and trusted device.</p>



<p>By generating unique key pairs for each RP that a user registers with, FIDO underscores its commitment to user security, eliminating potential cross-service vulnerabilities. The enterprise attestation feature provides organizations with better management of authenticators used by their personnel and is vital to environments that prioritize precise device management.</p>



<p>FIDO attestation brings certain privacy considerations. Disclosing authenticator-specific information, user device fingerprinting and the potential for user tracking, all highlight the importance of a privacy-aware approach. All stakeholders, including RPs, manufacturers, and users, must navigate the path between enhancing security and preserving user privacy.</p>



<p>FIDO attestation is adaptable.&nbsp; RPs have the discretion to request their desired level of attestation, ensuring a tailored approach suitable for both specialized services and large enterprises.</p>



<p>In summary, FIDO attestation augments online authentication. With a focus on public-key cryptography, unique key pairs, and specific attestation processes, its efficacy is maximized through careful deployment, thorough understanding of its capabilities, and a consistent commitment to user privacy.</p>

 Since its introduction in February 2024, maintainers have focused on significantly enhancing Hyperledger Web3j, a crucial tool for Java and Android developers working within the Ethereum ecosystem. Web3j has been instrumental in making blockchain development accessible to a broader range of developers, particularly those who work in environments where Java is the primary language.

  On July 9, 2012, not long after The Intention Economy&nbsp;came out, I got word from Gary Rosen of The Wall Street Journal that the paper’s publisher, Robert Thomson, loved the book and wanted “an excerpt/adaptation” from the book for the cover story of&nbsp; the WSJ’s Weekend Review section. The image above is the whole cover […]

 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444873204577535352521092154"></a><p>The cover page of the Weekend Review section of The Wall Street Journal, July 20, 2012</p> 
<p>On July 9, 2012, not long after <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy</a>&nbsp;came out, I got word from <a href="https://x.com/garyrosenWSJ">Gary Rosen</a> of <a href="https://wsj.com">The Wall Street Journal</a> that the paper’s publisher, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Thomson_(executive)">Robert Thomson</a>, loved the book and wanted “an excerpt/adaptation” from the book for the cover story of&nbsp; the WSJ’s Weekend Review section. The image above is the whole cover of that section, which appeared later that month.</p>
<p>In the article I described a new way to shop:</p>
<blockquote><p>An “intentcast” goes out to the marketplace, revealing only what’s required to attract offers. No personal information is revealed, except to vendors with whom you already have a trusted relationship.</p></blockquote>
<p>I also said that this form of shopping—</p>
<blockquote><p>…can be made possible only by the full empowerment of individuals—that is, by making them both independent of controlling organizations and better able to engage with them. Work toward these goals is going on today, inside a new field called VRM, for vendor relationship management. VRM works on the demand side of the marketplace: for you, the customer, rather than for sellers and third parties on the supply side.</p></blockquote>
<p>The scenario I described was set ten years out: in 2022, a future now two years in the past. In the meantime, many approaches to intentcasting have come and gone. The ones that have stayed are Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Instacart, TaskRabbit, Thumbtack, and a few others. (Thumbtack participated in the early days of ProjectVRM.) We include them in <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work#Intentcasting">our list of intentcasting services</a> because they model at least some of what we’d like intentcasting to be. What they don’t model is the full empowerment of individuals&nbsp;as independent actors: ones whose intentions <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/customers-need-scale-f8e045b90304">can scale across whole markets</a> and many sellers:</p>
 <p>Scale gives the customer single ways to deal with many companies. For example, she should be able to change her address or last name with every company she deals with in one move—or to send an intention-to-buy “intentcast” to a whole market.</p> 
<p>Should we call the sum of it “<a href="https://customercommons.org/blog/the-dawn-of-i-commerce/">i-commerce</a>“? Just a thought.</p>
<p>Back to the Wall Street Journal article. It is clear to me now that&nbsp;The Customer as a God would have been a much better title for my book than The Intention Economy, which needs explaining and sounds too much like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Attention-Economy-Understanding-Currency-Business/dp/1578518717">The Attention Economy</a>, which was the title of the book that came out ten years earlier. (I’ve met people who have read that one and thought it was mine—or worse, called my book “The Attention Economy” and sent readers to the wrong one.)</p>
<p>Of course, calling customers gods is hyperbole: exaggeration for effect.&nbsp; VRM has always been about customers coming to companies as equals. The “revolution in personal empowerment” in the subhead of “The Customer as a God” is about equality, not supremacy. For more on that, see the <a href="https://projectvrm.org/?s=r-button&amp;category=r-button">eleven posts</a> before this one that mention the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/R-button">R-button</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/R-button"></a></p>
<p>That symbol (or pair of symbols) is about two parties who attract each other (like two magnets) and engage as equals. It’s a symbol that only makes full sense in open markets where free customers prove more valuable than captive ones. Not markets where customers are mere “targets” to “acquire,” “capture,” “manage,” “control” or “lock in” as if they were slaves or cattle.</p>
<p>The stage of Internet growth called Web 2.0 was all about those forms of capture, control, and coerced dependency. We’re still in it. (What’s being called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> is, while “decentralized” (note: not distributed), it is also based on tokens and blockchain. ) Investment in customer independence rounds to nil.</p>
<p>And that’s probably the&nbsp;biggest reason intentcasting as we imagined it in the first place has not taken off. It is very hard, inside industrial-age business norms (which we still have) to see customers as equals, or as human beings who should be equipped to lead in the dance between buyers and sellers, or demand and supply, in truly open marketplaces. It’s still easier to see us as mere consumers (which <a href="https://www.jerrymichalski.com/">Jerry Michalski</a> calls “gullets with wallets and eyeballs”).</p>
<p>So, where is there hope?</p>
<p>How about AI? It’s at the late end of its craze stage, but still here to stay, and <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en">hot as ever</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en"></a></p>
<p>Can AI provide the “revolution in personal empowerment” we’ve been looking for here since 2006? Can it prove <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page#VRM_Principles">our thesis—that free customers are more valuable than captive ones—to themselves and to the marketplace</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">Only if it’s personal</a>.</p>
<p>If it is, then the market is <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2024/06/11/pai-greenfield/">a greenfield</a>.</p>
<p>Some of us here are working at putting AI on both sides of intentcasting ceremonies. If you have, or know about, one or more of those approaches (or any intentcasting approaches), please share what you know, or what you’re got, in the comments below. And come to VRM Day on October 28. I’ll be putting up the invite for that shortly.</p>

<p>In the years since <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> were first announced, a lot has changed in their availability to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkey-use-case/consumer/">consumers</a>, nomenclature across platforms, and even <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">implementation</a> requirements. However, one thing that has yet to change is the need for more awareness on what passkeys are, how they work, and their benefits.</p>



<p>In this webinar we debunk common misconceptions associated with passkeys, which we’ve heard from customers, FIDO members and industry participants, and see pop up across social networks. By doing so, we’re confident we can help drive our industry towards a passwordless world.</p>

 Part 1: Three Key Principles <p>This is the first post in a series exploring the fundamentals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">Systems Thinking</a>. This is an approach that helps us make sense of complex situations by considering the whole system rather than just its individual parts.</p><p>Why is Systems Thinking important? Whether you’re navigating challenges in your professional life or making decisions in your personal life, Systems Thinking offers a series of powerful lenses through which to view the interconnectedness of various elements. By understanding how different parts of a system influence one another, you can identify more effective solutions, anticipate unintended consequences, and make better-informed decisions. This holistic approach is particularly valuable in today’s complex world, where problems are rarely isolated and simple fixes can often lead to new&nbsp;issues!</p><p>This series is made up&nbsp;of:</p>  Part 1: Three Key Principles (this&nbsp;post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-77eb29d510a4">Part 2: Understanding Feedback&nbsp;Loops</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-8af6844edacd">Part 3: Identifying Leverage&nbsp;Points</a>  <p>In this first post, we’ll explore three key principles that are foundational to a Systems Thinking approach: Drawing a Boundary, Multiple Perspectives, and Holistic Thinking. These principles provide the groundwork for seeing beyond surface-level problems and understanding the deeper, often hidden, relationships and patterns within any system. By applying these principles, you can begin to approach challenges with a mindset that seeks to comprehend the whole rather than merely addressing symptoms, leading to more sustainable and impactful solutions.</p> 1. Drawing a&nbsp;boundary <p>“The only problems that have simple solutions are simple problems. Complex problems have complex solutions.” — Russell&nbsp;Ackoff</p><p>In Systems Thinking, one of the first steps is to draw a boundary around the system you’re examining. This boundary defines what is included within the system and what is considered external. It’s crucial because the way you set this boundary determines the scope of your analysis and influences the insights you&nbsp;gain.</p><p>A boundary can be drawn in various ways. It might cut cross-functionally across an organisation, considering multiple departments and their interactions. Alternatively, it could include several organisations, looking at an entire ecosystem rather than a single entity. These choices lead to different conclusions and strategies. Boundaries help manage complexity by allowing you to concentrate on specific parts of the system without getting overwhelmed by the&nbsp;whole.</p><p>For example, when we started working with the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC) based at MIT, we had to make a decision about where to draw the boundary. We could have drawn it very narrowly to focus just on the DCC team, which would have focused mainly on operational issues and decision-making. Our brief, however, was to help with a communications strategy, which meant drawing a wider one. This included organisations who were aware of the DCC, but not directly involved with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Draw a boundary too wide, and it becomes difficult to identify ways to create meaningful change. For example, if we included all of Higher Education, it would have become an impossible project to manage. In the end, we identified key stakeholder groups (e.g. registrars) and included them within the boundary. That meant purposely excluding other stakeholders (e.g. vendors) so that we could work on communications that would resonate and create&nbsp;change.</p> 2. Multiple perspectives <p>“We live in a world of problems, not puzzles. Problems are tangled with uncertainty, ambiguity, and value conflicts.” — Geoffrey&nbsp;Vickers</p><p>Every system is viewed differently depending on the perspective of the observer. Recognising and incorporating multiple perspectives is a cornerstone of Systems Thinking. Each stakeholder sees the system from their own unique angle, and by considering these diverse viewpoints, we can uncover hidden dynamics and potential conflicts.</p><p>For instance, with the DCC project, we needed to gain the perspectives of different members of the team, the Leadership Council, and key stakeholder groups. Each had different opinions and concerns, which helped us create an effective and holistic communications plan, balancing the needs of all stakeholders and provide a way&nbsp;forward.</p> 3. Holistic&nbsp;thinking <p>“Insight, I believe, refers to the process by which a shift in perspective reveals a coherent pattern that had previously been obscured from view.” — Mary Catherine Bateson</p><p>Holistic thinking involves seeing the system as a whole rather than just focusing on individual parts. It contrasts with reductionist approaches, which break down a system into its components. While reductionism can be useful, it often misses the interactions and relationships that make the system function.</p><p>In the DCC communications strategy project, it was important not to take a reductionist approach focused on individual aspects, but rather think more holistically. We needed a way that considered how these elements interact. For example, by creating a cadence for communications which re-uses content from one platform, and which helps scaffold stakeholder understanding. By considering the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem as an interconnected whole, we were able to think about how a communications strategy could encourage adoption, without burning out DCC&nbsp;staff.</p> Conclusion <p>In this post, we’ve explored the three foundational pillars of Systems Thinking: Drawing a Boundary, Multiple Perspectives, and Holistic Thinking. These principles offer a powerful framework for tackling complex problems, allowing you to see the bigger picture, understand diverse viewpoints, and recognise the intricate connections that drive systems. By applying these concepts, you can develop more effective strategies, avoid unintended consequences, and create sustainable solutions.</p><p>At We Are Open Co-op, we specialise in helping organisations integrate these Systems Thinking principles into their everyday practices. Whether you’re navigating organisational change, developing strategies, or addressing societal challenges, our approach can help you uncover deeper insights and achieve lasting&nbsp;impact.</p><p>If you’re interested in how Systems Thinking can transform your organisation, we’d love to collaborate with you. Stay tuned for the next post in this series, where we’ll delve into practical applications of these principles, providing you with tools and examples to put Systems Thinking into&nbsp;action.</p> References   Ackoff, R.L.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>If Tina had been in the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/photo-gallery/">Oceania Room at Te Papa Tongarewa last Tuesday</a>, and for the two&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;that preceded it, like some of you were, I think this would have been her observation. It certainly was for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vanessaronanpearce_digitalidentitynz-innovation-payments-activity-7229439216848412672-YzKe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">another singer</a>. The buzz in the room was palpable from the very start. Compared to the previous two years, this event saw increased attendance (214 registered, 202 in the room), more international and local speakers, and an increase in panels and roundtable discussions. It’s tangible evidence that Digital Trust is entering the consciousness of more people, accompanied by a desire to ‘get stuff done’. To that end – amongst several other great presentations, panels and exhibits of things currently in progress for those that wish to opt-in – NZTA showcased its&nbsp;<a href="https://nzta.govt.nz/about-us/app/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwt4a2BhD6ARIsALgH7Dp4rtVIKTd5kCl3AqZhTLoLAgzvRz2ym6ebiMtIvag2xz7M_dSomXoaArUTEALw_wcB">NZTA vehicle status app</a>, DINZ member Worldline walked us through its<a href="https://www.paymark.co.nz/blog/safer-faster-simpler-how-a-digital-identity-could-transform-our-day-to-day-lives/">&nbsp;Digital Identity Acceptance Network</a>&nbsp;at POS terminals, and DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xebo.me/">Xebo&nbsp;</a>demonstrated the application of its information assurance platform for a document (quote) using verifiable credentials in the exhibition area. We are hugely grateful to the Hui’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/partners/">partners</a>, speakers and panellists, without whom this fantastic event would not have been possible.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Awareness and education play the most critical role in people’s adoption of these new services. In their absence, misinformation and disinformation fill the vacuum. A case in point is the jaw-dropping statistic from&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final-1.pdf">DINZ’s research published last year</a>&nbsp;regarding the extent to which organisations are trusted to protect identity and use personal data responsibly. Government agencies only scored 51%. And yet,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/information-sharing/approved-information-sharing-agreements/">OPC’s Approved Information Sharing list&nbsp;</a>is much more limited and evidentially contradicts the surveillance conspiracies that swirl around the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly with the opt-in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identity/trust-framework/">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework</a>, where it’s not widely known that it’s primarily targeted at service providers to help keep their clients’ (you and me) information private and secure from fraudsters by introducing best practices, such as adopting protected reusable verifiable credentials that you decide who gets to see – so you are not forced to hand over documents to all and sundry for copying, which carry the risk of targeted data theft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my closing remarks at the Hui, I asked each attendee to consider what single action they can undertake right now to improve Digital Trust in Aotearoa. And I’m asking again here. There is a private-sector-initiated awareness and education module all set to go. Will your organisation step up to its corporate social responsibility in this domain and help sponsor it?&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">Reach out to me</a>&nbsp;if you’re interested to know more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, please take some time to listen to the first of DINZ’s new podcast series, Digital Identity in Focus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ5DHM28YRM&amp;list=PLvjBoMqh1G6_AY36W4nbUdvACyMmjvp8y">here</a>.

  <p>Addressing the Challenges of FAIR Data Implementation</p><p>The paper addresses a critical issue in implementing the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. While many research groups strive to make their data FAIR, they often encounter challenges documenting the context in which data was collected, processed, and analysed. This lack of machine-actionable, contextual metadata frequently renders data less reusable and visible outside the immediate research team.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, the authors present the first version of the Semantic Engine, a tool designed to facilitate the creation of decentralised, machine-actionable metadata schemas. This tool is handy when data is collected across multiple projects and institutions, such as Agri-Food Data Canada.</p><p>Leveraging Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)</p><p>The Semantic Engine is built upon the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a flexible and extensible standard hosted by the Human Colossus Foundation. OCA supports decentralised collaboration and reproducibility by allowing multiple contributors to work on different aspects of a data schema without compromising the integrity of the core data structure. This approach is particularly beneficial in the agri-food sector, where data heterogeneity and decentralised research efforts are expected.</p><p>The Semantic Engine is built upon the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a flexible and extensible standard hosted by the Human Colossus Foundation. OCA supports decentralised collaboration and reproducibility by allowing multiple contributors to work on different aspects of a data schema without compromising the integrity of the core data structure. This approach is particularly beneficial in the agri-food sector, where data heterogeneity and decentralised research efforts are expected.</p><p>Applications and Future Implications</p><p>The Semantic Engine, freely accessible at <a href="https://semanticengine.org/">semanticengine.org</a>, allows researchers to create, edit, and manage OCA-based schemas. It has been thoroughly tested by researchers at the University of Guelph and is designed to be user-friendly for the broader research community.</p><p>The potential applications of OCA and the Semantic Engine extend beyond the agri-food sector. The paper highlights ongoing projects in Canada and Switzerland and the EU Horizon project 'NextGen,' which uses OCA to harmonise semantic data in cardiovascular personalized medicine.</p><p>The release of the "Decentralised Semantics: A Semantic Engine User Perspective" paper represents a significant step forward in making research data more FAIR and usable. By leveraging the Semantic Engine and OCA, researchers can ensure that their data is well-documented, reproducible, and accessible to a broader audience. The Human Colossus Foundation is proud to support this critical work and looks forward to its continued impact on the research community.</p><p>You can access the full paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2024-042">here</a> and explore the Semantic Engine at <a href="https://semanticengine.org/">semanticengine.org</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, the <a href="https://openid.net/cg/gain-poc/">GAIN POC Community Group</a> has been working steadily on demonstrating that disparate digital identity implementations can be integrated. We have been through two cycles that largely ended up with the same high-level process:</p>
 
 Agree specifics 
 Implement code changes 
 Integrate &amp; demonstrate interoperability 
 
<p>The two cycles were quite different at a technical level with the first having been based on <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance</a> (OIDC4IDA) and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>. The findings of this round were partially documented in the whitepaper “<a href="https://openid.net/announcing-gain-in-2023-whitepaper/">Gain in 2023</a>.” The second cycle was focussed on <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/specifications/">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a> (OID4VCI).</p>
<p>Both cycles were successful in that they:</p>
 
 Resulted in functional demonstrations 
 Enabled participants to learn a lot about the challenges of integrating diverse digital identity systems 
 Provided participants with clearer specifications, enhancing understanding 
 Led to valuable feedback for other working groups. 
 
<p>The latest cycle has successfully delivered several integrated parties using a profile of <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/specifications/">OID4VCI</a> (ID-1) issuing an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VC</a> with the following integrations demonstrated:</p>
<p>– Bundesdruckerei Issuance to Meeco, Talao and Datev wallets<br>– Meeco Issuance to Talao wallet<br>– Authlete Issuance to Meeco, Talao and Datev wallets<br>– Boruta Issuance to Talao wallet</p>
<p>The Community Group continues to progress with next steps to include OpenID for Verifiable Presentations, and a collaboration with the Open Identity Exchange that leverages OpenID Federation to enable the passage of Trust Framework metadata. &nbsp;There has been work on this already by a few of the members so this phase should have a flying start!</p>
<p>Are you inspired by the progress we’ve made or curious how you can contribute to the next phases? We’re always looking for more collaborators to bring fresh perspectives and expertise to our group. Visit our website to sign up and join the GAIN POC CG now!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">GLEIF</a> is pleased to have broadened its engagement and participation in <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP)</a> by becoming a member of the ToIP Steering Committee in March 2024, recognizing the importance of well-functioning governance to the ongoing success of the foundation.&nbsp;GLEIF has been a member of ToIP, as a Founding Contributor member, since May 2020.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>, GLEIF has pioneered a new form of digitized organizational identity to meet the global need for automated identification, authentication and verification of legal entities across a range of industries. By creating the vLEI, GLEIF is now answering to this urgent and unmet need of pioneering a multi-stakeholder effort to create a new global ecosystem for organizational digital identity.</p>



<p>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier vLEI concept is simple: It is the secure digital counterpart of a conventional <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a>. In other words, it is a digitally trustworthy version of the 20-digit LEI code which is automatically verified, without the need for human intervention. The vLEI concept is also very much in-line with ToIP Technical and Governance Frameworks as detailed below.</p>



<p>The vLEI Trust Chain demonstrates the ability to chain the issuance of vLEI credentials as well as providing the foundation for the automated verification of vLEIs back to GLEIF which enable cryptographic verification of the identity of an organization back to its validated LEI identity.</p>







<p>vLEIs go further though in being able to cryptographically tie persons to organizations in the roles in which the persons are representing or engaging with these organizations. vLEI Role Credentials combine three concepts – (1) the organization’s identity, represented by the LEI, (2) a person’s identity and (3) the role that the person plays for the organization.&nbsp;</p>







<p>GLEIF works to advance digital trust standards in the neutral ToIP forum through participation in the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">Ecosystem Foundry Working Group</a>, the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/02/new-issuer-governance-requirements-guide-for-verifiable-credentials-public-comment-needed/">Issuer Requirements Task Force</a> of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">Governance Stack Working Group</a> and as a co-chair of both the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ACDC/KERI Task Force</a> and <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technical Stack Working Group</a>.&nbsp;It is here in which the technical specifications of the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">KERI Suite</a> have been drafted and have begun the process of approval to become published ToIP standards. The <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">KERI Suite of specifications</a> is made up of 3 documents – the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification, the Authentic Chained Data Containere (ACDC) specification and the Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) specification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GLEIF also contributed to the development of the ToIP Ecosystem <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">Governance Metamodel</a> and <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">companion guide</a>.&nbsp;The verifiable LEI (vLEI) Ecosystem Governance Framework is based on the ToIP Governance Metamodel.</p>

 A step-by-step guide from&nbsp;WAO Image CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/behind-the-scenes-of-our-new-project-on-job-readiness-credentials-30aa9580ca18">recent post</a> we outlined the early stages of our user research and evaluation project with Jobs for the Future (JFF) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Building on that, we also <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/key-questions-for-user-research-design-5edfab6046dd">shared a post</a> on the principles that drive our approach to user research.</p><p>Now, we offer a comprehensive guide for those who are embarking on user research for the first time, or those looking to refine their current practices.*</p> 1. Define the Scope&nbsp;🔍 <p>Every successful project starts with a clear definition of its scope. This involves establishing the “Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How” before taking any further steps. By doing so, we create a shared understanding with our clients, which is vital for ensuring that everyone is on the same page. This clarity enables us to guide the project effectively, making informed decisions at every stage. Without a well-defined scope, projects can easily lose focus, leading to wasted time and resources.</p> 2. Identify Stakeholder Groups&nbsp;👫 <p>Identifying the relevant stakeholders is the next crucial step. Stakeholders are those who have an interest in the outcome of the project or who may be affected by it. For our JFF/IRC project, we concentrated on engaging employers, IRC staff, and, where possible, IRC clients. Each group brought unique insights that enriched our understanding of the Job Readiness Credential’s effectiveness. Engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders ensures that the research reflects a wide range of experiences and perspectives, making the findings more robust and actionable.</p> 3. Create Surveys (Quantitative Data)&nbsp;📊 <p>Once stakeholder groups are identified, we design surveys tailored to each group to gather quantitative data. This data is essential for identifying trends and patterns that might not be immediately obvious. For example, in our work on this project, we developed a survey for employers that asked them to rate various aspects of the Job Readiness Credential, including its design and usability. The data collected provided a solid foundation for further analysis, allowing us to make evidence-based recommendations. Surveys are a powerful tool for collecting data at scale, providing a broad overview that can guide more detailed exploration.</p> 4. Develop a User Research Guide (Qualitative Data)&nbsp;📝 <p>Quantitative data provides a broad picture, but to gain a deeper understanding, we complement it with qualitative research. This involves developing detailed guides for our interviews, which help us stay focused while remaining open to unexpected insights. The qualitative data gathered through interviews adds depth and context to our findings. For instance, while a survey might tell us that a particular feature is unpopular, an interview can reveal the underlying reasons why. By combining quantitative and qualitative data, we create a more comprehensive picture of the user experience.</p> 5. Create Transcripts 🎤 <p>Conducting interviews is only the beginning. To extract meaningful insights, we transcribe the conversations using tools like <a href="http://sonix.ai">Sonix.ai</a>. These transcripts are then reviewed and edited to ensure clarity and accuracy. This step is crucial because it allows us to focus on the most relevant insights without losing any nuance. By thoroughly reviewing the transcripts, we ensure that the final analysis accurately reflects the participants’ perspectives. This meticulous approach to data processing is what allows us to provide our clients with reliable and actionable insights.</p> 6. Apply Snowball Sampling&nbsp;❄️ <p>In some cases, the initial set of stakeholders might not be sufficient to capture the full range of perspectives. This is where snowball sampling comes in. By asking participants to recommend others who might have relevant insights, we can expand our research to include a wider range of voices. For example, in the JFF/IRC project, we explored the possibility of engaging a representative from Indeed, the HRTech platform. This approach allows us to gather additional perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked, ensuring that our research is as comprehensive as&nbsp;possible</p> 7. Use AI to Gain Initial Insights&nbsp;🤖 <p>With the increasing availability of AI tools, we’ve integrated them into our process to generate early insights from the data we collect. Tools like GPT-4o and Claude help us quickly identify key themes and patterns in the data. These AI-generated summaries provide a useful starting point, allowing us to focus our analysis on the most promising areas. However, AI insights are not the final word; we carefully review and refine them, combining them with our own expertise to ensure a balanced and nuanced analysis. This approach allows us to work more efficiently without sacrificing quality.</p> 8. Synthesise Findings&nbsp;📚 <p>After collecting and analysing both quantitative and qualitative data, we synthesise the findings into a comprehensive report. This report brings together the survey results, interview insights, AI-generated perspectives, and our own analysis. The goal is to provide our clients with a clear and actionable summary of our findings. We often create both a visual summary and a more detailed report. The visual summary is designed for quick reference, while the detailed report offers a deeper dive into the data, providing clients with the insights they need to make informed decisions. By presenting our findings in this way, we ensure that our research is not only informative but also practical and easy to&nbsp;use.</p> Conclusion <p>At We Are Open Co-op, user research is all about helping people make better decisions with insights they can trust. Our experience with the Job Readiness Credential project shows how dedicated we are to this&nbsp;work.</p><p>We’re here to support you in your own research efforts, whether you’re just starting out or looking to refine your approach. As our work progresses, we’ll continue to share insights that can help you make the most of your user research&nbsp;journey.</p><p>* Note that user research and user testing can get very involved and scientific. Going into more detail and depth is definitely important if you are doing things at scale. This post is aimed at encouraging those who may not have in-house capacity to get started for the first&nbsp;time!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/demystifying-user-research-e345d309abab">Demystifying User Research</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An important paper on digital identity has just been released. “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Personhood Credentials: Artificial Intelligence and the Value of Privacy-Preserving Tools to Distinguish Who Is Real Online,</a>” published by researchers at a wide range of institutions, including OpenAI, Harvard Society of Fellows, MIT, and Collective Intelligence Project, explores how Personhood Credentials (PHCs) can enhance safety and privacy for humans on an internet where AI users outnumber humans. <a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF</a>, including DIF members Microsoft and <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">SpruceID</a>, is honored to have contributed to this paper, and we share this as a call to action to the decentralized identity community and beyond, and an opportunity to build PHC systems the right way.</p><p>The PHC paper addresses the risks posed by AI advances to traditional identity verification methods, such as the ability to solve CAPTCHAs and create realistic human-imitating videos. The implications are clear: our existing verification methods are becoming less reliable, and we must act quickly to reduce harms associated with deceptive fakes at scale. At the same time, we must avoid overcorrecting in ways that could compromise privacy and civil liberties.</p><p>We need a new building block that allows people to prove they are human, without revealing additional personally identifying information. The paper proposes “Personhood Credentials” (PHCs) as a solution, and further establishes requirements to mitigate privacy harms that could be introduced upon issuance and use of the credentials.</p><p>These requirements are thoughtfully designed to ensure both effectiveness and privacy:</p><blockquote>1. Credential limits (1 credential per person per issuer): The PHC issuer aims to issue only one credential per person and provides ways to mitigate the impact of transfer or theft of credentials.<br>    a. Issuers check one-per-person requirement at enrollment: The issuer has an effective check of whether a person has already received a personhood credential from them.<br>    b. Expiry or regular re-authentication: To mitigate the theft or transfer of credentials, there is a periodic process designed to reduce credential use by someone other than the original holder<br><br>2. Unlinkable pseudonymity (privacy): PHCs let a user interact with services anonymously through a service-specific pseudonym; the user’s digital activity is untraceable by the issuer and unlinkable across service providers, even if service providers and issuers collude.<br>    a. Minimal identifying information stored during enrollment: The issuer associates minimum necessary identifying information between a specific personhood credential and its holder.<br>    b. Minimal disclosure during usage: When a user presents a personhood credential to a service provider, it reveals to the service provider nothing more than “this person holds a valid PHC” or, with the user’s authorization, “this person holds a valid PHC not yet used with this service.”<br>    c. Unlinkability by default: By default, service providers or issuers cannot trace or link usage activity across uses, even if issuers and service providers collude. The issuer, by default, learns nothing when a PHC has been used. Service providers do not learn anything when a PHC that has been used with their service is used with another service.</blockquote><p>Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity standards are ideally suited to these requirements – in particular interoperability challenges posed by a multi-issuer PHC ecosystem – and the time to build is now. I strongly encourage you to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892?ref=blog.identity.foundation">read the PHC paper</a>, as it addresses broader challenges that will demand action from governments, technologists, standards bodies, and the public.</p><p>DIF's long-standing dedication to privacy-preserving digital identity, combined with our focus on Proof of Personhood in the Credential Schemas group and our work in the Applied Cryptography group, aligns directly with these principles and is focused on addressing these challenges.</p><p>We invite you to join DIF in this work. The challenges ahead are significant, but with thoughtful design and collaboration, we can build identity systems that meet the needs of the future while upholding the values of decentralization and user control.</p><p>Next steps:</p>  Read the paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892</a>&nbsp;  Join DIF: <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://identity.foundation/join/</a>&nbsp;  Sponsor the Personhood Credential challenge in our upcoming hackathon: <a href="mailto:hackathon@identity.foundation">hackathon@identity.foundation</a>&nbsp;  Contact: <a href="mailto:contact@identity.foundation">contact@identity.foundation</a>&nbsp;

<p>The evolution of money has always been about solving the shortcomings of previous systems. From the early days of barter, humanity transitioned to precious metals and then to fiat currencies, each step aiming to make trade more scalable. But fiat money, controlled by governments, has introduced a <a href="https://elastos.info/news/global-debt-crises-bel2-solution/">global debt crisis</a>, through problems like inflation, centralisation, and the manipulation of monetary policy. Bitcoin represents the next advancement in this evolutionary process, addressing these flaws by embracing cryptographic security and decentralisation. Unlike fiat currencies, which governments can inflate at will, Bitcoin’s fixed supply prevents inflation and shifts economic power back to individuals, and this is just the start.</p>
  
<p>Centralised monetary systems have historically led to corruption, manipulation, and the concentration of power, fundamentally distorting markets and undermining economic freedom. In a truly free market, prices should naturally fall over time due to technological advancements and increased productivity. However, centralised systems, through inflation and debt, have artificially reversed this deflationary trend, creating scarcity and concentrating power in the hands of a few.</p>
<p>Decentralisation is essential to counter these risks because it ensures that no single entity can manipulate or devalue a currency, preserving the integrity of free markets. <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a> extends this principle of decentralisation beyond money and into the digital economy, or SmartWeb, as a whole. This approach is rooted in the fundamental belief that the internet, like currency, should be a global public good, free from centralised control. With <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">5.44 billion internet users worldwide as of April 2024</a>, accounting for 67.1% of the global population, the need for a decentralised and secure digital infrastructure is more critical than ever. Elastos aims to create an internet where data and digital assets are controlled by individuals rather than central authorities, ensuring that digital activities are universally accessible, secure, and protected from manipulation.</p>
<p>This combination of decentralisation and digitisation allows technology to drive down costs and increase access, benefiting individuals rather than centralised entities. As finance, data ownership, digital assets, digital identity, and applications are disrupted through decentralisation, the big question is, can we successfully connect it all together to create a new economy? First, let’s explore connecting Bitcoin to Elastos.</p>
 BeL2: Connecting Bitcoin within the Elastos Ecosystem 
<p>Bitcoin offers a path to economic freedom by decentralising the control of money, allowing natural market forces to determine value without interference from central authorities. However, a truly decentralised and free market requires more than just digital gold; it needs a robust infrastructure to support new financial systems and complex transactions, such as BTC-backed fiat issuance, swaps, and loans. This is where <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>, built on the Elastos SmartWeb, comes into play.</p>
<p>BeL2 extends Bitcoin’s role by enabling sophisticated transactions and smart contracts without requiring Bitcoin to be bridged and wrapped, instead sending collateralised proof information over the assets themselves. As global retail e-commerce sales reached an estimated <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/">5.8 trillion U.S. dollars in 2023</a>, with projections indicating a 39% growth to surpass eight trillion dollars by 2027, the importance of secure and scalable digital infrastructure cannot be overstated.</p>
  
 ELA and Miners: Powering the Decentralised Economy 
<p>Elastos builds a secure, decentralised internet and economic system by using its <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastos-ela-bitcoin-merge-mining-economic-model/">Bitcoin merged-mined</a> native cryptocurrency, <a href="https://elastos.info/">ELA</a>, as the essential fuel for transactions and smart contracts. Rooted in trust, Elastos employs a hybrid consensus mechanism where miners validate transactions, ensuring the network’s integrity and resistance to centralised control. ELA powers smart contracts like <a href="https://ela.city/home">Elacity’s</a>, enabling secure business operations like digital asset trading.</p>
<p>The integration of <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a> enhances Bitcoin’s utility by allowing BTC-backed assets to function within the Elastos ecosystem, maintaining Bitcoin’s decentralised nature while expanding its role in a new financial system. By collateralising Bitcoin on the Elastos mainnet, BeL2 establishes a BTC-backed Bretton Woods system that supports not only fiat currencies but also decentralised loans and financial services. This innovation, combined with the decentralised security provided by miners and the utility of ELA, creates a robust foundation for next-generation decentralised markets and economies. Users control their identities, while BeL2 ensures Bitcoin remains a secure and resilient financial backbone, driving the Elastos SmartWeb economy and enabling diverse financial applications, from collateralised loans to complex business scenarios.</p>
 Elacity: Realising the Decentralised Internet Economy 
<p>Bitcoin’s potential as a decentralised currency stems from enabling secure, peer-to-peer transactions without the need for centralised intermediaries. However, to unlock its full capabilities, it must integrate with broader systems that allow for secure ownership and control of digital assets. Elacity, a platform built on the Elastos ecosystem, <a href="https://docs.ela.city/">believes</a> that true ownership of digital assets requires not just possession, but also the ability to securely manage, trade, and monetise those assets independently of centralised authorities. By implementing a decentralised digital rights management (dDRM) system, Elacity ensures that digital assets are encrypted, securely packaged, and tradable, directly addressing the inefficiencies and vulnerabilities inherent in traditional monetisation systems which rely on centralised licence servers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elacity’s connection to BeL2’s BTC-backed financial assets on the Elastos SmartWeb creates a digital economy anchored in Bitcoin’s security. This decentralised marketplace allows Digital Capsules to operate under smart contracts using Bitcoin-backed finance, ensuring secure and transparent transactions without central control through ELA miners. As <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/09/21/digital-payments-global-financial-inclusion">80% of transactions are now conducted digitally</a>, decentralised control over finance becomes even more critical. Elacity can expand BeL2’s role to support a new Bitcoin-backed Bretton Woods financial system, enabling BTC-backed fiat or loan payments across various economies, including established sectors like media, e-commerce, and software; emerging areas like gaming and VR/AR; and frontier markets such as AI, robotics, and IoT devices.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Each purchase instantly delivers payments directly to owners, streamlining revenue flows. Royalties in these markets are also tokenised and can be traded, creating new markets where ownership rights themselves become valuable assets. By supporting diverse business models, Elacity enables one-time purchases, subscriptions, rentals, pay-per-view, and ad-supported content on Elastos. With BeL2’s BTC-backed financial structure, a new marketplace that unites technologies, is grounded in Bitcoin, and supports secure ownership and trading across all digital economies is born.</p>
<p></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Maintaining Decentralisation Across the Ecosystem 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Centralised control has historically led to the co-opting of currencies by powerful entities, eroding the very freedoms that decentralised systems are designed to protect. Bitcoin’s decentralised structure, supported by the Elastos SmartWeb and platforms like Elacity, must be preserved to avoid this fate. If Bitcoin continues to uphold its decentralised nature, it could lead to a future where individuals have greater control over their economic destinies. BeL2 supports this vision by extending Bitcoin’s functionality, transforming it from a mere store of value into a foundation for a new Bretton Woods economic system within the new internet, the Elastos SmartWeb.</p>
<p>Elacity ties this broader vision together by creating an Elastos marketplace where Bitcoin and BeL2 play central financial roles in delivering a secure and private digital economy. The future of Bitcoin, supported by Elastos technologies like <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a> and <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a>, brings about a world where abundance, freedom, and prosperity are accessible to all, grounded in decentralisation and individual empowerment.

  <p>Disentis, July 28 to August 9</p><p>Nestled amidst the majestic Swiss Alps and the picturesque Disentis Monastery, the 2024 Summer Academy of the German <a href="https://www.studienstiftung.de">Studientstiftung des deutschen Volkes </a>and <a href="https://www.studienstiftung.de/pool/sdv/public/documents/Max_Weber-Programm/studienstiftung_max_weber_programm_broschuere.pdf">Max Weber Programm</a> was an inspiring setting for over 70 passionate students. Among them, six vibrant working groups explored pressing societal matters, ranging from sustainability to digital health. One such group took on the challenge of envisioning a secure and inclusive European Health Data Space (EHDS).</p>





















  
  






  <p>A vision for the future of health data.</p><p>With the recent legislative work of the European Parliament and Council, the European Union is taking a visionary step towards establishing the EHDS. Beyond its benefits for patients and research, the EHDS has the potential to leverage digital technologies to significantly enhance the resilience and long-term sustainability of Europe's universal healthcare systems, provide a unique economic advantage, and set global standards in privacy, individual protection, and data governance. </p><p>For a European health data space that can be adopted by everyone (including patients!), individuals must rely on a system that embeds information security by design. A working group approached the question by leveraging the participants' diverse perspectives as stakeholders in a European Health Data Space.</p>





















  
  






  <p>Under the leadership of Philippe Page from the Human Colossus Foundation's Research Council, an international team of eleven students from diverse disciplines embarked on the mission to address key aspects of the EHDS. Their goal was to create a safe, accessible, and economically viable solution that would benefit patients and researchers alike.</p><p>Three guiding questions anchored their deliberations:</p>  <p>How might EHDS revolutionize medical research pathways via expanded data accessibility?</p>  <p>What measures could ensure the EHDS contributes to the EU economy without compromising health data privacy from commercial exploitation?</p>  <p>Which components constitute a secure, scalable infrastructure that meets the EHDS expectations and security demands? Would such an implementation prove sustainable?</p>  <p>The working group organized itself into three distinct focus groups, each addressing specific themes related to the broader topic. These subgroups operated autonomously throughout the sessions, diving into their subjects. Daily, the working group would collaborate in a collective session to share insights on primary/secondary data usage, discuss findings, and harmonize perspectives to manage risks in commercial usage. Through these collaborative efforts, the participants crafted a first draft of a position paper encompassing essential questions about the future development of the EHDS.</p>





















  
  














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                

            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>In conclusion, the Human Colossus Foundation thanks the organisers for creating space for bringing new ideas forwards in a manner respecting everyone’s perspective. The vision initiated during the retreat in Disentis Monastery is just the beginning. With plans to reconvene in 2025, the group aims to build upon its foundational ideas. Its aim is to create a safer, more inclusive European Health Data Space that sets global benchmarks in privacy, individual protection, data use in research, and data governance.</p>

 Databases on Ceramic <p>OrbisDB has emerged as a premier database solution for the Ceramic Network. Building on the foundation laid by ComposeDB, OrbisDB brings significant advancements in functionality, performance, and user experience. This blog post will elaborate on the connection between Ceramic and OrbisDB, highlight OrbisDB's new features, and showcase its value to developers.</p> ComposeDB: The Original Building Block <p>ComposeDB was the first database and has become an integral technology for many decentralized applications built on Ceramic, such as <a href="https://www.passport.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Passport.xyz</a>, <a href="https://www.zuzalu.city/dashboard/home?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Zuzalu City</a>, <a href="https://charmverse.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CharmVerse</a>, and <a href="https://www.lateral.io/desci?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Lateral DeSci</a>.</p><p>ComposeDB has been instrumental in dapp development on Ceramic because it introduces a robust, scalable, and user-friendly approach to data management. It supports structured data models, advanced queries, and the integration of decentralized identities, all while leveraging <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/revolutionizing-data-publishing-why-ceramic-shifted-from-multicast-to-pairwise-synchronization/">Ceramic's fast performance and high transaction capacity</a>.</p> OrbisDB: A Practical Evolution <p>3Box Labs designed Ceramic as an open network upon which an ecosystem of data-handling solutions could emerge. <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/composedb-is-live-on-ceramic-mainnet/">We launched ComposeDB in 2023</a> as the first database service on the network. </p><p>While ComposeDB represented the first database service offered on Ceramic and introduced many advancements for interacting with Ceramic, the need for simple onboarding, hosted nodes, SQL, and easy integrations with other services led the Orbis team to create OrbisDB.</p><p>Built initially as the Ceramic-based infrastructure for Orbis Social, OrbisDB evolved from a template implementation used by leading crypto projects such as Iggy Social, CoinEasy, Autonolas, and Gitcoin Schelling Point, into a slick set of interface services for data on Ceramic, including a UI for no code deployment, integrated hosting, support for additional languages, and a blue sea of possibilities made possible by plugins.</p> Key Upgrades with OrbisDB   Simplified Ceramic Developer Experience:  Rapid Ceramic Onboarding: OrbisDB offers a web app and SDK for storing and managing datasets on Ceramic, no-code, or CLI.  Hosted nodes: OrbisDB makes Ceramic DevOps easy with an in-built hosted node service.  Accelerated Customization: Extend the functionality of your database with plugins. Build plugins for other developers.      Database Language Choice:  SQL Queries: Using PostgreSQL as its indexing database, OrbisDB offers scalable performance and the benefits of traditional scaling methods.  GraphQL: (already available on ComposeDB) and vector embeddings are both in development.    Plugin Ecosystem:  Optional and Versatile: Developers can easily add plugins to OrbisDB. These plugins are optional and designed to perform operations beyond the core's scope, providing additional functionality and connections to other blockchain services. Recently released plugins for Dune (link) and Base (link) make data visualization and importing on-chain data from any Base smart contract code-free and straightforward.  Open source: Plugins are open source. Users can build and share plugins with other developers in the ecosystem.  Do anything with plugins:  Combine on-chain transactions from Base or other EVMs with verifiable data on Ceramic (e.g., enable mutable and verifiable metadata)  Provide sybil-resistance and instant reputation score to all user-generated data using Passport.xyz or Verax attestations.  Easily token-gate your applications via pre-defined indexing logic  Resolve ENS Domain names directly from any datasets in one click  Enable a single query from multiple data sources (API, on-chain, Ceramic data, etc.)      <p>Get Early Access to OrbisDB Studio</p><p>OrbisDB represents a practical evolution of databases on Ceramic, building upon the foundations laid by ComposeDB and significantly improving experience, languages, and interoperability.</p><p>Projects have already started building on OrbisDB in beta, including Index Network, Plurality, and Flashcards, for various use cases, including a blockchain event listener and storing encrypted user data and educational content.</p><p>We're excited to work with Orbis to support the future of decentralized data management. OrbisDB Studio, accessible later this year, will offer the developer experience improvements discussed above. <a href="https://app.formo.so/hJ5VGyugmGigyVFyqdHJa?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Sign up here to get on the waitlist for early access</a>. </p><p>Learn more about OrbisDB at <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">useorbis.com</a></p>

<p>It’s cybersecurity season in Las Vegas and I’m inspired to write an overdue post on why I hate the phrase “cyber civil defense”. Actually, I don’t hate the phrase, I disagree with its usage. Being the literal sort I am, I have to of course start with a long look at what the three words seem to mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cyber: aka technology; though perhaps a more detailed definition would include “software driven” and “internet connected” as necessary attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civil: in this context, I think it means “citizens” or just “people”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Defense: The catch with this term is that it’s unclear what or who is being defended and by what or whom. For instance, this innocuous three-word phrase could mean any number of things:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Civilians defending “cyber” [tech] from other civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Civilians defending other people from civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending civilians from other civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending civilians from tech.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending tech from civilians. (ew.)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>I could go on but my head hurts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civilian defense seems to imply a kind of volunteer force to defend people from cyber threats (what kinds of threats?).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s where the wheels fall off this phrase: what about when the call’s coming from inside the house? Meaning, what about when the technology—as designed and with perfect integrity—is itself harmful to people? I’m not fine with using the phrase in the context or implication of defending people from risks from commercial technology itself because doing so:&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Reinforces that it’s acceptable for commercial technology (i.e. commercial products) to be a thing that civilians need to protect themselves from,&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Gaslights people into thinking that it’s somehow their responsibility to protect themselves against commercial technology that is evolving faster than the governance around it, bolstered by staggering amounts of financial resources, and whose risks are admittedly poorly understood by the makers themselves, but with just a little more elbow grease, you, dear user, can maybe be marginally less at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Smacks a bit of a military operation. I don’t want to join an army, I just want to have reasonably safe technology products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>– Also it’s a smidge paternalistic. (I can almost hear the “little lady” in there…)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is we already have a phrase to describe risks of commercial products on humans. It’s called Product Safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But product safety is an abject failure when it comes to commercial software and software-driven technology. In the US we have a dedicated product safety commission, but their scope hasn’t been updated since 2008, and was hamstrung by budgetary contractions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. Other agencies pick up pieces of product safety in the style of the blind men and the elephant, using their granted powers to maximum effect. The failure, however, is with the law makers. We have not updated ideas of “products” and “product safety” to keep pace with the internet age and citizens pay the price every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, from my research, it usually does take around 50 years after the launch of a new commercial product for US product safety laws to emerge, so we’re depressingly on time. For example, seatbelts became mandatory on January 1, 1968, sixty years after the commercial launch of the Fort Model T.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU recognized this gap in 2023 with their <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/general-product-safety-regulation-2023.html">updated product safety law</a>. As we in the US still wait for a federal privacy law, perhaps we can leapfrog ahead to a reimagined federal product safety law. Good news: we at ISL have tons of data, know-how, and tools to support this; it doesn’t have to start from scratch. But it would take extraordinary intestinal fortitude on behalf of the lawmakers to create something that meaningfully throttles the myriad risks technology foists upon us today. It would take precise regulation and a financially backed commitment to enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won’t be holding my breath, but we are absolutely here for that moment if and when it comes. Meanwhile, in the likely event the US government continues to ignore product safety for technology, ISL will continue to champion the safety of all tech users through our maturing safety labels and research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Our approach to the nexus of user research and user&nbsp;testing <p>WAO often starts projects with a bit of user research: asking your stakeholders and audience, users and even friends to give you some insight is always time well spent. After all, we all bring our own biases and experience, and user research can help surface some of those to better serve other&nbsp;people.</p><p>While there are, of course, specialised organisations and more or less complex user research projects, user research is something that you and your organisation can do yourself!. Even talking to five people about your project will give you a wealth of ideas and perspectives on how to improve things for your stakeholders.</p><p>In this post, we’re going to look at a few important considerations to make as you start the design of your user research. Read on to find out how you can bootstrap your first user research&nbsp;project.</p> Are you doing user research or user&nbsp;testing? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>We use the term ‘user research’ when we’re trying to figure out how to serve users better, whereas ‘user testing’ is when you have a prototype and you want to observe how people respond to it. We often do research that sits at the nexus of these two things — we ask questions as well as showing prototypes and ideas. However, rather than simply observing how people use them, which is what you would traditionally do in “user testing”, we talk to people about what they are experiencing. This allows us to both test ideas while also deepening our understanding of our users’&nbsp;needs.</p> Who are&nbsp;‘users’? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The word ‘User’ is sort of a confusing word in the research context. Sometimes we are, indeed, talking to users of a platform or product, but more often than not, we’re talking to people who are involved in a programme or project, but not necessarily as ‘users’. If you are having trouble figuring out who to talk to, you may want to reframe the term ‘user’ into ‘participant’ and reconceptualise ‘user research’ as just ‘talking to people’. Having a structured conversation with the people you are trying to serve is how you can create systems, process and, yes, products that are relevant and valuable.</p><p>The goal of this kind of research is to understand what people need and want, and the behaviours they have. This can help make programme, project or product design better. It can also help your communication and marketing.</p><p>The first thing you’ll want to do when designing a user research project is to think about the types of people you are designing for and see if you can talk to them. Our <a href="https://weareopen.coop">Learn with WAO</a> site has some activities to help you think about who these people are. Perhaps start with <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/stakeholder-mapping/">Stakeholder Mapping</a> and then see if you can apply your learnings in the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/persona-mapping/">Persona Mapping</a> activity.</p> Can you be more inclusive? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>While you need to be targeted in the specific types of people you talk to, it’s also important to ensure that you have a diverse range of participants for your user research. It’s important to be inclusive, which means that you don’t overlook people or groups that you might not associate as ‘users’. Once you’ve figured out the stakeholders and/or spectrum of personas you want to talk to, make sure you have diversity in your&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Diversity and inclusion is an intentional act, so if you realise that you do not have a racially, geographically, social-economically and gender diverse group of participants, you’ll need to do more outreach. It is perfectly acceptable to contact people within your network to ask for help finding diverse participants. You can also use social media and hashtags.</p><p>Sometimes, we use what’s called “snowball sampling” to help us find more participants. We simply ask people who have already volunteered to participate if they know someone who might also be willing to participate. This works well, but beware, snowball sampling can actually lead to less diverse groups because of the way network effect works. It can also lead to ‘scope creep’ where your project ends up being much larger than initially defined. So watch out for&nbsp;that!</p> What kind of data should you&nbsp;collect? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Effective user research combines both quantitative and qualitative methods. While quantitative data provides measurable insights, qualitative research helps to understand the context and motivations behind user behaviours, leading to deeper insights.</p><p>One of the tactics we like is to use surveys first. This allows us to collect quantitative data as well as to expand our recruitment pool for user research interviews. We ask “May we talk to you more about your answers?” And if the survey respondent answers yes, we ask for their contact information.</p><p>Once you have people to talk to, you need a set of questions to ask. A user research guide helps you ensure some rigour and can be used to steer interviews. You need to avoid leading questions, questions that have the answer in the question (e.g. things like “Isn’t this prototype beautiful and easy to use?”) Use open-ended questions, neutral language and avoid assumptions. It can help to test your questions on friends or colleagues!</p><p>Another point to note is that, as you carry out the user research interviews, you’ll learn things about the project and about the needs and desires of participants. You will need to balance asking similar questions (for fairness and reliability), with perhaps slightly different ones as the landscape becomes&nbsp;clearer.</p> Next steps cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In the end, user research is all about getting to know what your users need and want from your project, programme, product or service. The best way to get that information is to find a diverse group of people and talk to them in any way you can! Then, you can gather your data and present it in a way that tells a story about what your next steps should&nbsp;be.</p><p>Need help? We do this a lot, get in&nbsp;touch!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/key-questions-for-user-research-design-5edfab6046dd">Key Questions for User Research Design</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>To mark the entry into force of the eIDAS Regulation 2.0 in May 2024, the Blockchain Berlin news platform has published a comprehensive review of the IDunion research project’s work over the past three years.</p>

<p>While the original aim of the project was to develop a decentralised identity management system based on blockchain, the project was subsequently refocused on federated data storage using the OpenID4VC protocol family developed by the consortium partners. The integration of these protocols into the eIDAS 2.0 Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) by the EU confirms IDunion’s expertise and its important contribution to digitalisation in Europe.</p>

<p>The article presents various possible use cases for digital credentials, such as the digital student ID card of the TU Berlin or the digital product passport for seamless identification and transparency of product sustainability data. </p>

<p>2060.io enables anonymous, decentralized, sophisticated and interoperable chat connections between users and services. The company has developed Hologram Messaging, a Verifiable Credential wallet and messaging app with true privacy preserving features. Unlike other messaging apps, Hologram is a self-custody app, which means user’s data is only stored on device, and exclusively under user’s control. We spoke to the company's CEO and co-founder, Fabrice Rochette. </p><p>Tell us about the journey you’ve been on so far with 2060.io</p><p>I emigrated from France to Latin America twelve years ago. Once there I decided to start my own company and built a team of engineers in Colombia, developing software and SaaS (software as a service) products for mobile operators in the region, as well as in Africa and Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a good business, but I started to worry about the shift to a centralized internet where everything is provided as platforms, and you need to create an account to do anything.&nbsp;</p><p>I met Ariel Gentile, my co-founder at 2060.io, when I contacted Gemalto (now part of Thales) where he worked, as we needed help to develop an applet for SIM cards. We got talking about how the internet has become highly centralized, and started thinking about new decentralized concepts. Around a year later we heard about DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) &amp; VCs (Verifiable Credentials). We started to dig more into these topics and attended IIW (the Internet Identity Workshop) for the first time remotely, during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>We detected that what we wanted to do was totally aligned with the SSI ecosystem. So we decided to get involved in the ecosystem and started to analyze what was provided - what was good, also what we felt was too complicated.</p><p>We decided to design a solution that would address several problems at the same time. One of the main topics we wanted to tackle is that the communication channels we currently use are insecure and obsolete. They all use public identifiers, so anyone can contact you without your consent. Also, there’s no way of knowing for sure who is on the other end, which leads to problems with spam, phishing and so on. Finally, there’s no interoperability. For example, if you want to use Whatsapp, you can only talk to people who also use Whatsapp.</p><p>You’ve developed a chat application, Hologram Messaging. Can you tell us a bit about it, and how it leverages the DIDComm (Decentralized Identifier Communication) protocol?&nbsp;</p><p>There are more and more chatbots appearing in apps like Whatsapp, Telegram, and so on. Some are tied to a legitimate company or brand but there are a lot of fraudulent ones. So, we decided to address the chat channel first.&nbsp;</p><p>It was very important to us to enable users to confidently identify each other, as well as the entity providing a chatbot or other service. When we discovered VCs, we decided this was a good way to set up a secure communication channel where we can authenticate both ends.</p><p>We developed Hologram Messaging using Credo, a framework that’s aligned to Hyperledger Aries, and enables developers to work with agents such as digital identity wallets, DIDs and DIDComm.</p><p>DIDComm doesn’t just enable the initial credential exchange to establish trust. It also creates a persistent, secure connection between a user and a service (or another user), so it’s a good fit for a secure messaging application. What’s more, it’s built on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), so the content stays under the user’s control.&nbsp;</p><p>We decided to develop some open source modules that anyone can integrate in order to provide decentralized trusted services, and have extended the DIDComm protocol by adding more specifications and messages. These enable third party applications to handle everything a chatbot should do — forms, attachments, voice and video calls, and so on. We even have biometric modules for face, fingerprint and liveness detection, enabling you to do biometric verification, for example as part of a KYC process.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hologram app is a VC wallet as well. Using the chat interface is very convenient for the user, who has a history of what has happened and can access their credentials easily.&nbsp;</p><p>What are the key advantages of Hologram, for companies wishing to implement a secure chatbot?&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine your customer wants to talk to someone remotely, but they need to be sure who they’re speaking with. Today, you can only do this using VCs.</p><p>Hologram enables VC-based messaging and voice interactions, in a way that’s more secure than using OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OpenID4VCI) — when you deliver a credential using DIDComm, you can authenticate both the user and the service using the linked Verifiable Presentation (VP) within each entity’s DID Document.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a company that wants to use Whatsapp to communicate with your customers, you need to sign a contract with Meta, and pay them. In contrast, companies can build their own secure chatbot using our open source modules.&nbsp;</p><p>The chat interface is perfect for accumulating and presenting credentials, and for companies to enable the user journey. It’s very simple to deliver credentials. You don’t need to build a dedicated UI (User Interface).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s really easy to implement, which is why companies are attracted to it.</p><p>Who is using Hologram today?&nbsp;</p><p>We are working with mobile operators to find solutions to reduce fraud, including bank fraud. One of their main concerns is SIM swapping. Usually you need to share your mobile number with the bank when opening an account. Mobile operators can use Hologram to deliver a certificate of a mobile number as a Verifiable Credential, so a customer can demonstrate he or she owns the mobile number. They could also use it to enable customers to verify their physical address, for example, when a telco visits you to install optic fiber.</p><p>We have pilots in place in several countries, mostly in LATAM. We are testing reusable KYC with mobile operators and banks, and are piloting some simple services with governments, including mobile driving licenses.</p><p>Where should people go to find out more?&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://2060.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">2060 website</a> which includes some <a href="https://2060.io/use-cases/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">example use cases</a> that can all be downloaded and customized from our <a href="https://github.com/2060-io?ref=blog.identity.foundation">GitHub repo</a>, from creating a mock Citizen Registry, to using a credential to identify yourself during KYC. There’s even an authentication model where you use a credential presentation to log into a service.&nbsp;</p>

 New Initiative to Drive Sustainability, Circular Economy, and Data Interoperability Across&nbsp;Europe <p>In response to the sustainability and circularity data sharing needs highlighted in the EU Green Deal and the new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), the European Commission adopted the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) in March 2022. This regulation establishes the Digital Product Passport (DPP) system, designed to provide essential information on a need-to-know basis to support sustainable production and enable the transition to a circular economy. The DPP aims to boost material and energy efficiency, extend product lifetimes, and optimize product design, manufacturing, use, and end-of-life handling.</p><p>Beyond facilitating sustainability and circularity-related data sharing among economic operators along value chains, the DPP is intended to create new business opportunities through digital and circular value retention and optimization, such as product-as-a-service, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. It also helps consumers make sustainable choices and allows authorities to verify compliance with legal obligations.</p><p>Currently, there are numerous initiatives for such data sharing systems at the industry sector, platform, or individual company level. However, there is a lack of standardization in data definition, data format, and IT infrastructure, which hinders cross-sectoral interoperability. To address this, the EU Commission initiated the CIRPASS Coordination and Support Action (CSA) in October 2022, with the project set to conclude in March 2024. The focus is on batteries, electronics, and textile sectors. By the project’s end, CIRPASS will propose a clear cross-sectoral definition and description of the DPP system, identify key data for circularity, and define requirements for product identification and data exchange protocols to support further legislative and standardization developments.</p><p>To ensure inclusivity, an open call for pilot proposals was widely disseminated, forming the CIRPASS-2 project consortium, which will run from May 2024 until April 2027. Alongside 17 partners, CIRPASS-2 will demonstrate functioning Digital Product Passports in real-world settings through circular pilot deployments and use cases in textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, tires, and construction value&nbsp;chains.</p><p>CIRPASS-2 will show that the DPP, as a digital transformation initiative, helps strengthen the Union’s resilience and data sovereignty. It will develop a DPP data space fully aligned with Europe’s ongoing efforts in this field (such as SIMPL and DSSC) and emphasize interoperability based on harmonized standards. The focus on open source and architecture will also foster the EU data economy while ensuring compliance with data regulations. By taking the conceptualized DPP and pilot solutions and deploying them at scale, CIRPASS-2 aims to bridge the gap between digital technology research and market deployment. The project will contribute directly to Digital Europe Programme (DEP) objectives through its results and will provide extensive policy and business recommendations to further these&nbsp;goals.</p><p>CIRPASS-2 is an Innovation Action project funded by the European Commission’s Digital Europe Programme, running from May 2024 until April 2027. With 13 lighthouse pilots, the project will demonstrate functioning DPPs in real settings and at scale across four target value chains: textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, tires, and construction materials. Additionally, CIRPASS-2 will create a broad community of DPP stakeholders to facilitate the deployment of DPPs in various product sectors across Europe and&nbsp;beyond.</p> About Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Energy Web is a global non-profit organization accelerating the energy transition by developing and deploying open-source decentralized technologies.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO</p>



<p>In a significant move to bolster software security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations have released new guidance that organizations can use to demand better security from their software vendors.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-demand-guide">Secure by Demand Guide: How Software Customers Can Drive a Secure Technology Ecosystem</a> underscores the pivotal role that software customers play in digital supply chain security. The guide outlines high-priority security requirements from the earliest stages of software development, a principle central to creating “secure by design” products.</p>



<p>Among the items highlighted are phishing-resistant authentication methods, such as <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, as a default feature in software products. Announced on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at Black Hat USA, this new guidance represents a vital step forward in securing the digital supply chain in the United States and worldwide.</p>



 Secure by Demand, Secure by Design 



<p>This new guidance complements CISA’s recent <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/Shifting-the-Balance-of-Cybersecurity-Risk-Principles-and-Approaches-for-Secure-by-Design-Software.pdf">Secure by Design Guide</a> aimed at technology manufacturers to improve their software product security. By focusing on the procurement aspect in the supply chain, the new guidance advises software buyers to demand modern security features from technology manufacturers, such as phishing-resistant authentication and passkeys. By doing so, customers can drive demand for security as a baseline feature and compel technology manufacturers to adhere to secure design practices.</p>



<p>The guidance also includes an assessment to evaluate software security and include security requirements in contracts. It encourages a proactive procurement approach, where a buyer can assess a manufacturer’s security and capabilities to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience. The guide establishes best practices for secure software procurement and highlights the product security features that bolster supply chain security and interoperability.</p>



 Passkeys Take Center Stage 



<p>CISA’s guidance aligns with the recent guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in their digital identity guidelines on authentication and lifecycle management. In supplemental guidance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/nist-cites-phishing-resistance-of-synced-passkeys-in-digital-identity-guidelines-update/">NIST SP 800-63Bsup1</a>, NIST affirmed that synced passkeys meet Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) requirements and device-bound passkeys satisfy Authentication Assurance Level 3 (AAL3). The two guidance documents emphasize the importance of security, including digital identity and authentication best practices, across the digital supply chain.</p>



<p>The Secure by Demand guidance empowers IT buyers, who can drive market demand for secure software features, such as passkeys and FIDO authentication. Given that weak or stolen passwords account for <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/resources/reports/global-password-security-report">80% of hacking-related breaches</a> and <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/100067-report-shows-1265-increase-in-phishing-emails-since-chatgpt-launched">credential phishing has skyrocketed by 967%</a> since 2022, buyers can use the guide’s security assessment to evaluate software security, including passkey capabilities, and improve security risk management in the supply chain. With this guidance, CISA aims to increase awareness and drive market demand for secure software.</p>



 Key Recommendations for Software Manufacturers 



<p>CISA’s Secure by Demand guide outlines several critical requirements that customers should evaluate when procuring software, and includes questions to assess a software manufacturer’s security capabilities in the following areas:</p>



 
 Authentication: Manufacturers should support secure, standards-based Single Sign-On (SSO) and implement phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) or passkeys — by default, and at no extra cost. 



 Eliminating Vulnerabilities: Systematic efforts should be made to address and prevent classes of software defects, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. 



 Secure Defaults: Security logs should be provided to customers without additional charges, ensuring transparency and accountability in software security. 



 Supply Chain Security: Ensuring the provenance of third-party dependencies via Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and robust processes for integrating open-source components are vital. 



 Vulnerability Disclosure: Transparency and timely reporting of vulnerabilities, including authorization for security testing by the public, is crucial for maintaining trust and improving security outcomes. 
 



 A Call to Action for Security Leaders 



<p>The guidance for those manufacturing or procuring software across the software supply chain is clear: passkeys improve third-party supply chains and ensure higher security standards in software procurement and development processes. By integrating passkeys into authentication processes, organizations can strengthen end-to-end digital identity lifecycle management and significantly reduce the risks of phishing and social engineering attacks.</p>

Here is WHY knowledge graphs (KGs) are so important for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) helps power trust at Internet&nbsp;scale.</p> Knowledge Graphs in support of reliability of the&nbsp;GenAI <p>KGs act as intelligent maps for AI, aiding in understanding connections, explaining decisions, enhancing learning through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to reduce hallucination and bias in&nbsp;AI.</p><p><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/">Initially developed by Meta</a>, RAG is a type of AI system that combines two main tasks: retrieving information and generating answers. Think of it like a smart assistant that not only looks up facts but also puts them together in a way that makes sense. By using KGs, RAG systems become smarter and more reliable.</p><p>They can understand questions better, provide accurate answers, connect different ideas, search quickly, show their sources, and bring together knowledge from various topics. This helps users find the information they need and helps drive more reliable AI based on the transparent use of knowledge sources.</p> Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG): Trust the&nbsp;Source <p>“We live in a time of abundant connectivity and alas abundant misinformation.

 By Adrian Doerk, Lissi <p></p><p><a href="https://lissi.id/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Lissi</a> is a software house of identity experts who have been working on the topic of digital identity with ID-Wallets and verifiable credentials since 2018. The company, based in Frankfurt am Main in Germany, offers software for organizations to interact with EU Digital Identity Wallets in order to comply with the eIDAS 2 regulation ((<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj?ref=blog.identity.foundation">EU) 2024/1183</a>).</p><p>What is the importance of User Experience in driving uptake of the EUDI Wallet?</p><p>User experience is the number one factor that will determine adoption. If we don’t start investing heavily in this now, we won’t reach the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/trusted-and-secure-european-e-id-recommendation?ref=blog.identity.foundation">targeted adoption level</a> of 80 percent of citizens in 2030.&nbsp;</p><p>Communication and education are also very important. This needs to be transparent, and also needs to address negative topics. Missing communication was one of the key reasons for the failed adoption of the German eID scheme 14 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>What usability challenges do you see with the EUDI Wallet?&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">OpenID4VC</a>&nbsp; is very new and there are many aspects which still need to be addressed. The protocol responsible for presenting credentials to a relying party (OpenID4VP) is critical, and will be crucial in defining the processes of the ecosystem. The protocol currently doesn’t support use case and credential discovery functions. For instance, what happens if a relying party requests three different credentials and the holder only has two in their wallet? We need to inform the user about where to get the missing credential.&nbsp;</p><p>The answer may be clear for certain types of credentials, such as driving licenses. But what about things like proof of income? Not only can there be multiple potential issuers (such as an employer or bank), but proof of income is an abstract concept instead of a specific source the relying party can point to. If a degree is required for a job application, there are 427 universities in Germany — how do you find out if your degree is available as a VC? I believe this process needs to be supported in the protocol, for example as a directory of issuers, which relying parties can point to.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, all EUDI wallets will need intuitive icons to represent common functions like requesting a credential, presenting a credential and so on. There should be a general guidance for all wallet providers on how to illustrate such core processes.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, there is no forum where these topics are discussed. Creating an open community in which such user acceptance topics can be addressed would create immense value for adoption of the EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>The aspects addressed above are just a small part of what’s needed overall. Many other topics also need to go down a standards track. Further topics which need to be addressed from a user-first approach are guardianship, the backup function as well as the protection of the individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>How much progress is being made on tackling these issues? Who is driving this?&nbsp;</p><p>The technical standards are decided on by the eIDAS expert tool group. This group consists of two representatives of every EU member state. They define the <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/arf.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Architecture and Reference Framework</a> (ARF). The four <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-wallet-implementation?ref=blog.identity.foundation">eIDAS Large Scale Pilots</a> (LSPs), which started in May 2023, each have 50+ partners exploring different use cases. A lot of know-how has been built up already, but we also wait for the implementing acts to provide further information. The standards themselves are defined in recognised standardization bodies such as the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI).&nbsp;</p><p>In Germany, there is a <a href="https://bmi.usercontent.opencode.de/eudi-wallet/eidas2/start/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">public consultation process</a> initiated by the Federal Ministry of Interior and hosted by the Federal Agency for leap innovation. They made the right choice to get world-class experts in their team, and open a forum for discussing the many open questions that arise when implementing eIDAS 2.0 on a national level.</p><p>So, Germany is in a good position, but we also see others doing great work. The Dutch government initiated a <a href="https://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/overzicht-van-alle-onderwerpen/identiteit/id-wallet/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">wallet focused community</a>, which is working on <a href="https://edi.pleio.nl/news/view/43a92f84-b5e8-44a9-96b5-ce035c94bc8e/eerste-versie-nederlandse-publieke-id-wallet-gereed?ref=blog.identity.foundation">user flows, user interfaces and creating mock-ups</a>. We also see a strong community in Finland, Italy and Spain among others.&nbsp;</p><p>How do these issues impact Lissi? How much of this is about standardization, versus proprietary solutions from wallet providers?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s only so much you can do as a single vendor. Lissi participates in the working groups within the relevant standardization organizations, such as the OpenID Foundation, assisting the development of the underlying protocols. We see our role as raising the flag on important topics and discussing them with our peers in communities such as the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">European Wallet Consortium</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the last few years we shifted our focus away from the wallet, towards API software for issuers and verifiers. Here we can build a proprietary product based on open standards, which meets the requirements of financial institutions, insurance companies and other regulated institutions. They can use our software to implement use cases with the future EUDI wallets, such as verifying the identity of a person to perform a know-your-customer (KYC) process or issue an IBAN credential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What is Lissi’s business model?&nbsp;</p><p>We’re a software development company enabling organizations to implement use cases with EUDI Wallets by providing the necessary API software. We license this software to our clients.&nbsp; Hosting and integration is done directly by the clients, or by our implementation partners.</p><p>Organizations operating in the European Union face a choice: make-or-buy? It’s a bit like learning a language. Either you learn it, or you get everything translated. We’re the translator that enables you to enter the market without spending a year and half learning the language, maintaining and updating the software and contacting the 30+ expected wallet issuers if implementations are not as interoperable as intended. While having a strong footing in Germany, we also operate throughout Europe.</p><p>Are you mainly focused on standards compliance or product differentiation?&nbsp;</p><p>For now we are concentrating on ensuring that our clients are compliant with eIDAS 2.0. We’re focusing on ensuring smooth user flows and a holistic user experience with the Lissi EUDI-Wallet Connector API software.&nbsp; Within our Pilot Program organizations get insights into the ecosystem, expert guidance from our team as well as the API and wallet software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Where do you see opportunities for wallet providers to differentiate themselves?&nbsp;</p><p>The big opportunity is to develop user-centric approaches. We need to think outside the box and take a broader view of what the wallet can be. Governments look at it from a regulatory perspective, but I also want my wallet to show me a list of all my accounts and contracts, to automatically notify service providers when I change address, and so on. Building additional functions into the wallet is how wallet providers can set their offer apart.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve previously spoken of the role DIDComm can play in addressing certain usability issues with the EUDI Wallet. Is that still your view?&nbsp;</p><p>Here we are speaking about the protocols used by the issuer and verifier to interact with wallets. The currently used OpenID4VC is less flexible than DIDComm, which was used by many stakeholders before eIDAS 2.0. While the EU’s decision to standardize on OpenID4VC decreases implementation complexity, it also limits our ability to meet some of our clients’ requirements, such as a direct chat communication with the wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Our clients tell us they need persistent digital relationships with customers. We still think DIDComm is the best candidate to meet this need, given its maturity. If there are enough stakeholders requesting functionality offered by such a protocol, it might eventually be integrated into the technical requirements of eIDAS.&nbsp;</p><p>What is your view on the so-called ‘three wallet problem’? (referring to the complexity and inconvenience citizens may experience if they are required to download and manage many identity wallets)</p><p>In my opinion, the more important question is how successful eIDAS will be. If it's successful, citizens will have a single wallet with their national ID, and won’t need ten additional wallets for identity related topics. It all depends on whether the barrier to entry is low enough for organizations to interact with citizens without needing to issue a wallet of their own.&nbsp;</p><p>Do wallet providers have enough incentive to participate in the eIDAS ecosystem?&nbsp;</p><p>Good question! I’ve spent some time investigating the business case for wallet providers.&nbsp;According to eIDAS, we will have at least 30 wallets (one for each of the 27 member states plus 3 EEA countries). Given the option for additional private-sector wallets certified by member states, there may be a lot more, though it probably doesn’t make sense for wallet providers to enter the smaller markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Will wallet providers be able to build a viable business model? We have some ideas on this, but it’s still a big question mark for everyone. You can join the <a href="https://gitlab.opencode.de/bmi/eudi-wallet/eidas2/-/blob/main/05_Working_Group_Ecosystem_Governance/240710_Kick-Off_EGOM_Working_Group/240710_Kick-Off_EGOM_Working_Group_final.pdf?ref_type=heads&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Ecosystem, governance and business model working group of the German public consultation process</a> to discuss this in more detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Are there any other important gaps in eIDAS, from your perspective?&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid the risk that relying parties request too much or unnecessary data from citizens, they will need to register in their member state. For now it’s still discussed to what extent they need to register. If they will be required to register every credential they want to request, this would create unnecessary complexity and a potential barrier to entry. It’s also still to be decided if this will be technically enforced or just a legal prerequisite. We don’t think a technical enforcement is viable for the ecosystem. How a data request complaint is handled by the wallet, and EU member states, also needs to be standardized, not left to member states, or we’ll end up with a confusing mess of solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>The other area is the trust mechanism enabling relying parties to determine if an issuer is trusted to issue a certain credential, such as the Person Identification Data (PID). We need a clear direction on what trust model will be adopted, in order to continue the practical implementation of use cases.&nbsp;</p>

   Issuer permissions are the mechanism that Velocity Network introduces to enable relying parties (and wallets) to determine if an issuer is an authoritative source for a particular credential. After requesting the ability to issue on the Network, the request is reviewed by Velocity Network to ensure that the issuing service parameters are within the remit of the organization’s business activities.

<p>In response to Graeme Muller’s open letter from NZTech to New Zealand Government officials, DINZ and its Biometrics Special Interest Group wish to emphasise our support for the concerns raised. The letter, published yesterday, highlights significant concerns about the OPC’s proposed Code of Practice for biometrics, which could negatively impact businesses, innovation, and the economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“DINZ is fully committed to supporting the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). We believe that privacy-enhancing technologies introduced by our industry can complement the OPC’s role in protecting privacy. Collaboration between the OPC and businesses should not be seen as a trade-off but as a partnership with mutual benefits.” says Steven Graham, Head of Biometrics (ANZ) &amp; Innovation, NEC New Zealand Limited and Chair of DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group.</p>



<p>Following the publication of this letter the Privacy Commissioner reached out to NZTech CEO Graeme Muller to assure NZTech members that the process is far from finished, they are still reviewing the feedback and there will be further opportunities for stakeholders to engage. Given how important biometrics are for privacy, productivity and economic growth, DINZ, and NZTech look forward to the OPC publishing their proposed next steps and engaging in real consultation with experts in biometrics.</p>

<p>Submitted by: Joni Brennan, President</p>



<p>List of recommendations</p>



 
 Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:
 
 Digital Trust in Citizen Services; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety; and 



 Digital Trust in Business and Industry 
 
 



 Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing privacy-protecting verification and authentication tools as part of its Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategy. 



 Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike. 
 



<p>Introduction</p>



<p>The spread of misinformation is evolving around the world at a concerning pace. Bad actors are finding new battlegrounds and frontiers every day, and information and images generated by AI are being used to push political agendas and false narratives, scam and steal money and identities, and, even worse, lure online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, AI is also evolving rapidly, with risks as significant as the benefits. Further, now that AI is generative, users can manipulate images and information at unprecedented speed and scale, and vast amounts of inaccurate and malicious information make it difficult for people and organizations to verify information authenticity.</p>



<p>In today’s era of information warfare, authenticity and verification must be prioritized — particularly given the role of digital trust and identity verification in the delivery of government and business services.</p>



<p>Our submission and recommendations reflect the deep experience and expertise of DIACC’s member organizations, and our collective commitment to working with leaders in both the public and private sectors to secure verifiable information authenticity to the benefit of government, industry, and citizens alike by prioritizing inclusive and accessible privacy-protecting digital trust and verification capabilities.</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, with a goal to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>DIACC is guided by a belief that our public safety, civic engagement, and economic prosperity depend on leveraging trusted solutions and using well-established risk mitigation and certification tools. DIACC is committed to accelerating digital trust adoption and reducing information authenticity uncertainty by certifying services against its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework — a risk mitigation and assurance framework developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts that signals trustworthy design rooted in security, privacy, inclusivity, accessibility, and accountability.</p>



<p>Recommendations</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Citizen Services; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety; and 



 Digital Trust in Business and Industry. 
 



<p>Digital Trust in Citizen Services</p>



<p>DIACC advocates for digital trust in citizen services, emphasizing the importance of secure, privacy-respecting, and user-centric solutions through collaboration between government, private sector, and civil society. Leveraging our collaborative partnerships, we developed the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) – a risk mitigation and assurance framework that extends standards and open source code to help service providers ensure risk mitigation and user care.</p>



<p>As public services continue to move online, digital trust and verification services will be critical for ensuring that services are secure and accessible. From online healthcare consultations to digital government services, these technologies provide the necessary security infrastructure to protect public interactions and data.</p>



<p>Through partnerships with organizations such as DIACC, the government is encouraged to prioritize innovation in digital trust technologies through pilot projects, research, and education. Collaboration with various sectors will ensure the development and implementation of secure, efficient, inclusive, and accessible digital trust solutions, fostering a reliable digital ecosystem for accessing healthcare, banking, and government services.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory</p>



<p>Canadians benefit from being a highly banked jurisdiction with broad inclusivity and accessibility – according to the Canadian Bankers Association, approximately 99 per cent of Canadian adults have a bank account.</p>



<p>Existing financial regulations provide powerful and internationally recognized tools that act as a solid foundation to fight fraud and foster a more verified, authentic, and trustworthy ecosystem that supports the needs of people, governments, and businesses alike. However, the government is encouraged to build on the existing regulatory framework and develop new regulations to facilitate secure digital transactions, including compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.</p>



<p>Further, digital trust and verification services will be critical as the government moves forward with its commitments to open-banking, with interoperability also being paramount as the federal framework and existing provincial frameworks work together.</p>



<p>Similarly, the government has committed to reducing incidents of mortgage fraud and strengthening proof of borrower and title insurance, and digital trust and verification services can and should play a critical role in making that commitment a reality.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Safety</p>



<p>DIACC believes that implementing digital trust and verification services are essential for enhancing public safety. Digital verification can play a crucial role in protecting vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities.</p>



<p>By ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive areas such as schools, healthcare facilities, and care homes, digital trust services can help safeguard these groups from potential harm. Further, digital trust and verification services enable secure and reliable cross-border identity verification, facilitating international collaboration in law enforcement, disaster response, and public health.</p>



<p>By prioritizing advanced authentication methods that ensure individuals and organizations are who they claim to be, we can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and critical infrastructure, minimize financial scams and misuse of personal data, and enhance public safety for all Canadians.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Business and Industry</p>



<p>Enhanced security is a primary benefit of digital trust and verification services for businesses and industries. These services provide robust security measures that protect businesses from fraud, identity theft, and cyber threats. Ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information and resources, these services help maintain the integrity of business operations.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust in business and industry and implementing authentication and verification tools, the government can help drive the following benefits:</p>



 
 streamlined business processes by automating identity verification and reducing the need for manual checks; 



 faster, more efficient operations and reduced administrative costs, allowing businesses to allocate resources more effectively; 



 data minimization and the secure handling of personal information, increasing customer confidence; 



 a competitive advantage for Canadian businesses by helping them innovate and offer their customers new, secure digital services; and 



 a reduction in incidents of fraud, resulting in significant cost savings for businesses. These savings can be reinvested into other business areas, driving growth and innovation and improving overall business performance. 
 



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>In today’s world, where AI is becoming smarter every day, and information can be generated and manipulated at unprecedented speed and scale, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of information is critical. It is vital to maximize the benefits of an AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-fueled data ecosystem for Canada while also fostering citizen trust and protecting their safety.</p>



<p>To effectively address the challenges we’re facing while realizing the benefits of AI, the federal government should prioritize verification and authentication tools as part of its broader AI strategy. Prioritization must include funding, collaboration, and urgent action to support the development, adoption and certification of tools that verify information authenticity while protecting privacy and empowering Canadians. Governments, banks, telcos, tech companies, media organizations, and civil society must work together to deploy open, standards-based solutions and services to verify the authenticity of information.</p>



<p>The economic imperative of investing in these capabilities is clear. According to a <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting/perspectives/generative-ai-in-finance.html">study</a> by Deloitte, the Canadian economy could unlock an additional 7 per cent (CAD $7 trillion) in economic value through AI and AGI technologies. People and organizations can only realize this potential for the good of society by investing in tools, processes, and policies that support verifying the authenticity of the information generated and processed by AI and AGI technologies.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Today, solutions can signal verified trust by getting certified against a technology-neutral risk and assurance framework like DIACC’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts.</p>



<p>Verifiable information authenticity relies on critical principles, including provenance and traceability: provenance establishes the origin and history of information, ensuring it comes from a reliable source, while traceability allows for audibility of the flow of information, enabling people, businesses, and governments to verify its accuracy and authenticity. These principles are essential in combating the spread of misinformation and disinformation, which can have far-reaching consequences in an AI-fueled world.</p>



<p>Provenance and traceability are potent information authenticity tools that can help:</p>



 
 businesses and professionals reduce liabilities and meet obligations to verify information about their clients and their operations; 



 citizens and residents interact securely and efficiently with governments; 



 customers and clients transact with privacy and security anywhere, anytime; 



 industries manage decision-making and securely supply chains using trusted data; 



 producers verify essential data related to environmental, safety, and operational goals and 



 creators track intellectual property to ensure fair payment and cultural protection. 
 



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>Our public safety, civic engagement, and economic prosperity depend on leveraging trusted solutions, well-established risk mitigation and certification tools, and powerful collaboration to ensure regulations set informed guardrails that put people’s benefits, protections and agency to control data at the center of the design. The evolving AI-fueled information landscape presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities for innovation and progress. By prioritizing verifiable information authenticity, inclusive and accessible solutions, &nbsp;and investing in digital trust, we can ensure that people and organizations realize the benefits of AI and AGI while mitigating its risks<br><br>Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide our input in advance of Budget 2025 and as we collectively move forward on the path to a digitally and economically prosperous Canada.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity in the Age of GenAI: Coping with the Exponential Web of Change</p>



<p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses face a paradoxical challenge: while digital transformation fuels revenue growth, it also exposes them to escalating cyber threats.On the one hand, more than half of the global GDP is driven by digitally transformed organizations by now (<a href="https://financesonline.com/digital-transformation-statistics/">IDC, 2020</a>). On the other hand, this digital revolution, while fostering economic growth and innovation, also ushers in an era of unprecedented cybersecurity risks. Cybercrime damages are expected to reach a staggering <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damage-costs-10-trillion-by-2025/">$10.5 trillion annually by 2025</a> roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/">10% of the projected global GDP</a>, with a concerning annual growth rate of 15%. The complexity and scale of these threats highlight the inadequacy of traditional cybersecurity approaches and the urgent need for a paradigm shift.</p>



<p>As we embrace the power of Generative AI to transform most aspects of society, its exponential growth and capabilities bring about new risks and challenges.</p>

 Registry enables tracing and tracking of sustainable aviation fuel with the help of Energy Web and Polkadot technologies <p>The Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificate or SAFc registry was recently launched to support major consumers of air travel and transport in their efforts to help directly decarbonize flight. The registry’s design, development, and testing was spearheaded by nonprofit organizations RMI and the Environmental Defense Fund, that work through the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), an organization whose members include major airlines, fuel providers, and sustainable aviation buyers such as Novo Nordisk looking to reduce the climate impacts of air transport.</p><p>The <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a> connects corporate consumers, airlines, freight forwarders, and clean fuel providers in one universally accessible platform that will spur the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by ensuring that SAF certificates purchased outside of the platform are delivered consistently, verifiably, transparently, and credibly. The registry builds on industry best practices and was subject to public consultation to ensure SAF certificates exchanged realize their intended environmental impact and can be claimed towards emissions reduction goals.</p><p>SAF is made from renewable or waste materials and can decrease the lifecycle emissions of flight by more than 80%. However, the fuel is not yet widely available and can be significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. The Registry helps address this market gap by connecting corporate demand for emissions reductions to SAF producers through an auditable ledger for certificates which decouples the emissions benefits of SAF use from the physical fuel supply. It is the final piece of market infrastructure — in addition to robust <a href="https://rsb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RSB-PRO-20-001-001-RSB-Book-and-Claim-Manual-3.0.pdf">standards</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificate-safc-emissions-accounting-and-reporting-guidelines/">book &amp; claim accounting guidelines</a>, and structured <a href="https://flysaba.org/2023/04/04/first-collective-purchase-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates/">RFPs</a> — to create a robust and de-risked market for SAFc investment.</p><p><a href="https://flysaba.org/2024/04/17/sustainable-aviation-buyers-alliance-announces-historic-agreements-to-purchase-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates-to-grow-investment-in-clean-fuel-technologies/">Major customers have already banded together via SABA to collectively procure SAF certificates</a>. Several of these deals will use the SAFc Registry as the delivery mechanism. Future procurement efforts inside and outside of SABA can use the SAFc Registry to seamlessly ensure the delivery of SAF certificates and sustainability assurances to buyers. Q8Aviation, an international jet fuel supplier delivering sustainable aviation fuel to the aviation market, recently enrolled to the registry saying, “We look forward to leveraging the SAFc registry to expand accessibility and support broader adoption of&nbsp;SAF.”</p><p>Additionally, climate tech company CHOOOSE is complementing the registry with features to streamline the flow of SAF transactions across the value chain. “At CHOOOSE, we build and operate software that supports airlines, freight forwarders, clean fuel providers, and corporate buyers in scaling their sustainable aviation fuel programs. Recognizing the vital role SAF plays in helping to decarbonize the aviation industry, these programs contribute meaningfully to SAF’s adoption. By leveraging systems like book and claim, the SAFc Registry ensures the secure transfer of certificates — and when coupled with CHOOOSE technology, SAF transactions become more automated, streamlined, and accessible. Through this partnership, we’re able to accelerate the use of SAF across the sector,” said Gaute Gamst, Chief Technology Officer at&nbsp;CHOOOSE.</p><p>Web 3 technologies play an important role in operation of the SAFc Registry in order to provide deep transparency to end-users. With the support of so-called worker nodes anchored and supported by the Energy Web X blockchain on Polkadot, actions on the SAFc Registry are checked, validated, and digitally recorded in a zero trust, tamper proof way. For registry users, the public, and auditors, this represents a continuous audit of registry operations.</p><p><a href="https://safcregistry.org/">For more information, please visit the SAFc registry&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>Notes to&nbsp;Editors:</p><p>About Energy Web Foundation:</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>DWN Community Node</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF has launched a Decentralized Web Node (DWN) <a href="https://identity.foundation/dwn/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Community Instance</a>, operated by DIF and powered by Google Cloud.</p>
<p>Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs - also referred to as DWeb Nodes) are personal data stores that eliminate the need for individuals to trust apps to responsibly use and protect their data. Instead, data is owned and controlled by the individual — offering developers a brand new way to create apps that request individuals’ permission to read and access their data, but don’t store it.</p>
<p>The Managed DWN service or “community node” will allow existing and new Google Cloud customers to more easily build test applications using DWNs. Rather than having to run their own DWN or server infrastructure to store data, developers will be able to leverage a DWN on Google Cloud to build test applications.</p>
<p>Developers can use the community DWN node at no cost, including up to 1GB of storage per DID.</p>
<p>To read the report from the launch event on 18 July, click <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/dwn-community-node/">here</a>.</p>
<p>To start building decentralized apps on Web5, developers can visit developers.tbd.website.</p>

<p>Orgs join forces to advocate for inclusion of DIDs in the ARF</p>
<p><br>

<p>Leading experts collaborated to advocate for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) in the EU Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF).</p>
<p>The rationale, detailed in a <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/7c2abd75a4e79ecee102106b2ebea839bed0a32b/publications/DID_EUDIW_ARF-20240709.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">paper</a> published on Github, includes improved privacy and empowerment for individuals, broad existing implementations and support and interoperability and future proofing of the ARF. The paper also addresses a number of misconceptions about DIDs.</p>
<p>The intervention comes around the second anniversary of DIDs becoming an official web standard, after the specification was adopted as a W3C recommendation.</p>
<p>"Getting one organization to agree on something is hard. And getting multiple orgs to agree? If the reason is important enough, you find a way. Empowering individuals with digital identities they control is one of them," said DIF's Executive Director, Kim Hamilton Duffy.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful to Decentralized Identity Foundation, Digital Credentials Consortium, Trust Over IP Foundation for their leadership, and to the numerous community members (from W3C and beyond) for pulling this together in a very tight timeframe -- over a holiday weekend, in fact", she added.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/issues/278?ref=blog.identity.foundation">github issue</a> -- please upvote if you support DIDs!</p>
<p>DIF releases Credential Trust Establishment white paper</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF's Credential Trust Establishment Working Group released a new white paper titled "Decentralizing Trust in Identity Systems", describing how to achieve scaleable trust relationships in decentralized identity networks.</p>
<p>The problem of trust in a decentralized identity ecosystem comes down to the simple question of whether a credential verifier should trust the issuer of a credential. This problem becomes increasingly complex as networks expand to include many credential issuers and delegated trust relationships.</p>
<p>The paper explores different trust network architectures, comparing risks, benefits, and tradeoffs. It highlights the advantages of the Credential Trust Establishment Specification, offering practical recommendations for developing and managing of trust networks.</p>
<p>Check out the annoucement <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/decentralizing-trust-in-identity-systems/">here</a> and read the white paper <a href="https://identity.foundation/publications/DecentralizingTrustInIdentitySystems.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>.</p>
  🛠️ Working Group Updates  
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">💡Identifiers and Discovery Work Group</a> 
<p>The Linked Verifiable Presentation (VP) work item is completed now the spec has been ratified by the Steering Committee.  "It's a really nice spec, simple and useful. JC did a great job managing it and promoting it to the right people at conferences. All in all a very successful work item!" said co-chair Markus Sabadello.</p>
<p>A potential new work item, DID Traits, was presented by the group's new co-chair, JC Ebersbach at DICE, generating interest from the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP) and Open Wallet Foundation (OWF) among others. "The idea is to establish a list of traits and map these to DID methods, in order to provide a first assessment of how DID methods are different and help implementers decide which DID method(s) to use." JC said.</p>
<p>Several updates have been applied to the Universal Resolver, related to support for did:key and did:kscirc (a Korean DID method).</p>
<p>Identifiers and Discovery meets bi-weekly at 11am PT/ 2pmET/ 8pm CET Mondays</p>
 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/crypto-wg/blob/main/agenda.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">🔐 Applied Crypto WG</a> 
<p>The BBS Signature Scheme is continuing to move forward, with further great progress this month.</p>
<p>The draft specifications for Blind BBS Signatures and BBS Pseudonyms have been updated and lodged with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), following the submission of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Draft 6</a> of the overall specification at the end of last month.</p>
<p>Blind signatures are digital signatures over messages not known to the Signer. A pseudonym is a value that will remain constant each time a Prover presents a BBS proof to the same Verifier, but will be different (and unlinkable), when the Prover interacts with a different Verifier. This provides a way for a recipient (Verifier) to track the presentations intended for them, while also hindering them from tracking the Prover's interactions with other Verifiers.</p>
<p>The DIF Crypto - BBS work item meets weekly  at 11am PT/2pm ET /8pm CET Mondays</p>
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">📦 Secure Data Storage</a> 
<p>This month, the Decentralized Web Node (DWN) Task Force is excited to announce a partnership with Google and TBD to support community decentralized web node hosting (see DIF News, above). This marks a significant milestone in the development of personal data stores. On the WG activity front, lively discussions about versioning have been ongoing, primarily focusing on semantic consistency and timing considerations. The DWN WG has also been exploring ways to enhance adoption and onboarding tools for the Decentralized Web. These discussions include ideas such as a "block explorer" for protocol discovery and thin client support to reduce computational overhead for specific operations.</p>
<p>DIF/CCG Secure Data Storage WG - DWN Task Force meets bi-weekly at 9am PT/12pm ET/6pm CET Wednesdays</p>
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group</a> 
<p>The Credential Schemas group, led by co-chairs Otto Mora and Jim Schoening, has been compiling a unified glossary (based on the IEEE ontologies) of common terms intended to form the basis for a KYC Personal Data Model. Over 20 sources have been assessed, including Google and Meta Takeout Data, the HL7 and FHIR health data standards, OIDC Core data model, ISO mDOC and ISO 18013-5 (mDL). This will help further progress on this initial KYC schema, with more schemas to follow later including AML, Proof of Humanity, and Proof of Age.</p>

  📖 Open Groups at DIF  
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/veramo-usergroup/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Veramo User Group</a> 
<p>The next release of Veramo will include an update to the credential plugin system, making it easy to extend with new proof formats. Currently, adding a new proof format requires an upstream change to Veramo, but after this release such plugins can be developed entirely independently.</p>
<p>Other recent updates include some compatibility fixes, pruning some of the dependencies that were causing issues in react-native environments.</p>
<p>Meetings take place weekly on Thursdays, alternating between Noon EST / 18.00 CET and 09.00 EST / 15.00 CET.  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/veramo-usergroup?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Click here</a> for more details</p>

<p>ID Day</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a coalition partner of ID4Africa, DIF urges our members to celebrate The Right To Be Visible on ID Day, 16th September 2024.</p>
<p>Having proof of one’s identity is a fundamental human right, and a practical necessity, especially in the context of this modern digital age. Very few social constructs play as foundational a role in our lives as personal identity, yet the world does not commemorate it. Through a dedicated commemorative day, we hope to promote a responsible narrative about the most important human asset – our legal identity.</p>
<p>ID Day sensitizes us to the plight of those who lack proof of identity (estimated at 850 million, with about half in Africa) and reaffirms our commitment to achieving total inclusion, so that no one is left behind.</p>
<p>The choice of the date 16 September (16.9) is highly symbolic. It is in commemoration of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9 which calls for the provision of legal identity for all by 2030, including birth registration.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.id-day.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">ID Day website</a> for ideas for ways to celebrate ID Day, and plenty of resources to help you do so.</p>

 Championing European Gymnastics with Borderless Knowledge enabled by Artificial Intelligence and OriginTrail <p><a href="https://www.europeangymnastics.com/">European Gymnastics</a> is a sports organisation counting 50 national member federations, and reaches beyond the borders of political Europe. It nevertheless bears the idea of a united gymnastics nation. As guarantor of interests of its around 8,500,000 gymnasts, European Gymnastics represents many different facets. From high-level competitive sports in four Olympic, and three non-Olympic disciplines to leisure sports in gymnastics for all with offers for all age groups, from toddlers to senior citizens. European Gymnastics transmit their understanding of being together beyond borders and set an example in community.</p><p>Now, European Gymnastics is launching its own Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant powered by <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> to drive borderless knowledge in order to further their mission to promote, develop and support synergy among the community to make Gymnastics and gymnasts at all levels, shine. The friendly mascot Luigi who you can meet at all major European Gymnastics events, is now receiving its digital twin. Powered by AI, digital Luigi allows anyone to learn and keep in touch with the European Gymnastics community. From finding the information about the next competition to learning about​​ important events in European Gymnastics history or helping you understand which elements are important for scoring a routine on parallel bars — all can be discovered with the help of the AI-powered Luigi.</p><p>The uniqueness of our digital Luigi is that his responses always include sources of information, allowing the user to explore any particular source further. This capability is unlocked by using OriginTrail’s Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is promising to unlock an even more powerful Luigi assistant as it will allow the initial knowledge base to continuously expand, not only by European Gymnastics’s inputs but also with contributions of the national federations, gymnasts and fans. As OriginTrail is based on blockchain, all such contributions will also be protected against tampering — extending European Gymnastics’s commitment to integrity from the sport halls to managing&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today’s launch of Luigi is accompanied by the launch of the biggest sporting event in the world — the Olympic Games. To help you navigate all the performances by European gymnasts in Paris, Luigi is already equipped with knowledge about the schedule and will also be receiving updates about results every&nbsp;day.</p><p>“European Gymnastics is excited to keep pushing the innovation in our sport. After being the first continental gymnastics federation to launch a digital cup competition this year, we are now making first steps into adopting Artificial Intelligence and blockchain to improve the ease of interaction with what is sometimes considered a complex world of Gymnastics. This is an important step in our newly adopted Strategy 2030, embracing top technology which has a lot to offer..” Dr. Farid Gayibov, European Gymnastics President.</p><p>You can find Luigi’s digital twin on the <a href="https://europeangymnastics.com/ask">European Gymnastics website</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/championing-european-gymnastics-with-borderless-knowledge-enabled-by-artificial-intelligence-and-f49dae6f6e25">Championing European Gymnastics with Borderless Knowledge enabled by Artificial Intelligence and…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>About a month ago one of our founders, Joel Thorstensson, released an <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/private-data-architecture/1585?ref=blog.ceramic.network">initial overview</a> of our plans to begin ideating how physical private data capabilities could be natively offered to developers using the Ceramic Network. The forum post includes details of how this would be rolled out in two phases in the form of a proof-of-concept, which is advisable to read before consuming this article.</p><p>It's also important to mention the motivation behind this effort. To start, Ceramic doesn't currently offer any native privacy features. This means that all data on Ceramic is public by default. At the same time, over the past few years, we've recognized the strong need for access control across several applications and use cases. A rough estimation would be almost half of all apps built on Ceramic have access control needs in one form or another.</p><p> In thinking about a solution, we aligned on the premise that physical access control (where data lives and who can sync it, as opposed to encryption) resonates most directly with the uniqueness of Ceramic's event-based architecture and our desire to align with edge privacy principles.</p><p>As such, our next step was to define a scope around a minimalist build to showcase how physical data privacy could be implemented in Ceramic.</p> Phase 1: API Read Access Control <p>If you've read Joel's forum post (linked above), you already know the details of the concept we've designed for this first phase. However, below are several key takeaways:</p>  Builds on <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic-one</a> (implementation of the Ceramic protocol, written in Rust)  Leverages the Feed API on Ceramic-one nodes, thus allowing nodes to filter the feed of events based on which permissions a user has  Designed to showcase how two users could share private data from the same node by leveraging object-capabilities (OCAP)  Shows how an object-capability generated by user 1 references a stream containing the data they want to share (as well as the DID corresponding to user 2, the person they want to share their data with) and allows user 2 to access data that would otherwise be physically inaccessible to query and obtain without the OCAP  <p>This article will walk through how to run the PoC locally.</p><p>If you prefer video, please view the YouTube version of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNiUlGremBQ&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Private Data Playground</a>:</p> Setting Up Your Environment <p>This walk-through requires you to generate clones of two repositories, one of which is the PoC itself, while the other is the Rust-Ceramic codebase.</p> Rust-Ceramic Set-Up <p>First, install protobuf:</p> <code># You can alternatively use `brew install protobuf`
PROTOC_VERSION=3.20.1
PROTOC_ZIP=protoc-$PROTOC_VERSION-linux-x86_64.zip
curl --retry 3 --retry-max-time 90 -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v$PROTOC_VERSION/$PROTOC_ZIP \
    &amp;&amp; unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc \
    &amp;&amp; unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*' \
    &amp;&amp; rm -f $PROTOC_ZIP</code> <p>Next, clone the Rust-Ceramic codebase:</p> <code># we will need a special branch from the repo
git clone https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic &amp;&amp; cd rust-ceramic &amp;&amp; git fetch</code> <p>We need to set up our Rust-Ceramic node from a specific branch. Enter the branch relevant to this PoC, build, and run the daemon:</p> <code># enter the special branch
git checkout feat/private-data

# build and run
cargo run -p ceramic-one -- daemon</code> <p>If your terminal starts populating with logs like the screenshot below, you've successfully started your node!</p><p>You now have an active Ceramic node running in the background! Next, we'll walk through the configuration for the private data playground web app.</p> Private Data Playground Web App Setup <p>First, clone the Private Data Playground repository:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/private-data-playground</code> <p>Go ahead and open the private-data-playground repo in your text editor of choice. Once open, we will need to create a copy of the example environment file and rename it:</p> <code>cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Our first step is to supply a value to our <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID</code> variable by setting up a Project ID with WalletConnect. You can set one up for free (if you don't already have one) by following the simple steps in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/walletconnect-tutorial/">WalletConnect tutorial</a> (under "Obtain a WalletConnect Project ID). We will need this given that our application's Wagmi hooks rely on a contextual wrapper that will allow us to leverage these hooks within all child components, and use <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/appkit/overview?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal</a>.</p><p>Once obtained, paste this into your new environment file next to the variable name referenced above.</p><p>Next, install your dependencies:</p> <code>npm install</code> <p>We're now ready to run the PoC!</p> Running the Application <p>Start up your application from within the private-data-playground repository in developer mode to initiate the UI:</p> <code>npm run dev</code> <p>You should now be able to access the UI by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:3000/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser!</p> Creating a Stream and a Capability <p>Our first section will focus on generating a stream (containing a simple message) and an OCAP. </p><p>To begin, self-authenticate by clicking "Connect Wallet." </p><p>You should see a secondary signature request appear after selecting an account - approving this request will create a browser session (specific to your DID, stemming from your Eth address) that the application will use to sign and submit data on your behalf as you create messages:</p><p>There are two views contained in this simple PoC - one for writing data, and one for reading. Make sure you're in the "Write" view by clicking the toggle under your address:</p><p>Go ahead and enter a simple message of your choosing - for example, "I love Ceramic!" would be an obvious choice. Go ahead and click the "Create" button. This action initiates a process that builds a new Ceramic stream and constructs your message into a payload that the Rust-Ceramic feed API will accept.</p><p>You should now see the resulting identifier under "Stream ID":</p><p>Go ahead and copy this value. Save it somewhere as it's needed later (a simple text document will suffice). </p><p>Finally, select another Eth address you control (make sure to remember which one) and enter it into the text input under "Delegate read access to". When ready, click "Create Capability". If you've followed all the steps correctly, your screen should look something like this:</p><p>Copy the capability value somewhere you can reference for the next section.</p><p>Congrats! You've successfully created both a Ceramic stream and a capability object! The next section will show how to use these to access otherwise private data.</p> Using the OCAP to Access Private Data <p>Go ahead and disconnect your current authenticated account from the web app. Next, go through the sign-in flow using the address you selected for the "Delegate read access to" input from the prior section.</p><p>Once authenticated, navigate to the "Read" toggle in the web app:</p><p>Enter the Stream ID and the Capability generated and saved from the prior section.</p><p>If you've copied over the values correctly, you should now be able to view the original message:</p><p>Congratulations - you've successfully used a capability to access otherwise private data on Ceramic. </p><p>You can also run through the "Read" process again, but this time make an arbitrary edit to the OCAP (thus invalidating it). With the Stream ID value kept the same, you'll notice that you no longer access the resulting message.</p> Next Steps <p>This minimal PoC is only the beginning of our plans for rolling out private data on Ceramic, with phase 2 coming soon (showcasing data privacy in the form of nodes and their ability to sync data between each other based on signed capabilities).</p><p>Is private data relevant to what you're building? Have feedback, questions, or concerns about our current thinking around private data? We'd love to hear from you! Fill out our <a href="https://ceramic.network/contact-us?ref=blog.ceramic.network">community contact form</a>, or email us at <a>partners@3box.io</a>. </p><p>Happy buidling!</p>

<p>Today, we are excited to announce our latest research exposing the massively networked personal information sharing happening between and across identity resolution and customer data platforms that has been hiding in plain sites for over 10 years. These industries are the plumbing backbone in synthesizing personal data from hundreds of data sources—across services, devices, and spanning the digital world and the physical world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February 2024, Cracked Labs published <a href="https://crackedlabs.org/en/identity-surveillance">“Pervasive identity surveillance for marketing purposes”</a>, an in-depth analysis of LiveRamp’s RampID identity graph. One of the most superficial yet most powerful functions of this excellent report was to guide attention towards industries responsible for pervasive consumer surveillance. The timing was excellent as I’d already committed to present “The Hidden Identity Infrastructure” at Identiverse (May 2024) and prompted by the report, I dug in to better understand the two industries underpinning hidden identity infrastructure, namely, Identity Resolution (ID Res) and Customer Data Platforms (CDPs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are nearly $9T worth of industries worldwide that rely on persistent, hidden identification of people. Naturally, demand of this magnitude fueled the now mature industries that perform pervasive, universal identification of people and their personal information. ISL identified over 350 companies providing either identity resolution platforms, customer data platforms, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This paper explores the magnitude and reach of these two industries, how they came to be, and most importantly, why, from a human well-being perspective, it’s crucial that these kinds of platforms be held to higher regulatory standards of scrutiny, transparency, and accountability. One identity resolution company alone out of 93&nbsp; such companies (worldwide) boasts the collection of 5,000 data elements for [each of] 700 million consumers in 2021. To put this in perspective, the number of user accounts breached worldwide in 2023 was about 300 million1. Is there an appreciable difference between stolen user data and undisclosed “legitimate” personally identifiable information sharing? Moreover, nearly 40% of the 93 companies that provide identity resolution platforms are registered data brokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, after reviewing the research, we must ask ourselves, is this the kind of world we want to live in: a world where everything about us is always known by industry; a world where the ongoing surveillance of people is deemed necessary in the name of capitalism. Is this the kind of world in which humans and societies will flourish or self-destruct? Are humans more than capitalistic consumers? Are we more than our purchasing potential?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A Call to Action&nbsp; 
<p>ISL conducted this research to help illuminate the sizable risk of hidden identification and the worldwide web of user surveillance. ISL believes naming and exposure is crucial to effecting change. Identification resolution and customer data platforms have been hiding in plain sight for more than a decade, and yet even the “identerati” are largely unfamiliar with these industries. How can we expect everyday people to know?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This paper is a rallying call for privacy advocates to come together to demand greater regulatory scrutiny, transparency and oversight for these industries, in conjunction with more meaningful data broker regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, this is a rallying call to acknowledge the catastrophic failure of notice and consent as a valid permissioning mechanism for highly complex and interconnected digital services. It’s inconceivable that people understand the magnitude of data sharing that consenting to sharing “your data with our marketing” entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves if this is the kind of world we want for ourselves and our children, where our preferences, practices, relationships, behaviors, and beliefs are all up for sale and broadly shared without our awareness. Are we ourselves in fact being sold?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technologies fueling these capabilities have received billions of dollars; consumers don’t have a chance in the face of voracious hunger to identify, know, and manipulate them. We hope that this research shines a much needed light on the forces enabling the worldwide web of human surveillance so that they may be held to accountability for their troves of data on nearly all internet users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Act took effect on the first day of the month, and included the establishment and implementation of the Regulator, the Trust Framework Authority. The launch was rather low-key, with the only discernible signal from the Department of Internal Affairs being updates to their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/programmes-and-projects/digital-identity-programme/">digital government web pages</a>&nbsp;to reflect this milestone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a different story in industry, however, where the occasion was covered by&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/07/10/government-bringing-in-new-digital-trust-framework/">DINZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018946184/government-bringing-in-new-digital-trust-framework">nationally by RNZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepress.co.nz/business/350322132/digital-identity-regulator-launched-usher-start-brave-new-world">locally</a>, internationally by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202407/new-zealand-trust-framework-looks-to-onboard-digital-id-providers">Biometric Update</a>&nbsp;and social media posts, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-w-7921274/recent-activity/all/">my own</a>&nbsp;and those from<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219461359028121601/">&nbsp;DINZ</a>.</p>



<p>The quote that really stuck was this one from Victoria University’s Professor of Informatics&nbsp;<a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/markus.luczak-roesch">Markus Luczak-Roesch</a>: “There’s a huge risk of doing nothing. Which is why it’s good that we’re doing something.” He’s absolutely right. It’s been over seven years of policy work at the DIA to reach this point, which I described as<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7215637634742726656/">&nbsp;‘the end of the beginning</a>’. While a challenging journey, Aotearoa can build from here with those that want to opt-in.</p>



<p>Next month’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;ahead of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nethui.nz/">Net Hui</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/the-point-2024-navigating-beyond/">The Point 2024</a>, will kick off with a keynote by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianacafik/">Microsoft’s global identity standards lead</a>&nbsp;and past&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">DIACC TFEC member</a>&nbsp;Juliana Cafik. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219811396312580096/">panel</a>&nbsp;that follows will discuss NZ’s Digital Identity Trust Framework, representing organisations that could be potential Relying Parties/Verifiers in Aotearoa under the DISTF regulation. The Trust Framework market model would see such parties seek out Digital Identity Service Provider/Issuers to deliver privacy-aware, cryptographically secured verified credentials, a topic that I&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/07/24/will-the-digital-trust-hui-taumata-2024-move-the-dial/">blog about here</a>. Publicly, it’s known that MSD and HNZ are piloting DIA’s platform, with RealMe as a notional issuer.</p>



<p>Additionally, the event will cover Digital Public Infrastructure, AI, biometrics, digital acceptance networks, digital drivers’ licences, the Metaverse, passkeys, digital cash, next generation payments, and the challenges of delegated administration across communities and much more. It’s all there, along with a panel of four experts who will review the sessions from a Te Ao Māori perspective.</p>



<p>In short, this year’s Digital Trust Hui Taumata will be like no other. The wait is over, and the rubber is hitting the road for the DISTF. What matters now is scale – will they come?</p>



<p>Lastly, I’m very excited to tell you that the DINZ podcast series is almost ready for launch so do keep an eye out for the first episode dropping very soon.</p>

<p>Deep thought has gone into building the agenda for next month’s<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/"> Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>, ahead of <a href="https://www.nethui.nz/">Net Hui</a> and <a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/the-point-2024-navigating-beyond/">The Point 2024</a>, so that conversations live on and build out later in the year and into subsequent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Significant attention will be devoted to <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/programmes-and-projects/digital-identity-programme/">Trust Frameworks given the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) </a>regulation coming into play on 1 July. Immediately following Minister Collins’ opening remarks, Microsoft’s global identity standards lead and past <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">DIACC TFEC</a> member <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/julianacafik">Juliana Cafik</a> will deliver an intensely interesting first keynote – The international landscape for Digital Identity Trust Frameworks and how NZ compares. Trust frameworks already exist and we use them daily – for example using your bank card to withdraw cash from another bank’s ATM. The panel that follows, representing organisations that could be potential Relying Parties (RPs)/Verifiers under the DISTF, discuss how they see Trust Frameworks playing out. To be relieved of the burden and to minimise risk, these parties notionally look for accredited Digital Identity Service Provider/Issuers to deliver privacy-aware, cryptographically secured verified credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of these three panellists come from regulated industries while the other is a key government agency, where in all cases the failure to verify parties correctly could have devastating consequences. Other regulated industries and government agencies that need similar verification processes include estate agents, rental companies, law firms, financial services, insurance companies, the pharmacies, doctor’s surgeries, the Police Vetting Service, driver licencing, firearms licensing, the box store where you take out a loan for your new appliance, registering for a loyalty scheme – and the list goes on. Representatives from the Regulator, the DISTF Trust Framework Authority, will lead a Roundtable discussion after lunch where delegates can pose their questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are multiple paths to achieve this nirvana of privacy-aware, cryptographically secured verified credentials available to all people under the auspices of a Trust Framework which is why, straight after the Trust Frameworks panel, Worldline’s Conrad Morgan will keynote a complementary path – Turning transactions into interactions – building New Zealand’s first digital identity <a href="https://trinsic.id/first-identity-acceptance-network/">acceptance network</a>’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Supporting Trust Frameworks are increasingly biometrics and AI – both of which need demystifying for the public to gain confidence in them – along with Digital Public Infrastructure, the Metaverse, passkeys, digital cash, digital driver’s licences, next generation payments, the critical need for digital inclusion, and the challenges of delegated administration across communities. The <a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/programme/">agenda</a> comprises local and international speakers covering these topics as well, all reviewed by a panel of four experts reviewing the sessions from a Te Ao Māori perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The richness of the content to be presented at this year’s event is incomparable with previous years. So do not be surprised when the <a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">2024 Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a> is dropped into conversations in years to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In May 2024, the US government’s General Services Administration (GSA) updated its Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Contract with a new Special Item Number (SIN 541519CSP, Credential Service Providers) under the IT Large Category.SIN 541519CSP is designed to help federal agencies ensure that any IT services procured meet the requirements of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63 requirements and digital identity compliant services.&nbsp; To provide credential services under the new SIN, companies must meet <a href="https://gsa.federalschedules.com/resources/new-it-sin-for-credential-service-providers/#overview">specific instructions and requirements</a><a href="https://gsa.federalschedules.com/resources/new-it-sin-for-credential-service-providers/#overview">.</a> SIN 541519CSP was created to meet the increasing need for robust, trustworthy credential service providers. The new SIN will help government agencies quickly identify credential service providers that have been vetted against the government’s standard requirements. If your company offers credential services and meets the requirements, obtaining SIN 541519CSP will place your company in a better position to capture bids as agencies look to acquire NIST 800-63 compliant services. In order to be included on the Schedule, Credential Service Providers must either be listed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-status-list">Kantara Trust&nbsp;Status&nbsp;List</a>&nbsp;or provide a letter pf approval from Kantara Initiative, or other GSA approved third party that can assure conformance to NIST SP 800-63.&nbsp; To begin the process, you’ll need to complete forms that can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/membership/?civiwp=CiviCRM&amp;q=civicrm/mailing/url&amp;u=781&amp;qid=55665">idmanagement.gov</a>. Since both state and federal government agencies are permitted to use the vendors on this schedule for credential services, this considerably extends opportunities for Kantara certified companies.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope, Blockchain Commons’ “Smart Document” system, continues to be a major focus. Here’s what that meant in Q2.</p>

<p>Expanded Developer Pages. The developer pages were updated with a new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/summary/">executive summary</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/features/">feature list</a> to clarify the capabilities and advantages of using Envelope. (More executive summaries of our technology to follow!)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Request/Response Presentation. Our May Gordian Developers Meeting included a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDf2cmfX1k">presentation on Request/Response</a>, which is an interoperable communication methodology using Gordian Envelope. Why use it? It can make complex digital-asset procedures more accessible by using automation to dramatically reduce the amount of human interaction needed, yet it also preserves security by ensuring that human choices are required whenever data is transmitted from one device to another. (But watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDf2cmfX1k">the presentation</a> for more!)</p>



 
    
   

<p>Graphs Representation. Blockchain Commons has a new research paper out on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-006-envelope-graph.md">Representing Graphs with Envelope</a>, which presents a proposed architecture for representing many types of graphs, enabling the use of Envelope for a variety of graph-based structures and algorithms.</p>

 Gordian Meetings 

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/tree/master/meetings#blockchain-commons-meetings">Gordian Developer Meetings</a> are how we bring the wallet community together to talk about our interoperable specifications. We’ve been thrilled to expand that in the last quarter with some feature presentations from experts in the field.</p>

<p>FROST Presentation. April saw a special presentation on FROST by Jesse Posner that not only talked about his work to date, but also some of the emerging capabilities of FROST, such as the ability to regenerate shares or even change thresholds without changing the underlying secret! We’ve long thought FROST was a great next-generation resilience solution for digital assets, and so appreciate Jesse talking to our community about why it’s so exciting. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCM8dDql6oo">complete video</a> of our April meeting for more.</p>



 
    
   

<p>PayJoin Presentation. Privacy is one of our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">fundamental principles for Gordian design</a>. It’s also a principle that will be better supported in Bitcoin with a <a href="https://payjoin.org/">new version of PayJoin</a>. Dan Gould was kind enough to give a full presentation on the updates he’s working on at our May meeting. We’ve got a video of just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMGL-Y498ZQ">his PayJoin presentation</a>.</p>



 
    
   

<p>All the Rest. Both meetings of course also included details on Blockchain Commons’ own work (much of which is detailed in this report). The Gordian Developer meetings continue on the first Wednesday of every month. We’ve also already scheduled a few feature presentations for the rest of the year. On August 7th, we’ll have a special presentation on BIP-85, then on December 4th, we’ll have another FROST presentation for wallet developers. If you’d like to make a special presentation in September, October, or November on a topic of interest to wallet developers, let us know!</p>

<p>Also, if you’re a cryptographer, spec designer, or library developer who is working to implement FROST, please be sure to sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#frost-implementers">FROST implementers announcements-only list</a> so that you can receive invites for our second FROST Implementers Round Table, which will be on September 18 thanks to support from the <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-14-projects-worldwide/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a>.</p>

 Seedtool-Rust Release 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ newest reference application is <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">seedtool-cli for Rust</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">
    
</a></p>

<p>seedtool-cli-rust. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">Seedtool</a> is a domain-specific  application that allows the creation, reconstruction, translation, and backup of cryptographic seeds. Blockchain Commons’ new Rust-based Seedtool replaces our older C++-based CLI and provides broader support for Gordian Envelope, including offering Gordian Envelopes of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR shares</a>, that can backup a seed using Shamir’s Secret Sharing. Seedtool’s Gordian Envelopes can then be piped into <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">envelope-cli-rust</a> for compression, encryption, or the addition of further metadata.</p>

<p>Seedtool Manual. For more on seedtool-cli-rust, check out the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust/blob/master/MANUAL.md">full user manual</a>, which explains how to use all of its functionality and why it’s important.</p>

 dCBOR Adoption 

<p>dCBOR is one of the foundations of Envelope, as it allows for the deterministic ordering of data, which is crucial for a hashed data system like Envelope. The IETF dCBOR Internet-Draft updated from <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/08/">v8</a> to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/10/">v10</a> over Q2, with most of those changes due to expanding support for the spec. We’re still hoping to see the Internet-Draft finalized soon!</p>

<p><a href="https://cbor.me/">
    
</a></p>

<p>cbor.me. <a href="https://cbor.me/">The CBOR Playground</a> is Carsten Bormann’s foundational diagnostic site for CBOR. It now supports dCBOR thanks to a new <a href="https://github.com/cabo/cbor-dcbor">Ruby Gem</a> that Carsten authored.</p>

<p>cbor2. Joe Hildebrand’s <a href="https://github.com/hildjj/cbor2">cbor2 library for Typescript</a> has also been expanded to support dCBOR.</p>

<p>QCBOR. Laurence Lundblade’s <a href="https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR">QCBOR</a> library (which is written in C) now supports dCBOR in its development branch.</p>

<p>IANA Assignment of Tag 201. Finally, 201 is now officially the “enclosed dCBOR” <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">tag for CBOR</a>. This is also critical for Gordian Envelope, which uses this tag to wrap dCBOR in each of an envelope’s “leaf” nodes.</p>

 GSTP Improvements 

<p>Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol (GSTP) is a Gordian Envelope extension. It allows for Envelope Requests and Responses to be sent in a secure way and is a critical element of Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/csr/">Collaborative Seed Recovery</a> system, which enables the storage of SSKR shares in a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-depo-rust">Gordian Depository</a>.</p>

<p>GSTP Advances. Thanks to support from our Research Sponsor, <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation Devices</a>, Blockchain Commons was able to expend considerable engineering work on GSTP in the last quarter, resulting in more fluent API patterns for building GSTP requests and responses. In addition, GSTP now supports bidirectional self-encrypted state with a unique and powerful new feature that we are calling Encrypted State Continuations (ESC). Overall, GSTP is a system that is secure, distributed, and transportation-agnostic. In a world where we could be sending digital-asset info by NFC, Bluetooth, or QR codes, it’s a critical security measure. See our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnH14LkJOnI">presentation</a> from the most recent Gordian Developers Meeting for more!</p>



 
    
   

 SSH Research 

<p>SSH has been long used as an authentication system, primarily for accessing UNIX computers. However, it’s recently come under increasing usage as a signing system as well, primarily thanks to extensions in Git. That has led to Blockchain Commons experimenting with the integration of SSH keys into Envelope. (This has also demonstrateð the flexibility of Envelope through the addition of these signing methodologies.) We’ve now got some first results.</p>

<p>ssh-envelope Experiment in Python. Early in the quarter, we produced <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/ssh-envelope-python">ssh-envelope</a>, an experimental Python program that worked with both <code>ssh-keygen</code> and <code>envelope-cli</code>. But, thanks to some very rapid development, we’ve already moved beyond that.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">
    
</a></p>

<p>SSH Key Support for envelope-cli. We’ve since integrated SSH key support throughout our Rust stack, primarily affecting our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">bc-components</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-rust">bc-envelope</a> Rust crates. This allowed us to bring our SSH key support fully into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">Rust envelope-cli</a>, which you can now use <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust/blob/master/docs/Signing.md">for SSH signing</a>.</p>

<p>More to Come. We’re still working on processes that will allow for the safe, secure, and reliable signing of software releases, something that we talked about extensively in our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-software.md">software use cases</a>. You can see some more of our work-in-progress in a discussion of <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/3d6a2f39c4b623a1a287b3fb7e0aa05b">SSH Key Best Practices</a>. We hope to have more on using SSH to enable resilient &amp; secure software releases later in the year.</p>

 Architectural Articles 

<p>Blockchain Commons expresses a lot of its more architectural thoughts as articles. There were two major articles in Q2.</p>

<p>Minimum Viable Architecture. Our first major article for the quarter focused on the methodology of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-mva/">Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)</a>. Many companies still focus on Minimum Viable Products. Our article advocates instead looking at the big picture (with lots of discussion on why that’s important).</p>

<p>Authentication Patterns. Design patterns are a crucial element in architectural design. Much as with the adversaries found in <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a>, design patterns allow you to put together a larger system piece by piece. As part of a guide to the strength of heterogeneity in architectural design, Blockchain Commons penned a set of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/architecture/patterns/auth/">authentication design patterns</a>. We’d like to do more to fill out the space, but for now feel like this is a good first cut that shows the value of the design style.</p>

 DID Futures 

<p>The Blockchain Commons principals have been involved with DIDs since Christopher Allen founded <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting Web of Trust</a> in 2015.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">
    
</a></p>

<p>W3C DID 1.1 WG. After a hiatus, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID working group</a> has been rechartered through 2026. Christopher Allen continues as an Invited Expert, focused on a variety of privacy issues, including elision, DID registration, and DID resolver issues.</p>

<p>RWOT 13. Meanwhile, Rebooting the Web of Trust continues to be on the frontline for DID advancements, with Christopher still the chair of the organization and Shannon Appelcline the editor-in-chief. <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/rwot%20workshop/RWOT13-Papers/">RWOT13</a> is finally back in the USA, with the early bird deadline for advance-reading papers at the start of August.</p>

 Grants/Funding 

<p>As we’ve written elsewhere, funding has become more difficult in the last year because of large-scale financial factors such as inflation and the resultant increase in interest rates. Blockchain Commons has responded by working more closely with some of our partners on topics of special interest to them and by seeking out grants.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation</a> for their grant enabling our continued support of FROST work.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation Devices</a> for their support of GSTP work.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://contract.design/">Digital Contract Design</a> for their support of our advocacy over the last year.</p>

<p>Please consider becoming a personal or corporate <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a> of Blockchain Commons so that our work can continue. Or, if you want support to integrate or expand one of Blockchain Commons’ existing projects (such as SSKR, Envelope, or the Gordian Depositories) in an open manner, to meet your company’s needs, contact us directly about becoming a Research Sponsor.</p>

<p>Also, please let us know of any grants or awards that you think would be closely aligned with our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can apply.</p>

 What’s Next? 

<p>Coming up:</p>
 
   More work on Envelope &amp; GSTP. 
   More reveals of our SSH work. 
   A new musings on cryptographic “cliques”. 
 

<p>We’re looking forward to Q3!</p>

<p>On July 16th, 2024, the FIDO Alliance held a <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/fido-munich-seminar-2024-strengthening-authentication-with-passkeys-in-automotive-and-beyond/">seminar</a> focused on the fit for FIDO authentication and device onboarding within the automotive industry. Co-hosted with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/swissbit/">Swissbit</a>, the event had over 100 attendees who heard from various stakeholders on the need and opportunity for standards-based approaches to securing the automotive workforce and manufacturing process. Themes included how passkeys and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">FIDO-certified biometrics</a> can help transform the future of in-vehicle experiences, especially with in-car <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkey-use-case/payments/">payments</a>, smart cars, and IoT.</p>



 FIDO Momentum in the Automotive Industry 



<p>Like just about every market sector, the automotive industry is plagued by risks and ramifications associated with decades of relying on passwords – and is also uniquely poised to improve the user experience by embracing <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> for user authentication.</p>



<p>With smart cars having embedded technology to connect to digital experiences, there are several innovations primed for take-off in the automotive industry. With nearly <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/research/fintech-payments/emerging-payments/in-vehicle-payments-research-report/">100 million vehicles will be making payments by 2026</a>, up from just 2.3 million in 2021, passkeys will be crucial to simplify the in-vehicle user experience. At the same time, manufacturers have the opportunity to improve IoT and secure embedded devices to improve customer experiences on and off the road.</p>



 Manufacturing and Smart Car Case Studies 



<p>On the workforce front, the event featured a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fido-munich-seminar-workforce-authentication-case-study-pptx/270406201">case study</a> from MTRIX and considerations on how to deploy FIDO security keys to a manufacturer’s workforce – contemplating the many types and locations of workers for today’s global manufacturers. This case study reinforced the factors called out in a presentation by <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">Infineon</a> on the regulatory-driven push and pull with FIDO authentication.</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/vincss-official/">VinCSS</a> described how <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/device-onboarding-overview/">FIDO Device Onboard</a> is being used today to secure the smart car ecosystem both at point of manufacturing as well as for after-market use cases.</p>



 Using Passkeys for In-Vehicle Payments 



<p>The final block of sessions looked more closely at our in-vehicle future – including an overview of current trends for in-vehicle payments. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fido-munich-seminar-in-vehicle-payment-trends-pptx/270406190">Visa</a> and <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fido-munich-seminar-blueprint-for-in-vehicle-payment-standard-pptx/270375336">Starfish</a> then presented a blueprint and demo respectively for a standards-based approach for in-vehicle payments before <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">Qualcomm</a> wrapped things up with their vision for a digital chassis as the foundation for a software-defined vehicle that contemplates the need for secure identity, payments and driver/passenger personalization.</p>

<p>The digital transformation and the proliferation of e-identity schemes have escalated the need for secure and reliable online <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/">identity verification</a> methods, especially in light of the alarming trend of AI-generated “deepfakes.” As internet users have learned about the increasing threat of deepfakes, they have become increasingly concerned about their identities being spoofed online, according to a new study conducted by the FIDO Alliance. As a result, deepfake awareness and the risks associated with them have steadily increased.</p>



<p>Amidst this landscape, the FIDO Alliance released its newest research in the eBook, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/remote-identity-verification-biometric-systems-consumer-insights-2024">Remote ID Verification – Bringing Confidence to Biometric Systems Consumer Insights 2024</a>, which reveals insights from an independent study surveying 2,000 respondents in the U.S. and the U.K. on consumer perceptions on remote identity verification, online security, and biometrics. While the data showed consumer awareness and adoption of biometrics is increasing, consumers also expressed concerns about the rise of AI-generated deepfakes – reinforcing the need for preventative strategies and technologies focused on secure remote identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a “deepfake”? 



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/mdm-inauthentic-content-product-english_508.pdf">Center for Internet Security</a>, a deepfake consists of convincingly fabricated audio and video content designed to mislead audiences into believing that fabricated events or statements are real. These manipulations can create realistic yet entirely false representations of individuals through synthetic images or complete video footage. This manipulated audio/video content is dangerously effective at spreading false information. In cybersecurity, deepfakes are increasingly being used to spoof identities to fraudulently open accounts or take control of existing accounts.</p>



<p>With the advent of AI and the increasing use of face biometrics for remote identity verification, the deepfake risks to remote identity proofing (RIDP) methods have become a reality. Security researchers have been closely evaluating the identity verification risks associated with deepfakes to increase awareness of the rapidly changing threat landscape and support stronger countermeasures that enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of remote identity proofing (RIDP) methods. In the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’s (ENISA) latest remote ID <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/remote-id-proofing-good-practices">report</a>, researchers observed that deepfake injection attacks are increasing and becoming more difficult to mitigate.</p>



 Users Express Concerns about Deepfakes and ID Verification 



<p>With the rise of generative AI and deepfake videos in the news, there has been a heightened consumer unease about the security of biometrics for online verification. In the FIDO Alliance’s study, the deepfake trends have not escaped consumers’ attention online, who are increasingly using face biometrics to authenticate identities online and are concerned about identity security.</p>



<p>On one hand, the study reinforced consumer preference for using biometrics in remote identity verification, with nearly half of the respondents indicating a preference to use face biometrics, especially for sensitive transactions, like financial services (48%).&nbsp;</p>







<p>On the other hand, just over half of respondents revealed they are concerned about deepfakes when verifying identities online (52%).</p>







 Building Consumer Trust in Face Biometrics 



<p>As the concerns around deepfake security threats gain prominence, the industry has taken a significant step forward with the FIDO Alliance’s newly introduced Identity Verification certification program for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification</a>. This industry-first testing certification program, based on ISO standards, with requirements developed by the FIDO Alliance, aims to measure accuracy, liveness (including deepfake detection), and bias (including skin tone, age, and gender) in remote biometric identity verification technologies. By providing a framework for testing biometric performance and a network of accredited laboratories worldwide, this certification program standardizes and evaluates the performance of face verification systems while mitigating the impact of bias and security threats, like deepfakes.</p>



 Certifying Identity Verification with the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The Identity Verification certifications that the FIDO Alliance provides offer industry providers the ability to demonstrate commitment to addressing bias and security threats in remote biometric identity verification technologies. With a focus on standardizing and enhancing the performance of face verification technologies, the Alliance released its new <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certification Program</a> to elevate the performance, security, and equity of biometric solutions for remote identity verification. Combined with its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/document-authenticity/">Document Authenticity</a> (DocAuth) Certification Program, these two certifications work together to ensure identity verification solution providers can leverage FIDO’s independent testing and accredited laboratories as a market differentiator.&nbsp;</p>

 Commitment to ensure quality products for customers of the relying parties&nbsp; 



 Requirements developed by a diverse, international group of stakeholders from industry, government, and subject matter experts 



 Conforms to ISO 



 FIDO Annex published in ISO standards 
 



 What is the value of accredited laboratories? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/laboratory-overview/">FIDO Accredited Laboratories</a> are available worldwide and follow a common set of requirements and rigorous evaluation processes, defined by the FIDO Alliance Biometrics Working Group (BWG) and follow all relevant ISO standards. These laboratories are audited and trained by the FIDO Biometric Secretariat to ensure lab testing methodologies are compliant and utilize governance mechanisms per FIDO requirements. Laboratories perform biometric evaluations in alignment with audited FIDO accreditation processes. In contrast, bespoke, single laboratory biometric evaluations may not garner sufficient trust from relying parties for authentication and remote identity verification use cases.</p>



 What are the ISO Standards that FIDO certification conforms to? 



<p>When a vendor invests in FIDO’s Face Verification Certification, they and their accredited lab are adhering to the following ISO standards:</p>



Terminology<br>ISO/IEC 2382-37:2022 Information technology — Vocabulary — Part 37: BiometricsPresentation Attack Detection<br>ISO/IEC 30107-3:2023 Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 3: Testing and reportingISO/IEC 30107-4:2020 Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 4: Profile for testing of mobile devices<br>-FIDO Annex, published 2024Performance (e.g., FRR, FAR)<br>ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 1: Principles and frameworkISO/IEC 19795-9:2019 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 9: Testing on mobile devices<br>-FIDO Annex, published 2019Bias (differentials due to demographics)<br>ISO/IEC 19795-10:2024 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 10: Quantifying biometric system performance variation across demographic groups<br>-FIDO Annex, under developmentLaboratory<br>ISO/IEC 17025:2017, General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories

Over the decades, billions of products worldwide have been equipped with barcodes, streamlining and standardizing supply chain processes and adhering to GS1 standards.</p><p>As consumer demand for product information grew, regulatory requirements became stricter, and supply chain optimization pressures increased, the need for an updated barcode became evident. Enter the GS1 Digital Link, the barcode upgrade designed to provide dynamic access to comprehensive product information. Now, with <a href="https://www.gs1.org/resources/articles/leading-companies-retail-and-consumer-goods-industries-support-transition-qr-codes-gs1">leading retail and consumer goods companies actively supporting the transition to Digital Link QR codes</a>, the stage is set for the traditional barcode to retire gracefully.</p> Setting a Strong Foundation for Digital Link with OriginTrail <p>For products and brands to fully benefit from the GS1 Digital Link transition, a robust, connected, and verifiable data foundation is crucial. Product data is often split across various supply chain partners, including manufacturers, logistics providers, wholesalers, retailers, and others. To connect billions of products to the internet in a meaningful way that provides genuine insights and business value, this scattered product data needs to be interconnected.</p><p>Scanning a Digital Link on a product and seeing the manufacturer’s information, such as production date, description, ingredients, and brand details is good. Scanning the same code and accessing comprehensive information about the product’s journey through the supply chain — including whether the ingredients were ecologically produced, if the product was stored at proper temperatures during transport, and how long it was in the supply chain — is much better. This is the true potential of the Digital&nbsp;Link.</p><p>Beyond consumer engagement, consider a business operating a rail or plane network being able to access details on a component’s manufacture, testing, and maintenance by scanning a Digital Link code. That would have surely been invaluable with the recent Boeing aircraft incidents.</p><p>This is where the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and GS1 Digital Link make a match in heaven. The DKG provides a verifiable and interconnected knowledge base encompassing product data, supply chain events, certifications, locations, and more — across organizations and data sources. With the new DKG V8, the OriginTrail introduces the scalability needed to bring billions of products equipped with Digital Link into a world of standards-based, connected, and verifiable data. And the new DKG Edge Node concept empowers organizations and business networks to exchange product and other supply chain data with just a few clicks while maintaining data privacy, verifiability, and connectivity.</p>Supply chain data from multiple sources connected in a verifiable Decentralized Knowledge Graph.<p>As a longstanding partner of GS1, OriginTrail DKG is designed to natively support GS1 standards, including EPCIS, Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), Global Data Model (GDM), and Digital Link. This integration means that consumers, regulators, brands, and other stakeholders can access richer, more comprehensive, and trusted product data. The challenge now is to make this user experience seamless and simple, and there’s a tech perfect for the job — Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p> OriginTrail, Digital Link, and AI: A Consumer Engagement Power&nbsp;Throuple <p>Incorporating AI into the mix creates an incredibly powerful technology trio, enabling brands to enhance consumer engagement, based on connected and verifiable data spanning organizations, in unprecedented ways. And with the DKG Edge Node, AI capabilities come natively. Brands can thus offer personalized and tailored experiences by allowing customers to scan a product with a Digital Link QR code and ask anything — from brand details to product origins, sustainability, and environmental impact, all based on verifiable data from OriginTrail DKG.</p><p>This combination not only benefits consumers but also provides brands with valuable insights into customer preferences, allowing them to refine their business strategies. As billions of products transition from barcodes to Digital Link, the potential of this technology trio becomes evident. In fact, AI-powered product discovery, based on OriginTrail and Digital Link, is no longer a future concept but a current&nbsp;reality:</p><p>Some additional examples to check&nbsp;out:</p>  <a href="https://www.perutnina.com/int/en/premium-quality/check-the-origin/">Check the origin&nbsp;» Perutnina Ptuj</a>  <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1759626249813520823">Church of Oak Whiskey Distillery</a>  <p>Simultaneously, organizations can leverage AI to better understand and enhance their supply chains, ensuring they receive accurate and verifiable responses rooted in data from across their business network. By simply scanning a Digital Link QR code on a product, pallet, or shipping container, users are immediately empowered to ask questions and get verifiable answers — from basic queries like “Where was this product manufactured?” to more complex ones such as “Was the temperature in this shipping container in line with expectations?” and “Give me a list of all train wagons that are likely to experience issues with their wheels in the next month.” Exciting stuff&nbsp;indeed.</p> Where do we go from&nbsp;here? <p>As billions of products transition from traditional barcodes to Digital Link QR codes, establishing a robust foundation of connected and verifiable data becomes paramount. OriginTrail is at the forefront of this transformation, with the new DKG V8 offering the scalability and simplicity necessary to realize its full potential. When combined with AI, this technology trio unlocks immense opportunities for brands to engage with their customers in a trusted and meaningful way.</p><p>But consumer engagement is just one area set to benefit significantly from this transition. Regulatory bodies will gain streamlined access to verifiable product data, and supply chain management will become more proactive and efficient. The coming months and years promise exciting advancements and opportunities, making this a pivotal moment in the evolution of product information and consumer engagement.</p><p>We are excited to see OriginTrail at the epicenter of it all, as we — Trace Labs, the core developers of OriginTrai — along with our ecosystem partners get ready to unveil the Digital Link support via the new DKG V8 at the GS1 Industry &amp; Standards Event. Over 1,000 business leaders from 80+ countries will come together virtually to solve today’s greatest business challenges through the development and adoption of the GS1 global standard.</p><p>For the GS1 Industry &amp; Standards Event, register at: <a href="https://standards-event.gs1.org/">https://standards-event.gs1.org/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/from-barcodes-to-digital-links-supercharging-trillions-of-products-for-the-next-50-years-f46f4653e589">From Barcodes to Digital Links: Supercharging Trillions of Products for the Next 50 Years</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the past months we have replaced the algorithm at the heart of the ceramic database. This post explains why we made the change from Multicast to pairwise synchronization but first let review the design motivations of Ceramic.</p><p>“Information also wants to be expensive. Information Wants To Be Free. ...That tension will not go away.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free?ref=blog.ceramic.network#cite_note-3">Stewart Brand</a>. There is tension since data storage is a competitive market but data retrieval can only be done by the service that has your data. At 3Box Labs, we want to catalyze a data ecosystem by making community driven data distribution not only possible but available out of the box. <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a decentralized storage solution for apps that are dealing with multi-party data and that is more scalable, faster and cheaper than the blockchain. </p> Data vendor lock-in <p>Many organizations and individuals have data that they want to publish and Ceramic lets them do so without instant data vendor lock in for storing their own data. In the Web2 era, data often becomes ensnared within exclusive services, restricting its accessibility and durability. Access to this data requires obtaining permission from the service provider. Numerous platforms have vanished over the years, resulting in significant data loss like GeoCities, Friendster and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Orkut</a>. Even within still existing companies like Google, numerous lost data products are documented. See <a href="http://killedbygoogle.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">killed by google</a>. </p><p>We can break free from this risk by creating data-centric applications that multihome the data. Ceramic is the way to have many distinct data controllers publishing into shared tables in a trustless environment. Each reader can know who published what content and when they did without relying on trusting the storage service to keep accurate audit logs. Since each event is a JSON Document, signed by a controller, timestamped by ethereum, and in a documented schema it can be preserved by any interested party, with or without permission from the storage vendor. </p>Multihome the data<p>In Ceramic we separate the roles of data controllers from the data servers. By allowing data to live on any preferred server the data is durable as long as any server is interested in preserving the data. This allows data to outlive a particular data server, paired with the durability of data living in multiple places and the speed/reliability of operating on local data.</p> Document the schema <p>Throughout the history of the internet, we have witnessed numerous data services going away and taking the users data with them. While multihoming helps preserve data, it's useless without the ability to interpret it.</p><p>Ceramic preserves the data formats in two ways. The first is that the data lives in JSON Documents. This format allows us to reverse engineer and examine the data.&nbsp; The second is that the model schema gets published. The model schema contains both json-schema and human language description that the original developer can use to give machine and human context to the data. This enables both the preservation of the data and schema so the data can be understood and new apps can be made to interact with the preserved data.</p> <code>{

}</code> <p>Example schema document</p> Information retrieval&nbsp; <p>The key to multihome data is being able to retrieve the data from a server that has it.</p><p>How do we move the data from the servers that have the data to the servers that are interested in storing it? When we first made Ceramic we used two multicast methods: The first was to do a gratuitous announcement of new data. Send the data to EVERY node in the network so that they can store it if they are interested in it. Second, if a node did not know about a stream then when requested by a user it would multicast a request to the whole network and take the latest version to come back as a response.</p><p>This worked but had several drawbacks. The first is that requests for streams that a node did not know used WAN traffic and would have unpredictable latencies. This meant that all applications needed to design for slow unpredictable retrieval times. The second drawback was that a node had no way to retrieve a complete set of the streams that matched their interests. They could only listen to the multicast channel and fetch any stream they happened to hear about. Any stream that they missed either because it happened before the node was online or during down time could be missed forever. Third, there is a performance cost to sending requests to nodes that have no mutual interest with your node. A node that did 100 events a year could not scale down since it would need to keep up with filtering announcements from nodes doing 100 events a second. If we wanted to support both very large and very small data centric applications we needed a new strategy. We even saw cases where a slow node could not keep up on the multicast channel harming the performance of larger more powerful nodes.</p><p>To solve these problems of performance, completeness, and scalability we switched to a pairwise synchronization model. Each node advertises the ranges of streams that the node is interested in. Each node only synchronizes the streams that are of mutual interest and the nodes synchronize pair wise.</p> Scalability <p>Since the nodes synchronize pairwise, no slow node can harm the ability of two healthy nodes to complete a synchronization. If two nodes have no intersection in their interests then the conversation is done. A range of streams that has 100s of events per second that your node is not interested in will not create work for your node. A node only needs to scale to the speed of events in the ranges it is interested in and the scale of any model you are not interested in costs you nothing. This solved our scale up / scale down objective.</p> Completeness <p>If the two nodes do have an intersection of their interests they will continue the synchronization until both nodes have ALL the events that the other node had when the synchronization began. There is no longer a need for high availability to be online either when the stream’s event was originally published or when some node queried for that stream. If the event is stored by either of the nodes both nodes will have it at the end of the pairwise synchronization. Once a node has pairwise synchronized with each of the nodes that are advertising an interest range that node has all of the events in that range as of the time of the synchronization. This solves the completeness objective.</p><p>More interestingly, the local completeness means that we can build local indexes over the events and do more complex queries over the events in the ranges nodes are interested in entirely locally.</p> Performance <p>&nbsp;Lastly, since we have a complete set of events for our interests we can serve queries about the events from the local node with no need for WAN traffic. This solves the performance objective for predictable fetch latencies.</p> Pairwise Synchronization in Logarithmic rounds <p>In the multicast model ceramic sends messages to all other ceramic nodes. One of the most notable differences with synchronization is that nodes do pairwise synchronization one peer at a time. The two peers will each send the other their interests. Both nodes filter the events that they have to find the set of events of mutual interest between the two nodes. Once this intersection is found we synchronize the set with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13567?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Range-Based Set Reconciliation</a> protocol we call Recon.</p><p>We can report progress in a Recon synchronization by reporting the percentage of events in the in sync vs syncing ranges. Alternatively we could render a bar like in the diagram showing which ranges are in which states.</p><p>This is a divide and conquer protocol. We start with the full intersection as a single range. We pull a range off the work list and send the (hash, count) of all events in the range to the other side. They compare their own (hash, count) and respond accordingly.</p>

<p>The range splits are handled differently on the Initiator then the Responder. The Initiator maintains the work list and pushes all of the subranges onto the work list. The Responder just sends a message back with multiple ranges and hashes for each range. This keeps the synchronization state on the Initiator and reduces the burden on the Responder to a stateless call and response. This fits Recon into the http client server request response paradigm.</p> Exponential distribution <p>Now that we have replaced a multicast message to all nodes in the network with pairwise sync it is reasonable to ask if we have broken the exponential distribution we got from multicast trees.</p><p>How fast can data spread through the network? Now that we have replaced the multicast channel with pairwise connections, how do we match the exponential distribution of the multicast channel?&nbsp;</p><p>We get this property since each node cycles through connecting to all other nodes that advertise overlapping interests. When the node that originally received the event from a client there is 1 copy on the network. After the first sync there are 2. Then both of the nodes sync to new nodes giving 4. This will grow exponentially until almost all interested nodes have the data. At that point the odds that any node with the event calls a node without it is small but the odds that the node without the event calls a node with it is large. By using synchronization we get the benefits of both push and pull gossip protocols. Push which is fast when the knowledge of the event is rare and pull which is fast when knowledge of the event is common. </p> Summary <p>By using Set reconciliation to perform pairwise synchronization of node’s overlapping interests we are able to have performance, completeness, and scalability. The predictable performance of querying local data on your node. The completeness of synchronizing all of the events of interest preemptively. The scalability of not synchronizing the events that lay outside of the interests of a node. Pairwise synchronization protects the network from slow nodes from slowing down the rest of the network. It is now possible to scale up or down without performance and completeness problems. This enables developers to build data intensive applications without the data vendor lock-in from either the storage providing service or the application that originally read the schema.</p>

<p>Corporate overview:</p>



<p>Wedding Park Co., Ltd. was founded in 2004 with the management philosophy of “Making marriage happier.” Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2024, it started as a wedding review information site and has since expanded its operations. Utilizing a wealth of information, it operates several wedding-specialized media, including the wedding preparation review site <a href="https://www.weddingpark.net/">Wedding Park</a>. In addition, it runs various businesses in the realm of weddings combined with digital technology, such as internet advertising agency services, digital transformation (DX) support, and educational ventures.</p>



<p>Background and challenges leading to deployment</p>



<p>Wedding Park was faced with the challenges of strengthening the security of multiple cloud services that were being used for internal operations and the complexity of password management. As a way to address these issues, the company introduced an ID management service and consolidated them into a cloud service entrance with a single sign-on function.</p>



<p>The impetus for deploying FIDO authentication came from the fact that Salesforce, which is used for authentication for customer management, order and supply systems, and time and attendance management, announced that multi-factor authentication (MFA) was mandatory. However, if MFA is applied only to Salesforce and other cloud services continue to operate with password authentication, not only will the usability of users deteriorate, but the work of the IT management department will also become more complicated. In addition, due to the vulnerability of password-only authentication, the company decided to apply MFA to all cloud services, including Salesforce, in accordance with its policy to promote zero-trust security in February 2020.</p>



<p>Selection and verification of an authenticator</p>



<p>As an authentication method for MFA, the company considered one-time password authentication (OTP) and biometric authentication using smartphone applications, but ultimately decided to deploy passwordless authentication using FIDO for its unique ability to improve both security and user convenience.</p>



<p>In order to realize passwordless authentication using FIDO, a terminal equipped with a FIDO-compatible biometric authentication device is required. The majority of devices currently on the market support FIDO authentication, and with the exception of a few employees, the adoption of FIDO has been supported by the fact that all in-house devices are already equipped with Windows Hello and Touch ID. For some employees who use the devices not equipped with biometric features, a separate external authenticator has been installed.</p>



<p>A step-by-step changeover for each department</p>



<p>After examining the authenticators, the policy to deploy passwordless authentication company-wide in January 2022 was officially launched. The transition took place from February to March of the same year, and the smooth implementation in a short period of one month was made possible by the department-by-department implementation and the generous support provided by the IT management department. For this implementation, the company requested the support of CloudGate UNO, an identity management platform by International System Research Corporation (ISR) that the company has been using since 2012, because it supports passwordless authentication using FIDO2 and biometric authentication using a smartphone APP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The introduction of the system within the company began with the development department and gradually progressed to departments with a larger number of employees. First, at regular meetings for each department, the company communicated the purpose of why the system was being introduced and the benefits of “the deployment of the system will make daily authentication more convenient,” and gained the understanding across the company. The introduction of the system on a departmental basis had the advantage of not only limiting the number of people the IT management department had to deal with at one time, but also allowing the accumulation of QA as test cases and the smooth maintenance of manuals, since the system was introduced starting with the development department, which had high IT skills.</p>



<p>As a result of close follow-up by the IT management department, which not only prepared materials, but also checked the progress status on the administrator website as needed, and individually approached employees who had not yet registered their certifiers, the company was able to implement the system company-wide within the targeted time frame.</p>



<p>Effects of introduction</p>



<p></p>



<p>The number of login errors due to mistyping of passwords, which used to occur about 200 times a month, has been reduced to zero since the deployment of FIDO authentication. Many employees commented that the system has become very convenient, eliminating authentication failures due to forgotten passwords or typing errors. In addition, the number of periodic password reset requests has decreased, resulting in a reduction in man-hours for the administrator.</p>



<p>The passwordless authentication is smooth, and the authentication status retention period was shortened to further enhance security, but the system has continued to operate without problems since then.</p>



<p>Wedding Park’s future vision is to link all cloud services used within the company to “CloudGate UNO” and centrally manage them, including authentication, with “CloudGate UNO.</p>



<p>Akira Nishi, General Manager of the Corporate IT Office, who spoke with us about this case study, made the following comments.</p>



<p>“For those who are considering the deploying of a new authentication method, there is inevitably a concern that a change in authentication method will cause a large-scale login failure. In our case, in the early stages of the project, we held explanatory meetings for each department and repeatedly brushed up on explanatory materials and procedures, which was effective in minimizing confusion and anxiety within the company.</p>



<p>“After the switchover, we continued to check on the progress of the implementation and followed up with each department individually, but once the use of passkey (device-bound passkey) became standardized within the company, we felt that the scope of use, including various security measures, was expanding dramatically.”</p>

<p>The Ceramic protocol has undergone a series of updates over the past few months, all focused on improving performance and scalability, enabling developers to build applications that work better and faster. Today, the core Ceramic team is excited to share these updates with the community by announcing the release of <code>ceramic-one</code>.</p> About the release <p>The new release of Ceramic includes a data synchronization protocol called <a href="https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-124?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recon</a>, implemented in Rust. This new implementation of the Ceramic protocol enables data sharing between nodes and allows developers to run multiple nodes that stay in sync and are load balanced. All this facilitates highly available Ceramic deployments and reliable data synchronization.</p><p>To utilize the Recon protocol for their applications, developers are provided with a binary called <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>ceramic-one</code></a>.</p><p>This new implementation of the Ceramic protocol offers significant performance and stability improvements. Additionally, this release marks a significant shift in making the Ceramic architecture more robust, allowing the team to iterate on and build new protocols in the future.</p> The new Recon protocol <p>Recon is a new data synchronization protocol used for synchronizing stream events in the Ceramic network, implemented on top of libp2p. Stream sets bundle multiple streams together, allowing nodes with a common interest in certain streams to synchronize efficiently.</p><p>Before Recon, Ceramic nodes broadcasted updates to streams to every node in the network using a simple libp2p pubsub topic. Due to the single channel, nodes would receive stream event announcements they were not interested in, imposing a significant overhead on every node. Additionally, the network's throughput was limited by bandwidth, which led to either prioritizing high-bandwidth nodes or greatly limiting the network throughput to support low-bandwidth nodes.</p><p>Recon provides low to no overhead for nodes with no overlap in interest, while retaining a high probability of receiving the latest events from a stream shortly after any node has the events, without any need for remote connections at query time. By shifting updates from the pubsub channel to a stream set, interested nodes can synchronize without burdening uninterested ones. Stream sets also enable sharding across multiple nodes, allowing synchronization of only sub-ranges, which distributes the storage, indexing, and retrieval workload.</p><p>Additionally, nodes need to discover peers with similar interests for synchronization. Recon achieves this through nodes gossiping their interests and maintaining a list of peers' interests, ensuring synchronization with minimal bandwidth. Nodes also avoid sending event announcements to uninterested peers.</p> Performance and robustness improvements <p>This release, along with the recent Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) updates, marks significant scalability improvements. Currently, Ceramic provides a throughput of 250 TPS (transactions per second), more than double the previous throughput of up to 100 TPS before the Recon implementation. This increase in throughput is especially important for applications that handle large amounts of user data and require fast transaction times.</p><p>These numbers were measured between two nodes that share the same interest. It’s worth noting that nodes without overlapping interests do not affect each other's throughput. This means that, in theory, the throughput of a ceramic-one node scales horizontally. However, there is still one component that puts an upper limit on this: the CAS, which is operated by 3Box Labs. This service is currently a centralized bottleneck in the protocol, which is why the team’s next goal is <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ceramicstudio/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&amp;itemId=68981845&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Self-Anchoring</a>, allowing any Ceramic-One node to operate completely independently.</p><p>This release of Ceramic is also a significant step towards making the Ceramic architecture more robust, enabling the team to iterate on it and build new protocol implementations more easily and quickly.</p> Getting started with ceramic-one <p>All new Ceramic developers are recommended to use the <code>ceramic-one</code> to start building on Ceramic. Check out <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network">the setup guides</a> on the Ceramic documentation to get started.</p><p>Developers, who have been building on Ceramic for a while, are encouraged to migrate their applications to the <code>ceramic-one</code>-based implementation. Check out <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/blob/main/UPGRADE.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">this migration guide</a> to follow the migration steps.</p> Share you feedback with us! <p>We would like to get your feedback on building on Ceramic. Do you have any suggestions or ideas of how the core Ceramic team can improve the implementation of Ceramic? Do you have questions or troubles using the new release or migrating your existing application? Share your thoughts and ideas with us by posting on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Community Forum</a>.</p>

 Nissan, Honda eye EV battery passports in Europe by 2027 
 <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/honda-mazda-nissan-complete-1st-phase-of-web3-global-battery-passport-mvp/">Read on the LedgerInsights website</a><br> 
<p>MOBI, the mobility web3 consortium, has completed the first phase of the minimum viable product (MVP) for its global battery passport. This involved nine members including DENSO, Honda, Mazda, and Nissan exchanging battery identity and data using open standards.</p>
<p>Stepping back, if batteries are to achieve the hoped for environmental impact, how they’re manufactured and recycled is a critical part of the process. Hence the need to keep track of battery lifecycles as mandated in the US and Europe. Digital credentials can include the battery’s composition, status and history.</p>
<p>What MOBI is trying to sidestep is the need for costly one off integrations and to achieve cross industry interoperability.</p>
<p>Stage 1 implemented the Integrated Trust Network (ITN) identity services, which enables companies to exchange battery identity and data on a peer-to-peer basis. Hence, the ITN is a federated registry built and operated by the members using W3C decentralized identifiers (DID). It’s a self sovereign identity (SSI) offering that supports multiple blockchains. The SSI aspect means the data is stored with the battery rather than in a centralized database.</p>
<p>“Today’s global battery value chain is complex and it’s difficult to simultaneously ensure efficiency, scalability, safety, circularity, and regulatory compliance. To balance these priorities, we need to enhance battery lifecycle management through the creation of a shared ecosystem with SSI framework for secure coordination and selective disclosure of sensitive data,” said MOBI CEO and Co-founder, Tram Vo.</p>
<p>Stage 2 will involve trialing Citopia, MOBI’s web3 marketplace for services. This will support applications such as enhanced battery and carbon credits management and vehicle-to-grid communications and payment. It will also support other mobility solutions, such as data-driven pricing for used electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MOBI has developed several standards. The most relevant is its battery passport standard released a year ago. Perhaps its most foundational standard is for vehicle identity. Other standards include tracking emissions for trips, supply chain blockchain standards and blockchain in vehicle financing.</p>

 Developing communications for your organisation <p>This summer WAO ties a bow around a body of work we’ve been doing together with <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">the Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC). This initiative is hosted at MIT and has member universities from around the&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>The Digital Credentials Consortium is advancing the use and understanding of portable, verifiable digital credentials in higher education through open source technology development and leadership, research, and advocacy.</blockquote><p>The DCC plays a pivotal role in the definition and establishment of the W3C Verifiable Credentials Standard. <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">Standards are often invisible, but they are massively important!</a></p><p>In this post, we’ll use our work with the DCC to help you systematically review your communication initiatives and give you a bit of a playbook on how to develop reusable communication assets and resources.</p> Understanding your&nbsp;audience An audience map WAO created with the&nbsp;DCC Research <p>When crafting communications strategies, most organisations miss a crucial step: audience research. Implementing lessons from outdated research or making assumptions about audience only to find out that your assumptions were wrong are two mistakes that you can&nbsp;avoid!</p><p>Before we started creating communication messaging and assets for the DCC, we did two rounds of interviews. In both rounds, we spoke one-to-one with people deeply involved in the DCC’s work. In the first round, we spoke with staff members, W3C task group members and people already implementing the Verifiable Credentials standard. In the second round, we talked to members of the DCC and with the Leadership Board. We asked the same questions for both rounds, but allowed for organic conversation to&nbsp;emerge.</p>cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>These interviews not only provided us with a bounty of onboarding and understanding to the DCC’s multitude of work, but it helped us identify, specifically, what stakeholders need and want from the&nbsp;DCC.</p> Segmentation <p>Once you have collected insights from your audience, you can begin to reflect those insights back in ways that help others understand who your audience is. Segmentation is a way to find overlapping interests and topics. We like to visualise segmentation and have done so in multiple ways, from our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">Audience Ikigai</a> to <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/defining-the-cast/">Defining the Cast</a> and <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/persona-mapping/">Persona Spectrums</a>, we use a couple of different tools to find audience overlaps. Figuring out a visual way to explain your audience and their unique needs and insights is a great way to help people feel connected to your organisation.</p> Crafting your communications First slide of a deck implementing suggested design constraints Being specific <p>Understanding your audience will help you tailor your messages and customise content to specific segments of your audience. Through research, you are also creating relationships with your audience and can encourage people to feel open to giving you feedback.</p><p>Our research and subsequent analysis helped us see trends and patterns to pay attention to as we began to craft communications for the DCC. We also identified some quick intervention points allowing us to immediately implement small changes and quick wins. For example, before we ran our final interview, we implemented a new README for the <a href="https://github.com/digitalcredentials/">DCC’s Github organisation</a>. Small wins can have big&nbsp;impact!</p><p>Our onboarding and research activities helped us see where there were misunderstandings, so that we could deal with them as quickly as possible.</p> Design guidelines <p>It can be helpful to put what we call “Design Constraints” in place when we’re building communication strategies and initiatives. Design Constraints are simply rules you and your colleagues use to create consistency in both visual and written language. For example, we helped the DCC select a colour palette, fonts and an illustration library for their future communications.</p><p>A brand guide is an example of visual design constraints. A “key messaging and wording” section in your communications strategy is another. It helps create consistency, so that your audiences know how you wish to communicate your organisational goals.</p> Growing your&nbsp;audience cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> Engagement <p>You want to engage with people strategically so that you can work sustainably and your communications are aligned with your current initiatives and goals. We use several tools to help us figure out the best way to engage with a specific audience or community. We’ve written often about <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">the Architecture of Participation</a>, our go-to framework for creating participatory communities.</p><p>We also like to build Contributor Pathways, which help show how different stakeholders engage with a project. These pathways can outline steps different audience take and where you might be able to engage with them more effectively.</p><p>There are four stages to the engagement model we like to&nbsp;use:</p>  Awareness — The first stage invites you to think about how your particular group hears about you or your project for the first time. The questions to as are How do they hear about us and how would we like them to hear about&nbsp;us?  First Engagement — Stage two identifies the first interaction a person or a group has with you or your project. What is the first action that they take and what action would you like them to&nbsp;take?  Build Relationship — Stage three is about your interaction. How do you build relationships with people or groups and what value can you&nbsp;bring?  Deepen Engagement — As people deepen their engagement with your organisation or project, you’ll want to show them that they’re valued. So how can you ensure consistent engagement with your most engaged audiences?  <p>We think about each of these stages in reference to each specific audience group, as some audiences might be more or less engaged than&nbsp;others.</p> Advocacy <p>WAO tends to work with groups and organisations that are trying to create a better world. Advocacy is an integral part of our work. There are a variety of advocacy and collaboration strategies as well as best practices that you can use to ensure you are able to promote your messages in a way that lead to&nbsp;action.</p><p>In this post on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">campaigning for the right things</a>, we take a deep dive into using an advocacy framework to figure out where we might focus efforts. You can reapply this framework to your own initiatives!</p> Building and sustaining engagement cc-by-nd Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO Cadence <p>If you’ve truly understood your audiences through research and analysis and you’ve determined the messages and design constraints you need to utilise for maximum communication effectiveness, your audience will begin to grow. Yay! You are building engagement!</p><p>It’s time to find sustainable ways to keep your engagement going. Probably the most effective strategy we have for sustaining engagement is cadence and consistency.</p>an example month of DCC events and associated comms<p>You need to establish a cadence to your engagement efforts both so that your growing audience knows what to expect and so that you and your team can stay sane. It’s simple, but a communication schedule will help you be consistent, so that people stay engaged.

 <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Electric-vehicles/Nissan-Honda-eye-EV-battery-passports-in-Europe-by-2027">Read on Nikkei’s website</a><br> 
<p>By Azusa Kawakami, Nikkei staff writer | 12 July 2024 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p>NEW YORK — Nissan Motor, Honda Motor and other Japanese auto industry companies have joined forces to develop a digital tracking system for electric-vehicle batteries, anticipating European Union regulations aimed at encouraging recycling and reducing reliance on China.</p>
<p>Mazda Motor and parts supplier Denso are also among the seven Japanese companies planning to introduce a “battery passport” by 2027.</p>
<p>Businesses and car owners will use a code to access these digital records and find information about the amount of recyclable metals used, origin and production history. The passport will also provide the extent of battery deterioration and residual value.</p>
<p>The companies will seek to put the system to use first in Europe, where battery regulations are to be introduced in 2027.</p>
<p>Adopted in June 2023, the regulations will make battery recycling mandatory within the EU bloc. Among the provisions is a requirement that 50% of lithium from used batteries must be recycled by 2027.</p>
<p>From 2027, automakers will need to meet those regulations for EVs sold in Europe, with penalties for failing to do so.</p>
<p>Nissan and Honda are participants in the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, an alliance of more than 120 companies from Japan, the U.S. and Europe, and have been involved in the development of the battery passport infrastructure.</p>
<p>The EU’s tougher battery regulations are due in part to a desire to cut its reliance on China, which dominates the supply of battery materials. China accounts for 65% of the world’s processing and refining of lithium, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>The U.S., which is strengthening its own restrictions against China, is also considering introducing battery passports. The Inflation Reduction Act made it a condition for EV makers to procure batteries within North America to qualify for vehicle subsidies. Passports can help certify where batteries come from.</p>
<p>But because China leads the EV battery market with a roughly 60% share and controls much of the supply chain, it could be difficult to obtain full battery data without Chinese cooperation.</p>
<p>China’s CATL, the world’s leading automotive battery manufacturer, is said to have over 1 trillion pieces of battery data, from raw materials to recycling.</p>

<p>Canada’s digital trust leader, the DIACC, releases its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) Authentication Final Recommendation V1.2, signalling it’s ready for inclusion in their <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Certification Program</a>.</p>



<p>Why is the PCTF Authentication component important?</p>



<p>The Authentication component helps assure the on-going integrity of login and authentication processes by certifying, through a process of assessment, that they comply with standardized Conformance Criteria. The Conformance Criteria for this component may be used to provide assurances that Trusted Processes result in the representation of a unique Subject at a Level of Assurance that it is the same Subject with each successful login to an Authentication Service Provider while also providing assurances concerning the predictability and continuity in the login processes that they offer or on which they depend.</p>



<p>What problems does the PCTF Authentication component solve?</p>



<p>The Authentication component helps establish a standardized way for individuals and organizations to verify their identities when accessing digital services. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches. Additionally, by providing a reliable method for authentication, this allows the PCTF to foster trust and confidence among users, service providers, and stakeholders. This is crucial for the widespread adoption of digital services.</p>



<p>Who does the PCTF Authentication component help?</p>



<p>All participants will benefit from login and authentication processes that are repeatable and consistent (whether they offer these processes, depend on them, or both). It can help lay the foundation to provide assurances that identified Users can engage in authorized interactions with remote systems. When combined with considerations from the PCTF Wallet Component, participants may have an enhanced user experience through the reuse of credentials across multiple Relying Parties.</p>



<p>Relying Parties can benefit from the ability to build on the assurance that Authentication Trusted Processes uniquely identify, at an acceptable level of risk, a Subject in their application or program space.</p>

<p>An interview on risks, trends, and tools in OSINT digital&nbsp;research</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@emilymorter?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Emily Morter</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/question-mark-neon-signage-8xAA0f9yQnE?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a><p>When <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/johanna-wild">Johanna Wild</a> entered the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard as a joint <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/#:~:text=The%20Nieman%2DBerkman%20Klein%20Fellowship,project%20relating%20to%20journalism%20innovation.">Nieman Foundation</a> innovation fellow, I was intrigued. Wild works for the award-winning international open source (OS) investigative journalism collective <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/about/awards/">Bellingcat</a>. She is an expert on the creative deployment of technical approaches to support a more diverse cohort of public interest reporters and investigators, blending automated approaches with human-centered research methodology.</p><p>As someone who has supported expert networks in both disinformation and conflict documentation, I wanted Wild’s first-hand perspective on the benefits and risks of using novel open source intelligence (OSINT) tools to enable a broader, more transparent global knowledge base. We conducted this interview over email between Amsterdam and New York&nbsp;City.</p><p>Sam Hinds: Do you encounter specific types of people or professional backgrounds in the work of investigations and OSINT tool development?</p><p>Johanna Wild: The great thing about the field of open source research is that it consists of people from various backgrounds. Open source researchers spend a lot of time online. They find pieces of information on social media platforms, in online forums, and databases, and they compare features that they identify in user-generated online videos and photos with locations that can be seen on satellite imagery. This process, called geolocation, is used to verify online images. The nature of open source research allows everyone with an internet connection to do this type of&nbsp;work.</p><p>The open source researcher community is therefore a mix of people who do open source research as part of their job and volunteers who are passionate about contributing to important research in their free time. My surveys and user interviews with our Bellingcat community showed that our community consists of people working for human rights organizations, stay-at-home-parents who use their limited time to do something mentally challenging and useful, cybersecurity specialists, job seekers who want to learn new skills, lawyers, data scientists, people who are retired and many more. When I ask volunteers about their motivation, they often say that they want to contribute to research that reveals issues in the regions where they live, that they want to feel that in these times that are characterized by various conflicts around the world, and global challenges like climate change; they do not just passively sit around but actively contribute to something that creates new knowledge about those issues. Another motivation is to become part of a community with similar interests and to improve their open source research&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Of course there are also many journalists who are part of this community. Nowadays, more and more newsrooms are setting up teams focusing on open source research. However, journalists were more of the late adopters in this field. Most of them only discovered in the last few years how useful this type of research can be, especially if it is combined with traditional journalistic skills and methods. Newsrooms even started hiring skilled open source researchers who are completely self-taught and who have no journalism degree, which is something that is still rather unusual in the news industry.</p><p>Volunteers with a technical background contribute by building tools. These are often simple command line tools that are able to do one very specific task, for instance to scrape posts from a specific social media platform or to check whether an online account has been created on a platform using a specific phone number. Those tools do not usually turn into big commercial products; they are built by people from within the open source software community who focus on writing code that is publicly accessible to anyone. Several years ago, I clearly saw that the open source researcher and the open source software community are a very good match for each other, we just needed to bring them together. This is one of the things that we now do at Bellingcat. We organize hackathons, actively invite software developers into our volunteer community, and support them to build their own tools or to contribute to tools built by the Bellingcat team. This group of volunteers consists for example of people who have a full time job in a software company but want to do something meaningful in their free time, of job seekers who want to create their own portfolio of tools, or of academics who are already deep into a technical topic but would like to test its practical application.</p><p>Although the open source researcher and tech communities are very diverse in terms of their professional and personal backgrounds, they are currently still dominated by volunteers and professionals from Western countries, mainly from the US and Europe. The technical tool builder community is also, to date, still male dominated. This lack of representation raises serious questions in terms of who defines the future of our field and who has the power to research topics in regions all around the world. With people in many other regions still excluded from participating in this type of research, they mainly become the subject of Western researchers.</p><blockquote>“While AI tools can be powerful, we should not expect to automate the whole open source research process. Doing open source research is a combination of specific research methods, the use of tools, a good dose of logical thinking and also creativity!”</blockquote><p>SH: Have you seen novel trends emerge in the type of information researchers want&nbsp;today?</p><p>JW: I definitely observe that researchers, and especially journalists, have become more aware of how useful it is to be able to work with large datasets, to know how to scrape information from websites or to have the skills to build small tools that can speed up some of their research&nbsp;tasks.</p><p>Currently, everyone is of course interested in AI. Less experienced researchers are hoping for a tool that lets them input any picture or video and then spits out the exact location of where it was taken. While AI tools can be powerful, we should not expect to automate the whole open source research process. Doing open source research is a combination of specific research methods, the use of tools, a good dose of logical thinking and also creativity! Creativity is needed to spot topics that are worth getting investigated. When deciding where to look next in the vast amount of online information that is out there, creativity helps to connect multiple, often tiny, pieces of verified information which allow researchers to draw conclusions on a certain&nbsp;topic.</p><p>Another trend is the use of facial recognition tools. Open source researchers often find pictures that show individuals who have a connection to a certain research case but whose identity they don’t know. In the last few years, several easy to use facial recognition tools have emerged. Researchers can upload a picture of a person and the tool compares this picture with collections of photos from social media platforms. Sometimes, this can reveal the identity of a person, for instance by providing the person’s LinkedIn profile. It is obvious how useful this can be to identify individuals who were involved in serious crimes that require journalistic reporting.</p><p>However, facial recognition tools are a double-edge sword. We all know that they can provide wrong results. Two people might just look very similar and an uninvolved person might be misidentified as someone who is involved in illegal activities. It is therefore important that open source researchers do not use those tools as the only way of identifying someone. On top of that, the use of such tools raises various ethical questions ranging from the risk of stalking random people online, to questions about the data sources on which facial recognition tools rely. At Bellingcat, we reflected on how we can ensure a responsible use of facial recognition technologies and concluded that we will refrain from using these tools extensively, and never as a core element of an investigation. We also never used products from companies like Clearview AI. A good example of how we sometimes use a facial recognition tool as a starting point for further research can be found in our article on how <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/04/06/cartel-king-kinahans-google-reviews-expose-travel-partners/">“Cartel King Kinahan’s Google Reviews Expose Travel Partners”</a>.</p><p>SH: Are there any overlooked tools that you like to highlight in your trainings?</p><p>JW: The best type of tool really depends on the research topic. Often a combination of several small tools can lead to the best results. For instance, our<a href="https://bellingcat.github.io/name-variant-search/"> Name Variant Search Tool</a> is basically an enhanced search engine for finding information about people. Open source researchers often start with a name and try to find out as much as possible about the person’s online presence. However, the name might be written differently on different sites. “Jane Doe” might also show up as “J. Doe” or “Doe, Jane”. The tool suggests different possible variations of a name and provides search results for all those variations. It is also possible to instruct the tool to search for a name specifically on Linkedin or Facebook.</p><p>Example: Name Variant Search results for different variants of the name “Jane&nbsp;Doe”</p><p>Our<a href="https://osm-search.bellingcat.com/"> OpenStreetMap search tool</a>, on the other hand, supports the geolocation process. A core task of many open source researchers is to find out where a photo or video that they found online has been taken. To do that, they try to identify specific features and compare those with what is visible on satellite imagery or maps. If researchers already have a rough idea in which region a photo might have been taken, they can input a list of features that are visible in the photo (for instance, a residential street, a school and a supermarket) into our tool, which will try to list all locations in a pre-defined region in which those features show up together. This can really help narrow down possible locations.</p><p>SH: What’s an example of an unusual story or insight one can find from OS&nbsp;tools?</p><p>JW: If open source researchers have no idea where a picture might have been taken but they know at which time it was captured and the photo shows objects that cast clearly visible shadows, they can try our<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/GalenReich/ShadowFinder/blob/main/ShadowFinderColab.ipynb"> ShadowFinder</a> tool which is able to calculate at which locations around the world shadow lengths correspond with what can be seen in the photo at a specific point in time. This helps open source researchers concentrate their geolocation efforts to the areas suggested by the tool instead of searching across the whole&nbsp;world.</p>Example of a<a href="https://github.com/bellingcat/ShadowFinder"> ShadowFinder</a> tool result: Possible locations are shown by the yellow&nbsp;circle.<p>Another tool that has gained popularity within the open source researcher community is<a href="https://peakvisor.com/"> PeakVisor</a>, a tool that was originally targeted at helping mountaineers orient themselves but which can also be used for<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/07/13/more-than-mountaineering-using-peakvisor-for-geolocation/"> geolocation tasks</a>. For instance, we used it to research the location of the<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/12/11/the-sound-of-bullets-the-killing-of-colombian-journalist-abelardo-liz/"> killing of Colombian journalist Abelardo Liz</a>. This example in particular shows that a combination of research skills and the use of tools can go a long&nbsp;way.</p><p>SH: What frustrations or barriers do you see as a trainer, and how could the field democratize knowledge of command line&nbsp;tools?</p><p>JW: First of all: Teaching open source research is great. People who are interested in learning these methods come from so many different backgrounds which allows everyone to learn new things from each other, including the trainers! The topic is also quite accessible, meaning that everyone can start doing open source research with very simple methods, like using search engines in creative ways. Sometimes, this can lead to surprising results: For instance, just by googling, my colleague Foeke Postma revealed how<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/05/28/us-soldiers-expose-nuclear-weapons-secrets-via-flashcard-apps/"> US soldiers exposed nuclear weapons secrets via flashcard apps</a>.</p><p>Of course not all methods are as simple, and one of the things people are struggling with the most are research tools. During my <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/">Nieman-Berkman Klein fellowship</a> my research assistant Cooper-Morgan Bryant and I interviewed forty open source researchers about their use of tools. Their answers confirmed my<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/08/12/these-are-the-tools-open-source-researchers-say-they-need/"> previous findings</a> on this topic: Open source researchers, who are either beginners or who are looking at a topic that is new to them, find it really difficult to figure out what tool they should use at what stage of the research process and how those tools work. With such a wide variety of online tools, some more useful and some easier to find than others, and many researchers feel overwhelmed by the task of finding their way through the landscape of available tools spread across various platforms.</p><p>In addition, the majority of open source researchers are not able to use command line tools since this requires a certain degree of technical skills. However, those are exactly the type of small tools that the open source software community is building most frequently. There is a clear divide between those who are building tools for open source researchers and the researcher community itself, for whom those tools often turn out not to be accessible.</p><blockquote>“Open source researchers want complex tools that are easy to use and that are stable and well-developed but such tools need funders and teams who build them, and these conditions are not always easily met in the open source research and journalism space.”</blockquote><p>On the other side, open source researchers are often not aware of the resources that are required to build mature tools that have an easy-to-use interface. It is getting easier now, but tool builders need to invest a lot more time to build such tools and this is difficult for people who do this task in their free time and without any funding. Open source researchers want complex tools that are easy to use, stable, and well-developed, but such tools need funders and teams who build them. These conditions are not always easily met in the open source research and journalism space. I hope that researchers will become a little bit more open to learn some basic technical skills, and even more importantly that they understand that not every tool that is useful for their research has to function like a fully built commercial tool.</p><p>At Bellingcat, we focus on bridging this gap between tool builders and open source researchers. We work with tech communities —often through programs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOHj7r0_CKA">hackathons</a> or fellowships — and make them aware of how important good user guides are, even for seemingly easy-to-use tools. On the other hand, we teach open source researchers how to use command line tools. We also launched a video series with the goal to help researchers make their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymCMy8OffHM">first steps</a> towards the more technical side of research&nbsp;tools.</p><p>SH: Tools take a lot of resources to build. Do any OSINT tools have a complicated provenance in terms of private sector origin or geopolitics?</p><p>JW: It is definitely problematic that researchers and journalists can be so dependent on tools provided by big tech companies. Meta’s social monitoring platform Crowdtangle will be shut down in August and this has caused a lot of discontent amongst journalists, in particular amongst those who are covering elections. For instance, many of the platforms and tools open source researchers use are provided by Google, like Google Search, Google Maps and Google Earth Pro. We are often at the mercy of the decisions that big tech companies take regarding use of their&nbsp;tools.</p><p>However, their tools are usually provided for free, which is not the case for other commercial tools. Open source researchers definitely need to look into the companies from which they are buying tools. One risk is that tool providers might be able to see what type of keywords people are typing in or on what topic someone is working on. Researchers and journalists need to be sure that their sensitive research topics are safe from being monitored by tool providers.</p><p>At Bellingcat we focus on mostly small open source tools, but those tools come with their own set of challenges. For instance, it is often not clear who is behind a tool that is offered on code-sharing platforms like Github, which can raise security-related questions.</p><blockquote>“I would love to see universities getting more involved in building and maintaining tools for open source researchers and journalists…since both sides have the common goal of advancing research in the public interest”</blockquote><p>This is why I really hope we can build a different tool ecosystem for open source researchers in the future. I would love to see universities getting more involved in building and maintaining tools for open source researchers and journalists. I think that such collaborations could work well since both sides have the common goal of advancing research in the public interest, and many of the tools that are used by open source researchers are equally useful for academic researchers. I also see opportunities to research security-related aspects of widely used tools together, as journalists and open source researchers could definitely use some help in assessing the risks that some of the tools they are using might be posing. If anyone who reads this would like to discuss these topics with me: Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/johanna_wild">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p><p>SH: Misinformation, disinformation, conspiratorial thinking: What are some of the uses and abuses of “research” you see in these contexts?</p><p>JW: What is most common — especially during conflicts and wars — is that people share either photos or videos from a different conflict or old imagery and make people believe that they are related to current events. In the context of the Israel-Gaza conflict since October 2023, this phenomenon has reached a new scale with countless examples circulating online. For instance,<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/11/hamas-attacks-israel-bombs-gaza-and-misinformation-surges-online/"> Bellingcat</a> found videos that were shared with the claims that one showed rockets that were fired at Israel by Hamas and another that claimed to show recent Israeli strikes on Hamas; both turned out to be recycled videos that had been uploaded to YouTube several years&nbsp;prior.</p><blockquote>“People who post such pictures might sometimes think they are doing ‘research’ and that they are sharing relevant information about an ongoing conflict, without realizing that they are actually sharing incorrect information.”</blockquote><p>What is dangerous is that some of those posts go viral and are able to reach significant numbers of people who will never know that they fell for misinformation. People who post such pictures might sometimes think they are doing “research” and that they are sharing relevant information about an ongoing conflict, not realizing the information is incorrect. Others, however, will do it on purpose to evoke emotions either in favor or against one of the conflict parties. Users of online platforms cannot really do much to prevent being confronted with such posts. This is another reason it is essential that we all learn to question what we see online and to invest some time in learning <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2021/11/01/a-beginners-guide-to-social-media-verification/">basic verification skills</a>.</p><p>What we have also been seeing is that supporters of conspiracy ideologies are increasingly using open source research tools and presenting the information as journalistic findings. For example,<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/11/24/toy-rabbits-chemtrails-and-german-qanon-fanatics-how-not-to-conduct-open-source-investigations/"> Qanon supporters</a> in German-speaking countries started using flight-tracking sites to search for flights which they falsely believed were circling above “deep underground military bases” in which children were hidden and mistreated. This is problematic since people who are not aware of the methods and standards of open source research might not be able to differentiate between serious research and the distorted version of&nbsp;it.</p><p>SH: What are some of your favorite guidelines or best practices for journalists who aim to cover (and fact-check) broad conspiratorial thinking enabled by OS information?</p><p>JW: Looking at their business models can often be a very promising approach. More often than not, conspiracy-minded communities have business-savvy people amongst them who manage to benefit financially from those communities’ beliefs. When I was researching QAnon online communities in Germany, big platforms like Amazon and eBay had started implementing measures to ban QAnon products from their platforms. However, this seemed to have created new opportunities for QAnon influencers who were offering merchandise via their own small online shops. On top of that, customers in Germany were able to buy QAnon products from abroad, for instance from Chinese or British companies who offered products targeted specifically at German-speaking customers. It was interesting but also concerning to see how international today’s conspiracy merchandise markets&nbsp;are.</p><p>To research online shops, it is always worth researching what<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/03/26/how-to-get-started-investigating-payment-gateways-online/"> payment options</a> those shops are using and to look into their potential use of<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/03/26/how-to-track-illegal-funding-campaigns-via-cryptocurrency"> cryptocurrencies</a>. It is also important to take some time to learn the terminology a certain group is using. If you are looking into the far-right, for instance, it is crucial to learn how to<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/04/04/how-not-to-interpret-far-right-symbols/"> interpret the symbols</a> they&nbsp;use.</p><blockquote>”Open source researchers are often portrayed as some type of ‘nerdy hero’ who spends time on his laptop to research ‘the bad guys’ and is celebrated once he succeeds. The idea of one hero figure who solves all the research challenges is really the exact opposite of how open source research works&nbsp;best…”</blockquote><p>SH: How might international organizations build stronger support for women, femme-identified, and gender-nonconforming media and research professionals?</p><p>JW: In the field of open source research, there are definitely tendencies that I would like to see changed in the future. It is well established that women and gender-nonconforming people have traditionally had a much harder time to enter and succeed in the space of investigative journalism. Those issues are far from being overcome, but the journalism world has started to talk more openly about it, and the fact that academic researchers have published work on this topic has also been&nbsp;helpful.</p><p>My impression is that as open source researchers, we have not yet put enough effort into reflecting on what is happening in our own field. Maybe we thought that since it is relatively new, those issues would not appear as strongly. Unfortunately, however, they do, and it’s time to recognize this.</p><p>There are definitely many contributing factors, but one that has had a strong effect on me is that open source researchers are often portrayed as some type of “nerdy hero” who spends time on his laptop to research “the bad guys” and is celebrated once he succeeds. The idea of one lone wolf who solves all the research challenges on their own is really the exact opposite of how open source research works best, which is by nature collaborative and often requires the efforts of many to put together various small pieces of verified online sources for a specific research case. For those of us who don’t want, and are also not able to fit into this commonly portrayed male hero picture, this field might not necessarily feel like a good&nbsp;fit.</p><p>However, since more and more traditional newsrooms are setting up open source research units right now, I see more women entering the field and hopefully, this will also change how we publicly talk about open source research over time. To everyone who organizes a public event on open source research, I recommend to not only approach the few already well known voices in the field but to take the effort to find and invite speakers who can contribute new perspectives and who have done research on topics that are not always in the spotlight.</p><p>SH: What were the most meaningful conversations you had during your time at the Berkman Klein Center? Do you plan to use any of your connections or insights from the fellowship in your future&nbsp;work?</p><p>JW: I am very grateful that I was able to be a Berkman Klein Fellow this year. It was a great opportunity to be part of a community of people who all reflect on how we integrate new technologies in our lives but from various different angles. Each fellow and community hour provided me with insights into a different technology-related topic and I liked the “surprise” effect of being able to learn new things about topics I usually don’t have the time to think about. This has definitely had an impact on how I approached my own projects with Bellingcat. I feel that being immersed in such a knowledgeable and collaborative community has unlocked my creativity and I am looking forward to continuing to learn from everyone in the Berkman Klein sphere in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Johanna Wild was a joint 2023–2024 <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/#:~:text=The%20Nieman%2DBerkman%20Klein%20Fellowship,project%20relating%20to%20journalism%20innovation">Nieman-Berkman Fellow in Journalism Innovation</a>, a joint fellowship administered between the <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/">Nieman Foundation for Journalism</a> and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University.

<p></p>      First Web3 Global Battery Passport Implementation for Current and Future Regulatory Compliance           <p>DENSO, Honda, Mazda, and Nissan among MOBI members who have completed Stage 1 of the Cross-Industry Interoperable Minimum Viable Product, a three-year initiative towards a decentralized Global Battery Passport built for data privacy and selective disclosure   </p>
          <p>Los Angeles, 10 July 2024 — MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, is thrilled to announce a significant milestone in development of the Web3 Global Battery Passport (GBP) Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In a historic first, the MVP has successfully demonstrated battery identity/data validation and exchange between nine organizations using open-standards — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI Battery Birth Certificate</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework — an achievement that carries exciting implications for stakeholders of the battery value chain and lays critical groundwork for the Web3 Economy. Organizations worldwide are invited to <a href="https://dlt.mobi/participate/">join and collaborate</a> in this trailblazing effort.</p>
<p>Participants of MOBI Circular Economy and the GBP Working Group, constituting close to USD 1 Trillion in annual revenue and representing diverse functions within the global battery ecosystem, have successfully completed Stage 1 of the three-year MVP and are set to begin Stage 2. Implementers of the decentralized GBP include <a href="https://www.anritsu.com/">Anritsu</a>, <a href="https://www.densoautoparts.com/">DENSO</a>, <a href="https://www.hioki.com/">HIOKI</a>, <a href="https://global.honda/">Honda</a>, <a href="https://www.mazda.com/">Mazda</a>, <a href="https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/">Nissan</a>, and <a href="https://trade-log.io/">TradeLog Inc</a>. </p>
<p>As the world increasingly turns to batteries for sustainable energy solutions, global battery value chains are making continuous improvements to enhance operational efficiency, circularity, and cross-border compliance. Forward-looking global policies like the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/17/2023-06822/section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit">US Treasury’s Section 30D Guidance on EV Tax Credits</a> and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542">EU Battery Regulation</a> mandate digital recordkeeping to track battery life cycles, underscoring the need for a global battery passport — a digital credential containing key information about the battery’s composition, state of health, history, and more.</p>
<p>Creating a scalable GBP will require cross-industry interoperability, such that entities across the value chain can securely coordinate and selectively share relevant data without the need to pay for costly one-off integrations or abandon their existing systems. MOBI and its members believe Web3 can become a key enabler for cross-industry interoperability at scale. SSI in particular introduces a promising approach to unlocking powerful synergies, enabling entities to securely control and share credentials across different web applications and platforms without the need for centralized intermediaries. To this end, MOBI and its members are building a decentralized Web3 marketplace ecosystem with standardized communication protocols for Self-Sovereign Data and SSI, designed such that the federated infrastructure and data therein are not controlled or managed by one organization. While MOBI MVP initiative demonstrates a specific use case for implementing the GBP, the benefits of MOBI Web3 implementation extend to almost any use case that involves multiparty transactions. </p>
<p>In Stage 1 of the initiative, implementers demonstrated the<a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/"> Integrated Trust Network</a> (ITN) identity services of one-to-one cross-validation for battery identity and data. The ITN serves as a federated (member-built and operated) registry for W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>, offering SSI management for connected entities such as batteries and their value chain participants. The ITN is the first enterprise network supporting multiple blockchains at the same time. These features are unique to the ITN, built for high resilience by ensuring the network’s functionality and sustainability do not rely on a single organization or blockchain. </p>
<p>Stage 2 will demonstrate <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a> decentralized marketplace services through creation of the cross-industry interoperable, privacy-preserving GBP. ITN services are one-to-one whereas Citopia services are one-to-many (and many-to-one). Through Web3 implementation, the availability and selective disclosure of trusted data and identities throughout the battery value chain will beget digital services and applications such as enhanced battery and carbon credits management, vehicle-to-grid communications and transactions, risk-based insurance calculations, and data-driven used electric vehicle pricing.</p>
<p>“Today’s global battery value chain is complex and it’s difficult to simultaneously ensure efficiency, scalability, safety, circularity, and regulatory compliance. To balance these priorities, we need to enhance battery lifecycle management through the creation of a shared ecosystem with SSI framework for secure coordination and selective disclosure of sensitive data,” said MOBI CEO and Co-founder, Tram Vo. “Driving innovation at this scale requires cross-industry collaboration. We invite public and private organizations worldwide to join us in this critical pursuit.”</p>
<p>“Web3 is an interesting technology which may facilitate a more scalable approach to exchanging battery data in a peer-to-peer fashion between organizations,” said Christian Köbel, Senior Engineer at Honda Motor Co., Ltd. </p>
<p>“It is confirmed how Web3-based self-sovereign data management works throughout Stage 1 of the MVP,” said Yusuke Zushi, Senior Manager at Nissan. </p>
<p>Said Mazda Motor Corporation, “Through participation in the GBP Working Group, we not only acquired the technical knowledge of Web3 but also understood a vision of an ecosystem that realizes the exchange of reliable information. We appreciate MOBI for giving us this invaluable opportunity.”</p>
<p>“The Stage 1 MVP experiment was instrumental in deepening our understanding of a system that enables sovereign data management. In the current era of data, the integrity and safety of information flow are paramount. As an experienced manufacturer of measuring instruments, HIOKI has always placed a premium on the reliability and accuracy of data,” said Kenneth Soh, Executive Officer at HIOKI. “We believe that the insights gained from this MVP are vital for the future progress of measurement instrument manufacturers and the industries we serve, from the perspective of innovation and societal contribution driven by mechanisms that offer both security and precision in data distribution.”</p>
<p>“The successful implementation of the Web3 GBP MVP is a significant step towards a more transparent and sustainable battery ecosystem. We are honored to contribute to the realization of the GBP as participants in this important initiative,” said Hisashi Matsumoto, Senior Manager at Anritsu. </p>
<p>“We, TradeLog, Inc., proudly support the decentralized Global Battery Passport project, driven by the efforts of MOBI and its dedicated Implementers,” said Alvin Ishiguro, Project Coordinator at TradeLog, Inc. “Going forward, we will continue to deliver our customers new experiences through blockchain technologies in the energy sector.”</p>

 A step-by-step guide to our project kickoff with Jobs for the Future and International Rescue Committee  Context <p><a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> (WAO) is kicking off some work this week, collaborating with <a href="https://jff.org">Jobs for the Future</a> (JFF) to assess the Job Readiness Credential provided by the <a href="https://rescue.org">International Rescue Committee</a> (IRC). WAO is managing the project, developing a user research strategy, preparing necessary materials, and conducting interviews with employers, IRC staff, and, if possible, IRC&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Our broad key question relates to how the visual design and metadata contained in a digital badge impact employer perceptions and interactions. We want to help JFF and the IRC have the most impact possible with the Job Readiness Credential because that impact means changing the lives of real&nbsp;people.</p> How we approach this kind of&nbsp;work <p>At the start of any project, it’s important to know the absolute basics. In fact, it’s a good time to get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9pftOJW0uk">Busytown Mysteries theme tune</a> in your head as an earworm! The 5W’s and an H shown above help make sure we know all of the things necessary to set the project up for success. Ideally, we’d know most of this before even signing the contract, but anything missing we can pick up in the client kick-off&nbsp;meeting.</p><p>Before the client kick-off meeting, we have an internal project kick-off where we talk about everything from timelines and responsibilities, to setting up the digital environments in which we’ll do the work. If we need to purchase any new equipment or subscriptions, we’ll identify those in this meeting. Our guidelines for this can be found on the <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/guidelines/project-kickoff">WAO&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p> Communications and&nbsp;cadence Early days of JFF/IRC Trello board. It’s the usual kanban format with the additional of the self-explanatory ‘Feedback Needed’ along with ‘Undead’. The latter is for cards that would otherwise get stuck somewhere but we don’t want to delete/archive just in case they come back to bite&nbsp;us!<p>Getting into the right rhythm with clients is an art rather than a science. While it’s easy to put an hour in the calendar each week for a catch-up call, this is a sub-optimal for anything other than the very short term. This is because, in our experience, these kind of calls quick devolve into status update meetings.</p><p>Much better is to work as openly as possible. Sometimes that means entirely publicly with etherpads, public Trello boards, and the like. Other times, it’s working transparently with tools that provide either real-time or summary updates. Often this means that the number and frequency of meetings can be reduced. With our recent work with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">DCC</a>, for example, we met every other week, aiming for 45 minutes. Between meetings, we sent Loom videos and other sorts of outputs to make sure our collaborators knew how thinking had&nbsp;evolved.</p><p>While it’s important that there is a project lead from both sides, it’s also crucial that their inboxes do not become information silos. Larger organisations might use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM systems</a>, but for us information is best in context. So, for example, a Google Doc for ongoing meta-level important info, and everything else on the relevant Trello card (or equivalent).</p><p>Documentation is not putting a message in a Slack channel or mentioning something during a meeting. Documentation is writing something down in an uncontroversial way that makes sense to everybody involved in the project. This is important because humans can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven%2C_Plus_or_Minus_Two">only hold so much information in our heads</a> at one time, and our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory">memories can be&nbsp;faulty</a>.</p> Everything is a work in&nbsp;progress CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>‘Perpetual beta’ is another name for saying that everything is a work in progress. What’s true of software is true of documentation and everything involved in a project. Conclusions are provisional and based on the data and knowledge we had at the&nbsp;time.</p><p>To account for this, we usually version our work, starting at v0.1 rather than 1.0. The reason for this is to show the client (and ourselves) that we’re working towards our first fully-formed opinions and outputs. It’s all part of our attempt to <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">work openly</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">show our&nbsp;work</a>.</p><p>With this work that we are starting with JFF and IRC, we’ll be talking to stakeholders in a couple of different places. Our human brains want to take shortcuts and jump to conclusions quickly so that we can take action. However, we’ve learned to “<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-the-strategic-uses-of-ambiguity-c403bff44029">sit in ambiguity</a>” for long enough to allow thoughts and reflections to percolate. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">slower kind of thinking</a> allows us to spot things that might have been missed by our ‘System 1’ mode of&nbsp;thought.</p> Conclusion <p>We’re greatly looking forward to getting started with this work. We haven’t gone into how we perform user research, which is perhaps the topic for a future post. There’s a lot to cover from that point of view in terms of ethics, data, and different kinds of methodologies.</p><p>What we hope that we have shown in this post is our commitment to working openly, holistically, and thoroughly so that the outputs we generate are trusted, interesting, and actionable.

<p>Running a Ceramic node in a production environment involves several key components. This article aims to provide an overview of the necessary resources and cost estimates for deploying a Ceramic node in the cloud. While we only showcased two specific providers for the services required (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DigitalOcean</a> and <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">QuickNode</a>), we hope these cost examples given the hypothetical scenarios we walk through will help give you a general idea of cost.</p> Components Required for a Ceramic Node <p>There are several sub-services to consider when running a Ceramic node in production, each serving different functions. As such, you will need:</p> 1. Resources for JS-Ceramic   Functionality: Tracks and stores the latest tips for pinned streams, caches stream state, provides the HTTP API service for connected clients to read, and communicates with the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) for blockchain anchoring and timestamping.   2. Resources for Ceramic-One   Functionality: These nodes store the actual data and coordinate with network participants.   3. Resources for Postgres Database   Functionality: Required for indexing data.   4. Ethereum RPC Node API Access   Functionality: Required to validate CAS anchors.   5. Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) Access   Current Status: Anchors Ceramic protocol proofs to the blockchain. This service is currently funded by 3box Labs, however, eventually, this function will be provided by node operators and with some expected cost.   Baseline Recommended Resources <p>Given the services you’ll need above, the Ceramic team has tested and organized a set of “baseline” configuration settings we recommend when setting up your node. However, seeing as these are baseline, or average, you may need to increase resourcing accordingly based on your actual usage:</p> JS-Ceramic   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for state   Ceramic-One   4 vCPU  4 GB memory  100 GB disk for storage   Postgres Database   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for indexing   High Traffic Recommended Resources <p>Given the services you’ll need above, the Ceramic team has tested and organized a set of “High Traffic” configuration settings we recommend when setting up your node. However, seeing as these are baseline, or average, you may need to increase resourcing accordingly based on your actual usage:</p> JS-Ceramic   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for state  10,000 IOPs     Ceramic-One   6 vCPU  8 GB memory  500 GB disk for storage  15,000 IOPs     Postgres Database   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for indexing   High Availability Configuration <p>For high availability, an additional node can be configured to sync data and handle dynamic read/write tasks, thus doubling the cost of a single-node setup.</p> Ethereum RPC Node Endpoint Costs <p>We’ve also chosen QuickNode to provide several RPC cost examples :</p>  QuickNode Base Plan: $10/month (100 million API credits, 2 endpoints, 550 credits/second)  QuickNode Middle Plan: $49/month (500 million API credits, 10 endpoints, 2,500 credits/second)  QuickNode Premium Plan: $299/month (3 billion API credits, 20 endpoints, 6,000 credits/second)   Hypothetical Scenarios and Cost Estimates <p>Let’s walk through three hypothetical need scenarios and use these to help estimate our cost structure:</p> Application A: Small User Base   User Base: 10,000 monthly active users  Query Behavior: 30% writes, 70% reads  Availability: Low-priority  Configuration: Baseline resources  Cost Estimate:  Node: $96/month  Ethereum RPC: $10/month  Total: $106/month     Application B: Write-Heavy Mid-Sized Application   User Base: 100,000-500,000 monthly active users  Query Behavior: 70% writes, 30% reads  Availability: High priority (2-node setup)  Configuration: High Traffic  Cost Estimate:  Nodes (2x): $918/month (2x $459)  Ethereum RPC: $49/month  Total: $967/month    <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator?hl=en&amp;dl=CiRjN2M2MzI1My0xYTQ1LTQ1N2YtOTc2MS04NjlkNzg1YjQ4YjYQCBokRjhGNDYwNjgtRTFBMC00M0MxLTgzMDAtRTRBNDFGQUFGQkVC&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Example GCP budget</a></p> Other Considerations <p>Additional cloud costs must be considered for networking - these costs will vary based on traffic patterns. Most cloud providers offer free traffic ingress to the nodes but will charge for egress, or data leaving the nodes.</p><p>Running a Ceramic node in production involves various components and resources, each contributing to the overall cost. By understanding the necessary configurations and associated costs, developers can make informed decisions tailored to their application's needs and user base. High availability setups and resource over-provisioning can significantly impact costs, especially for mid-sized applications with high traffic and write volumes.</p>

 <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">Open Identity Exchange (OIX)</a> and <a href="https://diacc.ca">DIACC</a> commit to finding alignment for global policies on digital trust and verification. 



<p>UK, June 2024 – The global non-profit <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">Open Identity Exchange (OIX)</a> and the Canadian non-profit <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</a> have committed to working together to advance global digital interoperability – a crucial element for trusted, successful international trade in a rapidly advancing digital global economy.</p>



<p>OIX is an influential global community for all those involved in the ID sector to connect and collaborate, developing the thought leadership and guidance needed to enable interoperable, trusted identities carried seamlessly from place to place in ‘roaming wallets’ for everyone. DIACC is an equally influential community of public and private sector leaders committed securing inclusive digital economy benefits by promoting user-centric design principles and verifying private sector services against the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) to support a secure ecosystem of services to enable user-directed information verification between public and private sector data authorities.</p>



<p>The two organisations will explore how different country-based policies related to identity management, verification, security, data privacy innovation and approaches to digital identity assurance can be compared and analysed so that more rapid progress can be made towards global digital ID interoperability through alignment of policy or acceptance of policy differences.</p>



<p>The collaboration will focus on advancing methods for participants in one framework to accept identity verification and digital credentials verified through another trust framework based on a mixture of policy acceptance and technology adaption. DIACC and OIX will explore equivalency and interoperability processes, identify potential alignments, new standards required, and gaps that may need to be addressed, and highlight use cases that can be facilitated through interoperability across digital ecosystems. Within this work, they will explore methods to describe common features of jurisdictional and sectoral trust frameworks, and share insights widely available as a resource.</p>



<p>The exchange and transfer of knowledge and expertise will be at the heart of this collaboration. OIX and DIACC will work together to create ‘intellectual capital’ to shape debate and bring about actions, moving identity management, data privacy, and security forward at pace.</p>



<p>Nick Mothershaw, Chief Identity Strategist at OIX, said: “The benefits of the digital global economy will be vast, but there is still some way to go before everyone can confidently access them. Our collaboration with DIACC will play a critical role. The fantastic progress DIACC has already made across Canada is an exemplar for global interoperability and will provide much needed insight, tools and guidance to pave a much clearer way forward globally.</p>



<p>“Our plans are to share our work with other trust frameworks across the globe, by publishing the criteria and values, and in the short-term creating an interim tool for trust frameworks to use for policy areas. We also want to secure their input on what they want to see in Trust Framework Comparison tool, as well as to start demonstrating how a roaming wallet will work.”</p>



<p>Joni Brennan, DIACC President, said: “We’re thrilled to collaborate with the Open Identity Exchange. The formalization of our liaison demonstrates progress in supporting our shared values to advance secure, user-centric digital identity solutions globally. Our collaboration will leverage each organization’s expertise to explore opportunities to foster innovation, enhance interoperability, and build public trust in digital services by identifying the alignments and gaps between jurisdictional and sectoral trust frameworks.”</p>

<p>Driving data interconnectivity, interoperability, and integrity, the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), now in its 6th iteration, delivers significant advancements that have benefited world-class organizations and shaped standards for industrial information exchange. Through partnerships with entities such as the British Standards Institution¹²³, GS1⁴⁵, European Blockchain Sandbox⁶, and various government-funded initiatives, the DKG has also played a crucial role in informing public policies.</p><p>DKG uniquely and effectively addresses the challenges of data ownership, AI hallucinations, and bias⁷ with the Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG)⁸ framework. dRAG drives a vast advancement of the RAG model initially developed by Meta⁹, by organizing external sources in a DKG while introducing incentives to grow a global, crowdsourced network of knowledge made available for AI models to&nbsp;use.</p><p>The DKG V8 has through a prototype demonstrated an unprecedented scale at which the Verifiable Internet for AI can drive value for anyone, on any device, and any chain. Addressing sensitive data concerns, scalability, and AI challenges concurrently has brought encouraging results that importantly shape the expected V8 release timeline.</p> DKG V8 — for Anyone, on Any Device, on Any Chain at Internet&nbsp;Scale <p>OriginTrail DKG has been battle-tested in real-world applications increasingly used by an ecosystem of organizations and government-supported initiatives. To date, no decentralized system has scaled in the production environment the way V6 DKG has. However, the current capacity of DKG reached its limits to support the growing usage requirements, prompting a transition to the V8, evolved to tackle the scale at which AI is consumed in any environment.</p><p>Data has been growing exponentially for decades, with AI driving further growth acceleration — according to the latest estimates, 402.74 million terabytes of data are created each day¹⁰. This trend is increasingly visible in the rising demands for additional capacity in the DKG, driven by data-intensive industry deployments in aerospace, manufacturing, railways, consumer goods, and construction driving DKG&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Version 8 of the DKG has therefore been designed with major scalability improvements at multiple levels, with a prototyped implementation tested in collaboration with partners from the sectors mentioned above.</p> 3 key products of OriginTrail DKG&nbsp;V8 <p>The major advancement that DKG V8 is making is in expanding the OriginTrail ecosystem’s product suite to 3 key products:</p>  DKG Core Node V8 — highly scalable network nodes forming network core, persisting the public replicated DKG  DKG Edge Node V8 — user-friendly node applications tailored to edge devices (phones, laptops,&nbsp;etc).  ChatDKG V8 — the launchpad for creating AI solutions using decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG).   DKG Edge Node — enabling the largest, internet-scale decentralized physical infrastructure network&nbsp;(DePIN) <p>The newcomer in the product suite is the DKG Edge Node — a new type of DKG node enabling the OriginTrail ecosystem to tackle the global challenges described above. As the name suggests, DKG edge nodes can operate on Internet edge devices. Devices such as personal computers, mobile phones, wearables, IoT devices, but also enterprise and government systems are where we can find huge volumes of very important data activity that DKG edge nodes will enable to enter the AI age in a safe and privacy-preserving way. The DKG edge node will enable such sensitive data to remain protected on the device, giving owners full control over how their data is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Together with being protected on the device, edge-node data becomes a part of the global DKG with precise access management permissions controlled by the data owner. In this way, AI applications that the owner allows data access to will be able to use it together with the public data in the DKG via decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG).</p><p>Since such AI applications can equally be run locally on devices directly, this enables fully privacy-preserving AI solutions aimed at the ever-growing number of devices on the network edge that can at the same time use both public and private DKG data. The introduction of the DKG edge node enables the DKG to quickly expand to be the largest, internet-scale decentralized physical infrastructure network&nbsp;(DePIN).</p> New features of the DKG Edge&nbsp;Node <p>To unlock these powerful capabilities, DKG edge node will include new features that have previously not been available on DKG nodes but were elements of other proprietary or open-source products.</p>  To enable a seamless creation of knowledge, DKG nodes will inherit the proven knowledge publishing pipelines from the Network Operating System&nbsp;(nOS).  The data protection techniques for private and sensitive data will be based on the NGI-funded OpenPKG project outcomes.  The DKG Node will support all major standards such as GS1 Digital Link, EPCIS, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identities.

<p>OASIS and the OASIS Topology and Orchestration. Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) TC are pleased to announce that TOSCA Version 2.0 is now available for public review and comment. This 30-day review is the third public review for this specification.</p>



<p>About the specification draft:</p>



<p>The Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) provides a language for describing application components and their relationships by means of a service topology, and for specifying the lifecycle management procedures for creation or modification of services using orchestration processes. The combination of topology and orchestration enables not only the automation of deployment but also the automation of the complete service lifecycle management. The TOSCA specification promotes a model-driven approach, whereby information embedded in the model structure (the dependencies, connections, compositions) drives the automated processes.</p>

<p>The digital realm has long struggled with the vulnerabilities inherent in password-based authentication systems. With iOS 18 launching in September, Apple introduces a groundbreaking API for developers to implement passkeys, transforming how users secure their online accounts. This innovation is set to create a password-less future, significantly enhancing user data protection.</p>



 What Are Passkeys? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are a sophisticated, passwordless login option for apps and websites developed by the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance</a>. They consist of a “private key” stored on the user’s device and a “public key” residing with the service. This dual-key system undergoes an encrypted verification process, ensuring that access is granted only when the user’s biometrics or device PIN confirm their identity. This system effectively eliminates the need for passwords and multi-factor authentication codes, creating a seamless and secure user experience.</p>



 The Benefits of Passkeys 



<p>Traditional logins rely on passwords, which users often reuse across multiple sites, posing substantial security risks. Passkeys, however, are tied to the user’s unique device and biometric data, rendering them immune to phishing and brute-force attacks. If a passkey is stolen, it becomes useless without the rightful owner’s biometric verification. This intrinsic link between the user and the device significantly mitigates the threat landscape.</p>



 Banks and Passkey Adoption 



<p>While the advantages of passkeys are clear, some industries have been slow to adopt, including banks. Andrew Shikiar, CEO and Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance, explains, “Banks and financial institutions operate in a highly regulated industry, so they are vigilant when it comes to ensuring that user authentication complies with relevant regulations. Synced passkeys introduce a new customer assurance model that compliance leads within banks are still adjusting to.”</p>



<p>However, Shikiar noted that “we are now seeing regulatory and other government bodies begin to give formal guidance on how industry should contemplate passkeys,” including an April 2024 <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/giving-nist-digital-identity-guidelines-boost-supplement-incorporating">missive</a> from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offering guidance about implementation.</p>



<p>But Shikiar says that “banks are hypersensitive to customer experience,” too, and thus more cautious about changing how customers log in—even if passkeys are quicker and more secure. New login methods require educating customers—and that takes time.</p>



<p>Despite these bottlenecks, Shikiar says that banks are slowly moving away from strictly password-based logins because they “inherently understand that using a passkey as a primary factor is far superior to a password.”</p>



 The Collaborative Future of Passwordless Authentication 



<p>Apple’s implementation of passkeys underlines a collective effort by tech giants within the FIDO Alliance, including Microsoft and Google, to enhance internet security. The Alliance has pioneered developments in authentication standards, striving to eliminate the vulnerabilities of password-based systems. Users can visit the FIDO Alliance to learn more about the ongoing efforts and advancements in passkey technology and the latest in <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">passkey implementation</a>.</p>



<p>As passkeys gain traction, the internet moves closer to a future where security does not come at the expense of user convenience. The collaborative efforts of industry leaders within the FIDO Alliance signal a transformative shift towards more secure, passwordless authentication methods, promising a safer digital experience for all.</p>

<p>Picture this: you’re not just in the game, you’re leading it, crafting the very rules that define success. This is the golden opportunity that unfolds when you, as a tech innovator, dive headfirst into the realm of establishing open standards.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the magnetic pull of influence and the domineering stature in the tech world. Engaging actively in setting open standards is not just about putting your name out there. It’s about embedding your products, your technologies, and your visionary outlook into the very fabric of the industry’s future. You’re not just aiming to lead; you’re set to redefine leadership. Why settle for just competing when you can be the one crafting the arena? It’s about creating a scenario where your competition isn’t just trying to catch up; they’re scrambling to decode your rulebook.</p>



<p>You’re a tech innovator armed with resilience, foresight, and an unmatched zest for breakthroughs. It’s not about facing challenges; it’s about embracing them, dissecting them, and transforming them into stepping stones towards your ultimate victory. Envision a future where your influence reverberates across markets, shaping demands, dictating trends, and steering the technological evolution. Your efforts in spearheading open standards not only catapult your products and strategies to the forefront but also enshrine your status as an indomitable leader and a relentless innovator.</p>



<p>But here’s the deal – it demands more than just ingenuity and expertise. It calls for an unyielding spirit, an insatiable appetite for excellence, and an unwavering commitment to surpass the benchmarks you’ve set yourself. It’s a call to arms for those ready to lead, innovate, and inspire. Let’s not just participate in the evolution of technology. Let’s lead it. Together, we can redefine the boundaries, push the limits, and craft a legacy that echoes through the annals of tech history. The path to unparalleled success and influence is before you. The question is, are you ready to seize it?</p>



<p>Remember, in the grand chessboard of technological advancement, it’s not about the pieces you start with, but how you decide to play them. Write the rules, win the game. Let’s make history. <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join-2/">Join us</a> at OASIS Open!</p>

 Solidarity, common ground, and intersectionality in the climate&nbsp;movement <p>This post looks at ways we can channel our activist energy in ways that address multiple issues and find belonging in adjacent communities.</p><p>Recently at a week long event that brought together energy transition activists from around the Mediterranean, I was pleased to meet a variety of people with intersectional understandings of the climate crisis. Together, we explored what intersectionality looks like in the climate movement and how we can tell stories that lead to&nbsp;action.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Expanding our activist&nbsp;energies <p>Although many of us care about a variety of struggles, we don’t have the time or the energy to get involved in every single thing. We focus our energies, we have to. The problem, of course, is that each issue and cause needs the visibility a group of activists coming together can provide. So how can we focus ourselves and find energy to do&nbsp;more?</p><p>For just a couple hours last week, I worked with a small group of rabble rousers to create campaign ideas for the challenge:</p><blockquote>The intersection and complexities of our structural problems makes people feel powerless.</blockquote><p>The structural problems we are facing are complex and co-exist within a matrix of other challenges. We are dealing with environmental crisis, racist societies, and social inequalities left, right, and centre. No matter how positive your personality may be, it’s hard to stay optimistic. No matter how cognisant you are about other struggles, it’s hard to pay attention to everything.</p><p>When we are overwhelmed and feeling powerless, we tend to recede. Our group had the insight that feeling overwhelmed or powerless is lonely. Loneliness is a cascading psychological phenomena that halts action and feeds&nbsp;despair.</p><p>We started to think about how we might address loneliness in activist movements by telling stories that help people who feel like they belong to one group (e.g. environmentalists) to understand their connection to other&nbsp;groups.</p><p>Our theory of change is that finding belonging amongst your activist friends can provide you with solidarity and a source of energy. We wanted to push for intersectionality in the climate movement.</p>Intersections in audiences, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">the Audience Ikigai</a>, cc-by&nbsp;WAO Choose three: intersectionality in&nbsp;practice <p>Everybody cares about something, whether that be sports, the environment, or even status. If you can identify one thing you care about, you can surely identify three others. Using arbitrary design constraints, like “choosing three” is a good way to move any idea forward, including ideas around your own activism or civic participation.</p><p>We know that climate change disproportionately affects already marginalised communities, which can exacerbate existing social inequalities. With this in mind, we choose to look at the intersectionality of climate with three human rights&nbsp;issues:</p>  Refugee and migrant&nbsp;justice  Women’s rights  LGBTQIA+ rights  <p>Easy, right? Choosing three issues to put your energy into is a lot less than “everything”. Three is also enough to give variability and provide access to different communities. Different communities come with different energies and that is something you can tap into when&nbsp;needed.</p>We often consider the thematic intersections of our own work. See how we work in the overlaps together with thoughtful, ethical organisations in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16">Practical utopias and rewilding work</a>. Find connections and leverage&nbsp;points <p>Intersectionality is about understanding the points of interconnection between two issues. Seeing the overlaps means that you can connect issues together in new and novel ways. Novelty is just one storytelling tactic in calling attention to a particular issue. Once you’ve determined places to focus, you can further narrow your focus by looking for leverage points that lead to connection.</p>  Refugee and migrant justice — From climate-induced displacement to the fact that people who are forced to migrate whatever the reasons can face challenges in accessing their basic rights, refugee and migrant justice <a href="https://www.climate-refugees.org/why">ties heavily</a> to other environmental and human rights&nbsp;issues.  Women’s rights — Women’s societal roles as caregivers and food producers make them more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It’s now widely understood that <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-02-24/educating-girls-is-more-effective-in-the-climate-emergency-than-many-green-technologies">educating girls is a catalyst</a> towards climate&nbsp;action.  LGBTQIA+ rights — Again, marginalised communities are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis. <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/60078/impact-climate-crisis-lgbtqia2s-pride-month/">LGBTQIA+ are often </a>members of other marginalised communities, such as racial minorities, and they are more likely to live in&nbsp;poverty.  <p>Human rights and environmental justice are big and complex areas of focus. Thinking about how the complexities of these issues overlap can help narrow down the impact you want to&nbsp;have.</p>cc-by Iris Maertens with <a href="https://www.dancing-fox.com/">Dancing&nbsp;Fox</a> Have some&nbsp;fun <p>Yes, structural problems are serious and complicated. It is essential to be aware of both your own privileges (whatever they may be) and to think deeply about the issues and communities you are working with and within. It’s also important to know that joy is a common emotional human experience. Inciting joy is a way to truly help people. It can help build psychological characteristics that help people deal with whatever life has to throw at them. Joy can also open people up to a better tomorrow.</p><p>At the event I attended last week, as we thought about the intersectionality of environmentalism with human rights, we thought about how we might be able to inspire people to be joyfully curious to learning more about an issue they might not have much involvement with.</p><p>We developed a few posters, designed to be displayed on a metro, to inspire this curiosity.</p>Our poster ideas, drawn by the incredible <a href="https://www.dancing-fox.com/">Iris&nbsp;Maertens</a> Solidarity with&nbsp;others <p>The complexity of our global problems can be overwhelming, but we cannot solve one complex issue without tackling the intertwining structural issues. Finding ways to relate what you care about to what others care about is a way to build solidarity and, therefore, momentum. It’s not always easy, but the more you can participate in cross-cutting social and environmental communities, the bigger our collective power&nbsp;becomes.</p><p>I worked with inspiring people from these organisations:</p>  “<a href="https://www.casafuturs.org">La Casa dels Futurs</a> is both an ongoing project dedicated to supporting intersectional organizing between social and ecological movements, and a campaign to create a permanent Climate Justice Center and Movement&nbsp;School…”  “<a href="https://www.rinascimentogreen.it/">Rinascimento Green</a>…aims to bring together various pieces of civil society to promote, through a path of popular participation, a bottom-up Green&nbsp;Deal.”  “<a href="https://wesmellgas.org/">WeSmellGas</a> is a collective of organisers, researchers and film-makers based in Northern Europe. Climate justice can only be realised by dismantling capitalism and the imperial processes that reinforce it, including our current extractivist energy&nbsp;system.”  <p>🔥 Do you need help with storytelling and advocacy?

<p>Last year we partnered with&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Learn Web 3</a>&nbsp;(a free educational platform for Web3 developers) to publish a tutorial on&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Saving OpenAI Chats to ComposeDB on Ceramic</a>&nbsp;to showcase an easy-to-understand design architecture and how ComposeDB could be leveraged for storage. In that example we showed how to configure and deploy a local ComposeDB/Ceramic node, walking through data model design, server configurations, model deployment, and runtime definition generation, all of which are necessary steps a developer must undergo before running the application locally.</p><p>But what if developers could bypass local node configuration altogether and start testing their database design and application logic immediately? What if they could do so with the assurances of no lock-ins, and the open option to move to a self-hosted configuration in the future? And finally, what if they could benefit from all of these things while enjoying a seamless developer experience that makes storage setup easy?</p><p>That's where <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a> comes in.</p> What is OrbisDB? <p><a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a>&nbsp;is an advanced decentralized database built on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a>&nbsp;and offers an ORM-like interface that developers can leverage when integrating the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB SDK</a>. Developers who have worked with Prisma or Drizzle with a Postgres instance will find this experience familiar and exceedingly easy to work with.</p><p>As for developer experience, what sets OrbisDB apart are the following:</p>  A user interface (UI) developers can run either locally or using a&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hosted Studio instance</a>, bypassing the need to define and deploy data models by hand (which is still an option if using the SDK). The UI also includes data visualization (you can view data relevant to your applications in table format), as well as other views for configuring add-ons like plugins (described below).  OrbisDB offers the option to leverage a variety of a growing list of plugins to enrich the data capabilities developers can incorporate into their application logic. Some example plugins offer gating ability, automatic resolution of ENS domains, sybil resistance, and more. Anyone can also build plugins and incorporate them immediately in the event they're running a standalone instance.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB SDK</a>&nbsp;wraps user authentication, client creation, schema creation (if developers prefer not to use the UI), and querying all under one roof, therefore simplifying the list of dependencies developers need to worry about.  Finally, OrbisDB offers the option to run an instance locally (similar to the ComposeDB tutorial mentioned above), or on a shared (hosted) instance. This is a significant feature for overall development and testing velocity as it lets developers start writing and reading data right away without having to worry about node configuration. Once developers are ready to take their application to production after testing on the shared instance, setting up a self-hosted (standalone) instance is straightforward.  <p>For this tutorial, we will be leveraging the&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hosted Studio instance</a>&nbsp;to both define our data models and utilize a shared OrbisDB instance.</p> Let's Get Started! <p>Before we get started, you will need the following dependencies:</p>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Chrome Extension</a>&nbsp;(or similar browser wallet for authentication)  Node v20  An&nbsp;<a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OpenAI API key</a>  A project ID you will need from&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a>&nbsp;  A free&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB Studio</a>&nbsp;account - first, log in with your browser wallet. We will use this later to define our data models and obtain a context and environment ID   Initial Setup <p>First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot &amp;&amp; cd orbisdb-chatbot
npm install</code> <p>Next, create a copy of the example env file in your root directory:</p> <code>cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Visit <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OpenAI Signup</a> page to create an account if you don't yet have one and generate an API key. OpenAI offers a free OpenAI API trial, with $5 worth of credit (which can take you a LONG way). Go ahead and assign your new API key to <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> in your new .env file.</p><p>Navigate to <a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a>&nbsp;and create a free account and a new project (with a name of your choosing and the&nbsp;<code>App</code>&nbsp;type selected). Copy the resulting project ID and assign it as the value for <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID</code> .</p> OrbisDB Setup <p>If you're logged into your <a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB Studio</a> account, we can start connecting our application to a shared OrbisDB instance.</p><p>First, you will need to define a new context. Contexts are a Ceramic-native feature exposed in all data management methods, and make it easy for developers to organize data across different applications or projects (there is also the option to leverage sub-contexts, but we'll save this for a future tutorial). </p><p>Go ahead and click "+ Add context" within your root studio view - feel free to give your new context a name and description of your choosing:</p><p>If you click into your new context you can view its corresponding ID:</p><p>Go ahead and copy this value and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTEXT_ID</code> in your .env file.</p><p>On the right-hand side, you should also see details about your setup:</p><p>Copy the value found under "Environment ID" and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_ID</code> in your .env file. This ID is required to identify you when using the shared OrbisDB instance. </p><p>You will also see the endpoints for the shared Ceramic and OrbisDB instances in the same section. No need to copy these values as they are already hard-coded into the repository.</p><p>Defining Data Models</p><p>We will also use the Studio UI to define the data models our application needs. This demo application utilizes two simple data models found within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/models/tables.sql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tables file</a> in our repository:</p>  <code>posts</code> - this will contain each message within our conversation exchange. The "body" field will house the message itself, while the "tag" field will keep track of who the message came from (user vs. bot). This model will use the "List" account relation, which means an authenticated account can have an unbounded amount of instance documents that fall under this definition.  <code>profiles</code> - this model will allow us to assign additional data to ourselves and our chatbot, including a name, username, and fun emoji. The "actor" subfield will be used to differentiate between the user (using the value "human"), and your chatbot (using the value "robot"). In contrast to posts, this model will use the "Set" account relation based on the "actor" subfield, which means an account can have exactly 1 instance document given a value assigned to "actor". For example, this ensures that our application won't allow us to accidentally create &gt;1 document with an "actor" subfield matching "human".  <p>To start creating the models, navigate to "Model builder" from the Studio navigation. You can start by defining your "posts" table. After clicking "Create Model" you will be able to view the model ID:</p><p>Copy this value and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_POST_ID</code> in your .env file.</p><p>Go through the same steps for your "profiles" table. However, be sure to select the "Set" option under "Account relation". Copy the resulting model ID and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_ID</code> in your .env file.</p> Application Architecture <p>As mentioned above, the OrbisDB SDK makes it easy to instantiate clients, authenticate users, and run queries using the same library. As you'll note in the application repository, there are various components that need to be able to access the state of the authenticated user. While we're <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/pages/_app.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">wrapping all components </a>of our application within a <code>WagmiConfig</code> contextual wrapper (which will allow us to leverage Wagmi's hooks to see if a user's wallet is connected - learn more about this in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/walletconnect-tutorial/">WalletConnect Tutorial</a>), we also need a way to know if the user has an active OrbisDB session.</p><p>While there are multiple ways to facilitate this, our application uses <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Zustand</a> for state management to circumvent the need for contextual wrappers or prop drilling.</p><p>If you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/zustand/store.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">store file</a> you can see how we've set up four state variables (two of which are methods) and incorporated the OrbisDB SDK to authenticate users and alter the state of  <code>orbisSession</code>: </p> <code>type Store = {
  orbis: OrbisDB;
  orbisSession?: OrbisConnectResult | undefined;
  // setOrbisSession returns a promise
  setAuth: (
    wallet: GetWalletClientResult | undefined
  ) =&gt; Promise&lt;OrbisConnectResult | undefined&gt;;
  setOrbisSession: (session: OrbisConnectResult | undefined) =&gt; void;
};

const StartOrbisAuth = async (
  walletClient: GetWalletClientResult,
  orbis: OrbisDB
): Promise&lt;OrbisConnectResult | undefined&gt; =&gt; {
  if (walletClient) {
    const auth = new OrbisEVMAuth(window.ethereum!);
    
    // This option authenticates and persists the session in local storage
    const authResult: OrbisConnectResult = await orbis.connectUser({
      auth,
    });
    if (authResult.session) {
      console.log("Orbis Auth'd:", authResult.session);
      return authResult;
    }
  }

  return undefined;
};

const useStore = create&lt;Store&gt;((set) =&gt; ({
  orbis: new OrbisDB({
    ceramic: {
      gateway: "https://ceramic-orbisdb-mainnet-direct.hirenodes.io/",
    },
    nodes: [
      {
        gateway: "https://studio.useorbis.com",
        env: ENV_ID,
      },
    ],
  }),
  orbisSession: undefined,
  setAuth: async (wallet) =&gt; {
    if (wallet) {
      try {
        const auth = await StartOrbisAuth(wallet, useStore.getState().orbis);
        set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
          ...state,
          orbisSession: auth,
        }));
        return auth;
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    } else {
      set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
        ...state,
        session: undefined,
      }));
    }
  },
  setOrbisSession: (session) =&gt;
    set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
      ...state,
      orbisSession: session,
    })),
}));</code> <p>As you can see, we've hard-coded the Ceramic and OrbisDB gateways, whereas we've imported our environment ID that we previously assigned as an environment variable.</p><p>Our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/navbar.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">navbar component</a> sits at the same or greater level as all of our child components and includes our Web3Modal widget. You can see how we're using a <code>useEffect</code> hook to check if our session is active and either set our "loggedIn" state variable as true or false. This result determines if we generate a new session for the user by leveraging our <code>setAuth</code> method from our Zustand store, or if we simply set our <code>orbisSession</code> as the value of our valid active session.</p><p>Back in the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">home page component</a> you can see how we're conditionally rendering our <code>MessageList</code> child component based on whether we have both an active orbis session AND the user's wallet is connected (allowing us to access their address).</p><p>Reading Data</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/message-list.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">message list</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/userform.component.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">userform component</a> files are responsible for performing the majority of writes and reads to OrbisDB. If you navigate to the message list component for example, take a look at how we've imported our client-side environment variables to identify our post and profile models, as well as our context ID. When this component is rendered, the <code>useEffect</code> hook first invokes the "getProfile" method:</p> <code>  const getProfile = async (): Promise&lt;void&gt; =&gt; {
    try {
      const profile = orbis
        .select("controller", "name", "username", "emoji", "actor")
        .from(PROFILE_ID)
        .where({ actor: ["human"] })
        .context(CONTEXT_ID);
      const profileResult = await profile.run();
      if (profileResult.rows.length) {
        console.log(profileResult.rows[0]);
        setProfile(profileResult.rows[0] as Profile);
      } else {
        // take the user to the profile page if no profile is found
        window.location.href = "/profile";
      }
      await getRobotProfile(profileResult.rows[0] as Profile);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return undefined;
    }
  };</code> <p>Notice how we've constructed a <code>.select</code> query off of our OrbisDB instance (provided by our Zustand store), asking for the corresponding values for the 5 columns we want data for. </p><p>Next, we need to notate which data model we want our query to reference, which is where we use <code>.from</code> with our profile model ID as the value.</p><p>We also only want the records where the profile is for the human user, indicated on the following line.</p><p>Finally, we use the context ID that corresponds to this project as the final value that's appended to the query.</p><p>If a corresponding profile exists, we then invoke the <code>getRobotProfile</code> method to obtain our chatbot's information. If it does not exist, we take the users to the profiles page so they can create one.</p><p>Writing Data</p><p>Let's take a quick look at an example of data mutations. Within the same <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/message-list.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">message list</a> component you will find a method called <code>createPost</code> which is invoked each time the user creates a new message:</p> <code> const createPost = async (
    thisPost: string
  ): Promise&lt;PostProps | undefined&gt; =&gt; {
    try {
      await orbis.getConnectedUser();
      const query = await orbis
        .insert(POST_ID)
        .value({
          body: thisPost,
          created: new Date().toISOString(),
          tag: "user",
          edited: new Date().toISOString(),
        })
        .context(CONTEXT_ID)
        .run();

      if (query.content &amp;&amp; profile) {
        const createdPost: PostProps = {
          id: query.id,
          body: query.content.body as string,
          profile,
          tag: query.content.tag as string,
          created: query.content.created as string,
          authorId: query.controller,
        };
        return createdPost;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return undefined;
    }
  };</code> <p>While this looks similar to the syntax we use to read data, there are a few differences. </p><p>First, take a look at the first line under the "try" statement - we're calling <code>getConnectedUser()</code> off of our OrbisDB prototype chain to ensure that our active session is applied. This is necessary to run mutation queries, whereas it's not a necessary step for reading data.</p><p>You can also see that we've swapped out the <code>.select</code> and <code>.from</code> statements for <code>.insert</code> which references the model ID we want to use, thus creating a new row in the corresponding table.</p><p>Finally, we're referencing the user's message value for the body while ensuring we tag the message as coming from the "user" before running the query and checking on its success status.</p> Running the Application in Developer Mode <p>We're now ready to boot up our application! </p><p>In your terminal, go ahead and start the application in developer mode:</p> <code>nvm use 20
npm run dev</code> <p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/</a> in your browser. You should see the following:</p><p>Go ahead and click on "Connect Wallet." You should see a secondary authentication message appear after you connect your wallet:</p><p>Signing this message creates an authenticated session (using <code>orbis.connectUser()</code> from our Zustand store). You can check the value of this session by navigating to the "Application" tab in your browser and looking for the <code>orbis:session</code> key pair:</p><p>Given that you have not yet created any messages, the application should automatically direct you to the /profiles page where you can assign identifiers to yourself and your chatbot:</p><p>Finally, navigate back to the homepage to begin exchanging messages with your chatbot. Notice how the values from your corresponding profiles appear next to the messages:</p> How Could this Application be Improved? <p>Since our message history is being written and queried based on static values (for example, assigning messages to the "user" tag), you'll notice that the same conversation history appears when self-authenticating with a different wallet address and creating a new session.</p><p>As a challenge, try thinking about how to implement different ways to improve the application design to improve this experience:</p>  Tagging the profiles and messages with values that align with actual authenticated accounts instead of static ones  Altering our message data model and application to accommodate different chat contexts, allowing a user to have different conversation histories   Next Steps <p>We hope you've enjoyed this tutorial and learned something new about how to configure and incorporate OrbisDB into your application! While this concludes our walk-through, there are other possibilities Ceramic has to offer:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Join the Ceramic Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/ceramicnetwork?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow Ceramic on X</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/useorbis?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow Orbis on X</a></p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Start Building with Ceramic</a></p>

		<p>Webinar<br>
</p>
<p>For higher education institutions offering financial aid to students, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, means your institution is required to meet compliance standards for the security and protection of financial information, and to provide transparency related to how personal information is used and shared. Failure to meet these standards carries significant risk for institutions, including restrictions or loss of eligibility for Title IV funding. In this session, we’ll review how the latest revisions to GLBA compliance standards, aligned with the NIST 800-171 revision 3, will impact higher education. Our privacy and compliance experts will review how these revisions increase the compliance burden for institutions, and key steps that institutions can take to meet the new standard and maintain compliance to receive federal financial aid support.</p>

<p>Third public review - ends July 27th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Lexicographic Infrastructure Data Model and API (LEXIDMA) TC are pleased to announce that Data Model for Lexicography Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This 30-day review is the third public review for this specification.</p>



<p>About the specification draft:</p>



<p>The LEXIDMA TC’s high level purpose is to create an open standards based framework for internationally interoperable lexicographic work. Data Model for Lexicography v1.0 describes and defines standard serialization independent interchange objects based predominantly on state of the art in the lexicographic industry. The TC aims to develop the lexicographic infrastructure as part of a broader ecosystem of standards employed in Natural Language Processing (NLP), language services, and Semantic Web.</p>



<p>This document defines the first version of a data model in support of these technical goals, including:<br>– A serialization-independent Data Model for Lexicography (DMLex)<br>– An XML serialization of DMLex<br>– A JSON serialization of DMLex<br>– A relational database serialization of DMLex<br>– An RDF serialization of DMLex<br>– An informative NVH serialization of DMLex</p>

<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

 1. Background&nbsp; 
<p>In 2022, Internet Safety Labs (ISL) conducted an <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/reports/2022-k-12-edtech-safety-benchmark-findings-report-3/">extensive benchmark of EdTech apps</a> used in schools across the United States. We sampled 13 schools in each state and the District of Colombia and identified 1,722 unique apps which were in use In K12 schools. During the benchmark, the apps were evaluated scored on their behaviors related to safety. As part of the safety evaluation, SDKs in each app were identified and researchers collected network traffic for 1,357 apps. In total, there were 275 unique SDKs in the apps, and 8,168 unique subdomains, 3,211 unique domains from the network traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key research question in conducting the 2022 EdTech benchmark was to determine how accurate SDKs were as a proxy for actual third-party data sharing, since network traffic data collection is somewhat labor-intensive. This report shares the results of the analysis.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Analysis&nbsp; 
<p>The basis of the analysis was to compare the “expected” third parties as based on the company owners of the SDKs with the observed companies in the network traffic. This required identifying the owner companies for both the SDKs and all the subdomains observed in the aggregate network traffic.<a>1</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers first identified which SDKs were in use in apps by using AppFigures as a resource. In total, 275 SDKs unique SDKs were found in use across all apps.&nbsp; Next, researchers identified the companies who published these SDKs. For each app, the number of unique company owners of SDKs found in each app is referred to as the “expected” number of companies to receive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, researchers performed a similar analysis on the subdomains observed in the network traffic (1,175 total apps). Each subdomain was resolved to an “owner” company.&nbsp; Subdomains were identified from HTTP POST/GET requests captured in the network traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then performed two quantitative analyses: (1) we examined the network traffic of apps with at least one SDK (n=1,083 apps), and (2) we examined the network traffic of apps with no SDKs (n=92 apps).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 2.1&nbsp; &nbsp;Apps With at Least One SDK&nbsp; 
<p>Apps with at least one SDK communicated with an average of 10.1 companies based on observed network traffic (Table 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 2.1.1&nbsp; &nbsp;“Expected” Companies in Network Traffic&nbsp; 
<p>In apps with at least one SDK, there were an average of 4.7 unique companies represented by the SDKs–thus, 4.7 “expected” companies to receive data. However, on average, only 1.7 (or 36.2%) of the “expected” companies were seen in the network traffic of apps with at least one SDK (Table 1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that there are several contributing factors that could account for this, including:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The manual testing performed by the researchers was unstructured and therefore had inconsistencies across researchers.&nbsp; 
 The manual testing didn’t perform all functions in the app. For instance, the tested did not make any optional purchases or upgrading to a premium version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 <br>
2.1.2&nbsp; &nbsp;“Unexpected” Companies in Network Traffic&nbsp; 
<p>Additionally, as seen in Table 1, these apps communicated with an average of 8.4 unexpected companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As expected, apps that used Webview<a>2</a>, had advertisements or behavioral ads all had even higher average numbers of unexpected companies, with apps with behavioral ads having the highest at 33.7 unexpected companies on average<a>3</a>. The ISL app score rubric regards the use of Webview and the inclusion of advertising as very high risks for K-12 students and the data in Table 1 reinforces the rubric.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Apps with at least one SDK that use Webview had 2.6 times as many third parties as apps with at least one SDK that don’t use Webview.&nbsp; 
 Apps with at least one SDK that include ads had 3.0 times as many third parties as apps with at least one SDK that don’t include ads.&nbsp; 
 Apps with at least one SDK that include behavioral ads had 4.0 times as many third parties as apps with at least one SDK that don’t include behavioral ads.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 2.2 &nbsp; Apps with No SDKs&nbsp; 
<p>There were 92 apps in the data set that had no SDKs and for which we had network traffic. Since these apps had no SDKs, there were no “expected” companies to receive data from the app [other than the app developer, of course].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apps with no SDKs averaged 4.6 companies observed in network traffic—negligibly less than the average for apps with at least one SDK. However, for apps that use Webview, or include advertising or behavioral advertising, the average observed companies is markedly lower (Table 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Apps with no SDKs that use Webview had 44.1% fewer observed companies.&nbsp; 
 Apps with no SDKs that include advertising had 40.6% fewer observed companies.&nbsp; 
 Apps with no SDKs that include behavioral advertising had 21.0% fewer observed companies.&nbsp;

 <br>
3. Conclusion<br>
 
 3.1&nbsp; &nbsp;SDKs as a Proxy for Third Party Sharing<br>
 
<p>As the data shows, SDKs aren’t a useful proxy for the actual number of third parties receiving data from the app. Moreover, apps that include ads or that use Webview will likely have significantly more third parties than apps without.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that viable measurement of third parties receiving data from apps requires testing and observation of network traffic. ISL used mostly manual methods for the collection of this data but automated methods would be extremely beneficial for ongoing and pervasive measuring of app third party sharing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>SDKs do provide value in identifying potential omissions in the manual testing process. Can we account for the specific SDKs that don’t appear in the network traffic? Did we miss a particular functional branch of the app that we should go back and test? Or might it be an indication of an error in the SDK database? So while SDKs don’t serve as a perfect indication of the third parties communicating with the app, they still provide valuable information, and as such, they will remain in our app safety labels (see <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/">https://appmicroscope.org/</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 3.2&nbsp; &nbsp;Validation of ISL App Scoring Rubric&nbsp; 
<p>As shown in section 2, use of Webview and the inclusion of advertising substantially increase user exposure to data sharing with more third parties. This finding reinforces the ISL app scoring rubric wherein the use of Webview and presence of advertising are indicators for very high risk.&nbsp;</p>

  Note: researchers determined the use of Webview manually, by observing third-party pages opening within the app. Thus, the presence of Webview as tagged in ISL’s AppMicroscope.org may not accurately assess Webview use for first-party web pages.&nbsp; 
 It would be interesting to study how many apps&nbsp;have behavioral ads and&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;use Webview.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Earlier this month, I was lucky enough to be personally invited by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joergresch/">Joerg Resch</a>&nbsp;to attend Europe’s flagship digital ID conference in Berlin,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">EIC 2024</a>. For someone who regularly spoke on this circuit for over 10 years, it was a blast to be back, revelling in the richness of the presentations and discussion, highlighted in this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonibrennan_eic2024-dc4eu-personaldataprivacy-activity-7206782875801669632-70VT?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">post</a>&nbsp;by my predecessor at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kantara-initiative_eic2024-kantarainitaitive-activity-7204130422773985280-FVFw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Kantara Initiative</a>. The brain is fully engaged for hours, absorbing expert insight, experience, and innovation that is found here at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC</a>&nbsp;in Germany and<a href="https://identiverse.com/">&nbsp;Identiverse</a>&nbsp;in the US, the world’s two biggest conferences in this space. I’m looking forward to a tiny fraction of the ground being covered and contextualised locally at our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;in just six weeks’ time.</p>



<p>The pre-conference&nbsp;<a href="https://sidi-hub.community/">SIDIHub</a>&nbsp;made significant progress in the challenging goal to achieve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multi-stakeholder-cross-border-identity-eic24">digital identity cross border interoperability</a>. Participants were interested in learning about Aotearoa becoming the first common law country to implement a<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/programmes-and-projects/digital-identity-programme/about-the-digital-identity-programme/">&nbsp;regulated digital identity trust framework&nbsp;</a>on July 1st. This framework regulates stakeholders that opt in for accreditation, thereby increasing customer trust in their security and privacy settings. The US, UK, Canada, and Australia have digital ID trust frameworks in operation and piloted, but not yet nationally legislated. Credential authentication and verification continue to evolve both in policy and technology at different speeds, making it a complex issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At our recent DIA-hosted public/private sector working group meeting on digital identification standards, I commented that there is still much work needed globally before we can adopt comprehensive policies, protocols and standards for decentralised digital ID and its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-the-wallets-we-want-eic24">container</a><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-expert-digital-wallet-verifiers-eic24">wallets</a>. This is a plane we will continue to build as we fly it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high interest in digital ID led us to host/co-host two events in June: the capacity-filled ‘Digital Identity, Higher Education, Aotearoa’ sponsored by Middleware and featuring the University of Auckland, and a Town Hall-styled session on digital cash with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Te Pūtea Matua (RBNZ), in partnership with FinTechNZ. Both events showed how important broad digital trust is for ensuring cybersecurity and protecting against deepfakes, scams and hacking threats. Awareness and education are essential, so we thank our members for supporting DINZ initiatives, just as DINZ supports members’ initiatives like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/biometrics-education-series/">the upcoming series from NEC</a>.</p>



<p>And finally, the DIA has released a new schedule of Identification Masterclasses through to August.</p>







<p>To register for any of the Zoom sessions, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:identity@dia.govt.nz">identity@dia.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;with the G or HD reference number and a Zoom link will be supplied.</p>



<p>Ngā mihi</p>

<p>This week, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has called for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/health/surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label.html">warning labels for social media platforms</a>. If you know anything about Internet Safety Labs (ISL) you’ll know that our primary mission is the development of free and accurate safety labels for technology. So naturally, we heartily agree with Dr. Murthy that technology needs labels—but perhaps not warning labels and definitely not just for social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various experts have written thoughtful responses<a>1</a>&nbsp;to this week’s call for warning labels, and their concerns underscore the fact that a warning label may be inappropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course we need safety labels on technology.&nbsp;</p>
 History of Product Labels&nbsp; 
<p>There are several types of product labels: ingredient labels (food), test result labels (automobile crash test ratings), warning labels from the surgeon general (cigarettes) and from other entities (OSHA’s Hazard Communication System for chemicals).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safety labels have a long-standing history in the US as a core component of product safety and product liability. The purpose of safety labels is to illuminate innate—i.e. unavoidable—risks in a product whether it is food, vehicles, cleaning solvents, toys for children, or the technology that we use with increasing reliance for all facets of living our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safety labels almost always lag commercial product introduction, and in at least a few cases, product safety can lag by decades. For instance, for cars, product safety awareness and measures (like seatbelts) emerged 50-plus years after their mass availability. Consumer computing has been around for about 40 years now, and it will likely be another 10 years before we see product safety in full swing for software-driven technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to InComplianceMag.com, US and Canadian tort-based law makes manufacturers’ product safety obligations clear (emphasis is mine):&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>” Manufacturers have an obligation to provide safe products and to warn people about any hazards related to the product. Those requirements have risen up out of the original product safety/liability cases, some of which happened in the same timeframe as the Chicago World’s Fair, the middle to late 19th century, with many more to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assumption in U.S. liability law, and also typically if a case is brought in Canada, is that the manufacturer of the product is guilty and has to prove that they did everything necessary to provide a safe product. That includes warnings, user instructions, and other elements. Today, that continues to be the basic concept in product liability, that the burden lies on the manufacturer to prove that they did everything possible to make their product safe.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://incompliancemag.com/product-safety-and-liability-a-historical-overview/">https://incompliancemag.com/product-safety-and-liability-a-historical-overview/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another interesting fact about safety labels is that they always lag commercial product introduction, and in at least a few cases, product safety can lag by decades. For instance, for cars, product safety awareness and measures (like seatbelts) emerged 50-plus years after their mass availability. Consumer computing has been around for about 40 years now, and it will likely be another 10 years before we see product safety in full swing for software-driven technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If tech were food we would have never stood for the absence of product information for as long as we have. Never. We use tech with little to no visibility or awareness of what it’s actually doing. That simply must change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need a science of product safety for software and software driven technology. And that’s exactly what we’ve been building for five years at ISL. The current attitude of placing the onus on consumers to somehow gird themselves against invisible risks that not even vendors fully understand is absurd. Of course we need labels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the good news is we’ve got them started on over 1,300 EdTech related apps. Here’s an example <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/app/1614/">https://appmicroscope.org/app/1614/.</a> The image below shows just the label header and the safety facts summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Labels for Technology&nbsp; 
<p>What type of label is appropriate for technology? A warning label is appropriate when the science is irrefutable. Are we there with the physical and mental health risks due to the use of technology? Maybe. Depends on who you ask. But maybe a label more like chemical warning labels is appropriate. Or perhaps just a test results label.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our work at Internet Safety Labs, our intention since day one was to expose invisible or difficult to recognize facts about risky behaviors of technology. As can be seen from the design of our app safety labels, we chose to emulate food nutrition labels that report measured findings. This approach of reporting measured findings works very well for this early stage of the science of product safety for technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, in our safety labels, you can see the category averages for most of the measures in the label. Why did we do that? Because there is no concrete threshold that distinguishes safe from unsafe ranges. There’s no industry standard that says, “more than ten SDKs is bad” for example. Moreover, technology norms vary by industry, such that personal information collection in fintech and medical apps is quite different than personal information collection in retail (at least one hopes). Thus, the category averages displayed in our labels don’t necessarily mean “safe”, they just provide context as we continue to measure and quantify technology behavior. An example of the shortcomings of this approach is when, for instance, the category average number of data brokers is greater than zero for apps typically used by children. (We advocate for no data brokers in technology used by children.) But we need to start with understanding the norms. We can’t change what we can’t see. &nbsp;</p>
 The Devil is in the Details&nbsp; 
<p>The call for a congressional mandate for something (not necessarily a warning label) is a step in the right direction. Why? Because it treats software as a product and tacitly places product safety requirements on it. This is an advancement in our eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, product safety is almost always the domain of government (or insurance). In the absence of a government mandate for product safety for technology, we see fragmented efforts with the FTC boldly championing privacy risks in technology, and the FCC advocating for a different type of label. So indeed, it’s encouraging that we’re starting to talk about technology in product safety terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the devil is in the details of any labeling program. In the words of Shoshana Zuboff, “who decides and who decides who decides?” As in, who decides what goes on the labels? Also who oversees the integrity of the labels? The US government is a customer of data obtained by surveillance capitalism<a>2</a>. When it comes to technology can the government be trusted to keep people safe? (When it comes to food can the government be trusted to keep people safe? When you dig into it, the track record is spotty.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product safety exists in natural opposition to the industry status quo and any kind of regulation is already facing and will continue to face strong opposition<a>3</a>. In the early 1900s, when chemist Dr. Harvey W. Wiley began a crusade for the labeling of ingredients and identifying toxic elements in food, industries who relied on the opacity of ingredients (snake oil salesmen) or who simply didn’t want to incur the cost of change (whiskey distillers) opposed such a mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Strenuous opposition to Wiley’s campaign for a federal food and drug law came from whiskey distillers and the patent medicine firms, who were then the largest advertisers in the country. Many of these men thought they would be put out of business by federal regulation. In any case, it was argued, the federal government had no business policing what people ate, drank, or used for medicine. On the other side were strong agricultural organizations, many food packers, state food and drug officials, and the health professions. But the tide was turned, according to historians and Dr. Wiley himself, when the activist club women of the country rallied to the pure food cause.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/116890/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/116890/download&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Product safety challenges the status quo and creates necessary growing pains for industry. But industry always survives. And more often than not, new industries emerge, such as the ongoing development of safety features for vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s return to the challenge of deciding what goes in the labels. We at ISL know quite a lot about what it takes to develop safety labels in a space where the naming and measurement of risk isn’t fully baked (or worse, non-existent). Determining what goes into a previously uncharted, unmeasured safety label is extraordinarily challenging. It’s even more challenging if the measurement tools don’t exist. But our situation is even worse than that: we don’t even have agreement on what the risky behaviors in technology are. AND, we are talking about behaviors here—which is not language we typically associate with products. Products don’t typically behave. From our several years in development, these are the highly iterative steps that must occur to reach consensus on labels for technology:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Consensus on naming the hazards/harms in technology.<a>4</a>&nbsp; 
 Consensus on assessing and quantifying the risks.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Identify the behaviors that embody the risks.&nbsp; 
 Figure out a way to measure the behaviors that embody the risks.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Assess the measurements.<a>5</a>&nbsp; 
 Consensus on presentation of the measurements/information.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>As far as presentation of the data, in our case, we decided to aggregate the data into clusters based on riskiness, and we also ultimately decided to provide a single app score. This was done with some reluctance, and it will no doubt be a much-evolving scoring rubric for the next few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, we believe the best thing the labels can do is objectively report the invisible (or poorly understood) behaviors of the products until such time as definitive harm thresholds can be derived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a final vital detail regarding the establishment of any labels, and that’s having what I would characterize as exceptional diversity of participants in establishing safety standards. This isn’t lip service. A few years ago, when I started to better see how what was risky for me was very different than what was risky for people who are different from me such as a person of color, or a person with a disability, or an incarcerated person, I woke up one night from a deep sleep with the awareness that any attempt at standardizing or consensus is doomed if it doesn’t have full diversity involved<a>6 </a>. Why this is so is a long and complicated matter. On the one hand, everything ever done should endeavor to have exceptional inclusion of a massively diverse set of participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it also has to do with the fact the software and software driven tech is “alive” and interactive in a way that other products in our lives aren’t. We have a special duty when it comes to product safety of software animated products. We may even need to reconsider what a “product” is. We have seen evidence of the hazards of animated technology not built with adequate understanding of the diversity of users with the embodiment of human bias in automated decision making or with hand dryers that don’t activate for people of color. The point is that technology acts on and with us in a different (and constantly changeable) way than other products. So labeling is both harder and matters more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>Overall, I remain optimistic that the lens is happily starting to focus on product safety, implicit though it may be. People will be thinking more about labels for technology. And they will see that ISL is already providing labels with privacy risks. We can call out the presence of infinite scroll, and like buttons and other widely recognized as addictive user interface patterns in labels today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, confusion stems from Dr. Murthy’s call for a “warning label” instead of a safety or ingredients label. Technology is cigarettes<a>7</a>. We use the metaphor all the time. Technology today is cigarettes in the 1940s/1950s when just about everybody chain smoked and the harms were likely all anecdotal and pooh-poohed. It took decades to assemble causal evidence. But tech is also much more complicated than cigarettes and a warning label is premature. This is not a compelling argument to say that we don’t deserve to have accurate information on tech’s risky behaviors. As it is right now, we don’t even have an ingredient label for technology. We are flying (tech-ing?) blind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course we need labels. Industry would do well to proactively embrace label enablers like software bills of material, consent receipts, and machine-readable record of processing activities (ROPAs). Because there can be no doubt that labels are imminent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier, I said that we’ve “started”. I say that because our labels only include privacy risks at present. Our labels are deliberately modular and we’ve scoped additional sections:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Risky UI Patterns –like deliberately addictive UI patterns of the sort Dr. Murthy is calling for exposing. Our <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/specifications/isl-safe-software-specification-for-websites-and-mobile-apps-v1-1/">Safe Software Specification for Websites and Mobile Apps</a> already describes measurement of these kinds of risks.&nbsp; 
 Automated Decision-Making Risks&nbsp; 
 Security [client side only] Risks&nbsp; 
 Differences between observed tech behavior and privacy policy and/or terms of service.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>All of these are on our roadmap. We know exactly how to add these sections to the label, it’s strictly a resource and funding issue. If they sound good to you, please <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/donate/">consider supporting our mission</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of course we need labels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With tens of billions invested in AI last year and leading players such as OpenAI looking for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0">trillions more,</a> the tech industry is racing to grow large generative AI models. The goal is to steadily demonstrate better performance and, in doing so, close the gap between what humans can do and what can be accomplished with&nbsp;AI.</p><p>There is however another gap that has become strikingly apparent — the AI trust gap. As challenges such as AI hallucinations, bias, and intellectual property slurping continually cause damage, we look into how the base of the current Web could be effectively transformed to support the Verifiable Internet for&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The announced<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2024/06/10/apple-chatgpt-ios-18-heres-how-it-will-work/"> Apple and OpenAI</a> integration signals the trust gap is widening, with Apple users’ data becoming the next frontier for training ChatGPT and questionable transparency on how it is used. This data is so valuable that it <a href="https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/artificial-intelligence/apple-to-pay-openai-through-distribution-not-cash/110955459">reportedly makes up for charges Apple</a> would pay for using costly ChatGPT AI models. The Verifiable Internet for AI shifts this paradigm, making such data transactions transparent on chain with ownership of data taken back by users, who ultimately get to monetize&nbsp;it.</p> Decentralized AI: Intersection of Crypto and&nbsp;AI <p>Having employed the fundamentals of crypto, AI, and knowledge graphs successfully within a <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/overview">plethora of sectors</a>, where trust, transparency, and accuracy are of paramount importance, OriginTrail now integrates Base blockchain with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), to help drive trust and transparency with neuro-symbolic AI. Instilling information provenance, ownership, and graph structure through blockchains and knowledge graphs together can effectively address the aforementioned problems of AI, as detailed in the most recent <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">White Paper&nbsp;3.0</a>.</p> Your Body of Knowledge, Your Choice of&nbsp;AI <p>The opportunity of graph algorithms as a foundation for reputation in the age of AI was also highlighted by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, in a recent&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>“Another piece of a puzzle that I feel could be missing, is something around reputation that’s on chain. You can imagine a version of this that’s like using the graph structure of the chains.

  <p>ABSTRACT: Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA) is an alternative to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, emphasizing the importance of a robust, scalable, and expandable architecture. The MVA methodology mitigates risks associated with reputation, competitiveness, and architectural deficiencies, and fosters collaboration among competitors. Real-world examples, such as SSL/TLS and the Gordian system, illustrate the successful implementation of MVA in software development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A business methodology focused on producing a Minimum Viable Product blossomed in the 21st century. Unfortunately, it can set businesses up for future failure because it doesn’t properly define the larger architecture that is needed to evolve a product past its earliest, minimal state.</p>

 The Old Methodology: Minimum Viable Product 

<p>A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a business methodology that advocates creating the simplest possible version of a product as a first release, to see if the market responds positively, or else to understand why it doesn’t<a>1</a>. If an MVP is successful, possibly through iterations of the initial work, the product can then be grown and ultimately find large-scale success in the market.</p>

<p>Twitter has long been used as an example of an MVP that did great, with Dropbox and Facebook being other examples of MVPs<a>2</a> (to various extents). By the criteria of these companies, MVP would seem to be a win-win methodology.</p>

<p>However, they’re not the full story.</p>

 MVP Biases 

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, current literature about Minimum Viable Products suffers from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">Survivorship Bias</a>. We hear about the success of companies that used MVPs, but we don’t know that their doing so actually led to success. In fact, the successes that we see might just be a false signal.</p>

<p>How many hundreds or even thousands of companies pursuing MVPs failed for each Twitter or Facebook that succeeded? How many companies found that they couldn’t scale their MVP, realized that they couldn’t take commercial advantage of an otherwise successful MVP, or simply were beaten by competitors with even more viable products?</p>

<p>We can’t measure the success of the MVP methodology by the anecdotal success of a few individual companies.</p>

 MVP Dangers 

<p>The MVP system also has other dangers.</p>

<p>Some of these are related to company brand. Though a new company doesn’t have a reputation to damage, a series of unsuccessful MVPs could nonetheless curtail their future opportunities. Meanwhile, a more mature company might find their existing reputation blemished by a poor MVP. This is especially true today, as companies are increasingly saying that MVPs can be poor-quality releases<a>3</a>. That didn’t work out that well for Cyberpunk 2077, one of the highest profile and most controversial computer game releases of recent years, even though (like many modern-day computer games) it wasn’t quite released as an MVP, but not in a fully complete form either<a>4</a>.</p>

<p>There are also competitive dangers. Within a developmental niche, MVPs only work if everyone pursues them; otherwise, an MVP built on solid ideas could easily be out-competed by a firm who produced a slightly more mature prototype. Similarly, a company with more resources might be able to scoop up the ideas in a MVP and replicate them to their own advantage<a>5</a>.</p>

<p>However the biggest dangers of MVPs are probably architectural. By defining an MVP, a company can easily ignore the larger architecture issues that would have once been considered before starting work on any serious release. This can cause problems with scaling, with missing features that can’t easily be added, and with locked-in decisions that become part of the final product.</p>

<p>Twitter (“X”), for example, didn’t finalize its network architecture design until 2010<a>6</a>, four years after its advent. It would have been easy for a better architected social-medium system to get in there first; the fact that no one did is one of the pieces of luck that led to Twitter’s ultimate success. In fact, one of the developers at Twitter has noted this, saying: “In the end, Twitter barely made it, and product progress was slow for years due to post facto infrastructure investment.”<a>7</a></p>

<p>The biases and dangers implicit in MVPs suggest the need to at least experiment with other methodologies for product releases. The huge problems implicit in the potential lack of architecture in an MVP also suggest what that alternative methodology should be: a Minimum Viable Architecture.</p>

 A New Methodology: Minimum Viable Architecture 

<p>Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)<a>8</a> is a methodology that has been discussed in somewhat different forms over the last several years. It doesn’t focus on the simplest product that can be released to consumers, but instead on the simplest architecture that can support future development within a product’s technological ecosystem.</p>

<p>The goal of an MVA is still to create a product that doesn’t strain the resources of a company and that doesn’t create a situation where a company’s ultimate success or failure depends on that singular release. However, that simple product must be created with the understanding of a larger architecture that has enough flexibility<a>9</a> that designers can fill in gaps in that architecture in the future. It’s just that the decisions for filling in those gaps are delayed as much as possible<a>10</a>. It’s a melding of agile methodologies with architectural concerns.</p>

<p>Though an MVA could be created with a full understanding of future expansions that may or may not be ultimately accomodated, it’s more powerful to create an MVA that is modular and expandable — that doesn’t depend on the architect thinking of everything, but instead future-proofs itself so that the architecture could include unthought-of elements in the future. As Jorge Lebrato says: “The architecture remains cohesive and each piece cooperates with the others, despite having had different rhythms.” The best MVA is a compromise between entirely ignoring the architecture (as is likely in an MVP) and designing it entirely (which would likely result in time cost and waste)<a>11</a>.</p>

 MVA Examples 

<p>The following examples contain some real-world usages of MVA instead of MVP.</p>

 SSL/TLS 

<p>When I co-authored the TLS spec in the ’90s, I did my best to future-proof it by simultaneously constraining the design and giving it enough flexibility to be expanded in the future. This is an example of a Minimum Viable Architecture whose usefulness has proven itself: TLS is now the most deployed security system on the internet, at the heart of almost every shopping, financial, or banking transaction.</p>

<p>This future-proofing was thanks in part to our architecting elements that we suspected would be required in the future, but which couldn’t be deployed in the then-present, primarily due to CPU limitations. Perfect forward secrecy<a>12</a> is an example. Users were able to simply turn it on when its usage became viable on standard hardware platforms.</p>

<p>However, our more notable work in creating an MVA came from our inclusion of ciphersuites. These are powerful encryption and decryption rules that do the actual cryptographic work of TLS. By defining them as modular plug-ins, we supported the future innovation of TLS, even in ways that we could not envision. And, there was considerable innovation. TLS 1.2 had 37 ciphersuites, though that dropped back to five with TLS 1.3<a>13</a>.</p>

 The Gordian System 

<p></p>

<p>One of my most recent endeavors is Blockchain Commons’ Gordian system<a>14</a>, which is a layered architecture for protecting digital assets and identity that has seen early successes with the protection of seeds with systems like SSKR<a>15</a> and CSR<a>16</a> and that focuses on the Gordian Principles of independence, resilience, privacy, and openness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockchain Commons’ Mission: Advocating for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to create an MVA that future-proofs the Gordian products, the Gordian architecture identifies points of potential interoperability and breaks the architecture into discrete components across those interoperable interfaces, thus allowing individual elemetns to be replaced. This was done both at the large-scale application level and at the small-scale programmatic level. It’s important everywhere.</p>

<p>At the large-scale application level, the Gordian system achieves interoperability by the careful architecting of both discrete applications and the ways that they can interact. Airgaps are a traditional methodology for introducing security into a digital asset system<a>17</a>, but the Gordian system has expanded that to include Torgaps<a>18</a>, which is a way for making transactions between connected applications both secure and non-correlatable. This modular approach is one way to enable future-proofing, and it’s only strengthed by systems such as airgaps and torgaps that tightly constrain communications between the modules.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>At the small-scall programmatic level, the Gordian system introduces a layered stack of specifications that together enable the private and secure transmission of sensitive data. This stack includes dCBOR<a>19</a>, Bytewords<a>20</a>, URs<a>21</a>, Animated QRs<a>22</a>, Envelope<a>23</a>, Gordian Transport Protocol<a>24</a>, and Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol<a>25</a>. Together these specifications allow for the deterministic storage of binary data (dCBOR), the alphabetic representation of binary data (Bytewords), the tagged display of that representation with functionality to support multipart data (URs), the QR display of multipart data (animated QRs), the structured &amp; smart storage of content (Envelope), the communication of Envelopes (GTP), and the secure communication of Envelopes (GSTP). But we didn’t know what all the layers would be when we got started: this is another example of future-proofing, and one that easily arises from carefully layered specifications.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Blockchain Commons creates its progressive use cases we focus first on the requirements without needing to know the technology. The technological specifics can be filled in by ourselves or individual vendors in the future.</p>

<p>By abstracting and separating architectural elements—whether they be large-scale components, layered specifications, or additional requirements found in progressive use cases—the Gordian system will be able to incorporate options that we are not even considering. The ultimate goal of all of these designs is to ensure that our MVA architecture  does not limit itself, but instead remains flexible for the future.</p>



 
    
   

 Other MVA Examples 

<p>This type of MVA thinking is a pattern that can be widely successful and that doesn’t create some of the limitations that appear in MVP thinking. For example, when I was supporting the creation of the earliest specifications for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)<a>26</a>, I was pleased to see us arrive at a compromise where core DID specifications were separated from specific DID methods and from signature suites. It’s an architecture that allows for a lot of future expansion.</p>

<p>Similarly, some of my earliest Blockchain Commons work was with a company who was adapting the Gordian architecture. Even though they weren’t planning to initially implement multi-sigs, I ensured that they don’t make decisions that would lock them out of multi-sig usage in the future, because I was thinking of a MVA that went beyond the MVP they were focused on.</p>

 Coda: The Benefits of Coopetition 

<p>It can be quite hard for a single company to figure out an MVA. Thus, it’s great to work with other companies in your technology space.</p>

<p>This is particularly true if your industry supports coopetition, where business competitors can work together for a mutually beneficial good. If an industry  supports interoperability, or one company adding services to another company’s products, then it’s a great candidate for coopetition—and thus MVAs are even more likely to be successful.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has been able to take advantage of this. A variety of companies have participated in the Gordian Developer Community community<a>27</a>, each contributing their own ideas and requirements for the Gordian architecture. In turn, they’ve then gone off and created open-source libraries that adapt the architecture<a>28</a>, before beginning work on their own wallets that use the MVA that we cooperatively designed. A not-for-profit organization can be a great support for MVA work of this type; that’s what Blockchain Commons does.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Hollowing out spaces in architectures for future development and creating flexibility for the future through modular designs are two of the most successful methods for turning an MVP into an MVA. They give you something that supports minimal investment and agile development, while simultaneously maximizing the ability to scale and expand in the future.</p>

<p>We don’t always know the right solutions. We can’t predict what will work best. So the best we can do is create architectures that won’t lock us in to specific decisions about the future. By doing so, especially by working in coopetition to do so, we also ensure that no one company will lock us or our users into futures that we don’t agree with.</p>

Hopefully that means we’re moving in this direction!</p>

					 Enhancing Creative Workflows with Generative AI in Adobe Photoshop
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Hall Multipurpose Room A</p>
<p>Explore the transformative impact of Generative AI tools in Adobe Photoshop during this presentation. With two decades of Photoshop experience, I have witnessed numerous advancements from Adobe. What I was originally doing by hand with the primitive lasso tool of Photoshop 7.0 in 2002 (has it been that long?)…can now be done at the click of one button in the latest Creative Suite.</p>
<p>This technology has enhanced both the creative/editing applications within higher education, specifically at Seton Hall University’s Teaching, Learning and Technology Center.</p>
<p>The introduction of Generative AI into Adobe Photoshop has revolutionized our Digital Media Team’s workflow by automating routine tasks such as image corrections and creations. These advancements have not only accelerated our project timelines but also expanded our creative possibilities. This session will provide an in-depth look at how these AI tools have altered our digital workflows, improving efficiency and allowing for the production of more complex and creative outputs.</p>
<p>The presentation will include a live demonstration of key Generative AI features within Adobe Photoshop, illustrating their practical applications which have been instrumental in enhancing our workflow at the TLTC. Attendees will see how AI-enhanced tools are used in real-world scenarios to fix, create, and enhance images, useful for producing high-quality content and marketing materials.</p>
<p>This session is tailored for individuals eager to learn about the potential of AI in enhancing digital media production, specifically within the Adobe Creative Suite. By sharing practical examples and personal insights from years of experience, I aim to inspire attendees to integrate these innovative tools into their own workflows, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in educational technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also just really cool to digitally insert a T-Rex in the middle of the campus green at the press of a button.</p>

					 Centering Students and Using AI within Meaningful Learning Environments
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room B</p>
<p>“How can AI be used to enhance meaningful learning environments in culturally responsive ways? This session focuses on innovative ways AI tools can be used in the classroom to support meaningful learning experiences and culturally responsive teaching. When designing meaningful learning experiences, teachers use AI to engage students in activities that are active, collaborative, constructive, authentic, and goal directed. Culturally responsive teaching is a student centered approach that enriches how AI tools are used within meaningful learning experiences.This happens when teachers situate students’ lived experiences, frames of reference, and ways of being as resources for learning. Participants will be provided a process for designing meaningful learning experiences, a list of AI tools that promote meaningful engagement, and a culturally responsive framework that advances meaningful technology integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session also addresses educational inequities that surface when learning experiences lack meaningfulness. Teacher centered practices have historically been related to passive technology use, deficit based beliefs about students’ potential, “one size fits all” instruction, and curricular choices that do not account for diversity. As a result, teacher centered approaches have and continue to perpetuate opportunity gaps that disproportionately impact students from historically marginalized communities. To bridge digital divides and fill opportunity gaps, participants will be exposed to the strategies, beliefs, conditions, and tools that support the shift towards student centeredness. “</p>

					 Lessons Learned, Actions Unleashed: Unlocking Our Potential
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room C</p>
<p>Let’s reflect on our AI work together. We’ll use a ‘retrospective’ (a project management tool) to candidly discuss what worked well and where we can grow. We’ll focus on solutions we can control and make this a fun, collaborative conversation. We’re looking for real solutions for real people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some questions to get us started…</p>
 
  What were the outcomes of new teaching methods, tools, etc. used? Are there opportunities to refine or expand?&nbsp; 
  Let’s talk silver linings. What wisdom can we extract from decisions that didn’t quite work out? 
  Describe something you crushed! What made it a success? 
  What action items can we identify to address challenges and improve the learning environment for ourselves and our students? 
 
<p>Even if you haven’t made any groundbreaking discoveries, join us anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session lead will share anonymized responses compiled into a toolkit after the conference.&nbsp;</p>

					 Using AI Avatar Patients to Increase Student Readiness
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room A</p>
<p>Educators need to prepare students to enter the workforce post-graduation. Student’s readiness, which includes perceptions of knowledge, attitude, and ability, manifests in one’s sense of self-efficacy and is influenced by experiences. Additionally, experiences are impacted by context-specific readiness. The Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions framework defines context as a set of characteristics and circumstances that are active, unique, and embedded in the experience. Contextual readiness includes socio-political, community, organization, financial, and learning resources and opportunities that influence the experience. Experiences should promote active learning and simulate real-world scenarios to foster student readiness appropriately. Developing and delivering real-world learning experiences presents many challenges, including contextual characteristics, limited space for hands-on engagement, increased staffing needs, scheduling conflicts, and costs associated with patient actors or experiential opportunities. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) can address these challenges. AI is a computing system that can engage in human-like processes such as learning, synthesizing, self-correction, and data integration for complex processing tasks. AI technologies generate human-like content in response to complex and varied prompts and, blended with VR, immerse the user in simulated environments to make the experience more thoughtful and interactive, allowing for repeated practice to enhance skill development, conservation of resources, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>This panel presentation will describe the pedological design and implementation of AI avatar patients into healthcare interprofessional curricula. It will present data on financial impact and students’ perceived readiness post-AI-VR experiences and offer recommendations for future integration into the broader educational curriculum.&nbsp;</p>

While the EU AI Act put the so-called Brussels Effect into play, more regions across the globe are now weighing risks, rights, economic opportunities, and regional needs. On May 28th, the <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Global Network of Centers of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers</a> (NoC) and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University (BKC) hosted a group of policy experts from Africa, Latin America, the US, and the EU to discuss this state of global AI regulation and outline next steps for collaboration across continents.</p><p>Lis Sylvan, Senior Director of Strategy and Programming at BKC, moderated the discussion with Carlos Affonso de Souza (Director of the Institute of Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro), Mason Kortz (Clinical Instructor at the Cyberlaw Clinic at BKC), Gabriele Mazzini (European Commission, chief architect of the EU AI Act), and Ridwan Oloyede (Certa Foundation, coauthor of their recent “State of AI Regulation in Africa” report), with NoC Executive Director Armando Guio providing behind-the-scenes support. The group delved into how governments are weighing sectoral versus horizontal regulatory approaches; the role of the administrative state and existing data protection and competition regulators; the new models of AI regulation in Rwanda and Brazil; the impact of the EU AI Act across all jurisdictions; and the potential for truly global governance.</p> Origins and Approaches <p>De Souza contextualized the current moment of global AI regulation as a decade-long journey of AI regulation that started with charters and declarations of governing principles from various governments and entities. Over time, those charters and principles were reflected in national AI strategies, which have been in the works for five years and can be seen as the precursor to AI regulation; Brazil’s AI regulatory evolution, for example, closely followed this time frame. De Souza highlighted the impact of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on this evolution; after GDPR took effect, countries have established data protection authorities that have largely been the main point of contact for early AI governance. As a result of GDPR, he said, “data protection may be an accelerator, may be an entry point for countries in the majority world, because that’s the conversation that we have been having in the last decade, and that’s where resources [and] attention had been moving forward in those countries.” However, he cautioned against using data protection law as the sole basis of AI regulation, because the data protection framework does not necessarily address the full scope of challenges raised by the development of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Mazzini explained that the technical discussions about the EU’s proposed AI legislation date back to 2019. One of the key concerns with a sectoral approach, he said, was the risk of privileging certain sectors over others. The horizontal approach, though, results in added complexity as regulators needed to find regulations that would work across sectors and avoid repetitions; moreover, the scope of EU legislation is limited by the exclusion of national security, military, and defense sectors. While the EU AI Act takes an omnibus approach, Mazzini said it did not make sense to regulate AI as its own technology but rather a general-purpose tool with a variety of applications.</p><p>“What was clear to me since the get-go is that It didn’t make sense to regulate AI as a technology as such, because indeed what we are dealing with is a general purpose technology that has a variety of applications that we don’t even foresee today…” said Mazzini, “…and therefore, from my perspective, the idea to establish rules for the technology as such, regardless of its use, didn’t make any sense…We came up with this approach of establishing rules depending on the specific use to which that account is put, with the greatest burden, from a regulatory point of view, being on the high risk,” which Mazzini outlined to include applications of the technology that are linked to health and safety, including medical devices, automated cars, and&nbsp;drones.</p> Sectoral and Regional Approaches <p>In the U.S. and in the African Union, regulatory agencies have found it more effective to apply existing laws — across data protection, competition, consumer protection, employment, and other sectors — to govern AI, often taking a sectoral approach. Oloyede said that data protection authorities and competition authorities have largely driven the initial AI regulatory agenda, as these authorities are best equipped to enforce consumer protection, data protection, intellectual property, and competition laws as the basis for national AI governance strategies. “We might see some sort of like a clearinghouse model image where not every country in Africa, for example, will try to come up with a specific AI regulation,” Oloyede&nbsp;said.</p><p>Oloyede indicated that the sector-based approach has been dominant on the African continent, with countries including Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda, and Egypt beginning to develop roadmaps for AI governance and establish regulatory task forces. Oloyede said the sectoral approach has allowed regulators to develop specific policies for the deployment of AI in healthcare, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>According to Mason Kortz, this sectoral approach is typically favored in the U.S. because the U.S. regulatory approach values subject-matter expertise over technical expertise. The U.S. will likely have subject-matter experts regulate AI in their own domains, Kortz said — for example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would regulate AI for housing. The U.S. approach relies on the country’s strong administrative state and directs specific federal agencies to take on different pieces of AI regulation. Meanwhile, certain state laws have sought to regulate specific use cases of AI in housing and employment contexts.</p><p>Kortz also noted that the current approach in the U.S. is a confirmation that existing rights-based regimes will be applied or extended to harms resulting from the use of AI systems; with a notoriously slow legislature, he said, only making small changes as needed is an advantageous approach, particularly when existing enforcement agencies may already have the power to make those changes. The U.S. common law system is well-suited to this approach, he said, as it lends judges relatively strong power to reinterpret the law in ways that are binding on lower courts without necessarily having to rewrite civil&nbsp;code.</p><p>“When it comes to some of the more rights-based statutes we have,” Kortz said, “I think, actually, we have a pretty good governance model right there, and we just need some small adjustments around the edges to modernize those statutes and bring them in line, not just with AI, but hopefully, if not future-proof them, at least provide a little more stability for whatever comes next after AI.” However, Kortz allowed that AI is so fundamentally transformative that certain existing laws, such as intellectual property law and copyright doctrine, may not be enough and global harmonization of AI laws should be a priority.</p> Global Collaboration and&nbsp;Capacity <p>Oloyede indicated that African countries have introduced solutions at the level of the Global Privacy Congress, although these solutions will need to reflect differing national and regional interests. Mazzini noted that generative AI and general-purpose AI create additional issues that require international collaboration — fighting misinformation, he said, will require such collaboration. However, de Souza cautioned that regulatory transformation must keep in mind how those laws will be applied in the future. In some cases, he noted, new liability regimes for AI are now stricter than the remaining body of law; Costa Rica, for example, has adopted a strict liability approach for high-risk uses of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>“If we turn out to have the chapters of liability on our AI laws more severe than what we have in our general law for other situations, if we are all in agreement that, in the future, AI is going to be in everything, the legislators that are designing those laws today, they are designing general laws on liability, because we will have AI in almost all sectors,” de Souza remarked. “So the decisions that we’re making today on liability, they might end up scrapping the provisions that you have on your civil code, consumer protection code, because the AI law will be the law that is more recent, more specific, and that may be the one that will be applying in most&nbsp;cases.”</p><p>This international collaboration will require capacity building across the globe, and Mazzini emphasized that the EU AI Act has prompted additional work to support the authorities in the EU that will implement and enforce the regulation. Although the AI Act will impact multiple private sectors, he said, its public enforcement will require both financial and knowledge-based resources. De Souza noted that the Brussels Effect will prompt a need for global bureaucracy to support global compliance with the EU AI Act, and well-resourced national authorities are needed to support that implementation. Oloyede, however, said that lessons learned from the GDPR rollout may inform a better approach to implementing the EU AI Act with a more nuanced understanding of the local context. While the EU AI Act will require capacity building to support new governance bodies with funding and resources, he said, it is essential to preserve existing collaborations with data protection and competition authorities and empower those authorities to address AI in their own&nbsp;domains.</p><p>Despite different countries taking more sectoral versus horizontal approaches, the global community is working to establish flexible approaches to AI governance in their respective regions. As Oloyede said, “AI is here today. Tomorrow is going to be a different technology. And we can’t keep legislating for every new technology that we have.” Mazzini described a need for international coordination when he said, “when it comes to this new type of AI that is sometimes is called ‘generative AI’ or ‘general purpose AI’ that we have specifically regulated in the EU — notably in the last few weeks, in final stages of the negotiations — I think I would like to see there certainly more international coordination, because there we are dealing with a number of questions that I think are pretty common across jurisdictions.”</p><p>Though approaches across the globe may be different, a common cross-cutting theme of the work is balance: protecting rights versus supporting innovation, legislating a critical technology while its capacity and impact is still developing, and providing necessary limitations while allowing nimble innovation.</p><p>The <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Network of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers (NoC)</a> is a collaborative initiative among academic institutions with a focus on interdisciplinary research on the development, social impact, policy implications, and legal issues concerning the Internet. The Berkman Klein Center at Harvard University served as NoC Secretariat from 2020–2023 and continues to participate in cross-national, cross-disciplinary conversation, debate, teaching, learning, and engagement.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/global-ai-regulation-protecting-rights-leveraging-collaboration-b0da8e6a704d">Global AI Regulation: Protecting Rights; Leveraging Collaboration</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>Dear Edge Community,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to adapt to the industry changes brought about by VMware’s acquisition by Broadcom, I want to share some important updates and reaffirm our dedication to assisting you through these transitions.</p>
<p>Pricing Changes Post-Acquisition: Following Broadcom’s post-acquisition adjustments to VMware’s licensing, contracting, and operational model, Edge will no longer manage an Enterprise Licensing Agreement (ELA) on behalf of our members. As a result, Edge will not be responsible for negotiating pricing, co-terming licensing dates, or participating in the quoting and billing process.</p>
<p>VMware Horizon Update: VMware Horizon is becoming a new organization, separate from VMware/Broadcom, called Omnissa. Licensing for Horizon must be procured separately from VMware and can also be fulfilled by partners like Carahsoft.</p>
<p>What This Means for Members:</p>
<p>Members will need to procure Broadcom/VMware licensing through standard reseller channels. Discounting will be determined by negotiations between each member and Broadcom/the reseller.</p>
<p>Edge still has procurement vehicles available for members to quickly process orders. These include:</p>
 
 The EdgeMarket TeCHS contract, fulfilled by SHI. 
 Other preferred resellers through our convenience contract via Carahsoft. 
 
<p>Additionally, Carahsoft will continue to assist the VMware reseller community in preparing your pricing and quotes.</p>

<p>What forms of pAI—personal AI—are Apple, Mozilla, Google, Meta, Microsoft and the rest not doing?</p>
<p>Let’s look at those first two because they’re at the top of the news LIFO buffer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> (“coming in beta this fall<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/?cid=wwa-us-kwbi-features-slid--Brand-AppleIntellligence-Announce-&amp;mtid=20925e1t39169&amp;aosid=p238&amp;mnid=nHJFhcGO-dc_mtid_20925e1t39169_pcrid_78134256302923_pgrid_1250146041615591_&amp;msclkid=fb43aa7f55c8150c7b4ecc171ee3e360#footnote-1">*</a>“), announced yesterday, will help you with writing and creating images while giving you less lame answers from Siri. (Which they should re-name. Siri is Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/?cid=wwa-us-kwbi-features-slid--Brand-AppleIntellligence-Announce-&amp;mtid=20925e1t39169&amp;aosid=p238&amp;mnid=nHJFhcGO-dc_mtid_20925e1t39169_pcrid_78134256302923_pgrid_1250146041615591_&amp;msclkid=fb43aa7f55c8150c7b4ecc171ee3e360#footnote-1">Clippy</a>.) It “can draw on larger server-based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests for you while protecting your privacy.” The “larger models” will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24174786/apple-openai-partnership-chatgpt-wwdc">white-labeled ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://x.com/maxwinebach/status/1800277157135909005">plus Apple’s own small language models</a> (SLMs).</p>
<p>Mozilla, which <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/mozilla-signs-lucrative-3-year-google-search-deal-for-firefox">got $400+ million a year from Google (for search in the Firefox browser) starting in 2020</a>, announce on June 3 that they will be <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-builders-accelerator/">Building open, private AI with the Mozilla Builders Accelerator</a>. Jive:</p>
<blockquote><p>This program is designed to empower independent AI and machine learning engineers with the resources and support they need to thrive. It aims to cultivate a more innovative AI ecosystem, and it’s one of&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozillas-biggest-ai-moments/">Mozilla’s key initiatives</a>&nbsp;to make AI meaningfully impactful — alongside efforts like&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.ai/">Mozilla.ai</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-responsible-ai-challenge/">Responsible AI Challenge</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-rise25-ai-nominations/">Rise25 Awards</a>.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Builders Accelerator’s inaugural theme is local AI, which involves running AI models and applications directly on personal devices like laptops, smartphones, or edge devices rather than depending on cloud-based services…</p>
<p>We chose Local AI as the theme for the Accelerator’s first cohort because it aligns with our core values of privacy, user empowerment, and open source innovation. This method offers several benefits including:</p>
 
 Privacy:&nbsp;Data stays on the local device, minimizing exposure to potential breaches and misuse. 
 Agency:&nbsp;Users have greater control over their AI tools and data. 
 Cost-effectiveness:&nbsp;Reduces reliance on expensive cloud infrastructure, lowering costs for developers and users. 
 Reliability:&nbsp;Local processing ensures continuous operation even without internet connectivity. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Looks to me like both of these are Big AI writ small. It’s “local,” not personal. It’s made to serve your needs with what BigAI offers through APIs. It is still essentially AIaaS (AI as a Service), rather than truly personal AI (pAI): <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">personalized</a> more than personal.</p>
<p>That’s also what I see when I read between the lines at <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/">Mozilla’s AI job openings</a>. Take <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/jobs/4357000007">platform engineer</a>. This person will (among other things), “assist in managing and orchestrating workloads across multiple cloud providers.” That’s fine. I’m sure true pAIs will do that too. But most of pAI will be more personal than that. It will deal with the mundanities of your everyday life. Not with coughing up answers that can only come from AIaaSes.</p>
<p>The problem with personalizing AI giant offerings is that they are large language models (LLM) trained on everything that can be crawled on the Internet, plus who knows what else. Not on your truly personal stuff. This is why “prompt engineering” worthy of the noun is ” <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04444">not for anybody</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prompt engineering is crucial for deploying LLMs but is poorly understood mathematically. We formalize LLM systems as a class of discrete stochastic dynamical systems to explore prompt engineering through the lens of control theory. We investigate the reachable set of output token sequences $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ for which there exists a control input sequence $\mathbf u$ for each $\mathbf y \in R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ that steers the LLM to output $\mathbf y$ from initial state sequence $\mathbf x_0$. We offer analytic analysis on the limitations on the controllability of self-attention in terms of reachable set, where we prove an upper bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ as a function of the singular values of the parameter matrices. We present complementary empirical analysis on the controllability of a panel of LLMs, including Falcon-7b, Llama-7b, and Falcon-40b. Our results demonstrate a lower bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ w.r.t. initial state sequences $\mathbf x_0$ sampled from the Wikitext dataset. We find that the correct next Wikitext token following sequence $\mathbf x_0$ is reachable over 97% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. We also establish that the top 75 most likely next tokens, as estimated by the LLM itself, are reachable at least 85% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. Intriguingly, short prompt sequences can dramatically alter the likelihood of specific outputs, even making the least likely tokens become the most likely ones. This control-centric analysis of LLMs demonstrates the significant and poorly understood role of input sequences in steering output probabilities, offering a foundational perspective for enhancing language model system capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>But all that stuff applies mostly when we’re prompting a big LLM system.</p>
<p>What about using AI in our own lives, where the data that matters most are in our calendars, contacts, financial and health records, our travels, our correspondence (email, chat, whatever)? And how about all the location data we might get from our cars, phone apps, and phone companies? These should be much easier for a pAI to gather, examine, and help us do useful things. Caring about much less data also means a pAI will be less likely to give wrong (hallucinated) answers.</p>
<p>Today the mental frame almost everybody uses for AI is the Big kind, ingesting everything they can get their crawlers on, and munching all of it in giant compute farms. Those systems are great for lots of stuff, but they still don’t deal with personal data listed in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>Look at it this way. For each of us, there are three data pools:</p>
 
 The entire Net, which is what gets crawled by all the giant LLM operators, plus whatever else they can get their claws on. 
 One’s personal life, some of which is digitized in useful form (contacts, calendar, mail, stuff in folders inside PCs and attached drives).

<p>Two predominant themes stood out at last week’s Identiverse 2024 conference in Las Vegas. First, there was the issue of how to defend against rapidly evolving advances in deepfakes, especially for live remote verification. Second, there was a common assumption that widespread adoption of passkeys is right around the corner, and that organizations must prepare to manage and secure passkeys when they become mainstream.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO Andrew Shikiar touched on both topics in a session Wednesday (May 29) titled “<a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089529/">FIDO, Passkeys and the State of Passwordless</a>.”</p>



<p>He announced the alliance’s new certification standard for facial-recognition technologies. The first (and so far only) organization to receive that certification is iProov. In a <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089484/">keynote address</a> Thursday (May 30), Shikiar added that the FIDO Alliance was ready to offer independent testing of facial-recognition technologies.</p>



<p>As for passkeys, the passwordless, FIDO-certified PKI-based WebAuthn credentials that reside on hardware keys, smartphones, PCs and in the cloud, Shikiar said the question was not if consumers would adopt them, but when.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s goal is “to make passkeys inevitable,” Shikiar said. No one at Identiverse expressed any doubt that they would be.</p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> announced <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-14-projects-worldwide/">a Bitcoin Development Fund grant</a> to Blockchain Common for its continued support of the development of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST</a>, including holding <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/#upcoming-events">two more virtual FROST meetings for the developer community</a>.</p>

<p>FROST is a powerful quorum threshold signature scheme built using Schnorr signatures that offers many advantages over existing signature methodologies. That includes crucial integration with Distributed Key Generation: private keys can be created in pieces by discrete online servers, with no server ever having the whole key. Altogether, FROST can improve privacy, resilience, and security alike, making it truly a next-generation key-management system.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has long looked forward to the mainstream deployment of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Schnorr</a> and FROST because of their considerable benefits over traditional key-management and signature schemes. We held out first <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">FROST Implementer’s Round Table</a> in 2023 to give FROST library implementers and cryptographers a chance to talk with each other, and we were asked to do more. We also hosted a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/summary/">FROST Developer’s Meeting</a> this year where we worked with Jesse Posner to offer wallet developers a look at what the future of FROST means.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is thrilled by HRF’s recognition of our work. Their funding makes it possible to continue this work this year: we’ll be hosting a second round table for FROST library implementers &amp; cryptographers on September 18, then a second meeting for wallet developers on December 4. If you’re a cryptographer or library implementer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#frost-implementers">FROST implementer’s list</a> and if you’re a wallet developer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers">Gordian developer’s list</a> to receive the announcements on these events. Admission is free thanks to the support of HRF!</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has also placed FROST on our developmental road map for the year, to consider incorporating it our reference code and tools. More details as additional funding and our schedule firm up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, put September 18 and/or December 4 on your calendars so that you can join Blockchain Commons for these important events that will unveil the future of multi-party signatures and key management.</p>

<p>Alan Mayo goes beyond digital identity to consider identity in person, online, and by telephone. He has developed a structured way of describing identity that has, until now, been severely lacking. Alan questions the currently accepted status quo, suggesting that we will need to pass through an Identity 2.5 phase before reaching Identity 3.0.</p>



<p>With topics from verifiable credentials and passkeys to digital wallets and identity ecosystems, you can find Alan’s Digital Identity newsletters <a href="https://www.newsletters.identity25.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>An innovative collaboration has emerged in the AI sector, as <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a>, a leading AI platform developer headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, and Trace Labs, the core development company of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a>, based in Hong Kong, have just announced a strategic partnership aimed at supporting the development of the Knowledge Layer — the Internet of Knowledge.</p><p>This partnership signifies that two prominent players in the AI industry have come together to support a decentralized ecosystem where AI agents and infrastructure partners collaborate within the decentralized knowledge graph (DKG) landscape.</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to building a Verifiable Internet for AI, and this partnership marks the beginning of their collaboration with SingularityNET’s leading AI platform and robust ecosystem.</p><p>In some of the key highlights of this partnership, Trace Labs is tasked with developing sophisticated infrastructure that allows for efficient access and retrieval of information stored on the DKG, tackling challenges of AI hallucinations, bias, and model collapse due to an explosion in the amount of synthetic data produced by AI. This effort is aimed at enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of the decentralized knowledge graph within the OriginTrail network.</p><p>SingularityNET will then provide users access to its decentralized platform, where specialized AI models and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be purchased and used for data analysis. These models are designed to operate seamlessly with the data supported by the OriginTrail network, fostering a more robust ecosystem. The company will also develop AI models that can be trained directly on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph. This approach helps realize the shared vision of the two partners; eliminating the need for data centralization, and leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain to enhance privacy and security.</p><p>Leveraging SingularityNET’s leading position in mission-critical research of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Trace Labs’ experience in commercializing Web3 and AI solutions, the strategic partnership is in particular aimed at solving the real world challenges with decentralized AI within the key sectors, such as Industry 4.0, decentralized science (DeSci), real world assets (RWA), and education.</p><p>Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET, stated, “As we move from an Internet of documents, media and apps to an internet of knowledge and AI, the basic composition of the Internet as a ‘decentralized network of decentralized networks’ becomes ever more important. Both SingularityNET and Trace Labs have powerful capability to grow decentralized networks around knowledge graphs and associated AI capabilities; connecting these networks together into a cross-linked, cross-token meta-network will yield a host of different synergies enabling a broad-based boost in intelligent functionality. As a practical example: Putting together a subgraph of OriginTrail’s DKG decentralized knowledge graph covering shipping logistics, with a knowledge meta-graph living in the OpenCog Hyperon system deployed on SingularityNET covering the timing of events in various markets, one could achieve an unprecedented level of emergent knowledge in the minds of AI agents carrying out supply-chain planning and forecasting. SingularityNET’s new MeTTa-Motto tool integrating Hyperon symbolic AI with LLMs and other deep neural nets could play a critical role here. Similar examples exist in every vertical market, which gives this partnership an almost unbounded potential for economic benefit and human&nbsp;good.”</p><p>Žiga Drev, Managing Director of Trace Labs, added, “The benefits of AI are limitless and so are the risks, like hallucinations and model collapse as the growth in synthetic data outpaces the provision of real world data. A truly open AI that fosters inclusion and a more equitable distribution of value can only be achieved through a collaborative and modular approach. We are proud to partner with SingularityNet, founded and led by the visionary Dr. Ben Goertzel, who coined the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Working alongside the leading visionaries at the convergence of crypto and AI opens exciting opportunities to accelerate real-world adoption of neuro-symbolic AI, combining the power of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and SingularityNET’s specialized marketplace for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI&nbsp;models.”</p><p>Both organizations will also engage in collaborative marketing and social media efforts to promote their partnership and the innovations it brings to the blockchain world, the AI industry, and the intersection of these two sectors. The two partners are also mutually exploring and plan to integrate AI services into Trace Labs’ DKG and paranets.</p><p>The partnership is about working together today to solve the challenges of tomorrow; synergizing blockchains and knowledge graphs for safe, verifiable AI that emphasizes secure and privacy-preserving mechanisms for user authentication and authorization within the knowledge layer, and ultimately ensuring all data processing by users is rooted in their&nbsp;consent.</p> About SingularityNET <p><a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a> was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel with the mission of creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI is not dependent on any central entity, is open to anyone and is not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country. The SingularityNET team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers. Our core platform and AI teams are further complemented by specialized teams devoted to application areas such as finance, robotics, biomedical AI, media, arts and entertainment.</p> About OriginTrail <p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> is an ecosystem building a Verifiable Internet for AI, providing an inclusive framework that tackles the world’s challenges in the AI era, such as hallucinations, bias, and model collapse, by ensuring the provenance and verifiability of data used by AI systems. OriginTrail is used by global leaders like the British Standards Institution, Swiss Federal Railways, Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN), representing over 40% of US imports and several consortia funded by the European Union among others. Advised by Turing award winner Dr. Bob Metcalfe, renowned for his law of network effects, the Trace Labs team (OriginTrail core developers) plays a crucial role in promoting a more inclusive, transparent, and decentralized AI.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/singularitynet-and-origintrail-advancing-decentralized-knowledge-graphs-5bd74f029801">SingularityNET and OriginTrail: Advancing Decentralized Knowledge Graphs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the 4th edition of CeramicWorld! Last month has been busy with new features and developments happening across the Ceramic ecosystem. Here’s a TL;DR for what has happened:</p>  Ceramic released an a new library for building points on Ceramic  Index is making strides in powering decentralized AI  Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is moving away from IPFS pubsub  Ceramic’s Data Feed API is here    A new library for building points on Ceramic has dropped 🔥 <p>Ceramic core team has just released the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramic-solutions/points?activeTab=versions&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">points library</a>, designed to facilitate developers in initiating experimentation with reputation systems on Ceramic and accelerating iteration. The points library serves various use cases, including implementing rewards for community engagement, incentivizing collaboration, or facilitating community quests and educational initiatives.</p><p>As an illustration of its functionality, the Points library has been integrated into the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Sandbox</a>. By following the steps outlined in the Sandbox, you can earn your first points, stored on Ceramic! 🔥</p><p>And that’s not all. In addition to the points library, there is also a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/demo/fullstack-app?ref=blog.ceramic.network">points demo application</a> that you can use as the basis of your own project. This example app showcases how the points library can be utilized to incentivize community members for their engagement, such as participation on key social platforms. To learn more, check out the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/web3-points-library-tutorial/">comprehensive tutorial</a>, and watch the accompanying video walkthrough:</p> <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/libraries/points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Start building with points library</a>   Powering Decentralized AI with Composable&nbsp;Data <p><a href="https://index.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index</a>, a composable discovery protocol, is revolutionizing web discovery by empowering users to curate personalized search engines, known as indexes, tailored to their specific needs.</p><p>Built on Ceramic's decentralized graph database, <a href="https://mirror.xyz/indexnetwork.eth/pETWkxZcN3OW0fUWohAo6vAh4IPqfnF6h5v9O-Pwi_k?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index is driving decentralized AI</a>. It leverages a decentralized semantic index, utilizing ComposeDB, to enable semantic interoperability and a highly relational composition of use cases. By integrating AI-based discovery functions with Ceramic's decentralized network, Index ensures data integrity, privacy, and personalized discovery experiences across peers, mitigating privacy risks associated with centralized systems. This interconnected approach fosters a discovery experience where responses are both personalized and trusted, exemplified by a chat setup drawing from both community and private indexes.</p><p>Today, Index network is partnering with a number of projects in the ecosystem, including Ceramic, Lit Protocol, Fluence, Disco, Intuition Systems, Verax, and Olas Network, among others.</p><p>Just a few days ago Index team <a href="https://docs.index.network/docs/resources/libraries/langchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">announced the collaboration with LangChainAI</a> which enables developers to seamlessly build their composable semantic indexes with LangChain's suite of LLM pipelines. The new integration is supported in both Python and JavaScript.</p> <a href="https://index.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Explore the Index Network</a>   Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is moving away from IPFS pubsub<br><br>Earlier this month, the core Ceramic team shared an update regarding the work that has been done to enhance Ceramic network's reliability, scalability, and performance, particularly focusing on the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS). As the team is approaching the release of Ceramic’s Recon protocol, CAS is transitioning away from using IPFS pubsub to synchronize Streams in Ceramic. To facilitate this, a new HTTP-based mechanism has been developed for sharing Time Events from CAS to Ceramic nodes. This eliminates the dependency of newer Ceramic nodes on IPFS pubsub.<br><br>To ensure seamless data delivery and prevent potential data loss, it's crucial for all Ceramic nodes to be upgraded to at least v5.3. Learn more <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/upgrade-your-ceramic-node-to-v5-3-before-the-6th-of-may/1563?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.    New Ceramic features: SET Account Relations, Immutable Fields and shouldIndex flag<br><br>Earlier this month, a set of new features providing a sophisticated toolkit for data management, have been added to Ceramic. More specifically, you can now use the following tools to build your applications:<br>- <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#model-to-model">SET account relation</a>&nbsp;- enabling users to enforce a constraint where each user account (or DID) can create only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.<br>- <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/schemas?ref=blog.ceramic.network#type-validation-directives">Immutable fields</a>&nbsp;- allow specific data to be prevented from being altered.<br>- <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#removerestore-record-from-index">shouldIndex flag</a>&nbsp;- gives developers an option to manage the data visibility by choosing which fields should be indexed.<br><br>Learn more about these features in a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/exploring-ceramics-new-features-set-account-relations-immutable-fields-and-should-index-flag/">written tutorial </a>and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2BRQqPI354&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">video walkthrough</a>.    Data Feed API is here!<br><br>Data Feed API is finally out. The new Data Feed API formalizes the underlying Ceramic event streaming protocol and allows developers to build data(base) products using raw event streams.<br><br>The release finalises the initial stage of implementation of Data Feed API with additional features and improvements coming in the near future.

<p>Face Verification Certification launched to bring confidence to ID ecosystem among rising online identity theft and bias concerns&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>May 29, 2024 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today the launch of the first globally available certification program to test and certify the performance of remote biometric identity verification technology when verifying a user against a trusted identity document for accuracy, liveness, and bias. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a> program comes at a time of soaring demand for face biometric identity solutions and recognition of the importance of robust enrollment and identity re-binding processes to the overall security of online accounts. <a href="https://www.iproov.com/liveness-detection">Dynamic Liveness</a>, the science powering the <a href="https://www.iproov.com">iProov</a> Biometric Solution Suite’s Remote Onboarding Solution and Authentication Solution, is the first product to pass the rigorous certification testing.</p>



<p>The certification program, consisting of 10,000 tests at a minimum, assesses a biometric system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender. It measures resistance to spoof and deepfake attacks with Imposter Attack Presentation Accept Rate (IAPAR), and also assesses the usability and security of solutions by measuring False Reject and Accept Rates (FRR and FAR respectively). The certification also tests “selfie match” capabilities to ensure a user’s “selfie” matches their government-issued ID in the initial account setup process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combating bias and deepfake threats in biometric ID systems</p>



<p>Biometrics has <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Authenticate-2023-Barometer-Report.pdf">ranked top as global consumers’ preferred way to log in</a> and the method they think is most secure for the last two years. However, as governments and businesses globally roll out remote identity solutions, two urgent issues remain to address – bias in some biometric systems and new security threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations including NIST have been closely <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software">monitoring the disparities in performance for some time</a> – with NIST’s most recent <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_demographics.html">evaluation of solutions across different demographics</a> ​​released this year. The issue of bias is tightly linked to brand reputation too; new research from FIDO Alliance released today has found 50% of American and British consumers said they would lose trust in an organization if its biometric system was found to be biased, while 22% said they’d stop using a service entirely. Similarly, generative AI’s boom has also heightened security apprehensions about online verification; the same survey revealed over a third of consumers (37%) are more concerned about verifying themselves online due to the rising number of deepfakes. In ENISA’s latest remote ID report, researchers observed that while deepfake injection attacks are increasing and more sophisticated, deepfake presentation and injection attacks remain the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/remote-id-proofing-good-practices">top two biometric attack types most difficult to mitigate</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bringing trust to the ID ecosystem</p>



<p>Commenting on the news, Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CEO of the FIDO Alliance, said: “Remote identity solutions unlock huge benefits for governments, organizations, and consumers alike, but as appetite grows across the globe, there are understandable concerns mixed with excitement. Identity theft is rising, while bias in biometric systems has caused organizations to delay or reconsider implementations at a time when inclusivity and accessibility have never been more important.</p>



<p>“Certification unlocks the power of open standards and catalyzes ecosystem-wide innovation and opportunity. With iProov’s market-first certification for biometric face verification now completed, we look forward to serving additional providers who understand the value of independent, accredited lab testing. This new certification program provides a launchpad that enables all stakeholders to fast-track deployments that are robust enough for the modern threat landscape and work well for everyone, anywhere in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leading biometrics solutions provider, iProov, has become the first vendor to complete the rigorous certification process. iProov provides market-leading biometric solutions that protect the world’s most security-conscious organizations from deepfakes and other types of identity fraud. Andrew Bud, founder and CEO at iProov said: “Biometrics are a powerful tool that organizations can utilize to facilitate secure, inclusive, and user-friendly interactions online. Each of these three fundamental components must be given equal consideration as organizations evaluate their options. With the FIDO Face Verification Certification program, organizations now have a trusted compass for navigating these decisions. We applaud The FIDO Alliance for addressing the importance of biometric identity verification to strengthen the full user identity lifecycle. Independent certification creates a much-needed quality benchmark for this evolving technology and further demonstrates our ability to provide trusted identity assurance in an age of AI threats and identity fraud.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing requirements are built upon proven ISO standards and are developed by a diverse international authority of stakeholders, including industry, government, and independent subject matter experts. Participating vendors can benefit from identifying gaps in product performance and demonstrating clearly to the market their solutions can be trusted, which can reduce individual testing needs and boost adoption. Two independent labs are currently accredited to support this certification – <a href="https://ingeniumbiometrics.com/">Ingenium Biometrics</a> and <a href="https://www.tuvit.de/">TÜV Informationstechnik (TÜV NORD GROUP)</a> – with more expected to follow later this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program expands upon the Alliance’s existing <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">Biometric Component Certification</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/document-authenticity/">Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification</a> programs and demonstrates FIDO’s ongoing commitment to meet marketplace demand and address evolving threats with third-party certifications. Combined, these programs provide unrivaled end-to-end assurance to implementing organizations, consumers and vendors and support the world’s migration to more secure digital verification systems and passwordless security.</p>

<p>May 29, 2024 – The FIDO Alliance today released new design guidelines to help accelerate <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">passkey adoption</a> and deployment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Design Guidelines aim to help online service providers design a better, more consistent user experience (UX) when signing in with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guidelines are developed for designers, engineers, product managers, content strategists, and UX researchers to use for reference and guide their initial implementation of passkeys and expansion of passkey support over time.</p>



<p>The new guidelines are available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines">https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As organizations are increasingly deploying passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards around the world, the end users of passkeys – along with the practitioners implementing them – have become top priorities for successful adoption,” said Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CEO of The FIDO Alliance. “Our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/content-ebook-consumer-password-and-passkey-trends-wpd-2024/">research</a> shows consumers and employees are adopting phishing-resistant passkeys at a rapid pace while relying organizations are experiencing cost savings and fewer security incidents.&nbsp; By continuing our investment in the evolving user experience, the FIDO Alliance is committed to ensuring brands have a consistent and accessible set of guidelines that are fully aligned with design best practices and FIDO technology requirements. We encourage online service providers everywhere to use these publicly available guidelines to enhance the user experience and enjoy greater success with FIDO passkey deployment and adoption.”</p>



<p>Following the first release of FIDO UX guidelines for passkeys in 2022, the 2024 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines/">Design Guidelines</a> have been updated with optimization included for service providers evaluating and deploying passkeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2024 Design Guidelines are organized into five sections to provide clear guidance, confirm design principles, and offer flexibility:</p>



 
 User experience research: Provides confidence that the guidelines are informed by design research 



 Principles: 10 UX principles and 3 content principles for passkeys that are core to any passkey implementation 



 “Get started” design patterns: Patterns are the heart of the guidelines, containing self-contained experiences that can be combined to match unique business needs 



 Optional design patterns: Patterns that can be added after the “get started” patterns over time 



 Resources: Provides additional resources like events, Figma UI kits and community groups to jump-start work with passkeys 
 



<p>The FIDO UX Working Group created the guidelines and comprises 131 UX researchers, designers, and PMs from 31 global brands. The guidelines were created in partnership with usability research firm Blink UX – with added underwriting support from 1Password, Dashlane, Google, HID, Trusona, U.S. Bank, and Yubico.</p>

 How can we verify users are genuine in an online world? 



<p>Online identity theft has steadily risen in recent years, while the generative AI boom has driven a new wave of deepfake-powered attacks that threaten remote enrollment and identity security. Meanwhile, bias in biometric systems has been monitored for some time, varying significantly across solutions and impacting consumer trust and perception of the technology.</p>



<p>As the adoption of remote identity verification technology rises, two critical concerns and challenges need to be addressed: bias and new security threats.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance recently sponsored an independent study of 2,000 respondents across the U.S. and the U.K. to understand consumer perception towards remote identity verification, online security, and biometrics. This eBook reveals those insights on remote biometric face verification, including how many people have used biometric face recognition successfully, and their opinions on verification accuracy, potential discrimination, and concerns about deepfakes.</p>



 Key findings 



 
 Consumers want to use biometrics to verify themselves online more, especially in sensitive use cases like financial services – where one out of two people said they would use biometric technology (48%). 



 One in four feel they experience regular discrimination when using automated facial biometric systems (25%). 



 Equity in biometric systems is vital to trust – with half saying they would lose trust in a brand or institution (50%), with one out of five saying they’d stop using a service entirely if found to have a biased biometric system (22%). 



 Over half of respondents are concerned about deepfakes when verifying identities online (52%). 
 



<p>Read the full results of the survey in this eBook and learn about these consumers’ experiences with biometric face verification technologies, and discover how organizations can improve global digital access, authentication, and security when leveraging these remote identity verification technologies.</p>

<p>IDunion SCE, the neutral and democratically organised European cooperative created from the IDunion research consortium, has been offering their managed network infrastructure for industrial and productive use since April 2024.</p>

<p>As a neutral basic infrastructure, the distributed and redundant network enables every company to independently store and manage identity information and all types of company-related data. Companies can store unique and distinctive company identity-related identifiers (DID – Decentralised Identifier) on the IDunion network, which are permanent, unchangeable and verifiable and do not require the use of a central register. The identifiers can be linked to user-defined company data or company attributes. All company data can be managed according to predefined parameters and can of course also be revoked. IDunion SCE makes the identifiers available to companies as required and assigns corresponding write authorisations for network use on an individual contractual basis.</p>

<p>The network is based on the open source software Hyperledger Indy. All network nodes are operated exclusively by cooperative members in accordance with the principles of the IDunion SCE and monitored by the latter as a neutral body. The IDunion SCE and the infrastructures it manages and supports are subject to the principles of openness, neutrality, sovereignty, transparency, integrity and cooperative competition. All members of the cooperative have the same voting rights, regardless of their company size. This ensures that all participating companies can have an equal influence on the technical and organised development of the IDunion SCE and thus the ecosystem. Companies can join the European co-operative as members at any time.</p>

<p>Visa has introduced <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> to the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkey-use-case/payments/">payment industry</a>, enabling customers to authorize online purchases <a href="https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2024/05/14/the-key-to-1715698035525.html?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=VisaPaymentPasskey&amp;utm_id=VPF&amp;linkId=431538864">through a biometric scan</a> on their smartphones or computers when making a purchase online.</p>



<p>This capability is powered by the Visa Payment Passkey Service, which is built on Visa’s Fast Identity Online (FIDO) server. The service allows merchants to integrate the Visa Payment Passkey Service into their checkout systems without needing to establish their own servers, thereby simplifying the setup process.</p>



<p>For users, this means they can use the same biometric authentication methods they use to unlock their devices to approve Visa payments online, with a one-time enrollment required during checkout. Visa also plans to extend enrollment options to banking apps in the future.</p>



<p>The development of passkeys was a collaborative effort among major technology companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, which joined forces around 2012 to form the FIDO Alliance. This group aimed to overcome the limitations of traditional passwords by creating <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-overview/">open standards</a> for more robust authentication, involving biometric experts like HYPR and Nok Nok Labs.</p>



<p>FIDO released its first standards in 2014, setting the stage for authentication methods that do not depend on passwords. Subsequent advancements led to the establishment of the WebAuthn standard in 2019, which quickly gained acceptance among major web browsers. This progress facilitated the creation of passkeys, leveraging FIDO protocols to link authentication credentials to users’ mobile <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">biometrics</a>.</p>



<p>Visa’s recent move has been welcomed by supporters of FIDO and passkeys. HYPR’s co-founder and CEO, Bojan Simic, commented on this development, stating that nearly every regulated business he has interacted with in the past year has included a passkey initiative in their plans in an online post. “I’m so proud of the work that we have all done at the FIDO Alliance to make this a reality. When we wrote the first FIDO implementation in 2014 here at HYPR, seeing the top brands adopt the standard in a major way seemed like fantasy.”</p>



<p>In making this vision a reality, Visa joins several other prominent companies that have recently introduced support for passkeys, including PayPal, Samsung, and Amazon.</p>

<p>Spring conference season is in full swing and the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) is heading to Europe to participate in several major conferences:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) </a>— June 4-7, Berlin, Germany 



 <a href="https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/identity-week/">Identity Week Europe </a>— June 11-12, Amsterdam, Netherlands 



 <a href="https://diceurope.org/">Digital Identity unConference Europe (DICE</a>) — June 18-20, Zurich, Switzerland.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>We will also be attending the second regional summit of the <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/about-sidi/">Sustainable &amp; Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI)</a> Summit 2024 series.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP, which celebrates its fourth birthday this month, has long been known for its dual stack that emphasizes why we must combine technical interoperability with governance interoperability in order to establish truly interoperable digital trust ecosystems.</p>







<p>Although in our early history we were best known for our work on the governance side of the dual stack, at these June conferences our emphasis will be on two new technical specifications for which we just published Implementers Drafts: the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/11/toip-announces-the-first-implementers-draft-of-the-trust-spanning-protocol-specification/">Trust Spanning Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/03/toip-announces-the-implementers-draft-of-thetrust-registry-protocol-specification-v2-0/">Trust Registries Protocol</a>. Both of these protocols are designed to maximize interoperability and authenticity and minimize risk, while still enabling each ecosystem to make the choices they need for their specific context.</p>



<p>The following is a schedule of all the conference sessions and talks in which ToIP members or our partners will be participating.</p>



 



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join us at EIC for a panel of ToIP Steering Committee Members, moderated by Executive Director, Judith Fleenor.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5643/1">Panel: The Emerging Trust Layer for the Internet: Using Minimum Viable Protocols to Achieve Maximum Interoperability</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 13:30—14:30</p>



<p>Interoperability is not created alone and that is why ToIP collaborates with other standards organizations and certifications bodies.&nbsp; Executive Director, Judith Fleenor has invited the Executive Directors from <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> to unpack the role each foundation plays, how we collaborate to create the full picture for digital trust, and why it is so important for organizations and individuals to support and participate in several foundations, not just one.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5709/1">Panel: Executive Directors Speak: Why We Need More Collaboration</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 14:30—15:30</p>



<p>At last year’s EIC Judith gave a keynote on <a href="https://youtu.be/Hhv5-xbcmkw">Decentralized Identity Why is it all the rage?</a>&nbsp; Her premise was that the technologies that enable decentralized identity could be used, not only for traditional identity and access management, but more importantly for content authenticity and to assist in the challenges that AI brings.&nbsp; This year, Al will be a big topic at EIC, and several ToIP Steering Committee members will be addressing these topics in various sessions throughout the week.</p>



<p>On Wednesday Wenjing Chu, Futurewei Technologies and Drummond Reed, Gen Digital will be on the panel:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 12:00—13:00</p>



<p>Following that Wenjing Chu will be giving the session:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5551/1">Decentralizing AI: A Socio-Technical Path to Responsible and Trustworthy Tech</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 14:30—15:00</p>



<p>Continuing in the AI track, Wenjing will be joining by others for the following panel discussion:</p>

<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 15:00—15:30</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5557/1">Charting the Course: Diverse Approaches to AI Regulation in a Fractured World</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 15:30—16:10</p>



<p>AI isn’t the only opportunity vs threat we are facing in the near future.&nbsp; Quantum Computing is coming as well.&nbsp; Also, on Wednesday, Steve McCown, Anonyome Labs, will be giving a presentation:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5567/3">Post Quantum Security: Cryptography in Decentralized Identity</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 18:10—18:30</p>



<p>Another big topic at EIC will be the use of verifiable credentials and the digital wallets that hold them. Several sessions will explore these topics and give real word examples of their use in productions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Wednesday Marie Wallece. Accenture, and Drummond Reed, GenDigital, will be joined by others for a panel:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5553/2">Real-World Examples of How Smart Wallets will Transform how we <br>Navigate our Digital World</a>

<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 10:30—11:10</p>



<p>The above session will explore real world solutions being used now, but before selecting which technologies to use for your ecosystem and wallets, it is important to know the differences each technology solution has to offer.&nbsp; Our friends at the Open Wallet Foundation (OWF) have put together a guide to help explain wallet security.&nbsp; Daniel Bachenheimer, Accenture, will present with another OWF board member on:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5598/1">Open Wallet Foundation (OWF) Guide to Safe Digital Wallet Selection</a> 



<p>Thursday, June 06, 2024 12:00—12:20</p>



<p>Daniel will deepen the conversation about Digital Wallets in his Friday session on how you bind a wallet to the natural person who’s credentials it holds:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5637/1">Digital Wallet Holder Binding</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 11:30—11:50</p>

  You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android. But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s.

<p>You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android.</p>
<p>But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s.</p>
<p>How about one for you, that runs on your machine but is entirely yours? Let’s call it a Personal OS, or a POS.</p>
<p>The POS will have a kernel onto which abilities (not just applications) can be added. An extreme example of how this might work is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94">Neo learning ju jitsu</a> in The Matrix:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94"></a></p>
<p>That OS amplified&nbsp;Neo’s own intelligence, in his own head. We’re far from that today. But we can at least add abilities to a POS of our own. Those too can give us more agency of many kinds.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there is only one POS so far. It’s called <a href="https://paios.org/">pAI-OS</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pAI-OS/paios">Github code</a>), and it’s led by <a href="https://kwaai.ai">Kwaai</a>.* To my knowledge, pAI-OS is the first and only truly personal operating system. (If others do the same, let me know and I’ll talk those up too.) And it is built to run our own AIs. Let’s call them PAIs, where the A can mean amplified or augmented (<a href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/">sourcing Doug Englebart</a> for the latter).</p>
<p>So, what kind of abilities are we talking about?</p>
<p>Let’s start with something that could hardly be more mundane and important: memory.</p>
<p>In Laws of Media, Marshall McLuhan said (five decades ago) that computing promises “perfect memory—total and exact.” For many millennia, our species has been outboarding memory through speech, the written word, and collecting all of that in libraries and museums. And now, in the digital age that dawned with microcircuits and the Internet, we now occupy a <a href="https://www.digitallife.center/index.php/digital-life">digital world</a> where everybody can publish whatever they want. To peruse that, we made search engines. Those ruled from the late ’90s until approximately yesterday, when AIs took over servicing our interest in answers to questions. Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, and others have moved into a space we might call AI answerware.</p>
<p>Running all that answerware are corporate AIs. Lets call them CAIs. Nothing wrong with CAIs, but also nothing personal, because they are not ours. I explain the difference in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">Personal vs. Personalized AI</a>. Here’s a graphic from that post showing a bit of what abilities might run on your PAI:</p>
<p></p>
<p>PAIs can extend our own memories by accumulating personal stuff we need to know better, and our ability to meet, access, and use the external abilities of the CAI world. So we’ll have our agents + their agents, working together.</p>
<p>For an example of how that might work, take a look at <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">The most important standard in development today</a>: <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">P7012:&nbsp;Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms</a>, which “identifies/addresses the manner in which personal privacy terms are proffered and how they can be read and agreed to by machines.” After seven years with a working group, it is now in the IEEE editing and approval mill, edging toward becoming a finished standard by next year. It works like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here your agent (a PAI, represented by the ⊂ symbol) proffers your privacy terms (<a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">here is one example</a>) to a corporate agent (which might or might not be a CAI, but is still represented with the reciprocal symbol ⊃. (This should be familiar to ProjectVRM veterans as the <a href="https://projectvrm.org/category/r-button/">r-button</a>. We may finally get to use it!)</p>
<p>The ceremony here is the exact reverse of what we have today with the cookie popovers on most website home pages. This can and should be done ⊂ to ⊃. So should signing and recording the agreement, or the choice of the site, should it tell you to screw off. (An agent running on your PAI will record that diss.)</p>
<p>I also bring this up because it will be a key required ability—not just for you and me but for the world, starting with Europe, where <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/">the GDPR lists six lawful bases for processing personal data</a>. They begin—</p>
<blockquote><p>(a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.<br>
(b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.</p></blockquote>
<p>By now everyone knows that (a) Consent has failed. It’s an expensive and meaningless dance, with high cognitive (mostly cynical) overhead, and almost no accountability. Now they’re ready for (b) Contract, especially in ceremonies where the individual (not a mere “user”) takes the lead.</p>
<p>I believe there is less limit to what each of us can do with a PAI than there is to what we can do with a laptop or a phone. Because our PAI is our own. It runs on a deeper machine OS, but is not limited by that. Your PAI, running on your POS, may prove to be the first truly personal layer ever put on a machine OS.</p>
 
<p>*Full disclosure: I am now the <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/about">Chief Intention Officer</a> there. At this stage, it’s a voluntary position.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Digital ID has been increasingly in the news lately, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/27632/&amp;sid=0017">Australia</a>&nbsp;begins to ramp up its systems pilots development following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196986150773792768/">the passing of legislation</a>. In Aotearoa there’s been<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/nz-cabinet-minister-champions-digital-id-in-government-transformation-at-data-summit?utm_source=MarketingList&amp;utm_campaign=dc16ec863f-Top+Reads+17-05-202417%2F5%2F24+11%3A59+AM&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_3ab9d4375a-dc16ec863f-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">&nbsp;a lot happening too</a>&nbsp;as Minister Collins opened<a href="https://nzgovdata.co/">&nbsp;this year’s Summit</a>&nbsp;where DINZ was on stage later.</p>



<p>Contained within the avalanche of consultations posted in March and early April, was the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DISTF-Rules-Draft-April-2024.pdf">second revision of the rules</a>&nbsp;that support NZ’s own<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">&nbsp;Digital Identity Trust Framework (DISTF) Act</a>. The Department of Internal Affairs(DIA) presented to a packed virtual lunchtime audience on it earlier this month. Digital Identity NZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/dinz-distf-working-group/">DISTF Working Group</a>, comprising both private and public sector participants,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Response-DISTF-Rules-submission-May-2024.pdf">responded in detail</a>, reflecting the overall message that, despite good intentions to improve security, data protection, and privacy to reduce online fraud, there are alot of moving parts for stakeholders to consider. The fact that it is ‘opt-in’ for stakeholders and that alternative/non-digital channels should always be offered to people and organisations because it is not compulsory, should help provide time to become comfortable and confident with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;made a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Submission-Biometrics-Code-Exposure-Draft-May-2024.pdf">deeply considered submission</a>&nbsp;on the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s (OPC)<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/news/consultations/biometrics">&nbsp;exposure draft of a Code of Practice for biometrics under the Privacy Act 2020</a>. We continue to assert that a code is premature with potential for unintended consequences, whereas well drafted, clear guidance at the outset will deliver better outcomes for all New Zealanders. As if the above two were not enough, the<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html">&nbsp;CDR/CPD bill&nbsp;</a>is set to be introduced to Parliament, which also has a critical digital identity component.</p>



<p>Since the CPD and the Biometrics Code (should it be implemented) are mandatory for specific digital ID service providers undertaking particular identity-related processes, whereas the DISTF is opt-in, I sense that the weight of regulatory burden will result in tough choices for the industry in this small market, despite the good intentions of all stakeholders. In my view, we’ll have to be conscious of the potential for market stall. Could the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=5e09a5a86b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">CDR/CPD bill</a>&nbsp;help unify our data and streamline our sector and service laws to better suit our market size?</p>



<p>Meanwhile, sectors continue to analyse the role of digital identity and the potential to operate schemes within the DISTF, with financial services leading the way. This is demonstrated so clearly by the&nbsp;<a href="https://comcom.govt.nz/about-us/our-role/competition-studies/market-study-into-personal-banking-services?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=8c96051db1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D#projecttab">Commerce Commission’s consultation on personal banking</a>, which highlights the importance of robust digital identification for frictionless bank-switching and faster progress towards Open Banking.</p>



<p>With the above very much in mind,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7194476205281087488/">Payments NZ and DINZ co-hosted a highly productive investigative sprint earlier this month</a>&nbsp;across its combined membership. We brought together experts, representatives from the private, public and NGO sectors, and heard inspiring presentations from Australia’s&nbsp;<a href="https://connectid.com.au/">ConnectID</a>&nbsp;and our very own<a href="https://mattr.global/">&nbsp;MATTR</a>.</p>



<p>The research and education sector have been deeply engaged with digital identity for many years and continue to lead on many fronts. Learn more at our lunchtime webinar on Thursday 13 June simply titled ‘<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-higher-education-aotearoa/">Digital Identity, Higher Education, Aotearoa</a>’, when DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.themiddlewaregroup.com/">Middleware</a>&nbsp;showcases fellow DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university.html">University of Auckland</a>.</p>



<p>The following week, DINZ and FinTechNZ members with a general understanding of ‘digital cash’ should diary note 20 June for a ‘town hall’ styled dynamic submission with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/news/2024/04/consultation-opens-on-a-digital-currency-for-new-zealand#:~:text=The%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand%20%2D%20Te%20P%C5%ABtea%20Matua%20is,coins%20will%20still%20be%20available.">criticalities (including digital ID) surrounding ‘digital cash</a>’ – a Central Bank Digital Currency as a potential alternative to physical cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DINZ and FinTechNZ members who are familiar with ‘digital cash’ should watch for details about a town hall meeting on Thursday, June 20, with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua, discussing a potential Central Bank Digital Currency as an alternative to physical cash. The meeting will cover important topics such as digital ID.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, the Ceramic network was meant to be an open and customizable platform for developers to build on. The core Ceramic team is excited to keep delivering on that promise and launch Ceramic’s new Data Feed API.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/networking/data-feed-api?ref=blog.ceramic.network">The Data Feed</a> provides a new API for Ceramic that allows developers to receive notifications of updates to JSON documents that are managed via Ceramic. This feed of document updates allows developers to customize the way their data is indexed and queried, and enables the development of new custom database products on top of Ceramic. Databases built on top of the Data Feed API get the advantage of powerful querying capabilities custom-tailored to the needs of the application, while retaining interoperability and composability of the underlying data with all other databases built on the Data Feed API throughout the Ceramic ecosystem.</p> What is the Data Feed API <p>The Data Feed API enables developers to keep track of all the new state changes happening to documents in the Ceramic network, as they are observed on a Ceramic node. These state updates can either be from writes sent to the Ceramic node through the HTTP Client, or writes discovered from the network for Streams belonging to Models that are indexed on the Ceramic node. Ultimately, the Data Feed API can be used to build custom indexers and other database products, e.g., <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a>.</p> Supported API Methods <p>The Data Feed is a read-only API, allowing you to retrieve the feed data through HTTP GET methods. The Data Feed operates on the aggregated state of documents (such as Models and ModelInstanceDocuments), abstracting away the lower-level concerns of the underlying event streaming system. This allows developers to build with familiar JSON documents while taking advantage of automatic application of updates to document state with built-in schema validation.</p><p>Feed data can be accessed via a new HTTP endpoint on the js-ceramic node with the URL path <code>api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code>. The feed utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push messages with the following schema:</p> <code>FeedDocument = {
  resumeToken: string
  commitId: CommitID
  content: any
  metadata: StreamMetadata
  eventType: EventType
}
</code> <p>So for example, the following request:</p><p><code>curl http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code> </p><p>will return the following response:</p> <code>data: {
  "resumeToken": "1714742204565000000"
  "commitId": "k6zn3t2py84tn1dpy24625xjv65g4r23wuqpch6mmrywshreivaqiyaqctrz2ba5kk0qjvec61pbmyl15b49zxfd8qd3aiiupltnpveh45oiranqr4njj40",
  "content": "{...}",
  "metadata": {
    "controllers": [
      "did:key:z6MknE3RuK7XU2W1KGCQrsSVhzRwCUJ9uMb6ugwbELm9JdP6"
    ],
    "model": "kh4q0ozorrgaq2mezktnrmdwleo1d"
  },
  "eventType": 2
}
</code> <p>The Data Feed API can also be consumed through event listeners to continuously pull and process events from the feed. For example:</p> <code>import { EventSource&nbsp; } from "cross-eventsource";
import { JsonAsString, AggregationDocument } from '@ceramicnetwork/codecs';
import { decode } from "codeco";

const source = new EventSource('&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;')
const Codec = JsonAsString.pipe(AggregationDocument)

source.addEventListener('message', (event) =&gt; {
	console.log('message', event)
	//use JsonAsString, and AggregationDocument to decode and use event.data
	const parsedData = decode(Codec, event.data);
	console.log('parsed', parsedData)
})

source.addEventListener('error', error =&gt; {
	console.log('error', error)
})

console.log('listening...')
</code>  Resumability <p>The Data Feed API also comes with a resumability feature that provides “at least once” delivery semantics. Resumability is the ability for a consumer of the feed to pick up “where it left off” after downtime. Without resumability, an indexer that goes down has no way of receiving and indexing data that was propagated while the indexer was offline. The goal of resumability is to ensure that a consumer of the Data Feed API can be guaranteed to receive the most recent data for each Stream at least once, even in the event of failure.</p><p>Resumability in Data Feed API is enabled by the <code>resumeToken</code> property, which is added to every object emitted by the Data Feed API. This property enables you to initiate a connection and ask for the entries starting immediately after <code>resumeToken</code>.</p><p>For example, let’s say your application got an entry containing <code>resumeToken: "1714742204565000000"</code> . When connecting, you can pass the token value as a query parameter, as follows:</p> <code>// ... same as a code snipped above
const url = new URL("&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;")
url.searchParams.set('after', '1714742204565000000') // Value of the last resumeToken
// Connection to &lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents?after=1714742204565000000&gt;
const source = new EventSource(url)
</code> <p>Note that the internal structure of the resumeToken is meant to be considered opaque and may change in the future. You should not try to craft resumeTokens manually, instead, you should always use the resumeToken of the last event you received and processed successfully from the Data Feed resuming the feed with a new connection.</p> What’s coming next? <p>This release marks the initial public release of the Data Feed API with quite a few significant updates already on the horizon.</p><p>One of the upcoming significant updates will be introduced with the new Event Streaming API, powered by ceramic-one (a new implementation of the Ceramic protocol, written in Rust), which will allow developers direct access to the underlying event streams that have historically been hidden behind document-based APIs.</p><p>In addition to that, the core Ceramic team is committed to listening to your feedback and feature requests and taking them into account for future releases.</p><p>At this stage, the core Ceramic team would like to see early adopters trying out the new API and sharing the early feedback with the team.</p> Share your feedback with the Ceramic team! <p>Do you have ideas for how Data Feed API can enable the development of your projects? Or maybe you have questions or feedback on what could be improved? Share your thoughts with the core Ceramic team on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Forum</a>. We would love to hear from you!</p>

		<p>Slalom and New Jersey Institute of Technology Launch “Sophie”–A Prototype Digital Student Concierge</p>
<p>NEWARK, NJ, May 22, 2024 – The EdgeCon conference series continues to solidify its place as a destination event for higher education decision makers, with EdgeCon Spring garnering the event’s highest-ever attendance rate and attendee satisfaction rate. Edge members and vendors are taking note, and choosing the event as a key venue for innovative announcements.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en">Slalom</a> and longtime Edge member, <a href="https://www.njit.edu/">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> (NJIT), chose EdgeCon as their venue to officially debut a prototype AI Student Success Tool to attendees.</p>
<p>EdgeCon served as the ideal environment for the debut, given the prevalence of higher education membership in attendance, as well as the timely discussions of how AI is transforming higher education. Currently being referred to in development as Sophie, the AI tool is called the NJIT Digital Student Advisor, and is a prototype “digital student concierge”. Sophie was built using Soul Machines technology, with chat capabilities provided by GPT 3.5, and hosted in Microsoft Azure. The prototype was designed to work on any cloud platform with a native LLM integration (AWS, Google, etc.).</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Launching the prototype for our digital student advisor ‘Sophie’ in partnership with NJIT is just the beginning of a transformative journey for higher education in New Jersey. As we embark on a journey to humanize the future of AI, we’re not just shaping technology, we’re shaping the future of education itself, unlocking limitless possibilities for personalized learning and student success.”&nbsp;</p>

		<p>In this prototype stage, Sophie was programmed to address a specific use case regarding a student interested in switching majors. The Q&amp;A format shown in the demo was developed around typical questions a student may ask when switching majors or attending NJIT for the first time. Further development will focus on additional use cases to support students in their journey when accessing academic or social services at NJIT. The overall purpose is to create and improve upon a digital humanizing experience for students and faculty – one that is both informative and supportive.</p>
<p>Ed Wozencroft, Vice President for Digital Strategy and Chief Digital Officer, Vice President Digital Strategy CIO, NJIT, shared, “NJIT’s Artificial Intelligence Initiative seeks to embed AI in all facets of our university–from teaching and learning; to research and innovation; our operations and infrastructure – all while remaining human-centered. Undoubtedly AI is here to stay, and higher education must adapt to succeed. With great partners like Slalom, we can quickly develop and deploy great tools and services that change the nature of education and improve the value proposition of investing in a now highly personalized higher education.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the prototype is in its early stages, NJIT is currently in development discussions with Slalom to determine the next phases and potential release dates. Stay tuned for launch dates and availability.</p>
