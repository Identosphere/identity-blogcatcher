<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>If Tina had been in the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/photo-gallery/">Oceania Room at Te Papa Tongarewa last Tuesday</a>, and for the two&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;that preceded it, like some of you were, I think this would have been her observation. It certainly was for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vanessaronanpearce_digitalidentitynz-innovation-payments-activity-7229439216848412672-YzKe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">another singer</a>. The buzz in the room was palpable from the very start. Compared to the previous two years, this event saw increased attendance (214 registered, 202 in the room), more international and local speakers, and an increase in panels and roundtable discussions. It’s tangible evidence that Digital Trust is entering the consciousness of more people, accompanied by a desire to ‘get stuff done’. To that end – amongst several other great presentations, panels and exhibits of things currently in progress for those that wish to opt-in – NZTA showcased its&nbsp;<a href="https://nzta.govt.nz/about-us/app/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwt4a2BhD6ARIsALgH7Dp4rtVIKTd5kCl3AqZhTLoLAgzvRz2ym6ebiMtIvag2xz7M_dSomXoaArUTEALw_wcB">NZTA vehicle status app</a>, DINZ member Worldline walked us through its<a href="https://www.paymark.co.nz/blog/safer-faster-simpler-how-a-digital-identity-could-transform-our-day-to-day-lives/">&nbsp;Digital Identity Acceptance Network</a>&nbsp;at POS terminals, and DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xebo.me/">Xebo&nbsp;</a>demonstrated the application of its information assurance platform for a document (quote) using verifiable credentials in the exhibition area. We are hugely grateful to the Hui’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/partners/">partners</a>, speakers and panellists, without whom this fantastic event would not have been possible.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Awareness and education play the most critical role in people’s adoption of these new services. In their absence, misinformation and disinformation fill the vacuum. A case in point is the jaw-dropping statistic from&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final-1.pdf">DINZ’s research published last year</a>&nbsp;regarding the extent to which organisations are trusted to protect identity and use personal data responsibly. Government agencies only scored 51%. And yet,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/information-sharing/approved-information-sharing-agreements/">OPC’s Approved Information Sharing list&nbsp;</a>is much more limited and evidentially contradicts the surveillance conspiracies that swirl around the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly with the opt-in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identity/trust-framework/">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework</a>, where it’s not widely known that it’s primarily targeted at service providers to help keep their clients’ (you and me) information private and secure from fraudsters by introducing best practices, such as adopting protected reusable verifiable credentials that you decide who gets to see – so you are not forced to hand over documents to all and sundry for copying, which carry the risk of targeted data theft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my closing remarks at the Hui, I asked each attendee to consider what single action they can undertake right now to improve Digital Trust in Aotearoa. And I’m asking again here. There is a private-sector-initiated awareness and education module all set to go. Will your organisation step up to its corporate social responsibility in this domain and help sponsor it?&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">Reach out to me</a>&nbsp;if you’re interested to know more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, please take some time to listen to the first of DINZ’s new podcast series, Digital Identity in Focus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ5DHM28YRM&amp;list=PLvjBoMqh1G6_AY36W4nbUdvACyMmjvp8y">here</a>.

  <p>Addressing the Challenges of FAIR Data Implementation</p><p>The paper addresses a critical issue in implementing the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. While many research groups strive to make their data FAIR, they often encounter challenges documenting the context in which data was collected, processed, and analysed. This lack of machine-actionable, contextual metadata frequently renders data less reusable and visible outside the immediate research team.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, the authors present the first version of the Semantic Engine, a tool designed to facilitate the creation of decentralised, machine-actionable metadata schemas. This tool is handy when data is collected across multiple projects and institutions, such as Agri-Food Data Canada.</p><p>Leveraging Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)</p><p>The Semantic Engine is built upon the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a flexible and extensible standard hosted by the Human Colossus Foundation. OCA supports decentralised collaboration and reproducibility by allowing multiple contributors to work on different aspects of a data schema without compromising the integrity of the core data structure. This approach is particularly beneficial in the agri-food sector, where data heterogeneity and decentralised research efforts are expected.</p><p>The Semantic Engine is built upon the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a flexible and extensible standard hosted by the Human Colossus Foundation. OCA supports decentralised collaboration and reproducibility by allowing multiple contributors to work on different aspects of a data schema without compromising the integrity of the core data structure. This approach is particularly beneficial in the agri-food sector, where data heterogeneity and decentralised research efforts are expected.</p><p>Applications and Future Implications</p><p>The Semantic Engine, freely accessible at <a href="https://semanticengine.org/">semanticengine.org</a>, allows researchers to create, edit, and manage OCA-based schemas. It has been thoroughly tested by researchers at the University of Guelph and is designed to be user-friendly for the broader research community.</p><p>The potential applications of OCA and the Semantic Engine extend beyond the agri-food sector. The paper highlights ongoing projects in Canada and Switzerland and the EU Horizon project 'NextGen,' which uses OCA to harmonise semantic data in cardiovascular personalized medicine.</p><p>The release of the "Decentralised Semantics: A Semantic Engine User Perspective" paper represents a significant step forward in making research data more FAIR and usable. By leveraging the Semantic Engine and OCA, researchers can ensure that their data is well-documented, reproducible, and accessible to a broader audience. The Human Colossus Foundation is proud to support this critical work and looks forward to its continued impact on the research community.</p><p>You can access the full paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2024-042">here</a> and explore the Semantic Engine at <a href="https://semanticengine.org/">semanticengine.org</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, the <a href="https://openid.net/cg/gain-poc/">GAIN POC Community Group</a> has been working steadily on demonstrating that disparate digital identity implementations can be integrated. We have been through two cycles that largely ended up with the same high-level process:</p>
 
 Agree specifics 
 Implement code changes 
 Integrate &amp; demonstrate interoperability 
 
<p>The two cycles were quite different at a technical level with the first having been based on <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance</a> (OIDC4IDA) and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>. The findings of this round were partially documented in the whitepaper “<a href="https://openid.net/announcing-gain-in-2023-whitepaper/">Gain in 2023</a>.” The second cycle was focussed on <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/specifications/">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a> (OID4VCI).</p>
<p>Both cycles were successful in that they:</p>
 
 Resulted in functional demonstrations 
 Enabled participants to learn a lot about the challenges of integrating diverse digital identity systems 
 Provided participants with clearer specifications, enhancing understanding 
 Led to valuable feedback for other working groups. 
 
<p>The latest cycle has successfully delivered several integrated parties using a profile of <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/specifications/">OID4VCI</a> (ID-1) issuing an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VC</a> with the following integrations demonstrated:</p>
<p>– Bundesdruckerei Issuance to Meeco, Talao and Datev wallets<br>– Meeco Issuance to Talao wallet<br>– Authlete Issuance to Meeco, Talao and Datev wallets<br>– Boruta Issuance to Talao wallet</p>
<p>The Community Group continues to progress with next steps to include OpenID for Verifiable Presentations, and a collaboration with the Open Identity Exchange that leverages OpenID Federation to enable the passage of Trust Framework metadata. &nbsp;There has been work on this already by a few of the members so this phase should have a flying start!</p>
<p>Are you inspired by the progress we’ve made or curious how you can contribute to the next phases? We’re always looking for more collaborators to bring fresh perspectives and expertise to our group. Visit our website to sign up and join the GAIN POC CG now!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">GLEIF</a> is pleased to have broadened its engagement and participation in <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP)</a> by becoming a member of the ToIP Steering Committee in March 2024, recognizing the importance of well-functioning governance to the ongoing success of the foundation.&nbsp;GLEIF has been a member of ToIP, as a Founding Contributor member, since May 2020.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>, GLEIF has pioneered a new form of digitized organizational identity to meet the global need for automated identification, authentication and verification of legal entities across a range of industries. By creating the vLEI, GLEIF is now answering to this urgent and unmet need of pioneering a multi-stakeholder effort to create a new global ecosystem for organizational digital identity.</p>



<p>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier vLEI concept is simple: It is the secure digital counterpart of a conventional <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a>. In other words, it is a digitally trustworthy version of the 20-digit LEI code which is automatically verified, without the need for human intervention. The vLEI concept is also very much in-line with ToIP Technical and Governance Frameworks as detailed below.</p>



<p>The vLEI Trust Chain demonstrates the ability to chain the issuance of vLEI credentials as well as providing the foundation for the automated verification of vLEIs back to GLEIF which enable cryptographic verification of the identity of an organization back to its validated LEI identity.</p>







<p>vLEIs go further though in being able to cryptographically tie persons to organizations in the roles in which the persons are representing or engaging with these organizations. vLEI Role Credentials combine three concepts – (1) the organization’s identity, represented by the LEI, (2) a person’s identity and (3) the role that the person plays for the organization.&nbsp;</p>







<p>GLEIF works to advance digital trust standards in the neutral ToIP forum through participation in the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">Ecosystem Foundry Working Group</a>, the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/02/new-issuer-governance-requirements-guide-for-verifiable-credentials-public-comment-needed/">Issuer Requirements Task Force</a> of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">Governance Stack Working Group</a> and as a co-chair of both the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ACDC/KERI Task Force</a> and <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technical Stack Working Group</a>.&nbsp;It is here in which the technical specifications of the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">KERI Suite</a> have been drafted and have begun the process of approval to become published ToIP standards. The <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">KERI Suite of specifications</a> is made up of 3 documents – the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification, the Authentic Chained Data Containere (ACDC) specification and the Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) specification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GLEIF also contributed to the development of the ToIP Ecosystem <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">Governance Metamodel</a> and <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">companion guide</a>.&nbsp;The verifiable LEI (vLEI) Ecosystem Governance Framework is based on the ToIP Governance Metamodel.</p>

Define the Scope&nbsp;🔍 <p>Every successful project starts with a clear definition of its scope. This involves establishing the “Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How” before taking any further steps. By doing so, we create a shared understanding with our clients, which is vital for ensuring that everyone is on the same page. This clarity enables us to guide the project effectively, making informed decisions at every stage. Without a well-defined scope, projects can easily lose focus, leading to wasted time and resources.</p> 2. Identify Stakeholder Groups&nbsp;👫 <p>Identifying the relevant stakeholders is the next crucial step. Stakeholders are those who have an interest in the outcome of the project or who may be affected by it. For our JFF/IRC project, we concentrated on engaging employers, IRC staff, and, where possible, IRC clients. Each group brought unique insights that enriched our understanding of the Job Readiness Credential’s effectiveness. Engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders ensures that the research reflects a wide range of experiences and perspectives, making the findings more robust and actionable.</p> 3. Create Surveys (Quantitative Data)&nbsp;📊 <p>Once stakeholder groups are identified, we design surveys tailored to each group to gather quantitative data. This data is essential for identifying trends and patterns that might not be immediately obvious. For example, in our work on this project, we developed a survey for employers that asked them to rate various aspects of the Job Readiness Credential, including its design and usability. The data collected provided a solid foundation for further analysis, allowing us to make evidence-based recommendations. Surveys are a powerful tool for collecting data at scale, providing a broad overview that can guide more detailed exploration.</p> 4. Develop a User Research Guide (Qualitative Data)&nbsp;📝 <p>Quantitative data provides a broad picture, but to gain a deeper understanding, we complement it with qualitative research. This involves developing detailed guides for our interviews, which help us stay focused while remaining open to unexpected insights. The qualitative data gathered through interviews adds depth and context to our findings. For instance, while a survey might tell us that a particular feature is unpopular, an interview can reveal the underlying reasons why. By combining quantitative and qualitative data, we create a more comprehensive picture of the user experience.</p> 5. Create Transcripts 🎤 <p>Conducting interviews is only the beginning. To extract meaningful insights, we transcribe the conversations using tools like <a href="http://sonix.ai">Sonix.ai</a>. These transcripts are then reviewed and edited to ensure clarity and accuracy. This step is crucial because it allows us to focus on the most relevant insights without losing any nuance. By thoroughly reviewing the transcripts, we ensure that the final analysis accurately reflects the participants’ perspectives. This meticulous approach to data processing is what allows us to provide our clients with reliable and actionable insights.</p> 6. Apply Snowball Sampling&nbsp;❄️ <p>In some cases, the initial set of stakeholders might not be sufficient to capture the full range of perspectives. This is where snowball sampling comes in. By asking participants to recommend others who might have relevant insights, we can expand our research to include a wider range of voices. For example, in the JFF/IRC project, we explored the possibility of engaging a representative from Indeed, the HRTech platform. This approach allows us to gather additional perspectives that might otherwise be overlooked, ensuring that our research is as comprehensive as&nbsp;possible</p> 7. Use AI to Gain Initial Insights&nbsp;🤖 <p>With the increasing availability of AI tools, we’ve integrated them into our process to generate early insights from the data we collect. Tools like GPT-4o and Claude help us quickly identify key themes and patterns in the data. These AI-generated summaries provide a useful starting point, allowing us to focus our analysis on the most promising areas. However, AI insights are not the final word; we carefully review and refine them, combining them with our own expertise to ensure a balanced and nuanced analysis. This approach allows us to work more efficiently without sacrificing quality.</p> 8. Synthesise Findings&nbsp;📚 <p>After collecting and analysing both quantitative and qualitative data, we synthesise the findings into a comprehensive report. This report brings together the survey results, interview insights, AI-generated perspectives, and our own analysis. The goal is to provide our clients with a clear and actionable summary of our findings. We often create both a visual summary and a more detailed report. The visual summary is designed for quick reference, while the detailed report offers a deeper dive into the data, providing clients with the insights they need to make informed decisions. By presenting our findings in this way, we ensure that our research is not only informative but also practical and easy to&nbsp;use.</p> Conclusion <p>At We Are Open Co-op, user research is all about helping people make better decisions with insights they can trust. Our experience with the Job Readiness Credential project shows how dedicated we are to this&nbsp;work.</p><p>We’re here to support you in your own research efforts, whether you’re just starting out or looking to refine your approach. As our work progresses, we’ll continue to share insights that can help you make the most of your user research&nbsp;journey.</p><p>* Note that user research and user testing can get very involved and scientific. Going into more detail and depth is definitely important if you are doing things at scale. This post is aimed at encouraging those who may not have in-house capacity to get started for the first&nbsp;time!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/demystifying-user-research-e345d309abab">Demystifying User Research</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An important paper on digital identity has just been released. “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Personhood Credentials: Artificial Intelligence and the Value of Privacy-Preserving Tools to Distinguish Who Is Real Online,</a>” published by researchers at a wide range of institutions, including OpenAI, Harvard Society of Fellows, MIT, and Collective Intelligence Project, explores how Personhood Credentials (PHCs) can enhance safety and privacy for humans on an internet where AI users outnumber humans. <a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF</a>, including DIF members Microsoft and <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">SpruceID</a>, is honored to have contributed to this paper, and we share this as a call to action to the decentralized identity community and beyond, and an opportunity to build PHC systems the right way.</p><p>The PHC paper addresses the risks posed by AI advances to traditional identity verification methods, such as the ability to solve CAPTCHAs and create realistic human-imitating videos. The implications are clear: our existing verification methods are becoming less reliable, and we must act quickly to reduce harms associated with deceptive fakes at scale. At the same time, we must avoid overcorrecting in ways that could compromise privacy and civil liberties.</p><p>We need a new building block that allows people to prove they are human, without revealing additional personally identifying information. The paper proposes “Personhood Credentials” (PHCs) as a solution, and further establishes requirements to mitigate privacy harms that could be introduced upon issuance and use of the credentials.</p><p>These requirements are thoughtfully designed to ensure both effectiveness and privacy:</p><blockquote>1. Credential limits (1 credential per person per issuer): The PHC issuer aims to issue only one credential per person and provides ways to mitigate the impact of transfer or theft of credentials.<br>    a. Issuers check one-per-person requirement at enrollment: The issuer has an effective check of whether a person has already received a personhood credential from them.<br>    b. Expiry or regular re-authentication: To mitigate the theft or transfer of credentials, there is a periodic process designed to reduce credential use by someone other than the original holder<br><br>2. Unlinkable pseudonymity (privacy): PHCs let a user interact with services anonymously through a service-specific pseudonym; the user’s digital activity is untraceable by the issuer and unlinkable across service providers, even if service providers and issuers collude.<br>    a. Minimal identifying information stored during enrollment: The issuer associates minimum necessary identifying information between a specific personhood credential and its holder.<br>    b. Minimal disclosure during usage: When a user presents a personhood credential to a service provider, it reveals to the service provider nothing more than “this person holds a valid PHC” or, with the user’s authorization, “this person holds a valid PHC not yet used with this service.”<br>    c. Unlinkability by default: By default, service providers or issuers cannot trace or link usage activity across uses, even if issuers and service providers collude. The issuer, by default, learns nothing when a PHC has been used. Service providers do not learn anything when a PHC that has been used with their service is used with another service.</blockquote><p>Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity standards are ideally suited to these requirements – in particular interoperability challenges posed by a multi-issuer PHC ecosystem – and the time to build is now. I strongly encourage you to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892?ref=blog.identity.foundation">read the PHC paper</a>, as it addresses broader challenges that will demand action from governments, technologists, standards bodies, and the public.</p><p>DIF's long-standing dedication to privacy-preserving digital identity, combined with our focus on Proof of Personhood in the Credential Schemas group and our work in the Applied Cryptography group, aligns directly with these principles and is focused on addressing these challenges.</p><p>We invite you to join DIF in this work. The challenges ahead are significant, but with thoughtful design and collaboration, we can build identity systems that meet the needs of the future while upholding the values of decentralization and user control.</p><p>Next steps:</p>  Read the paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07892</a>&nbsp;  Join DIF: <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://identity.foundation/join/</a>&nbsp;  Sponsor the Personhood Credential challenge in our upcoming hackathon: <a href="mailto:hackathon@identity.foundation">hackathon@identity.foundation</a>&nbsp;  Contact: <a href="mailto:contact@identity.foundation">contact@identity.foundation</a>&nbsp;

<p>The evolution of money has always been about solving the shortcomings of previous systems. From the early days of barter, humanity transitioned to precious metals and then to fiat currencies, each step aiming to make trade more scalable. But fiat money, controlled by governments, has introduced a <a href="https://elastos.info/news/global-debt-crises-bel2-solution/">global debt crisis</a>, through problems like inflation, centralisation, and the manipulation of monetary policy. Bitcoin represents the next advancement in this evolutionary process, addressing these flaws by embracing cryptographic security and decentralisation. Unlike fiat currencies, which governments can inflate at will, Bitcoin’s fixed supply prevents inflation and shifts economic power back to individuals, and this is just the start.</p>
  
<p>Centralised monetary systems have historically led to corruption, manipulation, and the concentration of power, fundamentally distorting markets and undermining economic freedom. In a truly free market, prices should naturally fall over time due to technological advancements and increased productivity. However, centralised systems, through inflation and debt, have artificially reversed this deflationary trend, creating scarcity and concentrating power in the hands of a few.</p>
<p>Decentralisation is essential to counter these risks because it ensures that no single entity can manipulate or devalue a currency, preserving the integrity of free markets. <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a> extends this principle of decentralisation beyond money and into the digital economy, or SmartWeb, as a whole. This approach is rooted in the fundamental belief that the internet, like currency, should be a global public good, free from centralised control. With <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">5.44 billion internet users worldwide as of April 2024</a>, accounting for 67.1% of the global population, the need for a decentralised and secure digital infrastructure is more critical than ever. Elastos aims to create an internet where data and digital assets are controlled by individuals rather than central authorities, ensuring that digital activities are universally accessible, secure, and protected from manipulation.</p>
<p>This combination of decentralisation and digitisation allows technology to drive down costs and increase access, benefiting individuals rather than centralised entities. As finance, data ownership, digital assets, digital identity, and applications are disrupted through decentralisation, the big question is, can we successfully connect it all together to create a new economy? First, let’s explore connecting Bitcoin to Elastos.</p>
 BeL2: Connecting Bitcoin within the Elastos Ecosystem 
<p>Bitcoin offers a path to economic freedom by decentralising the control of money, allowing natural market forces to determine value without interference from central authorities. However, a truly decentralised and free market requires more than just digital gold; it needs a robust infrastructure to support new financial systems and complex transactions, such as BTC-backed fiat issuance, swaps, and loans. This is where <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>, built on the Elastos SmartWeb, comes into play.</p>
<p>BeL2 extends Bitcoin’s role by enabling sophisticated transactions and smart contracts without requiring Bitcoin to be bridged and wrapped, instead sending collateralised proof information over the assets themselves. As global retail e-commerce sales reached an estimated <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/">5.8 trillion U.S. dollars in 2023</a>, with projections indicating a 39% growth to surpass eight trillion dollars by 2027, the importance of secure and scalable digital infrastructure cannot be overstated.</p>
  
 ELA and Miners: Powering the Decentralised Economy 
<p>Elastos builds a secure, decentralised internet and economic system by using its <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastos-ela-bitcoin-merge-mining-economic-model/">Bitcoin merged-mined</a> native cryptocurrency, <a href="https://elastos.info/">ELA</a>, as the essential fuel for transactions and smart contracts. Rooted in trust, Elastos employs a hybrid consensus mechanism where miners validate transactions, ensuring the network’s integrity and resistance to centralised control. ELA powers smart contracts like <a href="https://ela.city/home">Elacity’s</a>, enabling secure business operations like digital asset trading.</p>
<p>The integration of <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a> enhances Bitcoin’s utility by allowing BTC-backed assets to function within the Elastos ecosystem, maintaining Bitcoin’s decentralised nature while expanding its role in a new financial system. By collateralising Bitcoin on the Elastos mainnet, BeL2 establishes a BTC-backed Bretton Woods system that supports not only fiat currencies but also decentralised loans and financial services. This innovation, combined with the decentralised security provided by miners and the utility of ELA, creates a robust foundation for next-generation decentralised markets and economies. Users control their identities, while BeL2 ensures Bitcoin remains a secure and resilient financial backbone, driving the Elastos SmartWeb economy and enabling diverse financial applications, from collateralised loans to complex business scenarios.</p>
 Elacity: Realising the Decentralised Internet Economy 
<p>Bitcoin’s potential as a decentralised currency stems from enabling secure, peer-to-peer transactions without the need for centralised intermediaries. However, to unlock its full capabilities, it must integrate with broader systems that allow for secure ownership and control of digital assets. Elacity, a platform built on the Elastos ecosystem, <a href="https://docs.ela.city/">believes</a> that true ownership of digital assets requires not just possession, but also the ability to securely manage, trade, and monetise those assets independently of centralised authorities. By implementing a decentralised digital rights management (dDRM) system, Elacity ensures that digital assets are encrypted, securely packaged, and tradable, directly addressing the inefficiencies and vulnerabilities inherent in traditional monetisation systems which rely on centralised licence servers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Elacity’s connection to BeL2’s BTC-backed financial assets on the Elastos SmartWeb creates a digital economy anchored in Bitcoin’s security. This decentralised marketplace allows Digital Capsules to operate under smart contracts using Bitcoin-backed finance, ensuring secure and transparent transactions without central control through ELA miners. As <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/09/21/digital-payments-global-financial-inclusion">80% of transactions are now conducted digitally</a>, decentralised control over finance becomes even more critical. Elacity can expand BeL2’s role to support a new Bitcoin-backed Bretton Woods financial system, enabling BTC-backed fiat or loan payments across various economies, including established sectors like media, e-commerce, and software; emerging areas like gaming and VR/AR; and frontier markets such as AI, robotics, and IoT devices.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Each purchase instantly delivers payments directly to owners, streamlining revenue flows. Royalties in these markets are also tokenised and can be traded, creating new markets where ownership rights themselves become valuable assets. By supporting diverse business models, Elacity enables one-time purchases, subscriptions, rentals, pay-per-view, and ad-supported content on Elastos. With BeL2’s BTC-backed financial structure, a new marketplace that unites technologies, is grounded in Bitcoin, and supports secure ownership and trading across all digital economies is born.</p>
<p></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Maintaining Decentralisation Across the Ecosystem 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Centralised control has historically led to the co-opting of currencies by powerful entities, eroding the very freedoms that decentralised systems are designed to protect. Bitcoin’s decentralised structure, supported by the Elastos SmartWeb and platforms like Elacity, must be preserved to avoid this fate. If Bitcoin continues to uphold its decentralised nature, it could lead to a future where individuals have greater control over their economic destinies. BeL2 supports this vision by extending Bitcoin’s functionality, transforming it from a mere store of value into a foundation for a new Bretton Woods economic system within the new internet, the Elastos SmartWeb.</p>
<p>Elacity ties this broader vision together by creating an Elastos marketplace where Bitcoin and BeL2 play central financial roles in delivering a secure and private digital economy. The future of Bitcoin, supported by Elastos technologies like <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a> and <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a>, brings about a world where abundance, freedom, and prosperity are accessible to all, grounded in decentralisation and individual empowerment. The road ahead is very promising, the dawn of economic freedom is with Elastos. Thank you for your continued support, and stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop and innovate!

  <p>Disentis, July 28 to August 9</p><p>Nestled amidst the majestic Swiss Alps and the picturesque Disentis Monastery, the 2024 Summer Academy of the German <a href="https://www.studienstiftung.de">Studientstiftung des deutschen Volkes </a>and <a href="https://www.studienstiftung.de/pool/sdv/public/documents/Max_Weber-Programm/studienstiftung_max_weber_programm_broschuere.pdf">Max Weber Programm</a> was an inspiring setting for over 70 passionate students. Among them, six vibrant working groups explored pressing societal matters, ranging from sustainability to digital health. One such group took on the challenge of envisioning a secure and inclusive European Health Data Space (EHDS).</p>





















  
  






  <p>A vision for the future of health data.</p><p>With the recent legislative work of the European Parliament and Council, the European Union is taking a visionary step towards establishing the EHDS. Beyond its benefits for patients and research, the EHDS has the potential to leverage digital technologies to significantly enhance the resilience and long-term sustainability of Europe's universal healthcare systems, provide a unique economic advantage, and set global standards in privacy, individual protection, and data governance. </p><p>For a European health data space that can be adopted by everyone (including patients!), individuals must rely on a system that embeds information security by design. A working group approached the question by leveraging the participants' diverse perspectives as stakeholders in a European Health Data Space.</p>





















  
  






  <p>Under the leadership of Philippe Page from the Human Colossus Foundation's Research Council, an international team of eleven students from diverse disciplines embarked on the mission to address key aspects of the EHDS. Their goal was to create a safe, accessible, and economically viable solution that would benefit patients and researchers alike.</p><p>Three guiding questions anchored their deliberations:</p>  <p>How might EHDS revolutionize medical research pathways via expanded data accessibility?</p>  <p>What measures could ensure the EHDS contributes to the EU economy without compromising health data privacy from commercial exploitation?</p>  <p>Which components constitute a secure, scalable infrastructure that meets the EHDS expectations and security demands? Would such an implementation prove sustainable?</p>  <p>The working group organized itself into three distinct focus groups, each addressing specific themes related to the broader topic. These subgroups operated autonomously throughout the sessions, diving into their subjects. Daily, the working group would collaborate in a collective session to share insights on primary/secondary data usage, discuss findings, and harmonize perspectives to manage risks in commercial usage. Through these collaborative efforts, the participants crafted a first draft of a position paper encompassing essential questions about the future development of the EHDS.</p>





















  
  














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                

            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>In conclusion, the Human Colossus Foundation thanks the organisers for creating space for bringing new ideas forwards in a manner respecting everyone’s perspective. The vision initiated during the retreat in Disentis Monastery is just the beginning. With plans to reconvene in 2025, the group aims to build upon its foundational ideas. Its aim is to create a safer, more inclusive European Health Data Space that sets global benchmarks in privacy, individual protection, data use in research, and data governance.</p>

 Databases on Ceramic <p>OrbisDB has emerged as a premier database solution for the Ceramic Network. Building on the foundation laid by ComposeDB, OrbisDB brings significant advancements in functionality, performance, and user experience. This blog post will elaborate on the connection between Ceramic and OrbisDB, highlight OrbisDB's new features, and showcase its value to developers.</p> ComposeDB: The Original Building Block <p>ComposeDB was the first database and has become an integral technology for many decentralized applications built on Ceramic, such as <a href="https://www.passport.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Passport.xyz</a>, <a href="https://www.zuzalu.city/dashboard/home?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Zuzalu City</a>, <a href="https://charmverse.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CharmVerse</a>, and <a href="https://www.lateral.io/desci?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Lateral DeSci</a>.</p><p>ComposeDB has been instrumental in dapp development on Ceramic because it introduces a robust, scalable, and user-friendly approach to data management. It supports structured data models, advanced queries, and the integration of decentralized identities, all while leveraging <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/revolutionizing-data-publishing-why-ceramic-shifted-from-multicast-to-pairwise-synchronization/">Ceramic's fast performance and high transaction capacity</a>.</p> OrbisDB: A Practical Evolution <p>3Box Labs designed Ceramic as an open network upon which an ecosystem of data-handling solutions could emerge. <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/composedb-is-live-on-ceramic-mainnet/">We launched ComposeDB in 2023</a> as the first database service on the network. </p><p>While ComposeDB represented the first database service offered on Ceramic and introduced many advancements for interacting with Ceramic, the need for simple onboarding, hosted nodes, SQL, and easy integrations with other services led the Orbis team to create OrbisDB.</p><p>Built initially as the Ceramic-based infrastructure for Orbis Social, OrbisDB evolved from a template implementation used by leading crypto projects such as Iggy Social, CoinEasy, Autonolas, and Gitcoin Schelling Point, into a slick set of interface services for data on Ceramic, including a UI for no code deployment, integrated hosting, support for additional languages, and a blue sea of possibilities made possible by plugins.</p> Key Upgrades with OrbisDB   Simplified Ceramic Developer Experience:  Rapid Ceramic Onboarding: OrbisDB offers a web app and SDK for storing and managing datasets on Ceramic, no-code, or CLI.  Hosted nodes: OrbisDB makes Ceramic DevOps easy with an in-built hosted node service.  Accelerated Customization: Extend the functionality of your database with plugins. Build plugins for other developers.      Database Language Choice:  SQL Queries: Using PostgreSQL as its indexing database, OrbisDB offers scalable performance and the benefits of traditional scaling methods.  GraphQL: (already available on ComposeDB) and vector embeddings are both in development.    Plugin Ecosystem:  Optional and Versatile: Developers can easily add plugins to OrbisDB. These plugins are optional and designed to perform operations beyond the core's scope, providing additional functionality and connections to other blockchain services. Recently released plugins for Dune (link) and Base (link) make data visualization and importing on-chain data from any Base smart contract code-free and straightforward.  Open source: Plugins are open source. Users can build and share plugins with other developers in the ecosystem.  Do anything with plugins:  Combine on-chain transactions from Base or other EVMs with verifiable data on Ceramic (e.g., enable mutable and verifiable metadata)  Provide sybil-resistance and instant reputation score to all user-generated data using Passport.xyz or Verax attestations.  Easily token-gate your applications via pre-defined indexing logic  Resolve ENS Domain names directly from any datasets in one click  Enable a single query from multiple data sources (API, on-chain, Ceramic data, etc.)      <p>Get Early Access to OrbisDB Studio</p><p>OrbisDB represents a practical evolution of databases on Ceramic, building upon the foundations laid by ComposeDB and significantly improving experience, languages, and interoperability.</p><p>Projects have already started building on OrbisDB in beta, including Index Network, Plurality, and Flashcards, for various use cases, including a blockchain event listener and storing encrypted user data and educational content.</p><p>We're excited to work with Orbis to support the future of decentralized data management. OrbisDB Studio, accessible later this year, will offer the developer experience improvements discussed above. <a href="https://app.formo.so/hJ5VGyugmGigyVFyqdHJa?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Sign up here to get on the waitlist for early access</a>. </p><p>Learn more about OrbisDB at <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">useorbis.com</a></p>

<p>It’s cybersecurity season in Las Vegas and I’m inspired to write an overdue post on why I hate the phrase “cyber civil defense”. Actually, I don’t hate the phrase, I disagree with its usage. Being the literal sort I am, I have to of course start with a long look at what the three words seem to mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cyber: aka technology; though perhaps a more detailed definition would include “software driven” and “internet connected” as necessary attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civil: in this context, I think it means “citizens” or just “people”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Defense: The catch with this term is that it’s unclear what or who is being defended and by what or whom. For instance, this innocuous three-word phrase could mean any number of things:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Civilians defending “cyber” [tech] from other civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Civilians defending other people from civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending civilians from other civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending civilians from tech.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending tech from civilians. (ew.)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>I could go on but my head hurts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civilian defense seems to imply a kind of volunteer force to defend people from cyber threats (what kinds of threats?).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s where the wheels fall off this phrase: what about when the call’s coming from inside the house? Meaning, what about when the technology—as designed and with perfect integrity—is itself harmful to people? I’m not fine with using the phrase in the context or implication of defending people from risks from commercial technology itself because doing so:&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Reinforces that it’s acceptable for commercial technology (i.e. commercial products) to be a thing that civilians need to protect themselves from,&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Gaslights people into thinking that it’s somehow their responsibility to protect themselves against commercial technology that is evolving faster than the governance around it, bolstered by staggering amounts of financial resources, and whose risks are admittedly poorly understood by the makers themselves, but with just a little more elbow grease, you, dear user, can maybe be marginally less at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Smacks a bit of a military operation. I don’t want to join an army, I just want to have reasonably safe technology products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>– Also it’s a smidge paternalistic. (I can almost hear the “little lady” in there…)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is we already have a phrase to describe risks of commercial products on humans. It’s called Product Safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But product safety is an abject failure when it comes to commercial software and software-driven technology. In the US we have a dedicated product safety commission, but their scope hasn’t been updated since 2008, and was hamstrung by budgetary contractions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. Other agencies pick up pieces of product safety in the style of the blind men and the elephant, using their granted powers to maximum effect. The failure, however, is with the law makers. We have not updated ideas of “products” and “product safety” to keep pace with the internet age and citizens pay the price every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, from my research, it usually does take around 50 years after the launch of a new commercial product for US product safety laws to emerge, so we’re depressingly on time. For example, seatbelts became mandatory on January 1, 1968, sixty years after the commercial launch of the Fort Model T.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU recognized this gap in 2023 with their <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/general-product-safety-regulation-2023.html">updated product safety law</a>. As we in the US still wait for a federal privacy law, perhaps we can leapfrog ahead to a reimagined federal product safety law. Good news: we at ISL have tons of data, know-how, and tools to support this; it doesn’t have to start from scratch. But it would take extraordinary intestinal fortitude on behalf of the lawmakers to create something that meaningfully throttles the myriad risks technology foists upon us today. It would take precise regulation and a financially backed commitment to enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won’t be holding my breath, but we are absolutely here for that moment if and when it comes. Meanwhile, in the likely event the US government continues to ignore product safety for technology, ISL will continue to champion the safety of all tech users through our maturing safety labels and research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Our approach to the nexus of user research and user&nbsp;testing <p>WAO often starts projects with a bit of user research: asking your stakeholders and audience, users and even friends to give you some insight is always time well spent. After all, we all bring our own biases and experience, and user research can help surface some of those to better serve other&nbsp;people.</p><p>While there are, of course, specialised organisations and more or less complex user research projects, user research is something that you and your organisation can do yourself!. Even talking to five people about your project will give you a wealth of ideas and perspectives on how to improve things for your stakeholders.</p><p>In this post, we’re going to look at a few important considerations to make as you start the design of your user research. Read on to find out how you can bootstrap your first user research&nbsp;project.</p> Are you doing user research or user&nbsp;testing? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>We use the term ‘user research’ when we’re trying to figure out how to serve users better, whereas ‘user testing’ is when you have a prototype and you want to observe how people respond to it. We often do research that sits at the nexus of these two things — we ask questions as well as showing prototypes and ideas. However, rather than simply observing how people use them, which is what you would traditionally do in “user testing”, we talk to people about what they are experiencing. This allows us to both test ideas while also deepening our understanding of our users’&nbsp;needs.</p> Who are&nbsp;‘users’? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The word ‘User’ is sort of a confusing word in the research context. Sometimes we are, indeed, talking to users of a platform or product, but more often than not, we’re talking to people who are involved in a programme or project, but not necessarily as ‘users’. If you are having trouble figuring out who to talk to, you may want to reframe the term ‘user’ into ‘participant’ and reconceptualise ‘user research’ as just ‘talking to people’. Having a structured conversation with the people you are trying to serve is how you can create systems, process and, yes, products that are relevant and valuable.</p><p>The goal of this kind of research is to understand what people need and want, and the behaviours they have. This can help make programme, project or product design better. It can also help your communication and marketing.</p><p>The first thing you’ll want to do when designing a user research project is to think about the types of people you are designing for and see if you can talk to them. Our <a href="https://weareopen.coop">Learn with WAO</a> site has some activities to help you think about who these people are. Perhaps start with <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/stakeholder-mapping/">Stakeholder Mapping</a> and then see if you can apply your learnings in the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/persona-mapping/">Persona Mapping</a> activity.</p> Can you be more inclusive? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>While you need to be targeted in the specific types of people you talk to, it’s also important to ensure that you have a diverse range of participants for your user research. It’s important to be inclusive, which means that you don’t overlook people or groups that you might not associate as ‘users’. Once you’ve figured out the stakeholders and/or spectrum of personas you want to talk to, make sure you have diversity in your&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Diversity and inclusion is an intentional act, so if you realise that you do not have a racially, geographically, social-economically and gender diverse group of participants, you’ll need to do more outreach. It is perfectly acceptable to contact people within your network to ask for help finding diverse participants. You can also use social media and hashtags.</p><p>Sometimes, we use what’s called “snowball sampling” to help us find more participants. We simply ask people who have already volunteered to participate if they know someone who might also be willing to participate. This works well, but beware, snowball sampling can actually lead to less diverse groups because of the way network effect works. It can also lead to ‘scope creep’ where your project ends up being much larger than initially defined. So watch out for&nbsp;that!</p> What kind of data should you&nbsp;collect? cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Effective user research combines both quantitative and qualitative methods. While quantitative data provides measurable insights, qualitative research helps to understand the context and motivations behind user behaviours, leading to deeper insights.</p><p>One of the tactics we like is to use surveys first. This allows us to collect quantitative data as well as to expand our recruitment pool for user research interviews. We ask “May we talk to you more about your answers?” And if the survey respondent answers yes, we ask for their contact information.</p><p>Once you have people to talk to, you need a set of questions to ask. A user research guide helps you ensure some rigour and can be used to steer interviews. You need to avoid leading questions, questions that have the answer in the question (e.g. things like “Isn’t this prototype beautiful and easy to use?”) Use open-ended questions, neutral language and avoid assumptions. It can help to test your questions on friends or colleagues!</p><p>Another point to note is that, as you carry out the user research interviews, you’ll learn things about the project and about the needs and desires of participants. You will need to balance asking similar questions (for fairness and reliability), with perhaps slightly different ones as the landscape becomes&nbsp;clearer.</p> Next steps cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In the end, user research is all about getting to know what your users need and want from your project, programme, product or service. The best way to get that information is to find a diverse group of people and talk to them in any way you can! Then, you can gather your data and present it in a way that tells a story about what your next steps should&nbsp;be.</p><p>Need help? We do this a lot, get in&nbsp;touch!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/key-questions-for-user-research-design-5edfab6046dd">Key Questions for User Research Design</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>To mark the entry into force of the eIDAS Regulation 2.0 in May 2024, the Blockchain Berlin news platform has published a comprehensive review of the IDunion research project’s work over the past three years.</p>

<p>While the original aim of the project was to develop a decentralised identity management system based on blockchain, the project was subsequently refocused on federated data storage using the OpenID4VC protocol family developed by the consortium partners. The integration of these protocols into the eIDAS 2.0 Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) by the EU confirms IDunion’s expertise and its important contribution to digitalisation in Europe.</p>

<p>2060.io enables anonymous, decentralized, sophisticated and interoperable chat connections between users and services. The company has developed Hologram Messaging, a Verifiable Credential wallet and messaging app with true privacy preserving features. Unlike other messaging apps, Hologram is a self-custody app, which means user’s data is only stored on device, and exclusively under user’s control. We spoke to the company's CEO and co-founder, Fabrice Rochette. </p><p>Tell us about the journey you’ve been on so far with 2060.io</p><p>I emigrated from France to Latin America twelve years ago. Once there I decided to start my own company and built a team of engineers in Colombia, developing software and SaaS (software as a service) products for mobile operators in the region, as well as in Africa and Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a good business, but I started to worry about the shift to a centralized internet where everything is provided as platforms, and you need to create an account to do anything.&nbsp;</p><p>I met Ariel Gentile, my co-founder at 2060.io, when I contacted Gemalto (now part of Thales) where he worked, as we needed help to develop an applet for SIM cards. We got talking about how the internet has become highly centralized, and started thinking about new decentralized concepts. Around a year later we heard about DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) &amp; VCs (Verifiable Credentials). We started to dig more into these topics and attended IIW (the Internet Identity Workshop) for the first time remotely, during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>We detected that what we wanted to do was totally aligned with the SSI ecosystem. So we decided to get involved in the ecosystem and started to analyze what was provided - what was good, also what we felt was too complicated.</p><p>We decided to design a solution that would address several problems at the same time. One of the main topics we wanted to tackle is that the communication channels we currently use are insecure and obsolete. They all use public identifiers, so anyone can contact you without your consent. Also, there’s no way of knowing for sure who is on the other end, which leads to problems with spam, phishing and so on. Finally, there’s no interoperability. For example, if you want to use Whatsapp, you can only talk to people who also use Whatsapp.</p><p>You’ve developed a chat application, Hologram Messaging. Can you tell us a bit about it, and how it leverages the DIDComm (Decentralized Identifier Communication) protocol?&nbsp;</p><p>There are more and more chatbots appearing in apps like Whatsapp, Telegram, and so on. Some are tied to a legitimate company or brand but there are a lot of fraudulent ones. So, we decided to address the chat channel first.&nbsp;</p><p>It was very important to us to enable users to confidently identify each other, as well as the entity providing a chatbot or other service. When we discovered VCs, we decided this was a good way to set up a secure communication channel where we can authenticate both ends.</p><p>We developed Hologram Messaging using Credo, a framework that’s aligned to Hyperledger Aries, and enables developers to work with agents such as digital identity wallets, DIDs and DIDComm.</p><p>DIDComm doesn’t just enable the initial credential exchange to establish trust. It also creates a persistent, secure connection between a user and a service (or another user), so it’s a good fit for a secure messaging application. What’s more, it’s built on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), so the content stays under the user’s control.&nbsp;</p><p>We decided to develop some open source modules that anyone can integrate in order to provide decentralized trusted services, and have extended the DIDComm protocol by adding more specifications and messages. These enable third party applications to handle everything a chatbot should do — forms, attachments, voice and video calls, and so on. We even have biometric modules for face, fingerprint and liveness detection, enabling you to do biometric verification, for example as part of a KYC process.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hologram app is a VC wallet as well. Using the chat interface is very convenient for the user, who has a history of what has happened and can access their credentials easily.&nbsp;</p><p>What are the key advantages of Hologram, for companies wishing to implement a secure chatbot?&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine your customer wants to talk to someone remotely, but they need to be sure who they’re speaking with. Today, you can only do this using VCs.</p><p>Hologram enables VC-based messaging and voice interactions, in a way that’s more secure than using OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OpenID4VCI) — when you deliver a credential using DIDComm, you can authenticate both the user and the service using the linked Verifiable Presentation (VP) within each entity’s DID Document.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a company that wants to use Whatsapp to communicate with your customers, you need to sign a contract with Meta, and pay them. In contrast, companies can build their own secure chatbot using our open source modules.&nbsp;</p><p>The chat interface is perfect for accumulating and presenting credentials, and for companies to enable the user journey. It’s very simple to deliver credentials. You don’t need to build a dedicated UI (User Interface).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s really easy to implement, which is why companies are attracted to it.</p><p>Who is using Hologram today?&nbsp;</p><p>We are working with mobile operators to find solutions to reduce fraud, including bank fraud. One of their main concerns is SIM swapping. Usually you need to share your mobile number with the bank when opening an account. Mobile operators can use Hologram to deliver a certificate of a mobile number as a Verifiable Credential, so a customer can demonstrate he or she owns the mobile number. They could also use it to enable customers to verify their physical address, for example, when a telco visits you to install optic fiber.</p><p>We have pilots in place in several countries, mostly in LATAM. We are testing reusable KYC with mobile operators and banks, and are piloting some simple services with governments, including mobile driving licenses.</p><p>Where should people go to find out more?&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://2060.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">2060 website</a> which includes some <a href="https://2060.io/use-cases/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">example use cases</a> that can all be downloaded and customized from our <a href="https://github.com/2060-io?ref=blog.identity.foundation">GitHub repo</a>, from creating a mock Citizen Registry, to using a credential to identify yourself during KYC. There’s even an authentication model where you use a credential presentation to log into a service.&nbsp;</p>

 New Initiative to Drive Sustainability, Circular Economy, and Data Interoperability Across&nbsp;Europe <p>In response to the sustainability and circularity data sharing needs highlighted in the EU Green Deal and the new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), the European Commission adopted the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) in March 2022. This regulation establishes the Digital Product Passport (DPP) system, designed to provide essential information on a need-to-know basis to support sustainable production and enable the transition to a circular economy. The DPP aims to boost material and energy efficiency, extend product lifetimes, and optimize product design, manufacturing, use, and end-of-life handling.</p><p>Beyond facilitating sustainability and circularity-related data sharing among economic operators along value chains, the DPP is intended to create new business opportunities through digital and circular value retention and optimization, such as product-as-a-service, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. It also helps consumers make sustainable choices and allows authorities to verify compliance with legal obligations.</p><p>Currently, there are numerous initiatives for such data sharing systems at the industry sector, platform, or individual company level. However, there is a lack of standardization in data definition, data format, and IT infrastructure, which hinders cross-sectoral interoperability. To address this, the EU Commission initiated the CIRPASS Coordination and Support Action (CSA) in October 2022, with the project set to conclude in March 2024. The focus is on batteries, electronics, and textile sectors. By the project’s end, CIRPASS will propose a clear cross-sectoral definition and description of the DPP system, identify key data for circularity, and define requirements for product identification and data exchange protocols to support further legislative and standardization developments.</p><p>To ensure inclusivity, an open call for pilot proposals was widely disseminated, forming the CIRPASS-2 project consortium, which will run from May 2024 until April 2027. Alongside 17 partners, CIRPASS-2 will demonstrate functioning Digital Product Passports in real-world settings through circular pilot deployments and use cases in textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, tires, and construction value&nbsp;chains.</p><p>CIRPASS-2 will show that the DPP, as a digital transformation initiative, helps strengthen the Union’s resilience and data sovereignty. It will develop a DPP data space fully aligned with Europe’s ongoing efforts in this field (such as SIMPL and DSSC) and emphasize interoperability based on harmonized standards. The focus on open source and architecture will also foster the EU data economy while ensuring compliance with data regulations. By taking the conceptualized DPP and pilot solutions and deploying them at scale, CIRPASS-2 aims to bridge the gap between digital technology research and market deployment. The project will contribute directly to Digital Europe Programme (DEP) objectives through its results and will provide extensive policy and business recommendations to further these&nbsp;goals.</p><p>CIRPASS-2 is an Innovation Action project funded by the European Commission’s Digital Europe Programme, running from May 2024 until April 2027. With 13 lighthouse pilots, the project will demonstrate functioning DPPs in real settings and at scale across four target value chains: textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, tires, and construction materials. Additionally, CIRPASS-2 will create a broad community of DPP stakeholders to facilitate the deployment of DPPs in various product sectors across Europe and&nbsp;beyond.</p> About Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Energy Web is a global non-profit organization accelerating the energy transition by developing and deploying open-source decentralized technologies.

<p>We are proud to share an important milestone in BeL2’s journey to enhance Bitcoin’s capabilities on the Elastos SmartWeb! Today, we announce the release of the BeL2 ZKP Block Explorer, a tool designed to provide detailed verification and proof information for each block on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is a major milestone in BeL2’s mission to maintain Bitcoin’s security and decentralisation while expanding its functionality to deliver a new <a href="https://elastos.info/news/global-debt-crises-bel2-solution/">Bretton Woods DeFi system</a> backed by Bitcoin. Let’s dive right in!</p>
 
 Launching the BeL2 ZKP Block Explorer 
 
 <a href="https://scan.bel2.org/">Explore the BeL2 ZKP Block Explorer here!</a> 
 
<p>At Elastos, we empower Bitcoin with tools that enhance transparency, security, and trust in the blockchain. First, through merge-mining to provide <a href="https://elastos.info/about/tokenomics/">ELA</a> rewards to miners in return for their security, the BeL2 ZKP Block Explorer is developed to provide users with the ability to verify BTC transactions independently, ensuring that Bitcoin remains a secure and decentralized network while expanding its utility into smart contracts.</p>
<p>The BeL2 ZKP Block Explorer achieves this by converting each Bitcoin transaction into zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). These proofs allow for independent verification of transaction data without revealing any sensitive information. By creating a chain of proofs for every Bitcoin block, from the genesis block to the present, all historical and current transactions can be verified for accuracy and integrity, opening the door to smart contract verification innovation.</p>
 
 Transaction Verification: The explorer lists transaction hashes and verifies them using ZKPs. 
 Block Header Proofs: Ensures block headers are correctly linked to previous blocks. 
 Merkle Tree Proofs: Verifies the list of transaction IDs in each block, maintaining transaction integrity. 
 
<p></p>
<p>The new BeL2 ZKP Block Explorer provides a user-friendly interface to browse and search all proofs and their details. Users can see the current block being processed, the sub-proofs being generated, and detailed block and transaction information, including the inputs and outputs used to produce the proofs. As BeL2 continues processing historical transactions to the current date, the aim is to achieve a fully functional full node. This will enable the operation of full nodes on BeL2’s network, which can be upgraded to arbiter nodes, collateralised with ELA and earning rewards for managing time-based execution and dispute resolution on the BeL2 protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Verifying Bitcoin ZKP’s in EVM Ecosystems 
<p>We are here to enhance Bitcoin’s capabilities while maintaining its security and decentralisation using the <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos SmartWeb</a>. Integrating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) into Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystems helps create a more interconnected blockchain environment. Elastos’ BeL2 ZKP Block Explorer converts Bitcoin transactions into zero-knowledge proofs. These proofs enable smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains to verify Bitcoin transactions without transferring assets, ensuring secure information sharing across chains.</p>
<p>Integrating ZKPs into EVM ecosystems allows Bitcoin transactions to interact with smart contracts on other chains like the <a href="https://esc.elastos.io/">Elastos Smart Chain</a>. This expands Bitcoin’s utility, enabling participation in complex financial applications and decentralised services. The BeL2 ZKP Block Explorer provides the framework for generating and verifying ZKPs, ensuring Bitcoin’s protocol remains secure while enhancing its functionality across platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 BeL2 Technical Updates and Progress 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Improving Block Proof Capabilities with zkPOrder: Block proofing ensures the integrity of blockchain blocks, confirming that each new block is valid. BeL2’s extended block-proof capabilities using zero-knowledge proofs, allow stakeholders to verify transactions and blocks securely. BeL2’s ZKP verification contract now supports the verification of transactions in specific blocks and ensures several blocks are legitimate successors of a certain block, enhancing integrity and reliability. 
 Ensuring Proof and App Consistency: Consistency checks are vital for ensuring that system proofs and apps are reliable. BeL2 have made progress by extending the bootloader output to support complex operations and upgrading the Solidity verifier to allow the registration of Cairo1 applications and the calculation of cryptographic hashes. 
 Improving BeL2s Proof System: Improving BeL2’s proof system enhances performance and reduces costs. BeL2 have completed part of the Rust Cairo VM runner, leveraging Rust’s performance and safety. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 StarkNet Grant Roadmap 
<p>Finally, BeL2 recently received a StarkNet grant! For more information, <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/elastos-bel2-secures-starknet-grant/">read here</a>. Alongside BeL2’s ZKP node innovation into Arbiters, here is BeL2’s grant roadmap, which outlines the major milestones they aim to achieve up until October, supported by their recent grant from StarkNet:</p>
 
 Building the Light Verification Solution on StarkNet (June 2024): Enable Bitcoin to interact with StarkNet, enhancing its utility in decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. 
 Developing the Alpha Version of the Native Bitcoin Lending Solution (July 2024): Create a platform for lending and borrowing Bitcoin directly, providing greater financial flexibility for Bitcoin holders. 
 Supporting Full Types of BTC Transactions and Threshold Signature (September 2024): Enhance the flexibility and security of Bitcoin transactions, supporting all transaction types and implementing threshold signatures. 
 Launching the Testnet of the Native Bitcoin Lending Solution (October 2024): Test the Bitcoin lending solution in a controlled environment to ensure robustness and security before full deployment.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO</p>



<p>In a significant move to bolster software security, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations have released new guidance that organizations can use to demand better security from their software vendors.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-demand-guide">Secure by Demand Guide: How Software Customers Can Drive a Secure Technology Ecosystem</a> underscores the pivotal role that software customers play in digital supply chain security. The guide outlines high-priority security requirements from the earliest stages of software development, a principle central to creating “secure by design” products.</p>



<p>Among the items highlighted are phishing-resistant authentication methods, such as <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, as a default feature in software products. Announced on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at Black Hat USA, this new guidance represents a vital step forward in securing the digital supply chain in the United States and worldwide.</p>



 Secure by Demand, Secure by Design 



<p>This new guidance complements CISA’s recent <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/Shifting-the-Balance-of-Cybersecurity-Risk-Principles-and-Approaches-for-Secure-by-Design-Software.pdf">Secure by Design Guide</a> aimed at technology manufacturers to improve their software product security. By focusing on the procurement aspect in the supply chain, the new guidance advises software buyers to demand modern security features from technology manufacturers, such as phishing-resistant authentication and passkeys. By doing so, customers can drive demand for security as a baseline feature and compel technology manufacturers to adhere to secure design practices.</p>



<p>The guidance also includes an assessment to evaluate software security and include security requirements in contracts. It encourages a proactive procurement approach, where a buyer can assess a manufacturer’s security and capabilities to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience. The guide establishes best practices for secure software procurement and highlights the product security features that bolster supply chain security and interoperability.</p>



 Passkeys Take Center Stage 



<p>CISA’s guidance aligns with the recent guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in their digital identity guidelines on authentication and lifecycle management. In supplemental guidance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/nist-cites-phishing-resistance-of-synced-passkeys-in-digital-identity-guidelines-update/">NIST SP 800-63Bsup1</a>, NIST affirmed that synced passkeys meet Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) requirements and device-bound passkeys satisfy Authentication Assurance Level 3 (AAL3). The two guidance documents emphasize the importance of security, including digital identity and authentication best practices, across the digital supply chain.</p>



<p>The Secure by Demand guidance empowers IT buyers, who can drive market demand for secure software features, such as passkeys and FIDO authentication. Given that weak or stolen passwords account for <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/resources/reports/global-password-security-report">80% of hacking-related breaches</a> and <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/100067-report-shows-1265-increase-in-phishing-emails-since-chatgpt-launched">credential phishing has skyrocketed by 967%</a> since 2022, buyers can use the guide’s security assessment to evaluate software security, including passkey capabilities, and improve security risk management in the supply chain. With this guidance, CISA aims to increase awareness and drive market demand for secure software.</p>



 Key Recommendations for Software Manufacturers 



<p>CISA’s Secure by Demand guide outlines several critical requirements that customers should evaluate when procuring software, and includes questions to assess a software manufacturer’s security capabilities in the following areas:</p>



 
 Authentication: Manufacturers should support secure, standards-based Single Sign-On (SSO) and implement phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) or passkeys — by default, and at no extra cost. 



 Eliminating Vulnerabilities: Systematic efforts should be made to address and prevent classes of software defects, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. 



 Secure Defaults: Security logs should be provided to customers without additional charges, ensuring transparency and accountability in software security. 



 Supply Chain Security: Ensuring the provenance of third-party dependencies via Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and robust processes for integrating open-source components are vital. 



 Vulnerability Disclosure: Transparency and timely reporting of vulnerabilities, including authorization for security testing by the public, is crucial for maintaining trust and improving security outcomes. 
 



 A Call to Action for Security Leaders 



<p>The guidance for those manufacturing or procuring software across the software supply chain is clear: passkeys improve third-party supply chains and ensure higher security standards in software procurement and development processes. By integrating passkeys into authentication processes, organizations can strengthen end-to-end digital identity lifecycle management and significantly reduce the risks of phishing and social engineering attacks.</p>

<p><a href="https://elastos.info/news/elacity-revolutionising-drm-in-the-digital-transformation-era/">Elacity</a> has announced a partnership with <a href="https://particle.network/">Particle Network</a>&nbsp;to create a decentralised, transparent, and user-friendly ecosystem for digital asset management and blockchain interactions, making media markets more accessible. The collaboration aims to overcome existing limitations, improve user experience, empower creators, and establish a fairer, more scalable system for managing digital assets and cross-chain interactions, creating easy-to-access markets.</p>
 How the Partnership Works 
<p>Particle Network provides Universal Accounts, Liquidity, and Gas, enabling users to manage a single account across multiple blockchains, pay gas fees with any token, and interact across chains. It employs Universal Liquidity for fund management and transaction execution. Similarly, <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> replaces centralised DRM systems with decentralised digital rights management (dDRM), enabling Web3 licensing and markets for trading digital assets like audio and video. Elacity allows creators to package digital assets into encrypted units known as Digital Capsules, stored on decentralised networks. Smart contracts handle access, distribution, and royalty management, automating access markets and ensuring immediate, transparent payments to creators.</p>
<p>Both platforms emphasise flexibility and scalability. Particle Network’s modular architecture allows easy integration and optimised resource use. Likewise, Elacity uses ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens for flexible digital asset management, supporting various business models like Buy Now and Subscribe which provides on-chain rights to decrypt content. Particle Network’s offering to support a developer-friendly ecosystem with universal SDKs for integrating account, liquidity, and gas functionalities complements Elacity’s mission to empower creators to monetise digital assets directly, set their own terms, and retain more revenue through a decentralised marketplace.</p>
<p>Their unified system will offer stakeholders in Elastos cross-blockchain interactions and simplified digital asset and rights management, addressing the needs of both technical and non-technical users. By combining this technology, Elacity’s platform and SDKs will further support third-party applications like <a href="https://beatfarm.io/">BeatFarm</a>, a Web3 music distribution platform that enables artists to trade music onto multiple blockchains. This integration allows artists to directly engage with their superfans and promote broader adoption of this easy-to-use dDRM system.</p>
<p></p>
 Future Prospects and Rollout 
<p>Integrating Particle Network’s Wallet Abstraction stack improves the user experience. Particle Network’s Universal Accounts, powered by a high-performance EVM execution environment built with the Cosmos SDK, allow users to manage a single account across multiple blockchains, pay gas fees with any token, and interact smoothly across chains, eliminating fragmentation and streamlining transactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sash__mit">Sasha Mitchell, CEO,</a> Elacity commented: “We are bringing inclusive markets and new business models to Web3, such as buy-now, subscription, and royalty opportunities globally. Despite these innovations, we must simplify the user experience by hiding blockchain complexity for ease of use. After extensive research for dDRMv2, we identified Particle Network as the best option. We are very happy to now be working with them to enable Web2 login, gasless minting, asset availability across any blockchain, and a payment system with blockchain efficiency and governance under the hood for Elacity.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://x.com/0xpengyu">Pengyu Wang, CEO, </a>Particle Network commented: “This partnership marks a significant step forward for Web3 adoption. As users transition from early adopters to more mainstream adopters, it is crucial to bring Chain Abstraction closer to everyone. Starting with our Smart Wallet, user’s onboarding and accessibility to Elacity’s platform are significantly improved and simplified. As we further deploy chain abstraction infrastructure (Universal Accounts), we aim to eliminate all UX complexities, allowing users to seamlessly access decentralised applications on any chain. With this, we are happy to work with Elacity implement chain abstraction across the industry.”</p>
<p>This collaboration enhances security and transparency while opening new revenue streams and business models for digital asset creators. Elacity and Particle Network aim to change how digital assets are managed and monetised. BeatFarm’s platform will further support artist careers and increase fan involvement, creating a more equitable and rewarding ecosystem for all participants. Expect to see this partnership showcased in <a href="https://x.com/Elacityofficial">Elacity dDRM v2</a>, which will roll out in Q4 this year!</p>

 By Adrian Doerk, Lissi <p></p><p><a href="https://lissi.id/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Lissi</a> is a software house of identity experts who have been working on the topic of digital identity with ID-Wallets and verifiable credentials since 2018. The company, based in Frankfurt am Main in Germany, offers software for organizations to interact with EU Digital Identity Wallets in order to comply with the eIDAS 2 regulation ((<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1183/oj?ref=blog.identity.foundation">EU) 2024/1183</a>).</p><p>What is the importance of User Experience in driving uptake of the EUDI Wallet?</p><p>User experience is the number one factor that will determine adoption. If we don’t start investing heavily in this now, we won’t reach the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/trusted-and-secure-european-e-id-recommendation?ref=blog.identity.foundation">targeted adoption level</a> of 80 percent of citizens in 2030.&nbsp;</p><p>Communication and education are also very important. This needs to be transparent, and also needs to address negative topics. Missing communication was one of the key reasons for the failed adoption of the German eID scheme 14 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>What usability challenges do you see with the EUDI Wallet?&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">OpenID4VC</a>&nbsp; is very new and there are many aspects which still need to be addressed. The protocol responsible for presenting credentials to a relying party (OpenID4VP) is critical, and will be crucial in defining the processes of the ecosystem. The protocol currently doesn’t support use case and credential discovery functions. For instance, what happens if a relying party requests three different credentials and the holder only has two in their wallet? We need to inform the user about where to get the missing credential.&nbsp;</p><p>The answer may be clear for certain types of credentials, such as driving licenses. But what about things like proof of income? Not only can there be multiple potential issuers (such as an employer or bank), but proof of income is an abstract concept instead of a specific source the relying party can point to. If a degree is required for a job application, there are 427 universities in Germany — how do you find out if your degree is available as a VC? I believe this process needs to be supported in the protocol, for example as a directory of issuers, which relying parties can point to.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, all EUDI wallets will need intuitive icons to represent common functions like requesting a credential, presenting a credential and so on. There should be a general guidance for all wallet providers on how to illustrate such core processes.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, there is no forum where these topics are discussed. Creating an open community in which such user acceptance topics can be addressed would create immense value for adoption of the EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>The aspects addressed above are just a small part of what’s needed overall. Many other topics also need to go down a standards track. Further topics which need to be addressed from a user-first approach are guardianship, the backup function as well as the protection of the individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>How much progress is being made on tackling these issues? Who is driving this?&nbsp;</p><p>The technical standards are decided on by the eIDAS expert tool group. This group consists of two representatives of every EU member state. They define the <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/arf.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Architecture and Reference Framework</a> (ARF). The four <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-wallet-implementation?ref=blog.identity.foundation">eIDAS Large Scale Pilots</a> (LSPs), which started in May 2023, each have 50+ partners exploring different use cases. A lot of know-how has been built up already, but we also wait for the implementing acts to provide further information. The standards themselves are defined in recognised standardization bodies such as the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI).&nbsp;</p><p>In Germany, there is a <a href="https://bmi.usercontent.opencode.de/eudi-wallet/eidas2/start/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">public consultation process</a> initiated by the Federal Ministry of Interior and hosted by the Federal Agency for leap innovation. They made the right choice to get world-class experts in their team, and open a forum for discussing the many open questions that arise when implementing eIDAS 2.0 on a national level.</p><p>So, Germany is in a good position, but we also see others doing great work. The Dutch government initiated a <a href="https://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/overzicht-van-alle-onderwerpen/identiteit/id-wallet/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">wallet focused community</a>, which is working on <a href="https://edi.pleio.nl/news/view/43a92f84-b5e8-44a9-96b5-ce035c94bc8e/eerste-versie-nederlandse-publieke-id-wallet-gereed?ref=blog.identity.foundation">user flows, user interfaces and creating mock-ups</a>. We also see a strong community in Finland, Italy and Spain among others.&nbsp;</p><p>How do these issues impact Lissi? How much of this is about standardization, versus proprietary solutions from wallet providers?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s only so much you can do as a single vendor. Lissi participates in the working groups within the relevant standardization organizations, such as the OpenID Foundation, assisting the development of the underlying protocols. We see our role as raising the flag on important topics and discussing them with our peers in communities such as the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">European Wallet Consortium</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the last few years we shifted our focus away from the wallet, towards API software for issuers and verifiers. Here we can build a proprietary product based on open standards, which meets the requirements of financial institutions, insurance companies and other regulated institutions. They can use our software to implement use cases with the future EUDI wallets, such as verifying the identity of a person to perform a know-your-customer (KYC) process or issue an IBAN credential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What is Lissi’s business model?&nbsp;</p><p>We’re a software development company enabling organizations to implement use cases with EUDI Wallets by providing the necessary API software. We license this software to our clients.&nbsp; Hosting and integration is done directly by the clients, or by our implementation partners.</p><p>Organizations operating in the European Union face a choice: make-or-buy? It’s a bit like learning a language. Either you learn it, or you get everything translated. We’re the translator that enables you to enter the market without spending a year and half learning the language, maintaining and updating the software and contacting the 30+ expected wallet issuers if implementations are not as interoperable as intended. While having a strong footing in Germany, we also operate throughout Europe.</p><p>Are you mainly focused on standards compliance or product differentiation?&nbsp;</p><p>For now we are concentrating on ensuring that our clients are compliant with eIDAS 2.0. We’re focusing on ensuring smooth user flows and a holistic user experience with the Lissi EUDI-Wallet Connector API software.&nbsp; Within our Pilot Program organizations get insights into the ecosystem, expert guidance from our team as well as the API and wallet software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Where do you see opportunities for wallet providers to differentiate themselves?&nbsp;</p><p>The big opportunity is to develop user-centric approaches. We need to think outside the box and take a broader view of what the wallet can be. Governments look at it from a regulatory perspective, but I also want my wallet to show me a list of all my accounts and contracts, to automatically notify service providers when I change address, and so on. Building additional functions into the wallet is how wallet providers can set their offer apart.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve previously spoken of the role DIDComm can play in addressing certain usability issues with the EUDI Wallet. Is that still your view?&nbsp;</p><p>Here we are speaking about the protocols used by the issuer and verifier to interact with wallets. The currently used OpenID4VC is less flexible than DIDComm, which was used by many stakeholders before eIDAS 2.0. While the EU’s decision to standardize on OpenID4VC decreases implementation complexity, it also limits our ability to meet some of our clients’ requirements, such as a direct chat communication with the wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>Our clients tell us they need persistent digital relationships with customers. We still think DIDComm is the best candidate to meet this need, given its maturity. If there are enough stakeholders requesting functionality offered by such a protocol, it might eventually be integrated into the technical requirements of eIDAS.&nbsp;</p><p>What is your view on the so-called ‘three wallet problem’? (referring to the complexity and inconvenience citizens may experience if they are required to download and manage many identity wallets)</p><p>In my opinion, the more important question is how successful eIDAS will be. If it's successful, citizens will have a single wallet with their national ID, and won’t need ten additional wallets for identity related topics. It all depends on whether the barrier to entry is low enough for organizations to interact with citizens without needing to issue a wallet of their own.&nbsp;</p><p>Do wallet providers have enough incentive to participate in the eIDAS ecosystem?&nbsp;</p><p>Good question! I’ve spent some time investigating the business case for wallet providers.&nbsp;According to eIDAS, we will have at least 30 wallets (one for each of the 27 member states plus 3 EEA countries). Given the option for additional private-sector wallets certified by member states, there may be a lot more, though it probably doesn’t make sense for wallet providers to enter the smaller markets.&nbsp;</p><p>Will wallet providers be able to build a viable business model? We have some ideas on this, but it’s still a big question mark for everyone. You can join the <a href="https://gitlab.opencode.de/bmi/eudi-wallet/eidas2/-/blob/main/05_Working_Group_Ecosystem_Governance/240710_Kick-Off_EGOM_Working_Group/240710_Kick-Off_EGOM_Working_Group_final.pdf?ref_type=heads&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Ecosystem, governance and business model working group of the German public consultation process</a> to discuss this in more detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Are there any other important gaps in eIDAS, from your perspective?&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid the risk that relying parties request too much or unnecessary data from citizens, they will need to register in their member state. For now it’s still discussed to what extent they need to register. If they will be required to register every credential they want to request, this would create unnecessary complexity and a potential barrier to entry. It’s also still to be decided if this will be technically enforced or just a legal prerequisite. We don’t think a technical enforcement is viable for the ecosystem. How a data request complaint is handled by the wallet, and EU member states, also needs to be standardized, not left to member states, or we’ll end up with a confusing mess of solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>The other area is the trust mechanism enabling relying parties to determine if an issuer is trusted to issue a certain credential, such as the Person Identification Data (PID). We need a clear direction on what trust model will be adopted, in order to continue the practical implementation of use cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In response to Graeme Muller’s open letter from NZTech to New Zealand Government officials, DINZ and its Biometrics Special Interest Group wish to emphasise our support for the concerns raised. The letter, published yesterday, highlights significant concerns about the OPC’s proposed Code of Practice for biometrics, which could negatively impact businesses, innovation, and the economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“DINZ is fully committed to supporting the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). We believe that privacy-enhancing technologies introduced by our industry can complement the OPC’s role in protecting privacy. Collaboration between the OPC and businesses should not be seen as a trade-off but as a partnership with mutual benefits.” says Steven Graham, Head of Biometrics (ANZ) &amp; Innovation, NEC New Zealand Limited and Chair of DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group.</p>



<p>Following the publication of this letter the Privacy Commissioner reached out to NZTech CEO Graeme Muller to assure NZTech members that the process is far from finished, they are still reviewing the feedback and there will be further opportunities for stakeholders to engage. Given how important biometrics are for privacy, productivity and economic growth, DINZ, and NZTech look forward to the OPC publishing their proposed next steps and engaging in real consultation with experts in biometrics.</p>

<p>Submitted by: Joni Brennan, President</p>



<p>List of recommendations</p>



 
 Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:
 
 Digital Trust in Citizen Services; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety; and 



 Digital Trust in Business and Industry 
 
 



 Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing privacy-protecting verification and authentication tools as part of its Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategy. 



 Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike. 
 



<p>Introduction</p>



<p>The spread of misinformation is evolving around the world at a concerning pace. Bad actors are finding new battlegrounds and frontiers every day, and information and images generated by AI are being used to push political agendas and false narratives, scam and steal money and identities, and, even worse, lure online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, AI is also evolving rapidly, with risks as significant as the benefits. Further, now that AI is generative, users can manipulate images and information at unprecedented speed and scale, and vast amounts of inaccurate and malicious information make it difficult for people and organizations to verify information authenticity.</p>



<p>In today’s era of information warfare, authenticity and verification must be prioritized — particularly given the role of digital trust and identity verification in the delivery of government and business services.</p>



<p>Our submission and recommendations reflect the deep experience and expertise of DIACC’s member organizations, and our collective commitment to working with leaders in both the public and private sectors to secure verifiable information authenticity to the benefit of government, industry, and citizens alike by prioritizing inclusive and accessible privacy-protecting digital trust and verification capabilities.</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, with a goal to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>DIACC is guided by a belief that our public safety, civic engagement, and economic prosperity depend on leveraging trusted solutions and using well-established risk mitigation and certification tools. DIACC is committed to accelerating digital trust adoption and reducing information authenticity uncertainty by certifying services against its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework — a risk mitigation and assurance framework developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts that signals trustworthy design rooted in security, privacy, inclusivity, accessibility, and accountability.</p>



<p>Recommendations</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Citizen Services; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety; and 



 Digital Trust in Business and Industry. 
 



<p>Digital Trust in Citizen Services</p>



<p>DIACC advocates for digital trust in citizen services, emphasizing the importance of secure, privacy-respecting, and user-centric solutions through collaboration between government, private sector, and civil society. Leveraging our collaborative partnerships, we developed the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) – a risk mitigation and assurance framework that extends standards and open source code to help service providers ensure risk mitigation and user care.</p>



<p>As public services continue to move online, digital trust and verification services will be critical for ensuring that services are secure and accessible. From online healthcare consultations to digital government services, these technologies provide the necessary security infrastructure to protect public interactions and data.</p>



<p>Through partnerships with organizations such as DIACC, the government is encouraged to prioritize innovation in digital trust technologies through pilot projects, research, and education. Collaboration with various sectors will ensure the development and implementation of secure, efficient, inclusive, and accessible digital trust solutions, fostering a reliable digital ecosystem for accessing healthcare, banking, and government services.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory</p>



<p>Canadians benefit from being a highly banked jurisdiction with broad inclusivity and accessibility – according to the Canadian Bankers Association, approximately 99 per cent of Canadian adults have a bank account.</p>



<p>Existing financial regulations provide powerful and internationally recognized tools that act as a solid foundation to fight fraud and foster a more verified, authentic, and trustworthy ecosystem that supports the needs of people, governments, and businesses alike. However, the government is encouraged to build on the existing regulatory framework and develop new regulations to facilitate secure digital transactions, including compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.</p>



<p>Further, digital trust and verification services will be critical as the government moves forward with its commitments to open-banking, with interoperability also being paramount as the federal framework and existing provincial frameworks work together.</p>



<p>Similarly, the government has committed to reducing incidents of mortgage fraud and strengthening proof of borrower and title insurance, and digital trust and verification services can and should play a critical role in making that commitment a reality.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Safety</p>



<p>DIACC believes that implementing digital trust and verification services are essential for enhancing public safety. Digital verification can play a crucial role in protecting vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities.</p>



<p>By ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive areas such as schools, healthcare facilities, and care homes, digital trust services can help safeguard these groups from potential harm. Further, digital trust and verification services enable secure and reliable cross-border identity verification, facilitating international collaboration in law enforcement, disaster response, and public health.</p>



<p>By prioritizing advanced authentication methods that ensure individuals and organizations are who they claim to be, we can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and critical infrastructure, minimize financial scams and misuse of personal data, and enhance public safety for all Canadians.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Business and Industry</p>



<p>Enhanced security is a primary benefit of digital trust and verification services for businesses and industries. These services provide robust security measures that protect businesses from fraud, identity theft, and cyber threats. Ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information and resources, these services help maintain the integrity of business operations.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust in business and industry and implementing authentication and verification tools, the government can help drive the following benefits:</p>



 
 streamlined business processes by automating identity verification and reducing the need for manual checks; 



 faster, more efficient operations and reduced administrative costs, allowing businesses to allocate resources more effectively; 



 data minimization and the secure handling of personal information, increasing customer confidence; 



 a competitive advantage for Canadian businesses by helping them innovate and offer their customers new, secure digital services; and 



 a reduction in incidents of fraud, resulting in significant cost savings for businesses. These savings can be reinvested into other business areas, driving growth and innovation and improving overall business performance. 
 



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>In today’s world, where AI is becoming smarter every day, and information can be generated and manipulated at unprecedented speed and scale, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of information is critical. It is vital to maximize the benefits of an AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-fueled data ecosystem for Canada while also fostering citizen trust and protecting their safety.</p>



<p>To effectively address the challenges we’re facing while realizing the benefits of AI, the federal government should prioritize verification and authentication tools as part of its broader AI strategy. Prioritization must include funding, collaboration, and urgent action to support the development, adoption and certification of tools that verify information authenticity while protecting privacy and empowering Canadians. Governments, banks, telcos, tech companies, media organizations, and civil society must work together to deploy open, standards-based solutions and services to verify the authenticity of information.</p>



<p>The economic imperative of investing in these capabilities is clear. According to a <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting/perspectives/generative-ai-in-finance.html">study</a> by Deloitte, the Canadian economy could unlock an additional 7 per cent (CAD $7 trillion) in economic value through AI and AGI technologies. People and organizations can only realize this potential for the good of society by investing in tools, processes, and policies that support verifying the authenticity of the information generated and processed by AI and AGI technologies.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Today, solutions can signal verified trust by getting certified against a technology-neutral risk and assurance framework like DIACC’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts.</p>



<p>Verifiable information authenticity relies on critical principles, including provenance and traceability: provenance establishes the origin and history of information, ensuring it comes from a reliable source, while traceability allows for audibility of the flow of information, enabling people, businesses, and governments to verify its accuracy and authenticity. These principles are essential in combating the spread of misinformation and disinformation, which can have far-reaching consequences in an AI-fueled world.</p>



<p>Provenance and traceability are potent information authenticity tools that can help:</p>



 
 businesses and professionals reduce liabilities and meet obligations to verify information about their clients and their operations; 



 citizens and residents interact securely and efficiently with governments; 



 customers and clients transact with privacy and security anywhere, anytime; 



 industries manage decision-making and securely supply chains using trusted data; 



 producers verify essential data related to environmental, safety, and operational goals and 



 creators track intellectual property to ensure fair payment and cultural protection. 
 



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>Our public safety, civic engagement, and economic prosperity depend on leveraging trusted solutions, well-established risk mitigation and certification tools, and powerful collaboration to ensure regulations set informed guardrails that put people’s benefits, protections and agency to control data at the center of the design. The evolving AI-fueled information landscape presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities for innovation and progress. By prioritizing verifiable information authenticity, inclusive and accessible solutions, &nbsp;and investing in digital trust, we can ensure that people and organizations realize the benefits of AI and AGI while mitigating its risks<br><br>Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide our input in advance of Budget 2025 and as we collectively move forward on the path to a digitally and economically prosperous Canada.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity in the Age of GenAI: Coping with the Exponential Web of Change</p>



<p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses face a paradoxical challenge: while digital transformation fuels revenue growth, it also exposes them to escalating cyber threats.On the one hand, more than half of the global GDP is driven by digitally transformed organizations by now (<a href="https://financesonline.com/digital-transformation-statistics/">IDC, 2020</a>). On the other hand, this digital revolution, while fostering economic growth and innovation, also ushers in an era of unprecedented cybersecurity risks. Cybercrime damages are expected to reach a staggering <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damage-costs-10-trillion-by-2025/">$10.5 trillion annually by 2025</a> roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/">10% of the projected global GDP</a>, with a concerning annual growth rate of 15%. The complexity and scale of these threats highlight the inadequacy of traditional cybersecurity approaches and the urgent need for a paradigm shift.</p>



<p>As we embrace the power of Generative AI to transform most aspects of society, its exponential growth and capabilities bring about new risks and challenges.</p>

<p>The global economy is facing an imminent debt crisis, driven by decades of fiscal mismanagement, economic policies, and the inherent instability of fiat currency systems. This crisis is not just a possibility but an impending reality, driven by the sheer scale of national debts, the erosion of the dollar’s value, and the shifting dynamics in global financial systems.&nbsp;For this article, we will focus on the global superpower, the US, in light of the recent <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/elastos-bitcoin-conference-2024/">Bitcoin conference</a> and the world’s dependency on the US dollar as the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/dollar-worlds-reserve-currency">global reserve currency</a>.</p>
<p>The combined market capitalisation of major tech companies like Apple ($3.4T), Microsoft ($3.3T), NVIDIA ($3T), Google ($2.25T), Meta ($1.25T), and Tesla ($0.78T) stands at $14T. This $14T is less than 10% of the <a href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/financial-report/2023/02-15-2024-FR-(Final).pdf">$175.3T owed by the US government</a>. The actual debt, including entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, is far higher than the officially reported $37T, as Druckenmiller has pointed out for years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>No political election or administration can pay off America’s $175T debt; only extensive use of the printing press can temporarily address it. Influential figures like Elon Musk and Ray Dalio foresee a sovereign debt crisis worse than the 2008 financial meltdown. The Federal Reserve made more <a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2023/04/the-lender-of-last-resort/">emergency loans in 2023</a> than during the 2008 financial crisis, indicating the severity of the current financial stress. Moreover, the US government is borrowing more under the current administration than it did during the COVID-19 pandemic, but at significantly <a href="https://fxstreet.com/analysis/fiscal-collapse-accelerates-202403291732">higher interest rates of 5%</a>. Interest payments on the national debt have become the largest government expense, surpassing <a href="https://x.com/YahooFinance/status/1794324972778799250">defense and social security</a>.</p>
<p>The dollar has lost at least <a href="https://truflation.com/dashboard?feed=truflation-us-aggregated">25% of its value</a> in the past four years due to inflation and interest rate hikes. Meanwhile, China, the largest foreign holder of US Treasury bonds, is rapidly <a href="https://michelsanti.fr/en/china/china-usa-a-separation-of-bodies">selling off its holdings</a>, signaling a lack of confidence in the US economy. BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are increasingly <a href="https://x.com/PopescuCo/status/1772543681628696874">buying gold instead of US debt</a>, reducing their reliance on the dollar. Additionally, China is using its own currency (CNY) for international trade more than ever before, further <a href="https://economist.com/briefing/2021/07/17/joe-biden-is-determined-that-china-should-not-displace-america">diminishing the dollar’s dominance</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite US sanctions, <a href="https://finshots.in/archive/russia-fourth-largest-economy-gdp-ppp-world-bank/">Russia’s economy has grown</a>, illustrating the reduced geopolitical influence of the dollar. Furthermore, US peacetime debt levels are now comparable to those during WWII, indicating <a href="https://visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/US_Debt_to_GDP_Shareable-1000x600.jpg">unsustainable fiscal policies</a>. The true debt of the USA, including entitlements, is <a href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/financial-report/2023/02-15-2024-FR-(Final).pdf">$175.3T</a>, far exceeding the official numbers. This underscores the enormity of the fiscal challenge the US faces.</p>
<p>Against this global debt crisis emerges a new economy anchored in blockchain consensus and algorithmic trust, distributing power and control. Crypto now has the number one Super PAC in the US, <a href="https://www.fairshakepac.com/">Fairshake</a>, which is dedicated to providing blockchain innovators the ability to develop their networks under a clearer regulatory and legal framework. This is vital if the broader open blockchain economy is to grow to its full potential in the United States.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With over $200 million raised, the leading US Super PAC reflects cryptocurrency’s growing political influence. The <a href="https://b.tc/conference/2024">Bitcoin conference</a> highlighted significant support for Bitcoin as a strategic asset due to its limited supply, independence from central banks, and protection against inflation. The natural deflationary state of the free market aligns with Bitcoin, making it a valuable store of value and medium of exchange. Recent political acceptance of Bitcoin is rising, with significant growth potential. Bitcoin mining fosters energy decentralisation and AI advancements, creating a more equitable economic system.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssYCRVpzcxc&amp;ab_channel=BitcoinMagazine">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> pledged to make Bitcoin a strategic U.S. asset, transferring 200,000 government-held Bitcoins to the Treasury and purchasing 550 Bitcoins daily until a 4 million reserve is reached. He committed to making Bitcoin transactions unreportable and non-taxable, emphasising transactional freedom and self-sovereignty. Kennedy highlighted Bitcoin’s potential to promote green energy investments and proposed backing U.S. debt with Bitcoin to restore financial stability. He also promised to make the U.S. a global hub for cryptocurrency innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UxAUryUKXM&amp;ab_channel=BitcoinMagazine">Donald Trump</a> pledged to make the U.S. a leader in cryptocurrency by ensuring the government keeps all its Bitcoin holdings, creating a strategic national Bitcoin stockpile. He promised to end anti-crypto policies, eliminate capital gains tax on Bitcoin transactions, and stop efforts to establish a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Trump emphasised clear and favourable regulations for the crypto industry, vowing to fire Gary Gensler and appoint a supportive SEC chairman. He also committed to making America the Bitcoin mining powerhouse by harnessing low-cost energy sources.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/BTC_Archive/status/1817228340719231197">letter dated July 26, 2024</a>, 27 Democratic officials urged the DNC to adopt a pro-digital asset and blockchain stance. They highlighted the potential of these technologies for innovation, economic growth, and financial inclusion, noting over <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/a-call-to-action-mobilizing-52-million-crypto-owners-into-an-army-of-1">52 million Americans use digital assets</a>. The letter called for four actions: including pro-digital asset language in the party platform, selecting a knowledgeable vice-presidential candidate, appointing a pro-innovation SEC Chair, and engaging with industry experts to support and regulate the technology effectively. Embracing digital assets aligns with the party’s progressive values and offers a gateway to a new financial ecosystem grounded in Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralised security, leading to a new <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-new-bretton-woods-system/">Bitcoin-backed Bretton Woods system</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 BeL2: The Bitcoin-Backed Bretton Woods System to Fix Debt Crises 
<p>To address the global financial challenges, <a href="https://bel2.org/">BeL2 offers</a> a revolutionary approach that uses Bitcoin’s strengths and innovative technologies to transform Bitcoin from a static store of value into a dynamic settlement layer for global financial systems. By using zero-knowledge proofs and smart contracts, BeL2 integrates Bitcoin with other blockchains, opening up smart contracts which open smart finance solutions for the world. BeL2 three S’s principles include:</p>
 
 Secure: BeL2 enhances Bitcoin’s security by rewarding full nodes for their altruistic actions, strengthening the network’s resilience. 
 Smart: By integrating zero-knowledge proofs and Cairo, BeL2 enables smart contracts from Ethereum to operate on Bitcoin without intermediaries or custodians. 
 Stable: The Native Bitcoin settlement layer facilitates the creation of a new Bretton Woods System, allowing for the minting of a universal stablecoin with Bitcoin as its reserve. 
 
<p>BeL2’s vision is to integrate blockchain technologies with Bitcoin’s settlement layer, bringing trust to a trustless environment. This enables users to collateralise and enter smart financial applications such as stablecoin issuance, swaps, and loans. Acting as a portal to an economy where financial instruments are algorithmically ensured by global blockchain consensus and miners, BeL2 ensures these instruments are backed by Bitcoin, which is finite and cannot be manipulated. This approach echoes the Bretton Woods system’s goal of stable global finance, which was abandoned in 1971 by Nixon when the US could no longer secure its dollar’s gold-backed promise.</p>
<p>Just last week, Elastos and BeL2 were at the Bitcoin conference showcasing their technology. This was highlighted by the <a href="https://x.com/ElastosInfo/status/1817030795590271462">team’s large booth</a> and by Head of Operations <a href="https://x.com/sash__mit">Sasha Mitchell</a> who took to the stage to talk about this vision. To watch his talk, <a href="https://ela.city/cinema/view/0x9057304a41919008d79b3bb3fcebd69414e38b1f/112">you can see it here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, BeL2’s <a href="https://scan.bel2.org/">recently released Explorer</a> for ZK nodes proves Bitcoin transactions which can be used for smart contracts across any Ethereum blockchain ecosystem to execute new financial applications. The vision allows nodes to use <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos’ merged-mined ELA</a> as collateral to support transactions in return for BTC rewards. More on this architecture will be released in the coming weeks.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Despite technical complexities, the end result is simple: Individuals, organisations, and governments will be able to use Bitcoin reserves to access decentralised loans and issue universal stablecoins backed by BTC security for use in all sectors globally. As governments face the inevitability of printing and devaluing old fiat systems exponentially, this will increasingly drive value into Bitcoin’s limited supply, giving rise to a new global consensus. BeL2 will provide a new, decentralised fiat system, a Bretton Woods backed by Bitcoin, offering fairness and security for generations to follow.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>The global debt crisis is driven by unsustainable fiscal policies, the erosion of the dollar’s value, and shifting global financial dynamics. From the massive national debts to the rise of alternative financial systems like Bitcoin, the current trajectory is unsustainable. We need to embrace decentralised financial systems and innovative technologies like BeL2. By leveraging Bitcoin’s strengths and introducing cutting-edge technologies, BeL2 aims to transform the global financial landscape, offering new possibilities for decentralised finance while maintaining the core principles of Bitcoin’s security and decentralisation.

 Registry enables tracing and tracking of sustainable aviation fuel with the help of Energy Web and Polkadot technologies <p>The Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificate or SAFc registry was recently launched to support major consumers of air travel and transport in their efforts to help directly decarbonize flight. The registry’s design, development, and testing was spearheaded by nonprofit organizations RMI and the Environmental Defense Fund, that work through the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), an organization whose members include major airlines, fuel providers, and sustainable aviation buyers such as Novo Nordisk looking to reduce the climate impacts of air transport.</p><p>The <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a> connects corporate consumers, airlines, freight forwarders, and clean fuel providers in one universally accessible platform that will spur the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by ensuring that SAF certificates purchased outside of the platform are delivered consistently, verifiably, transparently, and credibly. The registry builds on industry best practices and was subject to public consultation to ensure SAF certificates exchanged realize their intended environmental impact and can be claimed towards emissions reduction goals.</p><p>SAF is made from renewable or waste materials and can decrease the lifecycle emissions of flight by more than 80%. However, the fuel is not yet widely available and can be significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. The Registry helps address this market gap by connecting corporate demand for emissions reductions to SAF producers through an auditable ledger for certificates which decouples the emissions benefits of SAF use from the physical fuel supply. It is the final piece of market infrastructure — in addition to robust <a href="https://rsb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RSB-PRO-20-001-001-RSB-Book-and-Claim-Manual-3.0.pdf">standards</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificate-safc-emissions-accounting-and-reporting-guidelines/">book &amp; claim accounting guidelines</a>, and structured <a href="https://flysaba.org/2023/04/04/first-collective-purchase-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates/">RFPs</a> — to create a robust and de-risked market for SAFc investment.</p><p><a href="https://flysaba.org/2024/04/17/sustainable-aviation-buyers-alliance-announces-historic-agreements-to-purchase-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates-to-grow-investment-in-clean-fuel-technologies/">Major customers have already banded together via SABA to collectively procure SAF certificates</a>. Several of these deals will use the SAFc Registry as the delivery mechanism. Future procurement efforts inside and outside of SABA can use the SAFc Registry to seamlessly ensure the delivery of SAF certificates and sustainability assurances to buyers. Q8Aviation, an international jet fuel supplier delivering sustainable aviation fuel to the aviation market, recently enrolled to the registry saying, “We look forward to leveraging the SAFc registry to expand accessibility and support broader adoption of&nbsp;SAF.”</p><p>Additionally, climate tech company CHOOOSE is complementing the registry with features to streamline the flow of SAF transactions across the value chain. “At CHOOOSE, we build and operate software that supports airlines, freight forwarders, clean fuel providers, and corporate buyers in scaling their sustainable aviation fuel programs. Recognizing the vital role SAF plays in helping to decarbonize the aviation industry, these programs contribute meaningfully to SAF’s adoption. By leveraging systems like book and claim, the SAFc Registry ensures the secure transfer of certificates — and when coupled with CHOOOSE technology, SAF transactions become more automated, streamlined, and accessible. Through this partnership, we’re able to accelerate the use of SAF across the sector,” said Gaute Gamst, Chief Technology Officer at&nbsp;CHOOOSE.</p><p>Web 3 technologies play an important role in operation of the SAFc Registry in order to provide deep transparency to end-users. With the support of so-called worker nodes anchored and supported by the Energy Web X blockchain on Polkadot, actions on the SAFc Registry are checked, validated, and digitally recorded in a zero trust, tamper proof way. For registry users, the public, and auditors, this represents a continuous audit of registry operations.</p><p><a href="https://safcregistry.org/">For more information, please visit the SAFc registry&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>Notes to&nbsp;Editors:</p><p>About Energy Web Foundation:</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

  🚀 Decentralized Identity Foundation News  
<p>DIF Hackathon</p>
<p></p>
<p>Join Us this fall for a Transformative Hackathon Experience!</p>
<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) is thrilled to announce a groundbreaking hackathon in October 2024, coinciding with Hacktoberfest. This event will focus on harnessing the power of decentralized identity across key sectors: Education, Reusable Identity, and Travel.</p>
<p>Who should participate?<br>
We invite experienced developers and product managers to participate in two entry styles:</p>
 
 Applications with Code Provided 
 Idea Submissions (including engineering approaches and components used) 
 
<p>Why Sponsor?<br>
This is a unique opportunity for companies to pioneer challenges, attract top-tier talent, and deepen their grasp of how Decentralized Identity (DI) can revolutionize identity solutions. Sponsors will have the chance to showcase their products and SDKs through educational sessions promoted by DIF, amplifying visibility and engagement within the developer community.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements<br>
While challenges are not obligated to use DIF work items, they must incorporate Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) adhering to open standards at the W3C.</p>
<p>Hacking Period: October 1st - November 3rd 2024</p>
<p>For more details and to express your interest, please contact Limari Navarrete, DIF’s Sr. Director of Community Engagement, at limari@identity.foundation. Join us in driving the future of decentralized identity!</p>
<p>DWN Community Node</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF has launched a Decentralized Web Node (DWN) <a href="https://identity.foundation/dwn/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Community Instance</a>, operated by DIF and powered by Google Cloud.</p>
<p>Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs - also referred to as DWeb Nodes) are personal data stores that eliminate the need for individuals to trust apps to responsibly use and protect their data. Instead, data is owned and controlled by the individual — offering developers a brand new way to create apps that request individuals’ permission to read and access their data, but don’t store it.</p>
<p>The Managed DWN service or “community node” will allow existing and new Google Cloud customers to more easily build test applications using DWNs. Rather than having to run their own DWN or server infrastructure to store data, developers will be able to leverage a DWN on Google Cloud to build test applications.</p>
<p>Developers can use the community DWN node at no cost, including up to 1GB of storage per DID.</p>
<p>To read the report from the launch event on 18 July, click <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/dwn-community-node/">here</a>.</p>
<p>To start building decentralized apps on Web5, developers can visit developers.tbd.website.</p>
<p>To access the DIF community node, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/dwn-user-guide?ref=blog.identity.foundation">start here</a>.</p>
<p>Orgs join forces to advocate for inclusion of DIDs in the ARF</p>
<p><br>
Photo by Guillaume Périgois on Unsplash</p>
<p>Leading experts collaborated to advocate for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) in the EU Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF).</p>
<p>The rationale, detailed in a <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/7c2abd75a4e79ecee102106b2ebea839bed0a32b/publications/DID_EUDIW_ARF-20240709.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">paper</a> published on Github, includes improved privacy and empowerment for individuals, broad existing implementations and support and interoperability and future proofing of the ARF. The paper also addresses a number of misconceptions about DIDs.</p>
<p>The intervention comes around the second anniversary of DIDs becoming an official web standard, after the specification was adopted as a W3C recommendation.</p>
<p>"Getting one organization to agree on something is hard. And getting multiple orgs to agree? If the reason is important enough, you find a way. Empowering individuals with digital identities they control is one of them," said DIF's Executive Director, Kim Hamilton Duffy.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful to Decentralized Identity Foundation, Digital Credentials Consortium, Trust Over IP Foundation for their leadership, and to the numerous community members (from W3C and beyond) for pulling this together in a very tight timeframe -- over a holiday weekend, in fact", she added.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/issues/278?ref=blog.identity.foundation">github issue</a> -- please upvote if you support DIDs!</p>
<p>DIF releases Credential Trust Establishment white paper</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIF's Credential Trust Establishment Working Group released a new white paper titled "Decentralizing Trust in Identity Systems", describing how to achieve scaleable trust relationships in decentralized identity networks.</p>
<p>The problem of trust in a decentralized identity ecosystem comes down to the simple question of whether a credential verifier should trust the issuer of a credential. This problem becomes increasingly complex as networks expand to include many credential issuers and delegated trust relationships.</p>
<p>The paper explores different trust network architectures, comparing risks, benefits, and tradeoffs. It highlights the advantages of the Credential Trust Establishment Specification, offering practical recommendations for developing and managing of trust networks.</p>
<p>Check out the annoucement <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/decentralizing-trust-in-identity-systems/">here</a> and read the white paper <a href="https://identity.foundation/publications/DecentralizingTrustInIdentitySystems.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>.</p>
  🛠️ Working Group Updates  
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">💡Identifiers and Discovery Work Group</a> 
<p>The Linked Verifiable Presentation (VP) work item is completed now the spec has been ratified by the Steering Committee.  "It's a really nice spec, simple and useful. JC did a great job managing it and promoting it to the right people at conferences. All in all a very successful work item!" said co-chair Markus Sabadello.</p>
<p>A potential new work item, DID Traits, was presented by the group's new co-chair, JC Ebersbach at DICE, generating interest from the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP) and Open Wallet Foundation (OWF) among others. "The idea is to establish a list of traits and map these to DID methods, in order to provide a first assessment of how DID methods are different and help implementers decide which DID method(s) to use." JC said.</p>
<p>Several updates have been applied to the Universal Resolver, related to support for did:key and did:kscirc (a Korean DID method).</p>
<p>Identifiers and Discovery meets bi-weekly at 11am PT/ 2pmET/ 8pm CET Mondays</p>
 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/crypto-wg/blob/main/agenda.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">🔐 Applied Crypto WG</a> 
<p>The BBS Signature Scheme is continuing to move forward, with further great progress this month.</p>
<p>The draft specifications for Blind BBS Signatures and BBS Pseudonyms have been updated and lodged with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), following the submission of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Draft 6</a> of the overall specification at the end of last month.</p>
<p>Blind signatures are digital signatures over messages not known to the Signer. A pseudonym is a value that will remain constant each time a Prover presents a BBS proof to the same Verifier, but will be different (and unlinkable), when the Prover interacts with a different Verifier. This provides a way for a recipient (Verifier) to track the presentations intended for them, while also hindering them from tracking the Prover's interactions with other Verifiers.</p>
<p>The DIF Crypto - BBS work item meets weekly  at 11am PT/2pm ET /8pm CET Mondays</p>
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">📦 Secure Data Storage</a> 
<p>This month, the Decentralized Web Node (DWN) Task Force is excited to announce a partnership with Google and TBD to support community decentralized web node hosting (see DIF News, above). This marks a significant milestone in the development of personal data stores. On the WG activity front, lively discussions about versioning have been ongoing, primarily focusing on semantic consistency and timing considerations. The DWN WG has also been exploring ways to enhance adoption and onboarding tools for the Decentralized Web. These discussions include ideas such as a "block explorer" for protocol discovery and thin client support to reduce computational overhead for specific operations.</p>
<p>DIF/CCG Secure Data Storage WG - DWN Task Force meets bi-weekly at 9am PT/12pm ET/6pm CET Wednesdays</p>
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Claims &amp; Credentials Working Group</a> 
<p>The Credential Schemas group, led by co-chairs Otto Mora and Jim Schoening, has been compiling a unified glossary (based on the IEEE ontologies) of common terms intended to form the basis for a KYC Personal Data Model. Over 20 sources have been assessed, including Google and Meta Takeout Data, the HL7 and FHIR health data standards, OIDC Core data model, ISO mDOC and ISO 18013-5 (mDL). This will help further progress on this initial KYC schema, with more schemas to follow later including AML, Proof of Humanity, and Proof of Age.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in any of the Working Groups highlighted above, or any of DIF's other Working Groups, please click <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>.</p>
  📖 Open Groups at DIF  
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/veramo-usergroup/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Veramo User Group</a> 
<p>The next release of Veramo will include an update to the credential plugin system, making it easy to extend with new proof formats. Currently, adding a new proof format requires an upstream change to Veramo, but after this release such plugins can be developed entirely independently.</p>
<p>Other recent updates include some compatibility fixes, pruning some of the dependencies that were causing issues in react-native environments.</p>
<p>Meetings take place weekly on Thursdays, alternating between Noon EST / 18.00 CET and 09.00 EST / 15.00 CET.  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/veramo-usergroup?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Click here</a> for more details</p>

<p>ID Day</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a coalition partner of ID4Africa, DIF urges our members to celebrate The Right To Be Visible on ID Day, 16th September 2024.</p>
<p>Having proof of one’s identity is a fundamental human right, and a practical necessity, especially in the context of this modern digital age. Very few social constructs play as foundational a role in our lives as personal identity, yet the world does not commemorate it. Through a dedicated commemorative day, we hope to promote a responsible narrative about the most important human asset – our legal identity.</p>
<p>ID Day sensitizes us to the plight of those who lack proof of identity (estimated at 850 million, with about half in Africa) and reaffirms our commitment to achieving total inclusion, so that no one is left behind.</p>
<p>The choice of the date 16 September (16.9) is highly symbolic. It is in commemoration of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9 which calls for the provision of legal identity for all by 2030, including birth registration.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.id-day.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">ID Day website</a> for ideas for ways to celebrate ID Day, and plenty of resources to help you do so.</p>

<p>Elastos BeL2 (Bitcoin Elastos Layer2) has secured a $25,000 grant from <a href="https://www.starknet.io/">Starknet</a>, a technology leader in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). This significant endorsement highlights the Elastos BeL2 infrastructure and its critical role in advancing Native Bitcoin DeFi, particularly native Bitcoin lending. By integrating Starknet ZKPs and the Cairo programming language, Elastos’ BeL2 will enhance its ability to deliver smart contracts and decentralized apps (dapps) without moving Bitcoin (BTC) assets off the main network. This strategic partnership with Starknet demonstrates the growing acceptance and maturity of the BeL2 infrastructure, reinforcing Elastos’ commitment to market leadership in the evolving Bitcoin DeFi market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.starknet.io/">Starknet</a>, developed by StarkWare, is renowned for its advances in ZKP technology, which enhance the privacy and security of blockchain transactions. ZKPs allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This technology is fundamental to scaling blockchain networks, which will enhance BeL2’s ability to integrate complex smart contracts while maintaining Bitcoin’s integrity and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are delighted to receive this Starknet grant and announce our partnership to build tighter integrations with its ZKP technology and the Cairo programming language,” said Sasha Mitchell, Head of Bitcoin Layer 2, Elastos. “This is a major milestone for BeL2 and a real endorsement of the maturity and capabilities of our core technology. This support will allow us to further build out our Native Bitcoin lending innovation, as we look to leverage the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a viable alternative financial system.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closer integration with Cairo will enable BeL2 to use this powerful programming language to enhance Bitcoin’s capabilities and deliver secure, efficient, and scalable decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Specifically, the relationship with Cairo strengthens BeL2’s leading technical innovations, which include:</p>
 
 ZKPs to ensure secure and private transaction verification 
 Decentralized arbitration using collateralized nodes to supervise and enforce eairness in Native Bitcoin DeFi 
 BTC Oracle facilitating cross-chain interactions where information, not assets, are exchanged while Bitcoin remains on the main infrastructure 
 
<p>BeL2’s vision extends beyond technical innovation to pioneering a new financial system. The goal is to build a Bitcoin-backed Bretton Woods system, addressing global debt crises and enhancing Bitcoin’s role as a global hard currency. This new system will be anchored by the integrity and security of Bitcoin, providing a stable foundation for decentralized financial applications.</p>
<p>As the integration with Starknet and the Cairo programming language expands, BeL2 will deliver further advancements in smart contract capabilities, decentralized arbitration, and innovative financial products. At Token 2049, BeL2 will demonstrate further innovations in its core technologies, particularly around arbiters, which will underline the Elastos vision to deliver a more equitable, decentralized financial system anchored by Bitcoin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 9 in 10 submissions to the inaugural DIF Hackathon last October used Web5 and DWNs. There’s obviously a lot of interest in this! Did that surprise you?&nbsp;</p><p>In a way, no. There’s only so much you can do with Decentralized Identifiers and VCs on their own. The majority of use cases today are these stodgy things like government credentials or proving your humanness.&nbsp;</p><p>The IAM (Identity and Access Management) industry has a very dry view of identity. A human wouldn’t think “my login credentials are my identity”. A person thinks of their identity as more a reflection of a certain part or all of who they are.&nbsp;</p><p>For too long both the IAM and the Decentralized Identity communities were focused on boring stuff like government credentials. I don’t love it when I need to show my driver’s license. We’ve centrered the ecosystem around things that are done begrudgingly, they’re not fun for users. I think that’s maybe why the long tail of developers have not embraced DI yet.&nbsp;</p><p>What we’re trying for with Web5 is, go build the next Eventbrite or social network on this. It’s things that are more exciting for developers AND users. I think that’s what’s driving the interest in D-Web Nodes.&nbsp;</p><p>What was the journey that led you to be involved in working on the DWN specification?&nbsp;</p><p>My interest in this area grew while I was working at Mozilla. After researching Microsoft’s position in identity, I saw it as an opportunity to pursue what I was really interested in. I didn’t want to do another stint on browser stuff, so I was going to give it a year at Microsoft to see if I could work on what I really wanted to work on, coming in under the auspices of Browser.&nbsp;</p><p>After about six months Microsoft agreed yes, we should pursue some means of user-owned identity. None of the social oAuth is owned by Microsoft and if they could disintermediate the federated identity providers, that would be good for Microsoft. So they said, “let's take a shot”.&nbsp;</p><p>Solving identifiers in a decentralized way was necessary, in order to get onto more interesting problems. How would you create decentralized storage for apps, for instance, if you didn’t know how to store the data in reference to an identifier controlled by the data’s owner? You have to have the identifier before you can have the subsequent pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>So I had the opportunity to work on this stuff at Microsoft, to help get it pretty far along. But then there was this great opportunity to go work for Block, building out the piece that I’d actually wanted to work on back at Mozilla.</p><p>That’s where I think most of identity actually is. It's in people’s data. The content of your Tweets tells people more about you than your handle. Who cares how you’re logged in? What defines you is all the stuff you do after you log in. So the data store piece is huge and we’ve been contributing to that work at Block.&nbsp;</p><p>You helped establish DIF in 2016. Did you envisage back then the timescale for Decentralized Identity to get to where it is today?&nbsp;</p><p>I naively thought “we’ll just work with some browser vendors and be done with identity in a few years, then get onto the fun stuff”. It didn’t happen like that! I got a lot of Nos, a lot of people said “nothing needs to be decentralized”. But I was intentional about what I was doing, and I don’t like giving up. I wanted it to work so badly, and still do.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we got stuck in a rut with the IAM crowd, where they were using DIDs that were just keys. They thought, I don’t need to find content. It really neuters what you can do. I don’t think the world moves forward just because we have a couple of proofs we can pull out of our digital wallet instead of our physical wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>It might not be anything I’ve worked on that ends up being The Thing. That’s not important. What’s important is that Decentralized Identity comes to be, in some form. I do think it’s an idea whose time has come. I see all the signs. Like social media cancellations, deprivations of service, spam bots everywhere. It’s not stopping, it’s only accelerating. People are becoming concerned and they need something to turn to.&nbsp;</p><p>Who knows if DWNs end up being The Thing? I think it’s a good candidate / first pass approach, and I hope people like it. As long as options are there, someone’s going to pick up these tools and make them well-known. There’s going to be that break out moment. I’ll just keep working on it until either we get there or I can’t work anymore.</p><p>How long will it take for that breakout moment to arrive? Are there still big obstacles to adoption, in your view?</p><p>Getting DID resolution and DID-relative resources as standard functions of the browser, like DNS resolution is today, would be the single greatest thing for this entire ecosystem. Support for non-DNS origins has been a real sticking point historically. We need to get browser vendors to recognise other sorts of URIs aligned to the same-origin security model. The IPFS crowd has got this started. IPFS addresses have their own origin. It’s slowly happening.&nbsp;</p><p>DIDs being seen as first-class origins is THE thing. Once you convince them that’s ok, resolution of content follows. I don’t think the tech is mature enough yet, but I do think we have the beat on some candidate DID methods that browser vendors would be more inclined to adopt, that still have a full range of features.&nbsp;</p><p>On the data stores side, it’s great to have Tim Berners-Lee involved with Solid. I might not love every single technical decision of that project, but it’s a great thing that he is spearheading it.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we’re probably still five years from a breakout. We need to convince browser vendors that this is worthwhile. Until everyone has a browser that can resolve DIDs and show something visual, you’re looking at one-off use cases. It’s such a simple but important piece.&nbsp;</p><p>It sounds as though DWNs can help bridge to a world where browsers are able to resolve DIDs and find DID-linked resources?&nbsp;</p><p>Absolutely! We’ll be presenting some demos soon that show browsers finding DID-related data, even without an extension. Being able to click DID-relative links on the internet and have the data be visually rendered from someone’s personal data store is awesome! It’s by far the most interesting piece, and the number one thing that will make it real for people.&nbsp;</p><p>Where do Big Tech, social media and the Web3 community stand on Decentralized Identity?&nbsp;</p><p>When I started at Microsoft it was years before the spam problem really blew up, with all these crypto bots on Twitter and so on.&nbsp; They didn’t believe it was going to be a problem. Then AI came along. Now, bots are better at being human than some humans. I suspect these services are being overrun and if they don’t figure it out soon, there’s going to be a dramatic loss of quality on their platform and it will start to hit revenues. Recruiters don’t want to see a bunch of fraudulent profiles, so it makes sense for LinkedIn to make them verifiable. There’s probably a premium you can put on that, on certain services.&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralization isn’t something that’s unheard of in the social sphere. People understand it. 12 years ago it was this kookie conspiracy theory that you’d be concerned about who controls your twitter account. Ironically, centralized services and authoritarian regimes have been the best spokespeople for decentralization. By carrying out these bans, by suppressing people’s ideas and opinions, they have sold the world on the fact that they should not be in control of our data. Hats off to them!&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re talking about global social networks, it’s a harder economic question. One of the common arguments I hear against decentralization is, “how is it going to be paid for?” My response is “you'll pay for it, if you care about it”. People pay for Google Drive and all sorts of other services with a storage component. It’s not weird. People will pay to protect what’s theirs. From there out, you can work on models for services with an aggregation component.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Re Web3, there’s a blockchain crowd that wants to insert tokenization everywhere. Some do it because the way they make money is if there’s a token in the middle.&nbsp; Others don’t know there might be a better way that’s faster and cheaper and doesn’t require tokens. There are almost zero drawbacks to using a personal data store, versus putting things on a blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Where do DWNs fit into the larger SSI tech ecosystem?&nbsp;</p><p>I think with all three components of DIDs, VCs and personal data stores together in one platform, we’ll be able to see people really for the first time create apps that are respectful of users, that put you more in control. It’s not about decentralization for its own sake. There are real benefits that make it different from what’s available today. For example, imagine a social media platform that lets you choose your own algorithm.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the journey we’re on. It’s not one that’s unique to me, there are lots of other people working on this, including lots of data store projects in the DID &amp; VC space.&nbsp;</p><p>Final thoughts?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s going to be more delivered that we’ve long been working on from the TBD side, all open source, that gives more to users finally, than just developers.&nbsp; That’s what I’m looking forward to. I hope we get to have a much different conversation towards the end of 2024, having seen these things roll out, the standards stabilize and starting to have these discussions with the larger entities that are needed to get this to the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

 Championing European Gymnastics with Borderless Knowledge enabled by Artificial Intelligence and OriginTrail <p><a href="https://www.europeangymnastics.com/">European Gymnastics</a> is a sports organisation counting 50 national member federations, and reaches beyond the borders of political Europe. It nevertheless bears the idea of a united gymnastics nation. As guarantor of interests of its around 8,500,000 gymnasts, European Gymnastics represents many different facets. From high-level competitive sports in four Olympic, and three non-Olympic disciplines to leisure sports in gymnastics for all with offers for all age groups, from toddlers to senior citizens. European Gymnastics transmit their understanding of being together beyond borders and set an example in community.</p><p>Now, European Gymnastics is launching its own Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant powered by <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> to drive borderless knowledge in order to further their mission to promote, develop and support synergy among the community to make Gymnastics and gymnasts at all levels, shine. The friendly mascot Luigi who you can meet at all major European Gymnastics events, is now receiving its digital twin. Powered by AI, digital Luigi allows anyone to learn and keep in touch with the European Gymnastics community. From finding the information about the next competition to learning about​​ important events in European Gymnastics history or helping you understand which elements are important for scoring a routine on parallel bars — all can be discovered with the help of the AI-powered Luigi.</p><p>The uniqueness of our digital Luigi is that his responses always include sources of information, allowing the user to explore any particular source further. This capability is unlocked by using OriginTrail’s Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is promising to unlock an even more powerful Luigi assistant as it will allow the initial knowledge base to continuously expand, not only by European Gymnastics’s inputs but also with contributions of the national federations, gymnasts and fans. As OriginTrail is based on blockchain, all such contributions will also be protected against tampering — extending European Gymnastics’s commitment to integrity from the sport halls to managing&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today’s launch of Luigi is accompanied by the launch of the biggest sporting event in the world — the Olympic Games. To help you navigate all the performances by European gymnasts in Paris, Luigi is already equipped with knowledge about the schedule and will also be receiving updates about results every&nbsp;day.</p><p>“European Gymnastics is excited to keep pushing the innovation in our sport. After being the first continental gymnastics federation to launch a digital cup competition this year, we are now making first steps into adopting Artificial Intelligence and blockchain to improve the ease of interaction with what is sometimes considered a complex world of Gymnastics. This is an important step in our newly adopted Strategy 2030, embracing top technology which has a lot to offer..” Dr. Farid Gayibov, European Gymnastics President.</p><p>You can find Luigi’s digital twin on the <a href="https://europeangymnastics.com/ask">European Gymnastics website</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/championing-european-gymnastics-with-borderless-knowledge-enabled-by-artificial-intelligence-and-f49dae6f6e25">Championing European Gymnastics with Borderless Knowledge enabled by Artificial Intelligence and…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>About a month ago one of our founders, Joel Thorstensson, released an <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/private-data-architecture/1585?ref=blog.ceramic.network">initial overview</a> of our plans to begin ideating how physical private data capabilities could be natively offered to developers using the Ceramic Network. The forum post includes details of how this would be rolled out in two phases in the form of a proof-of-concept, which is advisable to read before consuming this article.</p><p>It's also important to mention the motivation behind this effort. To start, Ceramic doesn't currently offer any native privacy features. This means that all data on Ceramic is public by default. At the same time, over the past few years, we've recognized the strong need for access control across several applications and use cases. A rough estimation would be almost half of all apps built on Ceramic have access control needs in one form or another.</p><p> In thinking about a solution, we aligned on the premise that physical access control (where data lives and who can sync it, as opposed to encryption) resonates most directly with the uniqueness of Ceramic's event-based architecture and our desire to align with edge privacy principles.</p><p>As such, our next step was to define a scope around a minimalist build to showcase how physical data privacy could be implemented in Ceramic.</p> Phase 1: API Read Access Control <p>If you've read Joel's forum post (linked above), you already know the details of the concept we've designed for this first phase. However, below are several key takeaways:</p>  Builds on <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic-one</a> (implementation of the Ceramic protocol, written in Rust)  Leverages the Feed API on Ceramic-one nodes, thus allowing nodes to filter the feed of events based on which permissions a user has  Designed to showcase how two users could share private data from the same node by leveraging object-capabilities (OCAP)  Shows how an object-capability generated by user 1 references a stream containing the data they want to share (as well as the DID corresponding to user 2, the person they want to share their data with) and allows user 2 to access data that would otherwise be physically inaccessible to query and obtain without the OCAP  <p>This article will walk through how to run the PoC locally.</p><p>If you prefer video, please view the YouTube version of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNiUlGremBQ&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Private Data Playground</a>:</p> Setting Up Your Environment <p>This walk-through requires you to generate clones of two repositories, one of which is the PoC itself, while the other is the Rust-Ceramic codebase.</p> Rust-Ceramic Set-Up <p>First, install protobuf:</p> <code># You can alternatively use `brew install protobuf`

PROTOC_ZIP=protoc-$PROTOC_VERSION-linux-x86_64.zip
curl --retry 3 --retry-max-time 90 -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v$PROTOC_VERSION/$PROTOC_ZIP \
    &amp;&amp; unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc \
    &amp;&amp; unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*' \
    &amp;&amp; rm -f $PROTOC_ZIP</code> <p>Next, clone the Rust-Ceramic codebase:</p> <code># we will need a special branch from the repo
git clone https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic &amp;&amp; cd rust-ceramic &amp;&amp; git fetch</code> <p>We need to set up our Rust-Ceramic node from a specific branch. Enter the branch relevant to this PoC, build, and run the daemon:</p> <code># enter the special branch
git checkout feat/private-data

# build and run
cargo run -p ceramic-one -- daemon</code> <p>If your terminal starts populating with logs like the screenshot below, you've successfully started your node!</p><p>You now have an active Ceramic node running in the background! Next, we'll walk through the configuration for the private data playground web app.</p> Private Data Playground Web App Setup <p>First, clone the Private Data Playground repository:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/private-data-playground</code> <p>Go ahead and open the private-data-playground repo in your text editor of choice. Once open, we will need to create a copy of the example environment file and rename it:</p> <code>cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Our first step is to supply a value to our <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID</code> variable by setting up a Project ID with WalletConnect. You can set one up for free (if you don't already have one) by following the simple steps in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/walletconnect-tutorial/">WalletConnect tutorial</a> (under "Obtain a WalletConnect Project ID). We will need this given that our application's Wagmi hooks rely on a contextual wrapper that will allow us to leverage these hooks within all child components, and use <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/appkit/overview?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal</a>.</p><p>Once obtained, paste this into your new environment file next to the variable name referenced above.</p><p>Next, install your dependencies:</p> <code>npm install</code> <p>We're now ready to run the PoC!</p> Running the Application <p>Start up your application from within the private-data-playground repository in developer mode to initiate the UI:</p> <code>npm run dev</code> <p>You should now be able to access the UI by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:3000/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser!</p> Creating a Stream and a Capability <p>Our first section will focus on generating a stream (containing a simple message) and an OCAP. </p><p>To begin, self-authenticate by clicking "Connect Wallet." </p><p>You should see a secondary signature request appear after selecting an account - approving this request will create a browser session (specific to your DID, stemming from your Eth address) that the application will use to sign and submit data on your behalf as you create messages:</p><p>There are two views contained in this simple PoC - one for writing data, and one for reading. Make sure you're in the "Write" view by clicking the toggle under your address:</p><p>Go ahead and enter a simple message of your choosing - for example, "I love Ceramic!" would be an obvious choice. Go ahead and click the "Create" button. This action initiates a process that builds a new Ceramic stream and constructs your message into a payload that the Rust-Ceramic feed API will accept.</p><p>You should now see the resulting identifier under "Stream ID":</p><p>Go ahead and copy this value. Save it somewhere as it's needed later (a simple text document will suffice). </p><p>Finally, select another Eth address you control (make sure to remember which one) and enter it into the text input under "Delegate read access to". When ready, click "Create Capability". If you've followed all the steps correctly, your screen should look something like this:</p><p>Copy the capability value somewhere you can reference for the next section.</p><p>Congrats! You've successfully created both a Ceramic stream and a capability object! The next section will show how to use these to access otherwise private data.</p> Using the OCAP to Access Private Data <p>Go ahead and disconnect your current authenticated account from the web app. Next, go through the sign-in flow using the address you selected for the "Delegate read access to" input from the prior section.</p><p>Once authenticated, navigate to the "Read" toggle in the web app:</p><p>Enter the Stream ID and the Capability generated and saved from the prior section.</p><p>If you've copied over the values correctly, you should now be able to view the original message:</p><p>Congratulations - you've successfully used a capability to access otherwise private data on Ceramic. </p><p>You can also run through the "Read" process again, but this time make an arbitrary edit to the OCAP (thus invalidating it). With the Stream ID value kept the same, you'll notice that you no longer access the resulting message.</p> Next Steps <p>This minimal PoC is only the beginning of our plans for rolling out private data on Ceramic, with phase 2 coming soon (showcasing data privacy in the form of nodes and their ability to sync data between each other based on signed capabilities).</p><p>Is private data relevant to what you're building? Have feedback, questions, or concerns about our current thinking around private data? We'd love to hear from you! Fill out our <a href="https://ceramic.network/contact-us?ref=blog.ceramic.network">community contact form</a>, or email us at <a>partners@3box.io</a>. </p><p>Happy buidling!</p>

 Authors: Gail Hodges, Joseph Heenan, Dima Postnikov, Mark Haine, Mike Leszcz, Elizabeth Garber&nbsp; 
<p>Following our <a href="https://openid.net/letter-cfpb-open-banking/">May 16 open letter</a> to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the OpenID Foundation has been engaged in discussions about their rule-making on Personal Financial Data Rights. This post summarizes <a title="our guidance to the CFPB" href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/OIDF-Ex-Parte-Prefiling-Meeting_CFPB-July-17-2024_Recommendation.pdf">our guidance to the CFPB</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Image-7-24-24-at-11.02 AM-e1721833438971.jpeg"></a></p>
 Why are we engaged? 
<p>The OpenID Foundation is committed to supporting Open Banking ecosystems worldwide – all ecosystems that rely on identity data. In particular, we develop and continuously iterate upon world-class identity standards that improve security and underpin interoperability. This creates conditions for competitive marketplaces that protect consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering this guidance to the CFPB, we are answering a call from those seeking to enhance the security of US digital infrastructure. In its <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf">March 2024 report</a>, the United States Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) called on us to continue iterating on our standards to ensure they are fit for purpose in use cases requiring heightened security – and they called on Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to adopt those standards. We believe that the US Open Banking ecosystem, to best protect consumer data, should follow suit.&nbsp;</p>
 FAPI as a Secure Communications Protocol 
<p>We recommend that the CFPB, in its rule-making, ensures the use of a secure communications protocol for the exchange of identity data. We also propose that the widely adopted <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/specifications/">FAPI family of specifications</a> performs this role.</p>
<p>The FAPI profile enhances the OAuth 2.0 framework for high-security use cases. It is based on an advanced <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-attacker-model.html">attacker model</a> and closes critical security gaps that OAuth 2.0 does not address. We provided the CFPB with the example of Client Authentication:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This slide also shows how each jurisdiction may develop its own local profile for any final configuration choices.</p>
<p>Current global ecosystem adoption of FAPI includes:&nbsp;</p>

 The Benefits of Interoperability 
<p>By reducing the optionality inherent in the OAuth 2.0 framework, FAPI also promotes interoperability within and across ecosystems. We shared an example of one startup that sought to integrate with the US and other banks &amp; open banking partners globally. They encountered a wide variety of:</p>
 
 Cryptographic Methods, including less secure signing methods (covered by FAPI) 
 Client Authentication, including less secure authentication methods (covered by FAPI) 
 Data formats and payloads, each of which required interpretation&nbsp; 
 Approaches to data minimization, including many cases of receiving more data than requested 
 Security Culture &amp; Practices, enabling the selection of less secure options (somewhat addressed by selecting FAPI) 
 
<p>This wide variety prevents interoperability and places heavy burdens on fintechs and new market entrants. Interoperability, on the other hand, ensures:</p>
 
 A level playing field for new fintech entrants 
 Less reliance on aggregators 
 Opportunities for banks and fintechs to work with partners across borders (see “<a href="https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf">Open Banking and Open Data: Ready to Cross Borders</a>?” and our contributions to the “<a href="https://openid.net/cg/gain-poc/">Global Assured Identity Network</a>” and “<a href="https://sidi-hub.community">Sustainable Interoperable Digital Identity</a>” movements) 
 
<p>Our original <a href="http://openid.net/letter-to-the-cfpb-on-us-open-banking">Open Letter</a> provides more information about FAPI and its role in underpinning security and interoperability.</p>
 Other Relevant Standards: Federation and Shared Signals 
<p>While the conversation with the CFPB began as a strong recommendation to name a secure communications protocol, we would be remiss if we did not also refer to other OpenID Standards designed to improve the security and viability of open data ecosystems. In particular:</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>&nbsp;is designed to quickly establish trust between parties who have been onboarded to an ecosystem. This is how banks can ensure that data requests are coming from legitimate actors – and how legitimate actors can quickly gain access to an open banking ecosystem.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals </a>and Events is an open API built upon a protocol suite that enables applications and service providers to communicate about security events to make dynamic access and authorization decisions. It acts as a signaling layer on a back channel that helps secure near real-time sessions. We wrote about its benefits in a read-out from a recent interoperability event <a href="https://openid.net/shared-signals-enhanced-security-for-all/">here.</a> 
 
 What’s Next? 
<p>The OpenID Foundation is engaged in ongoing discussions with the CFPB and is exploring the requirements for approved standard-setting bodies. Those interested in promoting a secure and thriving Open Banking ecosystem in the United States and around the world should stay tuned!</p>
 About the OpenID Foundation 
 The OpenID Foundation (OIDF) is a global open standards body committed to helping people assert their identity wherever they choose. Founded in 2007, we are a community of technical experts leading the creation of open identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy-preserving. The Foundation’s OpenID Connect standard is now used by billions of people across millions of applications. In the last five years, the Financial Grade API has become the standard of choice for Open Banking and Open Data implementations, allowing people to access and share data across entities. Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments, and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

<p>Today, we are excited to announce our latest research exposing the massively networked personal information sharing happening between and across identity resolution and customer data platforms that has been hiding in plain sight for over 10 years. These industries are the plumbing backbone in synthesizing personal data from hundreds of data sources—across services, devices, and spanning the digital world and the physical world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In February 2024, Cracked Labs published <a href="https://crackedlabs.org/en/identity-surveillance">“Pervasive identity surveillance for marketing purposes”</a>, an in-depth analysis of LiveRamp’s RampID identity graph. One of the most superficial yet most powerful functions of this excellent report was to guide attention towards industries responsible for pervasive consumer surveillance. The timing was excellent as I’d already committed to present “The Hidden Identity Infrastructure” at Identiverse (May 2024) and prompted by the report, I dug in to better understand the two industries underpinning hidden identity infrastructure, namely, Identity Resolution (ID Res) and Customer Data Platforms (CDPs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are nearly $9T worth of industries worldwide that rely on persistent, hidden identification of people. Naturally, demand of this magnitude fueled the now mature industries that perform pervasive, universal identification of people and their personal information. ISL identified over 350 companies providing either identity resolution platforms, customer data platforms, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This paper explores the magnitude and reach of these two industries, how they came to be, and most importantly, why, from a human well-being perspective, it’s crucial that these kinds of platforms be held to higher regulatory standards of scrutiny, transparency, and accountability. One identity resolution company alone out of 93&nbsp; such companies (worldwide) boasts the collection of 5,000 data elements for [each of] 700 million consumers in 2021. To put this in perspective, the number of user accounts breached worldwide in 2023 was about 300 million1. Is there an appreciable difference between stolen user data and undisclosed “legitimate” personally identifiable information sharing? Moreover, nearly 40% of the 93 companies that provide identity resolution platforms are registered data brokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, after reviewing the research, we must ask ourselves, is this the kind of world we want to live in: a world where everything about us is always known by industry; a world where the ongoing surveillance of people is deemed necessary in the name of capitalism. Is this the kind of world in which humans and societies will flourish or self-destruct? Are humans more than capitalistic consumers? Are we more than our purchasing potential?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A Call to Action&nbsp; 
<p>ISL conducted this research to help illuminate the sizable risk of hidden identification and the worldwide web of user surveillance. ISL believes naming and exposure is crucial to effecting change. Identification resolution and customer data platforms have been hiding in plain sight for more than a decade, and yet even the “identerati” are largely unfamiliar with these industries. How can we expect everyday people to know?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This paper is a rallying call for privacy advocates to come together to demand greater regulatory scrutiny, transparency and oversight for these industries, in conjunction with more meaningful data broker regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, this is a rallying call to acknowledge the catastrophic failure of notice and consent as a valid permissioning mechanism for highly complex and interconnected digital services. It’s inconceivable that people understand the magnitude of data sharing that consenting to sharing “your data with our marketing” entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves if this is the kind of world we want for ourselves and our children, where our preferences, practices, relationships, behaviors, and beliefs are all up for sale and broadly shared without our awareness. Are we ourselves in fact being sold?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technologies fueling these capabilities have received billions of dollars; consumers don’t have a chance in the face of voracious hunger to identify, know, and manipulate them. We hope that this research shines a much needed light on the forces enabling the worldwide web of human surveillance so that they may be held to accountability for their troves of data on nearly all internet users.&nbsp;</p>

 Elastos unveils BeL2 SDKs for partners to develop Native Bitcoin Apps and StarBTC demo DeFi app to extract value from dormant Bitcoin 
 StarBTC first prototype for arbiter nodes and smart contracts enable collateralization of up to 80% of Bitcoin assets 
 Elastos BeL2 offers significant premiums for node owners staking Bitcoin (BTC) on the Bitcoin Network on top of existing APR rewards 
 
<p>Singapore: July 25, 2024 – Elastos, the SmartWeb ecosystem provider, today announced innovations that enable native Bitcoin staking on the Bitcoin network. Partners can use the Elastos BeL2 Software Development Kit (SDK) to build Native Bitcoin decentralized apps (dApps) to encourage staking of the estimated value of more than 1 trillion dollars in dormant bitcoins. The BeL2 SDK will be demonstrated at Bitcoin Nashville 2024 alongside the StarBTC demo loan app, showcasing BeL2’s native Bitcoin DeFi solutions as a decentralized clearing network service.</p>
<p>With BeL2, users can stake Bitcoin directly on the Bitcoin network. This allows for the transmission of transaction proofs, rather than assets, across chains, enabling users to enter Layer 2 environments and utilize BTC in various DeFi applications. The StarBTC demo app shows how staked BTC can be used as collateral for stablecoin loans, maintaining Bitcoin on its main network and leveraging BeL2’s ZKP technology and decentralized arbitration for secure transactions.</p>
<p>The BeL2 Protocol enables direct collateralization of Bitcoin without bridging or wrapping, preserving Bitcoin’s security and integrity while avoiding network congestion and fees. The StarBTC demo app shows how arbiter nodes facilitate communication between the Bitcoin and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains to verify transaction proofs using BeL2’s Zero-Knowledge-Proof (ZKP) process to ensure all conditions are met for collateral release.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The combination of our innovations around arbiter nodes and the BeL2 SDK will enable developers and node holders to earn significant premiums from staking Bitcoin,” said Jonathan Hargreaves, Global Head of Business Development &amp; ESG, Elastos. “We estimate the Native Bitcoin DeFi market could grow by over $1 Trillion, with potential in industries from creative arts to retail.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elastos’ BeL2 lets users run zkBTC full nodes on mobile phones, creating a decentralized Bitcoin DeFi network. These nodes ensure security by allowing users to verify transactions themselves. Upgraded zkBTC nodes can become arbiters, earning fees for helping others manage loans and time-based transactions. This system supports Bitcoin staking and rewards nodes with upcoming BeL2 assets and BTC fees. To prevent collusion, anyone can challenge arbitrators by submitting proof of misconduct for punishment and compensation. Arbiter nodes are backed by BTC and Elastos SmartWeb’s ELA coin, which is secured by up to 50% of Bitcoin miners’ hashpower, including BTC.com, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and BinancePool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This model enhances the Bitcoin network by increasing the number of full nodes, essential for maintaining decentralization and security. Incentivizing node participation strengthens the network’s robustness and resilience. Full nodes validate transactions and blocks, contributing to the blockchain’s overall health. Increased participation fosters a secure and trustworthy environment for Bitcoin transactions, crucial for decentralized finance adoption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BeL2 SDK simplifies development, enhances security, and offers innovation opportunities by abstracting complex blockchain interactions and ZKP operations. This allows developers to integrate Bitcoin functionality with minimal effort. Additionally, Elastos provides a ZKP Explorer for verifying zero-knowledge proofs, enhancing transparency and trust within the BeL2 ecosystem.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<p>“Our vision is to establish a new global financial system anchored by Bitcoin and enhance its role as a global hard currency,” said Sasha Mitchell, Head of Bitcoin Layer 2 (BeL2), Elastos. “The launch of the BeL2 Protocol, the StarBTC demo app, and the BeL2 SDK is inspiring our partners to explore DeFi opportunities. We are excited to work with Layer 2s like BEVM and B² Network to demonstrate how Native Bitcoin DeFi can open up new economic opportunities.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BeL2 SDK is a critical element of the Elastos strategy to build a vibrant ecosystem using the BeL2 Protocol. Partners are developing key technologies, integrations, and dApps, including <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastos-bevm-enhance-bitcoin-bel2/">BEVM</a>’s peer-to-peer Bitcoin-denominated loan offering and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/b2-selects-bel2-protocol-develop-native-bitcoin-dapps-elastosinfo-lmntf/?trackingId=q7T8%2FsvxTuSXJ8daL1%2FF4A%3D%3D">B² Network</a>’s Layer 2 EVM execution environment. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196762982188515328/">Conflux</a>, the only regulatory-compliant, public, and permissionless Blockchain in China, is integrating with BeL2 to facilitate Bitcoin-denominated transactions and exchanges. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7195705758347358209">Tuna Chain</a> is a Layer 2 solution ensuring interoperability between ecosystems, leveraging Elastos’ Bitcoin Oracle for real-time data on Bitcoin-assured activity. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7192914160274288641">EastBlue</a>, a Bitcoin super app, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7216379562597769219">Spending Power</a>, a Web3 e-commerce platform, are also creating integrations with BeL2. This will connect EastBlue users to Elastos’ full portfolio of dApps and enable developers to create Native Bitcoin apps compatible with Spending Power’s offering.</p>

<p>It was a different story in industry, however, where the occasion was covered by&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/07/10/government-bringing-in-new-digital-trust-framework/">DINZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2018946184/government-bringing-in-new-digital-trust-framework">nationally by RNZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thepress.co.nz/business/350322132/digital-identity-regulator-launched-usher-start-brave-new-world">locally</a>, internationally by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202407/new-zealand-trust-framework-looks-to-onboard-digital-id-providers">Biometric Update</a>&nbsp;and social media posts, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-w-7921274/recent-activity/all/">my own</a>&nbsp;and those from<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219461359028121601/">&nbsp;DINZ</a>.</p>



<p>The quote that really stuck was this one from Victoria University’s Professor of Informatics&nbsp;<a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/markus.luczak-roesch">Markus Luczak-Roesch</a>: “There’s a huge risk of doing nothing. Which is why it’s good that we’re doing something.” He’s absolutely right. It’s been over seven years of policy work at the DIA to reach this point, which I described as<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7215637634742726656/">&nbsp;‘the end of the beginning</a>’.

<p>Additionally, the event will cover Digital Public Infrastructure, AI, biometrics, digital acceptance networks, digital drivers’ licences, the Metaverse, passkeys, digital cash, next generation payments, and the challenges of delegated administration across communities and much more. It’s all there, along with a panel of four experts who will review the sessions from a Te Ao Māori perspective.</p>



<p>In short, this year’s Digital Trust Hui Taumata will be like no other. The wait is over, and the rubber is hitting the road for the DISTF. What matters now is scale – will they come?</p>



<p>Lastly, I’m very excited to tell you that the DINZ podcast series is almost ready for launch so do keep an eye out for the first episode dropping very soon.</p>

<p>Deep thought has gone into building the agenda for next month’s<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/"> Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>, ahead of <a href="https://www.nethui.nz/">Net Hui</a> and <a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/the-point-2024-navigating-beyond/">The Point 2024</a>, so that conversations live on and build out later in the year and into subsequent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Significant attention will be devoted to <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/programmes-and-projects/digital-identity-programme/">Trust Frameworks given the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) </a>regulation coming into play on 1 July. Immediately following Minister Collins’ opening remarks, Microsoft’s global identity standards lead and past <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">DIACC TFEC</a> member <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/julianacafik">Juliana Cafik</a> will deliver an intensely interesting first keynote – The international landscape for Digital Identity Trust Frameworks and how NZ compares. Trust frameworks already exist and we use them daily – for example using your bank card to withdraw cash from another bank’s ATM. The panel that follows, representing organisations that could be potential Relying Parties (RPs)/Verifiers under the DISTF, discuss how they see Trust Frameworks playing out. To be relieved of the burden and to minimise risk, these parties notionally look for accredited Digital Identity Service Provider/Issuers to deliver privacy-aware, cryptographically secured verified credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two of these three panellists come from regulated industries while the other is a key government agency, where in all cases the failure to verify parties correctly could have devastating consequences. Other regulated industries and government agencies that need similar verification processes include estate agents, rental companies, law firms, financial services, insurance companies, the pharmacies, doctor’s surgeries, the Police Vetting Service, driver licencing, firearms licensing, the box store where you take out a loan for your new appliance, registering for a loyalty scheme – and the list goes on. Representatives from the Regulator, the DISTF Trust Framework Authority, will lead a Roundtable discussion after lunch where delegates can pose their questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are multiple paths to achieve this nirvana of privacy-aware, cryptographically secured verified credentials available to all people under the auspices of a Trust Framework which is why, straight after the Trust Frameworks panel, Worldline’s Conrad Morgan will keynote a complementary path – Turning transactions into interactions – building New Zealand’s first digital identity <a href="https://trinsic.id/first-identity-acceptance-network/">acceptance network</a>’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Supporting Trust Frameworks are increasingly biometrics and AI – both of which need demystifying for the public to gain confidence in them – along with Digital Public Infrastructure, the Metaverse, passkeys, digital cash, digital driver’s licences, next generation payments, the critical need for digital inclusion, and the challenges of delegated administration across communities. The <a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/programme/">agenda</a> comprises local and international speakers covering these topics as well, all reviewed by a panel of four experts reviewing the sessions from a Te Ao Māori perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The richness of the content to be presented at this year’s event is incomparable with previous years. So do not be surprised when the <a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">2024 Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a> is dropped into conversations in years to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In May 2024, the US government’s General Services Administration (GSA) updated its Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Contract with a new Special Item Number (SIN 541519CSP, Credential Service Providers) under the IT Large Category.SIN 541519CSP is designed to help federal agencies ensure that any IT services procured meet the requirements of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63 requirements and digital identity compliant services.&nbsp; To provide credential services under the new SIN, companies must meet <a href="https://gsa.federalschedules.com/resources/new-it-sin-for-credential-service-providers/#overview">specific instructions and requirements</a><a href="https://gsa.federalschedules.com/resources/new-it-sin-for-credential-service-providers/#overview">.</a> SIN 541519CSP was created to meet the increasing need for robust, trustworthy credential service providers. The new SIN will help government agencies quickly identify credential service providers that have been vetted against the government’s standard requirements. If your company offers credential services and meets the requirements, obtaining SIN 541519CSP will place your company in a better position to capture bids as agencies look to acquire NIST 800-63 compliant services. In order to be included on the Schedule, Credential Service Providers must either be listed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-status-list">Kantara Trust&nbsp;Status&nbsp;List</a>&nbsp;or provide a letter pf approval from Kantara Initiative, or other GSA approved third party that can assure conformance to NIST SP 800-63.&nbsp; To begin the process, you’ll need to complete forms that can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/membership/?civiwp=CiviCRM&amp;q=civicrm/mailing/url&amp;u=781&amp;qid=55665">idmanagement.gov</a>. Since both state and federal government agencies are permitted to use the vendors on this schedule for credential services, this considerably extends opportunities for Kantara certified companies.</p>

 Gordian Envelope Updates 

<p>Gordian Envelope, Blockchain Commons’ “Smart Document” system, continues to be a major focus. Here’s what that meant in Q2.</p>

<p>Expanded Developer Pages. The developer pages were updated with a new <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/summary/">executive summary</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/features/">feature list</a> to clarify the capabilities and advantages of using Envelope. (More executive summaries of our technology to follow!)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Request/Response Presentation. Our May Gordian Developers Meeting included a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDf2cmfX1k">presentation on Request/Response</a>, which is an interoperable communication methodology using Gordian Envelope. Why use it? It can make complex digital-asset procedures more accessible by using automation to dramatically reduce the amount of human interaction needed, yet it also preserves security by ensuring that human choices are required whenever data is transmitted from one device to another. (But watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDf2cmfX1k">the presentation</a> for more!)</p>



 
    
   

<p>Graphs Representation. Blockchain Commons has a new research paper out on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2024-006-envelope-graph.md">Representing Graphs with Envelope</a>, which presents a proposed architecture for representing many types of graphs, enabling the use of Envelope for a variety of graph-based structures and algorithms.</p>

 Gordian Meetings 

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/tree/master/meetings#blockchain-commons-meetings">Gordian Developer Meetings</a> are how we bring the wallet community together to talk about our interoperable specifications. We’ve been thrilled to expand that in the last quarter with some feature presentations from experts in the field.</p>

<p>FROST Presentation. April saw a special presentation on FROST by Jesse Posner that not only talked about his work to date, but also some of the emerging capabilities of FROST, such as the ability to regenerate shares or even change thresholds without changing the underlying secret! We’ve long thought FROST was a great next-generation resilience solution for digital assets, and so appreciate Jesse talking to our community about why it’s so exciting. See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCM8dDql6oo">complete video</a> of our April meeting for more.</p>



 
    
   

<p>PayJoin Presentation. Privacy is one of our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/principles/">fundamental principles for Gordian design</a>. It’s also a principle that will be better supported in Bitcoin with a <a href="https://payjoin.org/">new version of PayJoin</a>. Dan Gould was kind enough to give a full presentation on the updates he’s working on at our May meeting. We’ve got a video of just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMGL-Y498ZQ">his PayJoin presentation</a>.</p>



 
    
   

<p>All the Rest. Both meetings of course also included details on Blockchain Commons’ own work (much of which is detailed in this report). The Gordian Developer meetings continue on the first Wednesday of every month. We’ve also already scheduled a few feature presentations for the rest of the year. On August 7th, we’ll have a special presentation on BIP-85, then on December 4th, we’ll have another FROST presentation for wallet developers. If you’d like to make a special presentation in September, October, or November on a topic of interest to wallet developers, let us know!</p>

<p>Also, if you’re a cryptographer, spec designer, or library developer who is working to implement FROST, please be sure to sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#frost-implementers">FROST implementers announcements-only list</a> so that you can receive invites for our second FROST Implementers Round Table, which will be on September 18 thanks to support from the <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-14-projects-worldwide/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a>.</p>

 Seedtool-Rust Release 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ newest reference application is <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">seedtool-cli for Rust</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">
    
</a></p>

<p>seedtool-cli-rust. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust">Seedtool</a> is a domain-specific  application that allows the creation, reconstruction, translation, and backup of cryptographic seeds. Blockchain Commons’ new Rust-based Seedtool replaces our older C++-based CLI and provides broader support for Gordian Envelope, including offering Gordian Envelopes of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/sskr/">SSKR shares</a>, that can backup a seed using Shamir’s Secret Sharing. Seedtool’s Gordian Envelopes can then be piped into <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">envelope-cli-rust</a> for compression, encryption, or the addition of further metadata.</p>

<p>Seedtool Manual. For more on seedtool-cli-rust, check out the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli-rust/blob/master/MANUAL.md">full user manual</a>, which explains how to use all of its functionality and why it’s important.</p>

 dCBOR Adoption 

<p>dCBOR is one of the foundations of Envelope, as it allows for the deterministic ordering of data, which is crucial for a hashed data system like Envelope. The IETF dCBOR Internet-Draft updated from <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/08/">v8</a> to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/10/">v10</a> over Q2, with most of those changes due to expanding support for the spec. We’re still hoping to see the Internet-Draft finalized soon!</p>

<p><a href="https://cbor.me/">
    
</a></p>

<p>cbor.me. <a href="https://cbor.me/">The CBOR Playground</a> is Carsten Bormann’s foundational diagnostic site for CBOR. It now supports dCBOR thanks to a new <a href="https://github.com/cabo/cbor-dcbor">Ruby Gem</a> that Carsten authored.</p>

<p>cbor2. Joe Hildebrand’s <a href="https://github.com/hildjj/cbor2">cbor2 library for Typescript</a> has also been expanded to support dCBOR.</p>

<p>QCBOR. Laurence Lundblade’s <a href="https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR">QCBOR</a> library (which is written in C) now supports dCBOR in its development branch.</p>

<p>IANA Assignment of Tag 201. Finally, 201 is now officially the “enclosed dCBOR” <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">tag for CBOR</a>. This is also critical for Gordian Envelope, which uses this tag to wrap dCBOR in each of an envelope’s “leaf” nodes.</p>

 GSTP Improvements 

<p>Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol (GSTP) is a Gordian Envelope extension. It allows for Envelope Requests and Responses to be sent in a secure way and is a critical element of Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/csr/">Collaborative Seed Recovery</a> system, which enables the storage of SSKR shares in a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-depo-rust">Gordian Depository</a>.</p>

<p>GSTP Advances. Thanks to support from our Research Sponsor, <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation Devices</a>, Blockchain Commons was able to expend considerable engineering work on GSTP in the last quarter, resulting in more fluent API patterns for building GSTP requests and responses. In addition, GSTP now supports bidirectional self-encrypted state with a unique and powerful new feature that we are calling Encrypted State Continuations (ESC). Overall, GSTP is a system that is secure, distributed, and transportation-agnostic. In a world where we could be sending digital-asset info by NFC, Bluetooth, or QR codes, it’s a critical security measure. See our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnH14LkJOnI">presentation</a> from the most recent Gordian Developers Meeting for more!</p>



 
    
   

 SSH Research 

<p>SSH has been long used as an authentication system, primarily for accessing UNIX computers. However, it’s recently come under increasing usage as a signing system as well, primarily thanks to extensions in Git. That has led to Blockchain Commons experimenting with the integration of SSH keys into Envelope. (This has also demonstrateð the flexibility of Envelope through the addition of these signing methodologies.) We’ve now got some first results.</p>

<p>ssh-envelope Experiment in Python. Early in the quarter, we produced <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/ssh-envelope-python">ssh-envelope</a>, an experimental Python program that worked with both <code>ssh-keygen</code> and <code>envelope-cli</code>. But, thanks to some very rapid development, we’ve already moved beyond that.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">
    
</a></p>

<p>SSH Key Support for envelope-cli. We’ve since integrated SSH key support throughout our Rust stack, primarily affecting our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-components-rust">bc-components</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-rust">bc-envelope</a> Rust crates. This allowed us to bring our SSH key support fully into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">Rust envelope-cli</a>, which you can now use <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust/blob/master/docs/Signing.md">for SSH signing</a>.</p>

<p>More to Come. We’re still working on processes that will allow for the safe, secure, and reliable signing of software releases, something that we talked about extensively in our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/blob/master/_pages/envelope-usecases-software.md">software use cases</a>. You can see some more of our work-in-progress in a discussion of <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChristopherA/3d6a2f39c4b623a1a287b3fb7e0aa05b">SSH Key Best Practices</a>. We hope to have more on using SSH to enable resilient &amp; secure software releases later in the year.</p>

 Architectural Articles 

<p>Blockchain Commons expresses a lot of its more architectural thoughts as articles. There were two major articles in Q2.</p>

<p>Minimum Viable Architecture. Our first major article for the quarter focused on the methodology of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-mva/">Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)</a>. Many companies still focus on Minimum Viable Products. Our article advocates instead looking at the big picture (with lots of discussion on why that’s important).</p>

<p>Authentication Patterns. Design patterns are a crucial element in architectural design. Much as with the adversaries found in <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a>, design patterns allow you to put together a larger system piece by piece. As part of a guide to the strength of heterogeneity in architectural design, Blockchain Commons penned a set of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/architecture/patterns/auth/">authentication design patterns</a>. We’d like to do more to fill out the space, but for now feel like this is a good first cut that shows the value of the design style.</p>

 DID Futures 

<p>The Blockchain Commons principals have been involved with DIDs since Christopher Allen founded <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting Web of Trust</a> in 2015.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">
    
</a></p>

<p>W3C DID 1.1 WG. After a hiatus, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID working group</a> has been rechartered through 2026. Christopher Allen continues as an Invited Expert, focused on a variety of privacy issues, including elision, DID registration, and DID resolver issues.</p>

<p>RWOT 13. Meanwhile, Rebooting the Web of Trust continues to be on the frontline for DID advancements, with Christopher still the chair of the organization and Shannon Appelcline the editor-in-chief. <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/rwot%20workshop/RWOT13-Papers/">RWOT13</a> is finally back in the USA, with the early bird deadline for advance-reading papers at the start of August.</p>

 Grants/Funding 

<p>As we’ve written elsewhere, funding has become more difficult in the last year because of large-scale financial factors such as inflation and the resultant increase in interest rates. Blockchain Commons has responded by working more closely with some of our partners on topics of special interest to them and by seeking out grants.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation</a> for their grant enabling our continued support of FROST work.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://foundation.xyz/">Foundation Devices</a> for their support of GSTP work.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://contract.design/">Digital Contract Design</a> for their support of our advocacy over the last year.</p>

<p>Please consider becoming a personal or corporate <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a> of Blockchain Commons so that our work can continue. Or, if you want support to integrate or expand one of Blockchain Commons’ existing projects (such as SSKR, Envelope, or the Gordian Depositories) in an open manner, to meet your company’s needs, contact us directly about becoming a Research Sponsor.</p>

<p>Also, please let us know of any grants or awards that you think would be closely aligned with our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can apply.</p>

 What’s Next? 

<p>Coming up:</p>
 
   More work on Envelope &amp; GSTP. 
   More reveals of our SSH work. 
   A new musings on cryptographic “cliques”. 
 

<p>We’re looking forward to Q3!</p>

<p>On July 16th, 2024, the FIDO Alliance held a <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/fido-munich-seminar-2024-strengthening-authentication-with-passkeys-in-automotive-and-beyond/">seminar</a> focused on the fit for FIDO authentication and device onboarding within the automotive industry. Co-hosted with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/swissbit/">Swissbit</a>, the event had over 100 attendees who heard from various stakeholders on the need and opportunity for standards-based approaches to securing the automotive workforce and manufacturing process. Themes included how passkeys and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">FIDO-certified biometrics</a> can help transform the future of in-vehicle experiences, especially with in-car <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkey-use-case/payments/">payments</a>, smart cars, and IoT.</p>



 FIDO Momentum in the Automotive Industry 



<p>Like just about every market sector, the automotive industry is plagued by risks and ramifications associated with decades of relying on passwords – and is also uniquely poised to improve the user experience by embracing <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> for user authentication.</p>



<p>With smart cars having embedded technology to connect to digital experiences, there are several innovations primed for take-off in the automotive industry. With nearly <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/research/fintech-payments/emerging-payments/in-vehicle-payments-research-report/">100 million vehicles will be making payments by 2026</a>, up from just 2.3 million in 2021, passkeys will be crucial to simplify the in-vehicle user experience. At the same time, manufacturers have the opportunity to improve IoT and secure embedded devices to improve customer experiences on and off the road.</p>



 Manufacturing and Smart Car Case Studies 



<p>On the workforce front, the event featured a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fido-munich-seminar-workforce-authentication-case-study-pptx/270406201">case study</a> from MTRIX and considerations on how to deploy FIDO security keys to a manufacturer’s workforce – contemplating the many types and locations of workers for today’s global manufacturers. This case study reinforced the factors called out in a presentation by <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">Infineon</a> on the regulatory-driven push and pull with FIDO authentication.</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/vincss-official/">VinCSS</a> described how <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/device-onboarding-overview/">FIDO Device Onboard</a> is being used today to secure the smart car ecosystem both at point of manufacturing as well as for after-market use cases.</p>



 Using Passkeys for In-Vehicle Payments 



<p>The final block of sessions looked more closely at our in-vehicle future – including an overview of current trends for in-vehicle payments. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fido-munich-seminar-in-vehicle-payment-trends-pptx/270406190">Visa</a> and <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/fido-munich-seminar-blueprint-for-in-vehicle-payment-standard-pptx/270375336">Starfish</a> then presented a blueprint and demo respectively for a standards-based approach for in-vehicle payments before <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">Qualcomm</a> wrapped things up with their vision for a digital chassis as the foundation for a software-defined vehicle that contemplates the need for secure identity, payments and driver/passenger personalization.</p>

 Join us for a Shared Signals Interop Event at Gartner IAM in Grapevine, Texas (December 9-11) 
<p>Momentum continues to build around the OpenID Shared Signals Framework, CAEP, and RISC standards. Leading companies have announced their support, and implementations are now in production.</p>
<p>Building on the success of the <a href="https://openid.net/call-for-participation-demonstrate-interoperability-of-your-caep-implementations/">first CAEP interoperability event</a>, The OpenID Foundation and the Shared Signals Work Group (SSWG) are delighted to announce that we are returning to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/identity-access-management-us?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=EVT_NA_2024_IAM19_PD_DS1_PMAX&amp;utm_adgroup=&amp;utm_term=&amp;ad=&amp;matchtype=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1qO0BhDwARIsANfnkv8xyx3JwJ4AK89sqzIN-1c0BIQJYNABaIFgF2ShZl2ichvc-fVhMc4aAvi6EALw_wcB">Gartner’s IAM Summit</a> for a second <a href="https://openid.net/shared-signals-enhanced-security-for-all/">interop event</a>, this time in Grapevine Texas, December 9-11 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this event, we will demonstrate interoperability of implementations of:</p>
 
 The Shared Signals Framework (SSF) 
 Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) 
 Risk and Incident Sharing and Collaboration (RISC) 
 SCIM Events&nbsp; 
 
 How to Get Involved 
<p>There is room for up to 10 implementers and you are invited to register your interest with Atul Tulshibagwale, co-chair of the SSWG, at <a href="mailto:atul@sgnl.ai">atul@sgnl.ai</a> by August 1st, 2024. Note that this is not a final commitment to participate, but an expression of interest. The final scope of the event will be determined between the SSWG and the implementers who register interest. You will have the opportunity to confirm participation once all interested parties have met to agree on the scope and format of the interoperability event.</p>
<p>The Gartner IAM Summit will feature a breakout session and two interoperability sessions where the implementations will be discussed. </p>
 
 In the breakout session, we will display the matrix of interoperability test results for all committed implementers.  
 In the interoperability sessions, conference attendees will have the opportunity to interact with the implementers and watch the live implementations interoperate with each other. 
 
<p>OIDF will publicize the participants’ interop test results after the event takes place – including whether they did or did not achieve interoperability for specific use cases.</p>
<p>Note that we can enable remote participation for offline testing and inclusion in test results, but remote participation is not possible during the summit.</p>

<p>The digital transformation and the proliferation of e-identity schemes have escalated the need for secure and reliable online <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/">identity verification</a> methods, especially in light of the alarming trend of AI-generated “deepfakes.” As internet users have learned about the increasing threat of deepfakes, they have become increasingly concerned about their identities being spoofed online, according to a new study conducted by the FIDO Alliance. As a result, deepfake awareness and the risks associated with them have steadily increased.</p>



<p>Amidst this landscape, the FIDO Alliance released its newest research in the eBook, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/remote-identity-verification-biometric-systems-consumer-insights-2024">Remote ID Verification – Bringing Confidence to Biometric Systems Consumer Insights 2024</a>, which reveals insights from an independent study surveying 2,000 respondents in the U.S. and the U.K. on consumer perceptions on remote identity verification, online security, and biometrics. While the data showed consumer awareness and adoption of biometrics is increasing, consumers also expressed concerns about the rise of AI-generated deepfakes – reinforcing the need for preventative strategies and technologies focused on secure remote identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a “deepfake”? 



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/mdm-inauthentic-content-product-english_508.pdf">Center for Internet Security</a>, a deepfake consists of convincingly fabricated audio and video content designed to mislead audiences into believing that fabricated events or statements are real. These manipulations can create realistic yet entirely false representations of individuals through synthetic images or complete video footage. This manipulated audio/video content is dangerously effective at spreading false information. In cybersecurity, deepfakes are increasingly being used to spoof identities to fraudulently open accounts or take control of existing accounts.</p>



<p>With the advent of AI and the increasing use of face biometrics for remote identity verification, the deepfake risks to remote identity proofing (RIDP) methods have become a reality. Security researchers have been closely evaluating the identity verification risks associated with deepfakes to increase awareness of the rapidly changing threat landscape and support stronger countermeasures that enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of remote identity proofing (RIDP) methods. In the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity’s (ENISA) latest remote ID <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/remote-id-proofing-good-practices">report</a>, researchers observed that deepfake injection attacks are increasing and becoming more difficult to mitigate.</p>



 Users Express Concerns about Deepfakes and ID Verification 



<p>With the rise of generative AI and deepfake videos in the news, there has been a heightened consumer unease about the security of biometrics for online verification. In the FIDO Alliance’s study, the deepfake trends have not escaped consumers’ attention online, who are increasingly using face biometrics to authenticate identities online and are concerned about identity security.</p>



<p>On one hand, the study reinforced consumer preference for using biometrics in remote identity verification, with nearly half of the respondents indicating a preference to use face biometrics, especially for sensitive transactions, like financial services (48%).&nbsp;</p>







<p>On the other hand, just over half of respondents revealed they are concerned about deepfakes when verifying identities online (52%).</p>







 Building Consumer Trust in Face Biometrics 



<p>As the concerns around deepfake security threats gain prominence, the industry has taken a significant step forward with the FIDO Alliance’s newly introduced Identity Verification certification program for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification</a>. This industry-first testing certification program, based on ISO standards, with requirements developed by the FIDO Alliance, aims to measure accuracy, liveness (including deepfake detection), and bias (including skin tone, age, and gender) in remote biometric identity verification technologies. By providing a framework for testing biometric performance and a network of accredited laboratories worldwide, this certification program standardizes and evaluates the performance of face verification systems while mitigating the impact of bias and security threats, like deepfakes.</p>



 Certifying Identity Verification with the FIDO Alliance 



<p>The Identity Verification certifications that the FIDO Alliance provides offer industry providers the ability to demonstrate commitment to addressing bias and security threats in remote biometric identity verification technologies. With a focus on standardizing and enhancing the performance of face verification technologies, the Alliance released its new <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certification Program</a> to elevate the performance, security, and equity of biometric solutions for remote identity verification. Combined with its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/document-authenticity/">Document Authenticity</a> (DocAuth) Certification Program, these two certifications work together to ensure identity verification solution providers can leverage FIDO’s independent testing and accredited laboratories as a market differentiator.&nbsp;</p>

 Commitment to ensure quality products for customers of the relying parties&nbsp; 



 Requirements developed by a diverse, international group of stakeholders from industry, government, and subject matter experts 



 Conforms to ISO 



 FIDO Annex published in ISO standards 
 



 What is the value of accredited laboratories? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/laboratory-overview/">FIDO Accredited Laboratories</a> are available worldwide and follow a common set of requirements and rigorous evaluation processes, defined by the FIDO Alliance Biometrics Working Group (BWG) and follow all relevant ISO standards. These laboratories are audited and trained by the FIDO Biometric Secretariat to ensure lab testing methodologies are compliant and utilize governance mechanisms per FIDO requirements. Laboratories perform biometric evaluations in alignment with audited FIDO accreditation processes. In contrast, bespoke, single laboratory biometric evaluations may not garner sufficient trust from relying parties for authentication and remote identity verification use cases.</p>



 What are the ISO Standards that FIDO certification conforms to? 



<p>When a vendor invests in FIDO’s Face Verification Certification, they and their accredited lab are adhering to the following ISO standards:</p>



Terminology<br>ISO/IEC 2382-37:2022 Information technology — Vocabulary — Part 37: BiometricsPresentation Attack Detection<br>ISO/IEC 30107-3:2023 Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 3: Testing and reportingISO/IEC 30107-4:2020 Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 4: Profile for testing of mobile devices<br>-FIDO Annex, published 2024Performance (e.g., FRR, FAR)<br>ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 1: Principles and frameworkISO/IEC 19795-9:2019 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 9: Testing on mobile devices<br>-FIDO Annex, published 2019Bias (differentials due to demographics)<br>ISO/IEC 19795-10:2024 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 10: Quantifying biometric system performance variation across demographic groups<br>-FIDO Annex, under developmentLaboratory<br>ISO/IEC 17025:2017, General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) today announced the availability of the Decentralized Web Node (DWN) Community Instance, operated by DIF and powered by Google Cloud.&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs - also referred to as DWeb Nodes) are personal data stores that eliminate the need for individuals to trust apps to responsibly use and protect their data. Instead, data is owned and controlled by the individual — offering developers a brand new way to create apps that request individuals’ permission to read and access their data, but don’t store it.</p><p>The Managed DWN service or “community node” will allow existing and new Google Cloud customers to more easily build test applications using DWNs. Rather than having to run their own DWN or server infrastructure to store data, developers will be able to leverage a DWN on Google Cloud to build test applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Developers can use the community DWN node at no cost, including up to 1GB of storage per DID.</p><p>The service was launched during a strongly attended DIF community call earlier today (event highlights below).&nbsp;</p><p>The launch marks an exciting milestone in DIF’s mission to make it easy for developers to build using decentralized identity, and follows the recent establishment of the Veramo User Group and an upgrade to DIF’s Universal Resolver infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>SC members Daniel Buchner and Markus Sabadello will share the stage with leaders from Google Cloud and DIF member org TBD at <a href="https://www.wearedevelopers.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">We Are Developers</a> World Congress in Berlin tomorrow to shine a spotlight on the new service, including a live demo of applications built using DWNs.</p><p>Today’s launch event in brief&nbsp;</p><p>Following an introduction by DIF’s Executive Director, Kim Hamilton Duffy, and DIF Ambassador, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-alan-schwartz/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Jeffrey Schwartz</a>, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.dentity.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dentity</a>, several companies who are deploying DWNs in real-world use cases gave case study presentations.&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel Bucher and Andor Kesselman, co-chairs of the DWN work item within DIF’s Secure Data Storage working group, described how DWeb Nodes work, and what developers can do with them.&nbsp;</p><p>A hot topic that surfaced during the discussion and subsequent Q&amp;A, led by DIF’s Senior Director of Community Engagement, Limari Navarrete, was how developers can define protocols that give users fine-grained control over the data in their DWN.&nbsp;</p><p>Protocols “encode rules around how people interact with my data,” Andor said. “It’s very powerful!” he added.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/celina-villanueva-3ba90053/?locale=es_ES&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Celina Villanueva</a> from <a href="https://extrimian.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Extrimian</a> described a pre-authorisation protocol designed to enable first responders at an emergency to access critical information in an accident victim’s DWN. The protocol powers a new service that will be piloted in Buenos Aires later this year. Extrimian also envisages the protocol enabling customers to pre-authorise their bank to access personal information when needed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjarmol/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Michal Jarmolkowicz</a> described how <a href="https://swisssafe.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Swiss Safe</a> is working with clients in the travel and healthcare sectors to build new services around DWNs, including a protocol enabling patients to take control of their health record and grant specific, time-limited access to healthcare professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>Another recurring topic was how DWNs and Verifiable Credentials can interact. Insights included how DWNs enable backup and recovery of VCs, and the benefits of combining VCs with a “bring your own data” model.&nbsp;</p><p>There was also discussion about the adoption status of DWNs, and how to accelerate this. Jeffrey Schwartz said Dentity clearly sees an adoption cycle underway, based on Proofs of Concept they are involved in or aware of. Michal Jarmolkowicz noted that searching out CIOs and CTOs with an active “technology radar” (a service that flags and tracks emerging technologies) has proved fruitful for Swiss Safe, as they are more likely to be aware of Decentralized Identity and the value it offers. He added that Data Protection Officers often respond enthusiastically to DWNs.</p><p>Several participants wanted to know which cloud platforms and developer tools DWNs can be used with today. Daniel Buchner said Google has already adapted DWNs for Cloud SQL and Blobstore, while others are currently working on adapters for AWS S3 and other services. He also shared the insight that cloud providers are incentivized to enable developers to add more DWN protocols, since this drives more utility from customers’ data, encouraging them to increase their service usage.&nbsp;</p><p>Wrapping up, he urged participants to “get involved and see what you can build. Together, DIF’s Community Node and the Web5 SDK make it pretty simple. Try writing your own protocols and have fun with it!”</p><p>What are Decentralized Web Nodes?</p><p>DWNs are personal data stores and peer-to-peer communication nodes that serve as the foundation for decentralized apps and protocols. They live on devices and can be replicated on hosted instances in the cloud. These data stores are a realization of true serverless applications in which developers can store app data without using centralized servers or an account with a centralized service.</p><p>DWNs are a foundational component of Web5, an open source platform that provides a new, reliable identity and trust layer for the Web to enable decentralized applications and protocols that solve real problems for people. Built on open standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and DIF, Web5 consists of three key pillars: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Decentralized Web Nodes.</p><p>Why use DIF’s Managed DWN Service?</p><p>The service empowers developers to build decentralized apps that give users full ownership and control over their data, without needing to ask each user to deploy a local DWN. With DIF’s Managed DWN Service, developers can build decentralized apps with data in DWNs hosted on Google Cloud, making it easier than ever before to empower individuals with ownership and control of their data.</p><p>How do I get started with Managed DWNs?&nbsp;</p><p>To start building decentralized apps on Web5, developers can visit developers.tbd.website.&nbsp;</p><p>To access the DIF community node, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/dwn-user-guide?ref=blog.identity.foundation">start here</a>.</p>

 Celebrating 50 Years of the GS1&nbsp;Barcode <p>June 26 marked the 50th anniversary of the GS1 barcode, commemorating the first-ever product scan at a cash registry checkout. Over the decades, billions of products worldwide have been equipped with barcodes, streamlining and standardizing supply chain processes and adhering to GS1 standards.</p><p>As consumer demand for product information grew, regulatory requirements became stricter, and supply chain optimization pressures increased, the need for an updated barcode became evident. Enter the GS1 Digital Link, the barcode upgrade designed to provide dynamic access to comprehensive product information. Now, with <a href="https://www.gs1.org/resources/articles/leading-companies-retail-and-consumer-goods-industries-support-transition-qr-codes-gs1">leading retail and consumer goods companies actively supporting the transition to Digital Link QR codes</a>, the stage is set for the traditional barcode to retire gracefully.</p> Setting a Strong Foundation for Digital Link with OriginTrail <p>For products and brands to fully benefit from the GS1 Digital Link transition, a robust, connected, and verifiable data foundation is crucial. Product data is often split across various supply chain partners, including manufacturers, logistics providers, wholesalers, retailers, and others. To connect billions of products to the internet in a meaningful way that provides genuine insights and business value, this scattered product data needs to be interconnected.</p><p>Scanning a Digital Link on a product and seeing the manufacturer’s information, such as production date, description, ingredients, and brand details is good. Scanning the same code and accessing comprehensive information about the product’s journey through the supply chain — including whether the ingredients were ecologically produced, if the product was stored at proper temperatures during transport, and how long it was in the supply chain — is much better. This is the true potential of the Digital&nbsp;Link.</p><p>Beyond consumer engagement, consider a business operating a rail or plane network being able to access details on a component’s manufacture, testing, and maintenance by scanning a Digital Link code. That would have surely been invaluable with the recent Boeing aircraft incidents.</p><p>This is where the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and GS1 Digital Link make a match in heaven. The DKG provides a verifiable and interconnected knowledge base encompassing product data, supply chain events, certifications, locations, and more — across organizations and data sources. With the new DKG V8, the OriginTrail introduces the scalability needed to bring billions of products equipped with Digital Link into a world of standards-based, connected, and verifiable data. And the new DKG Edge Node concept empowers organizations and business networks to exchange product and other supply chain data with just a few clicks while maintaining data privacy, verifiability, and connectivity.</p>Supply chain data from multiple sources connected in a verifiable Decentralized Knowledge Graph.<p>As a longstanding partner of GS1, OriginTrail DKG is designed to natively support GS1 standards, including EPCIS, Core Business Vocabulary (CBV), Global Data Model (GDM), and Digital Link. This integration means that consumers, regulators, brands, and other stakeholders can access richer, more comprehensive, and trusted product data. The challenge now is to make this user experience seamless and simple, and there’s a tech perfect for the job — Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p> OriginTrail, Digital Link, and AI: A Consumer Engagement Power&nbsp;Throuple <p>Incorporating AI into the mix creates an incredibly powerful technology trio, enabling brands to enhance consumer engagement, based on connected and verifiable data spanning organizations, in unprecedented ways. And with the DKG Edge Node, AI capabilities come natively. Brands can thus offer personalized and tailored experiences by allowing customers to scan a product with a Digital Link QR code and ask anything — from brand details to product origins, sustainability, and environmental impact, all based on verifiable data from OriginTrail DKG.</p><p>This combination not only benefits consumers but also provides brands with valuable insights into customer preferences, allowing them to refine their business strategies. As billions of products transition from barcodes to Digital Link, the potential of this technology trio becomes evident. In fact, AI-powered product discovery, based on OriginTrail and Digital Link, is no longer a future concept but a current&nbsp;reality:</p><p>Some additional examples to check&nbsp;out:</p>  <a href="https://www.perutnina.com/int/en/premium-quality/check-the-origin/">Check the origin&nbsp;» Perutnina Ptuj</a>  <a href="https://x.com/origin_trail/status/1759626249813520823">Church of Oak Whiskey Distillery</a>  <p>Simultaneously, organizations can leverage AI to better understand and enhance their supply chains, ensuring they receive accurate and verifiable responses rooted in data from across their business network. By simply scanning a Digital Link QR code on a product, pallet, or shipping container, users are immediately empowered to ask questions and get verifiable answers — from basic queries like “Where was this product manufactured?” to more complex ones such as “Was the temperature in this shipping container in line with expectations?” and “Give me a list of all train wagons that are likely to experience issues with their wheels in the next month.” Exciting stuff&nbsp;indeed.</p> Where do we go from&nbsp;here? <p>As billions of products transition from traditional barcodes to Digital Link QR codes, establishing a robust foundation of connected and verifiable data becomes paramount. OriginTrail is at the forefront of this transformation, with the new DKG V8 offering the scalability and simplicity necessary to realize its full potential. When combined with AI, this technology trio unlocks immense opportunities for brands to engage with their customers in a trusted and meaningful way.</p><p>But consumer engagement is just one area set to benefit significantly from this transition. Regulatory bodies will gain streamlined access to verifiable product data, and supply chain management will become more proactive and efficient. The coming months and years promise exciting advancements and opportunities, making this a pivotal moment in the evolution of product information and consumer engagement.</p><p>We are excited to see OriginTrail at the epicenter of it all, as we — Trace Labs, the core developers of OriginTrai — along with our ecosystem partners get ready to unveil the Digital Link support via the new DKG V8 at the GS1 Industry &amp; Standards Event. Over 1,000 business leaders from 80+ countries will come together virtually to solve today’s greatest business challenges through the development and adoption of the GS1 global standard.</p><p>For the GS1 Industry &amp; Standards Event, register at: <a href="https://standards-event.gs1.org/">https://standards-event.gs1.org/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/from-barcodes-to-digital-links-supercharging-trillions-of-products-for-the-next-50-years-f46f4653e589">From Barcodes to Digital Links: Supercharging Trillions of Products for the Next 50 Years</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Numerous platforms have vanished over the years, resulting in significant data loss like GeoCities, Friendster and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Orkut</a>. Even within still existing companies like Google, numerous lost data products are documented. See <a href="http://killedbygoogle.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">killed by google</a>. </p><p>We can break free from this risk by creating data-centric applications that multihome the data. Ceramic is the way to have many distinct data controllers publishing into shared tables in a trustless environment. Each reader can know who published what content and when they did without relying on trusting the storage service to keep accurate audit logs. Since each event is a JSON Document, signed by a controller, timestamped by ethereum, and in a documented schema it can be preserved by any interested party, with or without permission from the storage vendor. </p>Multihome the data<p>In Ceramic we separate the roles of data controllers from the data servers. By allowing data to live on any preferred server the data is durable as long as any server is interested in preserving the data. This allows data to outlive a particular data server, paired with the durability of data living in multiple places and the speed/reliability of operating on local data.</p> Document the schema <p>Throughout the history of the internet, we have witnessed numerous data services going away and taking the users data with them. While multihoming helps preserve data, it's useless without the ability to interpret it.</p><p>Ceramic preserves the data formats in two ways. The first is that the data lives in JSON Documents. This format allows us to reverse engineer and examine the data.&nbsp; The second is that the model schema gets published. The model schema contains both json-schema and human language description that the original developer can use to give machine and human context to the data. This enables both the preservation of the data and schema so the data can be understood and new apps can be made to interact with the preserved data.</p> <code>{

}</code> <p>Example schema document</p> Information retrieval&nbsp; <p>The key to multihome data is being able to retrieve the data from a server that has it.</p><p>How do we move the data from the servers that have the data to the servers that are interested in storing it? When we first made Ceramic we used two multicast methods: The first was to do a gratuitous announcement of new data. Send the data to EVERY node in the network so that they can store it if they are interested in it. Second, if a node did not know about a stream then when requested by a user it would multicast a request to the whole network and take the latest version to come back as a response.</p><p>This worked but had several drawbacks. The first is that requests for streams that a node did not know used WAN traffic and would have unpredictable latencies. This meant that all applications needed to design for slow unpredictable retrieval times. The second drawback was that a node had no way to retrieve a complete set of the streams that matched their interests. They could only listen to the multicast channel and fetch any stream they happened to hear about. Any stream that they missed either because it happened before the node was online or during down time could be missed forever. Third, there is a performance cost to sending requests to nodes that have no mutual interest with your node. A node that did 100 events a year could not scale down since it would need to keep up with filtering announcements from nodes doing 100 events a second. If we wanted to support both very large and very small data centric applications we needed a new strategy. We even saw cases where a slow node could not keep up on the multicast channel harming the performance of larger more powerful nodes.</p><p>To solve these problems of performance, completeness, and scalability we switched to a pairwise synchronization model. Each node advertises the ranges of streams that the node is interested in. Each node only synchronizes the streams that are of mutual interest and the nodes synchronize pair wise.</p> Scalability <p>Since the nodes synchronize pairwise, no slow node can harm the ability of two healthy nodes to complete a synchronization. If two nodes have no intersection in their interests then the conversation is done. A range of streams that has 100s of events per second that your node is not interested in will not create work for your node. A node only needs to scale to the speed of events in the ranges it is interested in and the scale of any model you are not interested in costs you nothing. This solved our scale up / scale down objective.</p> Completeness <p>If the two nodes do have an intersection of their interests they will continue the synchronization until both nodes have ALL the events that the other node had when the synchronization began. There is no longer a need for high availability to be online either when the stream’s event was originally published or when some node queried for that stream. If the event is stored by either of the nodes both nodes will have it at the end of the pairwise synchronization. Once a node has pairwise synchronized with each of the nodes that are advertising an interest range that node has all of the events in that range as of the time of the synchronization. This solves the completeness objective.</p><p>More interestingly, the local completeness means that we can build local indexes over the events and do more complex queries over the events in the ranges nodes are interested in entirely locally.</p> Performance <p>&nbsp;Lastly, since we have a complete set of events for our interests we can serve queries about the events from the local node with no need for WAN traffic. This solves the performance objective for predictable fetch latencies.</p> Pairwise Synchronization in Logarithmic rounds <p>In the multicast model ceramic sends messages to all other ceramic nodes. One of the most notable differences with synchronization is that nodes do pairwise synchronization one peer at a time. The two peers will each send the other their interests. Both nodes filter the events that they have to find the set of events of mutual interest between the two nodes. Once this intersection is found we synchronize the set with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13567?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Range-Based Set Reconciliation</a> protocol we call Recon.</p><p>We can report progress in a Recon synchronization by reporting the percentage of events in the in sync vs syncing ranges. Alternatively we could render a bar like in the diagram showing which ranges are in which states.</p><p>This is a divide and conquer protocol. We start with the full intersection as a single range. We pull a range off the work list and send the (hash, count) of all events in the range to the other side. They compare their own (hash, count) and respond accordingly.</p>

<p>We have</p><p>They have</p><p>Acton</p><p>hash_A</p><p>hash_A</p><p>Done.<br>`in sync`</p><p>0</p><p>hash_A</p><p>Send a request for the events.<br>`Don’t have`</p><p>hash_A</p><p>0</p><p>Send the events.<br>`in sync`</p><p>hash_A</p><p>hash_B</p><p>Split the range<br>Push sub-ranges from split on the work list.<br>Each range `syncing`</p>

<p>The range splits are handled differently on the Initiator then the Responder. The Initiator maintains the work list and pushes all of the subranges onto the work list. The Responder just sends a message back with multiple ranges and hashes for each range. This keeps the synchronization state on the Initiator and reduces the burden on the Responder to a stateless call and response. This fits Recon into the http client server request response paradigm.</p> Exponential distribution <p>Now that we have replaced a multicast message to all nodes in the network with pairwise sync it is reasonable to ask if we have broken the exponential distribution we got from multicast trees.</p><p>How fast can data spread through the network? Now that we have replaced the multicast channel with pairwise connections, how do we match the exponential distribution of the multicast channel?&nbsp;</p><p>We get this property since each node cycles through connecting to all other nodes that advertise overlapping interests. When the node that originally received the event from a client there is 1 copy on the network. After the first sync there are 2. Then both of the nodes sync to new nodes giving 4. This will grow exponentially until almost all interested nodes have the data. At that point the odds that any node with the event calls a node without it is small but the odds that the node without the event calls a node with it is large. By using synchronization we get the benefits of both push and pull gossip protocols. Push which is fast when the knowledge of the event is rare and pull which is fast when knowledge of the event is common. </p> Summary <p>By using Set reconciliation to perform pairwise synchronization of node’s overlapping interests we are able to have performance, completeness, and scalability. The predictable performance of querying local data on your node. The completeness of synchronizing all of the events of interest preemptively. The scalability of not synchronizing the events that lay outside of the interests of a node. Pairwise synchronization protects the network from slow nodes from slowing down the rest of the network. It is now possible to scale up or down without performance and completeness problems. This enables developers to build data intensive applications without the data vendor lock-in from either the storage providing service or the application that originally read the schema.</p>

<p>Corporate overview:</p>



<p>Wedding Park Co., Ltd. was founded in 2004 with the management philosophy of “Making marriage happier.” Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2024, it started as a wedding review information site and has since expanded its operations. Utilizing a wealth of information, it operates several wedding-specialized media, including the wedding preparation review site <a href="https://www.weddingpark.net/">Wedding Park</a>. In addition, it runs various businesses in the realm of weddings combined with digital technology, such as internet advertising agency services, digital transformation (DX) support, and educational ventures.</p>



<p>Background and challenges leading to deployment</p>



<p>Wedding Park was faced with the challenges of strengthening the security of multiple cloud services that were being used for internal operations and the complexity of password management. As a way to address these issues, the company introduced an ID management service and consolidated them into a cloud service entrance with a single sign-on function.</p>



<p>The impetus for deploying FIDO authentication came from the fact that Salesforce, which is used for authentication for customer management, order and supply systems, and time and attendance management, announced that multi-factor authentication (MFA) was mandatory. However, if MFA is applied only to Salesforce and other cloud services continue to operate with password authentication, not only will the usability of users deteriorate, but the work of the IT management department will also become more complicated. In addition, due to the vulnerability of password-only authentication, the company decided to apply MFA to all cloud services, including Salesforce, in accordance with its policy to promote zero-trust security in February 2020.</p>



<p>Selection and verification of an authenticator</p>



<p>As an authentication method for MFA, the company considered one-time password authentication (OTP) and biometric authentication using smartphone applications, but ultimately decided to deploy passwordless authentication using FIDO for its unique ability to improve both security and user convenience.</p>



<p>In order to realize passwordless authentication using FIDO, a terminal equipped with a FIDO-compatible biometric authentication device is required. The majority of devices currently on the market support FIDO authentication, and with the exception of a few employees, the adoption of FIDO has been supported by the fact that all in-house devices are already equipped with Windows Hello and Touch ID. For some employees who use the devices not equipped with biometric features, a separate external authenticator has been installed.</p>



<p>A step-by-step changeover for each department</p>



<p>After examining the authenticators, the policy to deploy passwordless authentication company-wide in January 2022 was officially launched. The transition took place from February to March of the same year, and the smooth implementation in a short period of one month was made possible by the department-by-department implementation and the generous support provided by the IT management department. For this implementation, the company requested the support of CloudGate UNO, an identity management platform by International System Research Corporation (ISR) that the company has been using since 2012, because it supports passwordless authentication using FIDO2 and biometric authentication using a smartphone APP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The introduction of the system within the company began with the development department and gradually progressed to departments with a larger number of employees. First, at regular meetings for each department, the company communicated the purpose of why the system was being introduced and the benefits of “the deployment of the system will make daily authentication more convenient,” and gained the understanding across the company. The introduction of the system on a departmental basis had the advantage of not only limiting the number of people the IT management department had to deal with at one time, but also allowing the accumulation of QA as test cases and the smooth maintenance of manuals, since the system was introduced starting with the development department, which had high IT skills.</p>



<p>As a result of close follow-up by the IT management department, which not only prepared materials, but also checked the progress status on the administrator website as needed, and individually approached employees who had not yet registered their certifiers, the company was able to implement the system company-wide within the targeted time frame.</p>



<p>Effects of introduction</p>



<p></p>



<p>The number of login errors due to mistyping of passwords, which used to occur about 200 times a month, has been reduced to zero since the deployment of FIDO authentication. Many employees commented that the system has become very convenient, eliminating authentication failures due to forgotten passwords or typing errors. In addition, the number of periodic password reset requests has decreased, resulting in a reduction in man-hours for the administrator.</p>



<p>The passwordless authentication is smooth, and the authentication status retention period was shortened to further enhance security, but the system has continued to operate without problems since then.</p>



<p>Wedding Park’s future vision is to link all cloud services used within the company to “CloudGate UNO” and centrally manage them, including authentication, with “CloudGate UNO.</p>



<p>Akira Nishi, General Manager of the Corporate IT Office, who spoke with us about this case study, made the following comments.</p>



<p>“For those who are considering the deploying of a new authentication method, there is inevitably a concern that a change in authentication method will cause a large-scale login failure. In our case, in the early stages of the project, we held explanatory meetings for each department and repeatedly brushed up on explanatory materials and procedures, which was effective in minimizing confusion and anxiety within the company.</p>



<p>“After the switchover, we continued to check on the progress of the implementation and followed up with each department individually, but once the use of passkey (device-bound passkey) became standardized within the company, we felt that the scope of use, including various security measures, was expanding dramatically.”</p>

<p>The Ceramic protocol has undergone a series of updates over the past few months, all focused on improving performance and scalability, enabling developers to build applications that work better and faster. Today, the core Ceramic team is excited to share these updates with the community by announcing the release of <code>ceramic-one</code>.</p> About the release <p>The new release of Ceramic includes a data synchronization protocol called <a href="https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-124?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recon</a>, implemented in Rust. This new implementation of the Ceramic protocol enables data sharing between nodes and allows developers to run multiple nodes that stay in sync and are load balanced. All this facilitates highly available Ceramic deployments and reliable data synchronization.</p><p>To utilize the Recon protocol for their applications, developers are provided with a binary called <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>ceramic-one</code></a>.</p><p>This new implementation of the Ceramic protocol offers significant performance and stability improvements. Additionally, this release marks a significant shift in making the Ceramic architecture more robust, allowing the team to iterate on and build new protocols in the future.</p> The new Recon protocol <p>Recon is a new data synchronization protocol used for synchronizing stream events in the Ceramic network, implemented on top of libp2p. Stream sets bundle multiple streams together, allowing nodes with a common interest in certain streams to synchronize efficiently.</p><p>Before Recon, Ceramic nodes broadcasted updates to streams to every node in the network using a simple libp2p pubsub topic. Due to the single channel, nodes would receive stream event announcements they were not interested in, imposing a significant overhead on every node. Additionally, the network's throughput was limited by bandwidth, which led to either prioritizing high-bandwidth nodes or greatly limiting the network throughput to support low-bandwidth nodes.</p><p>Recon provides low to no overhead for nodes with no overlap in interest, while retaining a high probability of receiving the latest events from a stream shortly after any node has the events, without any need for remote connections at query time. By shifting updates from the pubsub channel to a stream set, interested nodes can synchronize without burdening uninterested ones. Stream sets also enable sharding across multiple nodes, allowing synchronization of only sub-ranges, which distributes the storage, indexing, and retrieval workload.</p><p>Additionally, nodes need to discover peers with similar interests for synchronization. Recon achieves this through nodes gossiping their interests and maintaining a list of peers' interests, ensuring synchronization with minimal bandwidth. Nodes also avoid sending event announcements to uninterested peers.</p> Performance and robustness improvements <p>This release, along with the recent Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) updates, marks significant scalability improvements. Currently, Ceramic provides a throughput of 250 TPS (transactions per second), more than double the previous throughput of up to 100 TPS before the Recon implementation. This increase in throughput is especially important for applications that handle large amounts of user data and require fast transaction times.</p><p>These numbers were measured between two nodes that share the same interest. It’s worth noting that nodes without overlapping interests do not affect each other's throughput. This means that, in theory, the throughput of a ceramic-one node scales horizontally. However, there is still one component that puts an upper limit on this: the CAS, which is operated by 3Box Labs. This service is currently a centralized bottleneck in the protocol, which is why the team’s next goal is <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ceramicstudio/projects/2/views/1?pane=issue&amp;itemId=68981845&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Self-Anchoring</a>, allowing any Ceramic-One node to operate completely independently.</p><p>This release of Ceramic is also a significant step towards making the Ceramic architecture more robust, enabling the team to iterate on it and build new protocol implementations more easily and quickly.</p> Getting started with ceramic-one <p>All new Ceramic developers are recommended to use the <code>ceramic-one</code> to start building on Ceramic. Check out <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/set-up-your-environment?ref=blog.ceramic.network">the setup guides</a> on the Ceramic documentation to get started.</p><p>Developers, who have been building on Ceramic for a while, are encouraged to migrate their applications to the <code>ceramic-one</code>-based implementation. Check out <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/blob/main/UPGRADE.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">this migration guide</a> to follow the migration steps.</p> Share you feedback with us! <p>We would like to get your feedback on building on Ceramic. Do you have any suggestions or ideas of how the core Ceramic team can improve the implementation of Ceramic? Do you have questions or troubles using the new release or migrating your existing application? Share your thoughts and ideas with us by posting on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Community Forum</a>.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs was founded in 2014 to give people control and freedom over their personal and private information. Based in California, Utah and Australia, the company has deep expertise in security, identity management, authentication and authorization, cloud, privacy, and cryptography, and equips businesses with cutting-edge privacy and cybersecurity solutions that seamlessly integrate with existing offerings and systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Anonyome Labs Chief Architect and DIF Steering Committee member, Steve McCown, talked to us about how the company is using Decentralized Identity to drive interoperability and usability of their products, his involvement in DIF, and decentralized identity standards work.&nbsp;</p><p>What does Anonyome offer, and who are your customers?&nbsp;</p><p>We started 10 years ago, when we noticed that people’s personal and private information was being collected and used without their permission. There were certain contact points that industry was using to triangulate people’s behavior, such as phone numbers and email addresses. So we developed an app called MySudo that gives users the ability to create contact sets and associated pseudonymous profiles called ‘Sudos’, consisting of an email address, phone number and a one-time or reusable credit card number.&nbsp;</p><p>People already had separate home and work contact details, so we took it further. With MySudo, you can create Sudos for your online purchases, for hobbies, for travel, and so on. Our mission was to create separate IDs, so when a hacker steals data from websites, or data brokers buy and sell your online activity data, they can’t correlate your home activities with your work activities, or your social activities with products you purchase. This increases your privacy by disrupting how your data can be correlated.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals use MySudo to privately communicate back and forth, share files, and so on — for all their usual digital activities. We also have an Enterprise-grade platform with all the same capabilities, which we license to organizations who incorporate these privacy-enhancing services into their own offerings. There are some very notable companies you would have heard of that are providing a white label version of our privacy-enhancing technologies to their customers. We’ve also been working with national governments to help preserve their citizens’ and commercial entities’ private data.&nbsp;</p><p>What got Anonyome interested in Decentralized Identity?&nbsp;</p><p>Anonyome is focused on creating strong privacy-enhancing and secure identity tools for everyday users.&nbsp; The MySudo product is a great example of how internet users can control their privacy during everyday activities, such as email, texting, calling, and purchasing.&nbsp; The critical privacy and security requirements for these elements are greatly enhanced with decentralized identity elements and protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a previous job, I worked for the US Department of Energy as a cybersecurity exploit researcher, so that’s part of my mindset. How would someone take advantage of existing identity paradigms? It’s not just about all the good that everyone is trying to accomplish, it’s also about how an adversary might leverage identity technologies for illicit purposes. That concern is what led me to engage with Decentralized Identity and keeping the crypto keys, passwords, tokens, etc. within your own digital wallet. Because if you control the keys, you can better control access to your data assets.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing that got Anonyome on this track is that strong crypto environments like Signal were emerging as closed ecosystems. If someone wants to use Signal, they also need to convince others to adopt it, too.&nbsp; For a lot of users, that can be really hard. Decentralized Identity provides a way to create an open encryption environment and keep the strong cryptography while also bridging across ecosystems. </p><p>While we may have competitors in parallel spaces, it benefits everyone if we can increase secure communication between applications that users enjoy using — this secure cross talk between applications becomes a rising tide that floats all boats … customers, companies, everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Interoperable security is the next evolution that extends beyond closed secure ecosystems, and we’re working to be interoperable with lots of other decentralized identity providers and users. This is why Anonyome has tasked me to work in the standards orgs. If we can collectively solve security and privacy issues at the identity standards level, then we will have a way to realize our goals for secure and private interoperability between applications … and people.&nbsp;</p><p>What is driving Decentralized Identity uptake, in your view?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s tremendous interest in Decentralized Identity. I credit a lot of this to GDPR. The EU has assigned significant liability and penalties for data breaches. Faced with these very large fines, companies are trying to figure out what they need to do to protect users' privacy, since this now affects their bottom lines. While some are doing the bare minimum, others are doing a lot more. There’s also a lot happening in Europe with the Digital Identity Wallet. We want to be interoperable with these standards and the services that implement them.&nbsp; So we've been reviewing the EU’s Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) to find out what identity, credentials, proof types and so on we need to work with.&nbsp;</p><p>Privacy at the legislative level is no longer just an EU thing. For example, there are new laws in Utah (US) that mandate that state government organizations can only collect the data they actually need, keep it only as long as authorized and then destroy it unless retention regulations require that they need to retain it. I serve on the Utah Privacy Commission and we’re very strong proponents of this. We will receive presentations from state agencies and give our feedback on what enhances privacy and what needs additional work. There is a real appetite among government officials for better privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also growing awareness of the potential problems associated with working in the cloud. For example, if you store your data in the cloud, it may be encrypted, but where do the keys go? If you don’t control access to the data access keys (or a provider does this as part of their service), then your information may be insecure without you really knowing it. Recently, there have been some very large data breaches, which seem like about once a month. In response, people are receiving emails saying “your data has been stolen, so here’s 3 to 6 months of free credit monitoring”. This almost seems on the level of “security theater” where companies are doing something, but it’s not very useful and doesn’t solve the problem.</p><p>Decentralized Identity can augment many existing services.&nbsp; For example, DI capabilities can be used to encrypt my files before they are sent to a cloud storage provider.&nbsp; The cloud storage provider can then work their storage, retrieval, and replication magic without having access to the unencrypted files. As long as I control the encryption keys, my data can only be decrypted by me.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s just what’s possible with file storage. Decentralized Identity is also delivering a wide range of interoperable privacy-enhancing capabilities for communications systems, identity control, access management, digital credentials, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s what I see happening with DI. If implemented as designed, we’re going to put privacy and security control in the users’ hands. Then we can continue to enjoy many wonderful cloud services while we will be able to control access to our own data.&nbsp;</p><p>What is the value of open standards for Anonyome and your customers?&nbsp;</p><p>We’re huge fans of open standards. We try not to build systems that are proprietary from an interoperability perspective. We strive to ensure that all of our interoperability points are based on industry standards, so that we can communicate with other platforms and they can easily communicate with ours.&nbsp; Embracing DI standards means if a user wants to use a particular platform, then they don’t have to convince others to use it before it's useful.</p><p>As a quick analogy, we’re aiming for the interoperability of email combined with the strong security and authentication of a secure communications application. Pick up any old email app and it will work with most any other, but the security isn’t there. If you work for a large enterprise, they may have put something like S/MIME in place, but when you or I get a regular gmail account, that’s not something we typically add. This is primarily because it’s too hard for users to manage the certificates and so forth. Today, this means that emails are typically transmitted in the clear and not end-to-end encrypted. DI facilitates privacy-enhancing and more secure interactions, which is a key reason why we’re working with these technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>As someone who is involved with DIF, W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium) and the Trust over IP Foundation, what do you see as their respective roles, and the differences between them?&nbsp;</p><p>We’re super excited about each of these organizations.&nbsp; W3C has spent a great deal of time and effort to create DI’s main building blocks, namely, DIDs and Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp; W3C is continuing to actively refine and extend these elements in order to facilitate many enhanced DI capabilities.</p><p>Trust over IP has created an excellent DI paradigm for illustrating how all of the DI components connect and interact.&nbsp; These layers depict how DIDs are anchored in a Verifiable Data Registry (such as a decentralized ledger), how DID-based communication takes place, how Verifiable Credentials fit into the ecosystem, and finally how a top layer governance model shows all participants in a system what the systems rules are.</p><p>What brought me to DIF was getting involved in DIDComm (Decentralized Identifier Communications).&nbsp; I see this as one of the main attractions in DI.&nbsp; As I had been participating for a while, I volunteered to become a co-chair with Sam Curren.&nbsp; This gave me new insights into the community standards-building processes and in particular key details of the DIDComm protocol.&nbsp; Later, Sam nominated me as a candidate during the Steering Committee elections and I am honored to have been elected to the SC.</p><p>I see DIF as one of the leading development organizations where implementation happens. While other organizations focus primarily on creating a range of standards and documents, which is vital, DIF typically focuses on producing a variety of working software that is based on industry standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).&nbsp; This makes DIF a key provider in the larger symbiotic DI industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of the various standards organizations are distinct and have different missions. DIF fills a critical void that traditional standards organizations don’t typically emphasize. The term incubator is a little outdated, but that’s part of the role that DIF performs. Everything in DI has started with a few people getting together and having a conversation about how to design, build, or enhance some particular technology element. This leads to standards being created.&nbsp; At some point, usable code libraries are created using the standard base elements and then those are combined into larger protocols, services, environments, and so on.&nbsp; </p><p>There’s a whole lot that needs to happen in this process, and a lot of that work happens at DIF.&nbsp; </p><p>If your goal is implementation right now, that’s where DIF excels. It’s where companies come to pick up architectural designs and reusable code libraries they can use in their products today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US and global respondents perceive Donald Trump as the Most ‘Crypto-Aware’ and ‘Crypto-Ready’ Presidential Candidate, outpacing Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy</p>
<p>Singapore: July 16th, 2024 – Here at Elastos, the premier SmartWeb ecosystem, we are excited to reveal the latest findings from our BIT Index (Bitcoin, Innovation &amp; Trust). This report underscores that Donald J. Trump is perceived as the leading figure among US tech-savvy consumers for his understanding and readiness to embrace Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Key Findings:</p>
 
 38% of respondents anticipate Bitcoin becoming mainstream within four years. 
 80% foresee Bitcoin evolving into a ‘default’ global currency. 
 Bitcoin adoption is progressing more rapidly in BRICS and Global South Nations compared to Western Nations. 
 
<p>Who is the Bitcoin President?</p>
<p>In the US, 50% of tech-savvy consumers recognize Donald Trump as the most ‘crypto-aware’ presidential candidate, demonstrating a profound understanding of Bitcoin’s intricacies and advantages, compared to Joe Biden (32%) and Robert F. Kennedy (19%).</p>
<p>Globally, the perception remains consistent:</p>
 
 Donald Trump: 51% 
 Joe Biden: 31% 
 Robert F. Kennedy: 19% 
 
<p>Demographic insights reveal that younger consumers (18-24) are slightly less inclined to view Trump as ‘crypto-aware’ (45%), compared to 25-34 year-olds (54%) and 35-44 year-olds (54%). Biden (34%) and Kennedy (21%) see a minor increase among the 18-24 demographic.</p>
<p>Trump is also viewed as the most ‘crypto-ready’ candidate in the US:</p>
 
 Donald Trump: 49% 
 Joe Biden: 30% 
 Robert F. Kennedy: 21% 
 
<p>Globally, the figures are:</p>
 
 Donald Trump: 51% 
 Joe Biden: 29% 
 Robert F. Kennedy: 20% 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, younger demographics (18-24) show less support for Trump as ‘crypto-ready’ (47%) compared to 25-34 year-olds (51%) and 35-44 year-olds (54%). Kennedy receives a slight uplift from 18-24 year-olds (24%).</p>
<p>Trump is also seen by 42% of US respondents as the candidate most likely to promote the use and benefits of Bitcoin compared to Joe Biden (23%) and Robert F. Kennedy (14%).</p>
<p>Globally:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trump’s support from younger voters (18-24) is lower (37%) compared to 25-34 year-olds (43%) and 35-44 year-olds (45%), while Kennedy sees a slight increase from 18-24 year-olds (17%).</p>
<p>Internationally, Nigerian respondents (59%), followed by the UK (56%) and Germany (54%), believe Trump is the most ‘crypto-ready’, compared to only 42% in India.<br>
</p>
<p>Bitcoin Going Mainstream</p>
<p>More than a third of tech-savvy consumers (38%) believe Bitcoin will become mainstream within four years. This belief is higher among 25-34 year-olds (41%) and 18-24 year-olds (40%).</p>
<p>A significant 80% foresee a future where Bitcoin becomes a ‘default’ currency for global transactions, including commodities, real estate, and company valuations.</p>
<p>BRICS Nations and Global South Leading in Bitcoin Adoption</p>
 
 24% of tech-savvy Indian consumers and 26% of UAE respondents use Bitcoin daily, compared to the global average of 18%. In contrast, only 11% of Germans, 13% of UK respondents, 14% of South Koreans, and 15% of US tech-savvy consumers use Bitcoin daily. 
 High acceptance is observed in the UAE and Brazil (49%) for Bitcoin going mainstream within four years, compared to 22% in Germany, 25% in South Korea, and 36% in the UK. 
 91% of Nigerians and 90% of Indians envision Bitcoin as a ‘default’ currency, compared to 70% in Germany, 73% in the UK and South Korea, and 75% in the US.

 Nissan, Honda eye EV battery passports in Europe by 2027 
 <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/honda-mazda-nissan-complete-1st-phase-of-web3-global-battery-passport-mvp/">Read on the LedgerInsights website</a><br> 
<p>MOBI, the mobility web3 consortium, has completed the first phase of the minimum viable product (MVP) for its global battery passport. This involved nine members including DENSO, Honda, Mazda, and Nissan exchanging battery identity and data using open standards.</p>
<p>Stepping back, if batteries are to achieve the hoped for environmental impact, how they’re manufactured and recycled is a critical part of the process. Hence the need to keep track of battery lifecycles as mandated in the US and Europe. Digital credentials can include the battery’s composition, status and history.</p>
<p>What MOBI is trying to sidestep is the need for costly one off integrations and to achieve cross industry interoperability.</p>
<p>Stage 1 implemented the Integrated Trust Network (ITN) identity services, which enables companies to exchange battery identity and data on a peer-to-peer basis. Hence, the ITN is a federated registry built and operated by the members using W3C decentralized identifiers (DID). It’s a self sovereign identity (SSI) offering that supports multiple blockchains. The SSI aspect means the data is stored with the battery rather than in a centralized database.</p>
<p>“Today’s global battery value chain is complex and it’s difficult to simultaneously ensure efficiency, scalability, safety, circularity, and regulatory compliance. To balance these priorities, we need to enhance battery lifecycle management through the creation of a shared ecosystem with SSI framework for secure coordination and selective disclosure of sensitive data,” said MOBI CEO and Co-founder, Tram Vo.</p>
<p>Stage 2 will involve trialing Citopia, MOBI’s web3 marketplace for services. This will support applications such as enhanced battery and carbon credits management and vehicle-to-grid communications and payment. It will also support other mobility solutions, such as data-driven pricing for used electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MOBI has developed several standards. The most relevant is its battery passport standard released a year ago. Perhaps its most foundational standard is for vehicle identity. Other standards include tracking emissions for trips, supply chain blockchain standards and blockchain in vehicle financing.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Elastos, under the BeL2 initiative, will be attending the <a href="https://b.tc/conference/2024">Bitcoin Conference</a> in Nashville, taking place from July 25-27, 2024, at the Music City Center, less than two weeks away! This participation is the result of a collaborative effort supported equally by our <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic</a> (our DAO) via Proposal 145 and the Elastos Foundation, spearheaded by Mark Blair, longstanding CR Council Member and Head of Strategy at <a href="http://bel2.org">BeL2</a>. In this article, we outline why this is so important for us, the details of our participation and how you can get involved! Let’s dive right in!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Transforming Bitcoin: Elastos’ Vision and the Power of BeL2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos</a> is dedicated to transforming Bitcoin into a smart, versatile asset while preserving its core principle of decentralisation. BeL2 is a powerful new technology that leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and a decentralised clearing network to enable advanced DeFi applications for native Bitcoin (NB). The mission is to maintain Bitcoin’s integrity as the ultimate decentralised system while unlocking its potential for complex financial transactions, staking, and smart contracts​​​​.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeL2 achieves this through a unique model where information, not assets, is transmitted across chains. This ensures that Bitcoin remains on its main network, maintaining its security and decentralisation. By utilising light client verification and zkBTC full nodes, BeL2 supports a range of Layer 2 applications, from lending to stablecoin issuance, paving the way for <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-new-bretton-woods-system/">a new decentralised financial system akin to the historical Bretton Woods system</a>, which, rather than being backed by gold, is backed by the 21st-century digital gold equivalent, Bitcoin.</p>
 Prime Location: Visit Elastos at Booth 621 
<p>Our booth at the conference has been officially confirmed, and we have secured a prime location on the conference floor. Booth 621 is the first large booth on the left as you enter, conveniently situated near the entrance, main stage, and the “Nakamoto Stage.” It’s also adjacent to the “Zen Lounge,” ensuring high visibility and foot traffic. This strategic positioning allows us to showcase our innovative solutions to a large audience, expected to be over 35,000 attendees​​!</p>
<p></p>
<p>At our booth, visitors will find exciting merchandise, fun giveaway prizes, and interactive games, including a spin-the-wheel activity. We will showcase alongside Elastos partners and stakeholders and also distribute a brochure (attached in this article) that highlights Elastos and its significant relationship with Bitcoin, emphasising ELA’s status as a merged-mined coin with over <a href="https://ela.elastos.io">50% of Bitcoin’s hash power​​.</a> Sasha Mitchell, the Head of BeL2 and founder of Elacity, will be speaking at the event, providing deeper insights into our technologies and future plans. The event will feature influential leaders such as Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cathie Wood, Michael Saylor, Russell Brand, and Edward Snowden. This year is shaping up to be a very interesting event, given the US elections in November and Web3 becoming political.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BTC Nashville represents an important moment for Elastos and the BeL2 project as we continue to push the boundaries of what Bitcoin can achieve. We invite everyone to visit our booth, engage with our team, and get excited for the future of decentralised finance with Elastos and BeL2. For more information about our participation and updates, stay tuned to our official channels. We look forward to seeing you in Nashville on the 25th! Excited to learn more? Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">Infinity</a> for the latest updates, we will keep you updated throughout the whole week!</p>

 Developing communications for your organisation <p>This summer WAO ties a bow around a body of work we’ve been doing together with <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">the Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC). This initiative is hosted at MIT and has member universities from around the&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>The Digital Credentials Consortium is advancing the use and understanding of portable, verifiable digital credentials in higher education through open source technology development and leadership, research, and advocacy.</blockquote><p>The DCC plays a pivotal role in the definition and establishment of the W3C Verifiable Credentials Standard. <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">Standards are often invisible, but they are massively important!</a></p><p>In this post, we’ll use our work with the DCC to help you systematically review your communication initiatives and give you a bit of a playbook on how to develop reusable communication assets and resources.</p> Understanding your&nbsp;audience An audience map WAO created with the&nbsp;DCC Research <p>When crafting communications strategies, most organisations miss a crucial step: audience research. Implementing lessons from outdated research or making assumptions about audience only to find out that your assumptions were wrong are two mistakes that you can&nbsp;avoid!</p><p>Before we started creating communication messaging and assets for the DCC, we did two rounds of interviews. In both rounds, we spoke one-to-one with people deeply involved in the DCC’s work. In the first round, we spoke with staff members, W3C task group members and people already implementing the Verifiable Credentials standard. In the second round, we talked to members of the DCC and with the Leadership Board. We asked the same questions for both rounds, but allowed for organic conversation to&nbsp;emerge.</p>cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>These interviews not only provided us with a bounty of onboarding and understanding to the DCC’s multitude of work, but it helped us identify, specifically, what stakeholders need and want from the&nbsp;DCC.</p> Segmentation <p>Once you have collected insights from your audience, you can begin to reflect those insights back in ways that help others understand who your audience is. Segmentation is a way to find overlapping interests and topics. We like to visualise segmentation and have done so in multiple ways, from our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">Audience Ikigai</a> to <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/defining-the-cast/">Defining the Cast</a> and <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/persona-mapping/">Persona Spectrums</a>, we use a couple of different tools to find audience overlaps. Figuring out a visual way to explain your audience and their unique needs and insights is a great way to help people feel connected to your organisation.</p> Crafting your communications First slide of a deck implementing suggested design constraints Being specific <p>Understanding your audience will help you tailor your messages and customise content to specific segments of your audience. Through research, you are also creating relationships with your audience and can encourage people to feel open to giving you feedback.</p><p>Our research and subsequent analysis helped us see trends and patterns to pay attention to as we began to craft communications for the DCC. We also identified some quick intervention points allowing us to immediately implement small changes and quick wins. For example, before we ran our final interview, we implemented a new README for the <a href="https://github.com/digitalcredentials/">DCC’s Github organisation</a>. Small wins can have big&nbsp;impact!</p><p>Our onboarding and research activities helped us see where there were misunderstandings, so that we could deal with them as quickly as possible.</p> Design guidelines <p>It can be helpful to put what we call “Design Constraints” in place when we’re building communication strategies and initiatives. Design Constraints are simply rules you and your colleagues use to create consistency in both visual and written language. For example, we helped the DCC select a colour palette, fonts and an illustration library for their future communications.</p><p>A brand guide is an example of visual design constraints. A “key messaging and wording” section in your communications strategy is another. It helps create consistency, so that your audiences know how you wish to communicate your organisational goals.</p> Growing your&nbsp;audience cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> Engagement <p>You want to engage with people strategically so that you can work sustainably and your communications are aligned with your current initiatives and goals. We use several tools to help us figure out the best way to engage with a specific audience or community. We’ve written often about <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop/">the Architecture of Participation</a>, our go-to framework for creating participatory communities.</p><p>We also like to build Contributor Pathways, which help show how different stakeholders engage with a project. These pathways can outline steps different audience take and where you might be able to engage with them more effectively.</p><p>There are four stages to the engagement model we like to&nbsp;use:</p>  Awareness — The first stage invites you to think about how your particular group hears about you or your project for the first time. The questions to as are How do they hear about us and how would we like them to hear about&nbsp;us?  First Engagement — Stage two identifies the first interaction a person or a group has with you or your project. What is the first action that they take and what action would you like them to&nbsp;take?  Build Relationship — Stage three is about your interaction. How do you build relationships with people or groups and what value can you&nbsp;bring?  Deepen Engagement — As people deepen their engagement with your organisation or project, you’ll want to show them that they’re valued. So how can you ensure consistent engagement with your most engaged audiences?  <p>We think about each of these stages in reference to each specific audience group, as some audiences might be more or less engaged than&nbsp;others.</p> Advocacy <p>WAO tends to work with groups and organisations that are trying to create a better world. Advocacy is an integral part of our work. There are a variety of advocacy and collaboration strategies as well as best practices that you can use to ensure you are able to promote your messages in a way that lead to&nbsp;action.</p><p>In this post on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">campaigning for the right things</a>, we take a deep dive into using an advocacy framework to figure out where we might focus efforts. You can reapply this framework to your own initiatives!</p> Building and sustaining engagement cc-by-nd Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO Cadence <p>If you’ve truly understood your audiences through research and analysis and you’ve determined the messages and design constraints you need to utilise for maximum communication effectiveness, your audience will begin to grow. Yay! You are building engagement!</p><p>It’s time to find sustainable ways to keep your engagement going. Probably the most effective strategy we have for sustaining engagement is cadence and consistency.</p>an example month of DCC events and associated comms<p>You need to establish a cadence to your engagement efforts both so that your growing audience knows what to expect and so that you and your team can stay sane. It’s simple, but a communication schedule will help you be consistent, so that people stay engaged.

 <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Electric-vehicles/Nissan-Honda-eye-EV-battery-passports-in-Europe-by-2027">Read on Nikkei’s website</a><br> 
<p>By Azusa Kawakami, Nikkei staff writer | 12 July 2024 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p>NEW YORK — Nissan Motor, Honda Motor and other Japanese auto industry companies have joined forces to develop a digital tracking system for electric-vehicle batteries, anticipating European Union regulations aimed at encouraging recycling and reducing reliance on China.</p>
<p>Mazda Motor and parts supplier Denso are also among the seven Japanese companies planning to introduce a “battery passport” by 2027.</p>
<p>Businesses and car owners will use a code to access these digital records and find information about the amount of recyclable metals used, origin and production history. The passport will also provide the extent of battery deterioration and residual value.</p>
<p>The companies will seek to put the system to use first in Europe, where battery regulations are to be introduced in 2027.</p>
<p>Adopted in June 2023, the regulations will make battery recycling mandatory within the EU bloc. Among the provisions is a requirement that 50% of lithium from used batteries must be recycled by 2027.</p>
<p>From 2027, automakers will need to meet those regulations for EVs sold in Europe, with penalties for failing to do so.</p>
<p>Nissan and Honda are participants in the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative, an alliance of more than 120 companies from Japan, the U.S. and Europe, and have been involved in the development of the battery passport infrastructure.</p>
<p>The EU’s tougher battery regulations are due in part to a desire to cut its reliance on China, which dominates the supply of battery materials. China accounts for 65% of the world’s processing and refining of lithium, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>The U.S., which is strengthening its own restrictions against China, is also considering introducing battery passports. The Inflation Reduction Act made it a condition for EV makers to procure batteries within North America to qualify for vehicle subsidies. Passports can help certify where batteries come from.</p>
<p>But because China leads the EV battery market with a roughly 60% share and controls much of the supply chain, it could be difficult to obtain full battery data without Chinese cooperation.</p>
<p>China’s CATL, the world’s leading automotive battery manufacturer, is said to have over 1 trillion pieces of battery data, from raw materials to recycling.</p>

<p>Canada’s digital trust leader, the DIACC, releases its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) Authentication Final Recommendation V1.2, signalling it’s ready for inclusion in their <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Certification Program</a>.</p>



<p>Why is the PCTF Authentication component important?</p>



<p>The Authentication component helps assure the on-going integrity of login and authentication processes by certifying, through a process of assessment, that they comply with standardized Conformance Criteria. The Conformance Criteria for this component may be used to provide assurances that Trusted Processes result in the representation of a unique Subject at a Level of Assurance that it is the same Subject with each successful login to an Authentication Service Provider while also providing assurances concerning the predictability and continuity in the login processes that they offer or on which they depend.</p>



<p>What problems does the PCTF Authentication component solve?</p>



<p>The Authentication component helps establish a standardized way for individuals and organizations to verify their identities when accessing digital services. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches. Additionally, by providing a reliable method for authentication, this allows the PCTF to foster trust and confidence among users, service providers, and stakeholders. This is crucial for the widespread adoption of digital services.</p>



<p>Who does the PCTF Authentication component help?</p>



<p>All participants will benefit from login and authentication processes that are repeatable and consistent (whether they offer these processes, depend on them, or both). It can help lay the foundation to provide assurances that identified Users can engage in authorized interactions with remote systems. When combined with considerations from the PCTF Wallet Component, participants may have an enhanced user experience through the reuse of credentials across multiple Relying Parties.</p>



<p>Relying Parties can benefit from the ability to build on the assurance that Authentication Trusted Processes uniquely identify, at an acceptable level of risk, a Subject in their application or program space.</p>

<p>An interview on risks, trends, and tools in OSINT digital&nbsp;research</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@emilymorter?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Emily Morter</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/question-mark-neon-signage-8xAA0f9yQnE?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a><p>When <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/johanna-wild">Johanna Wild</a> entered the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard as a joint <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/#:~:text=The%20Nieman%2DBerkman%20Klein%20Fellowship,project%20relating%20to%20journalism%20innovation.">Nieman Foundation</a> innovation fellow, I was intrigued. Wild works for the award-winning international open source (OS) investigative journalism collective <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/about/awards/">Bellingcat</a>. She is an expert on the creative deployment of technical approaches to support a more diverse cohort of public interest reporters and investigators, blending automated approaches with human-centered research methodology.</p><p>As someone who has supported expert networks in both disinformation and conflict documentation, I wanted Wild’s first-hand perspective on the benefits and risks of using novel open source intelligence (OSINT) tools to enable a broader, more transparent global knowledge base. We conducted this interview over email between Amsterdam and New York&nbsp;City.</p><p>Sam Hinds: Do you encounter specific types of people or professional backgrounds in the work of investigations and OSINT tool development?</p><p>Johanna Wild: The great thing about the field of open source research is that it consists of people from various backgrounds. Open source researchers spend a lot of time online. They find pieces of information on social media platforms, in online forums, and databases, and they compare features that they identify in user-generated online videos and photos with locations that can be seen on satellite imagery. This process, called geolocation, is used to verify online images. The nature of open source research allows everyone with an internet connection to do this type of&nbsp;work.</p><p>The open source researcher community is therefore a mix of people who do open source research as part of their job and volunteers who are passionate about contributing to important research in their free time. My surveys and user interviews with our Bellingcat community showed that our community consists of people working for human rights organizations, stay-at-home-parents who use their limited time to do something mentally challenging and useful, cybersecurity specialists, job seekers who want to learn new skills, lawyers, data scientists, people who are retired and many more. When I ask volunteers about their motivation, they often say that they want to contribute to research that reveals issues in the regions where they live, that they want to feel that in these times that are characterized by various conflicts around the world, and global challenges like climate change; they do not just passively sit around but actively contribute to something that creates new knowledge about those issues. Another motivation is to become part of a community with similar interests and to improve their open source research&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Of course there are also many journalists who are part of this community. Nowadays, more and more newsrooms are setting up teams focusing on open source research. However, journalists were more of the late adopters in this field. Most of them only discovered in the last few years how useful this type of research can be, especially if it is combined with traditional journalistic skills and methods. Newsrooms even started hiring skilled open source researchers who are completely self-taught and who have no journalism degree, which is something that is still rather unusual in the news industry.</p><p>Volunteers with a technical background contribute by building tools. These are often simple command line tools that are able to do one very specific task, for instance to scrape posts from a specific social media platform or to check whether an online account has been created on a platform using a specific phone number. Those tools do not usually turn into big commercial products; they are built by people from within the open source software community who focus on writing code that is publicly accessible to anyone. Several years ago, I clearly saw that the open source researcher and the open source software community are a very good match for each other, we just needed to bring them together. This is one of the things that we now do at Bellingcat. We organize hackathons, actively invite software developers into our volunteer community, and support them to build their own tools or to contribute to tools built by the Bellingcat team. This group of volunteers consists for example of people who have a full time job in a software company but want to do something meaningful in their free time, of job seekers who want to create their own portfolio of tools, or of academics who are already deep into a technical topic but would like to test its practical application.</p><p>Although the open source researcher and tech communities are very diverse in terms of their professional and personal backgrounds, they are currently still dominated by volunteers and professionals from Western countries, mainly from the US and Europe. The technical tool builder community is also, to date, still male dominated. This lack of representation raises serious questions in terms of who defines the future of our field and who has the power to research topics in regions all around the world. With people in many other regions still excluded from participating in this type of research, they mainly become the subject of Western researchers.</p><blockquote>“While AI tools can be powerful, we should not expect to automate the whole open source research process. Doing open source research is a combination of specific research methods, the use of tools, a good dose of logical thinking and also creativity!”</blockquote><p>SH: Have you seen novel trends emerge in the type of information researchers want&nbsp;today?</p><p>JW: I definitely observe that researchers, and especially journalists, have become more aware of how useful it is to be able to work with large datasets, to know how to scrape information from websites or to have the skills to build small tools that can speed up some of their research&nbsp;tasks.</p><p>Currently, everyone is of course interested in AI. Less experienced researchers are hoping for a tool that lets them input any picture or video and then spits out the exact location of where it was taken. While AI tools can be powerful, we should not expect to automate the whole open source research process. Doing open source research is a combination of specific research methods, the use of tools, a good dose of logical thinking and also creativity! Creativity is needed to spot topics that are worth getting investigated. When deciding where to look next in the vast amount of online information that is out there, creativity helps to connect multiple, often tiny, pieces of verified information which allow researchers to draw conclusions on a certain&nbsp;topic.</p><p>Another trend is the use of facial recognition tools. Open source researchers often find pictures that show individuals who have a connection to a certain research case but whose identity they don’t know. In the last few years, several easy to use facial recognition tools have emerged. Researchers can upload a picture of a person and the tool compares this picture with collections of photos from social media platforms. Sometimes, this can reveal the identity of a person, for instance by providing the person’s LinkedIn profile. It is obvious how useful this can be to identify individuals who were involved in serious crimes that require journalistic reporting.</p><p>However, facial recognition tools are a double-edge sword. We all know that they can provide wrong results. Two people might just look very similar and an uninvolved person might be misidentified as someone who is involved in illegal activities. It is therefore important that open source researchers do not use those tools as the only way of identifying someone. On top of that, the use of such tools raises various ethical questions ranging from the risk of stalking random people online, to questions about the data sources on which facial recognition tools rely. At Bellingcat, we reflected on how we can ensure a responsible use of facial recognition technologies and concluded that we will refrain from using these tools extensively, and never as a core element of an investigation. We also never used products from companies like Clearview AI. A good example of how we sometimes use a facial recognition tool as a starting point for further research can be found in our article on how <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/04/06/cartel-king-kinahans-google-reviews-expose-travel-partners/">“Cartel King Kinahan’s Google Reviews Expose Travel Partners”</a>.</p><p>SH: Are there any overlooked tools that you like to highlight in your trainings?</p><p>JW: The best type of tool really depends on the research topic. Often a combination of several small tools can lead to the best results. For instance, our<a href="https://bellingcat.github.io/name-variant-search/"> Name Variant Search Tool</a> is basically an enhanced search engine for finding information about people. Open source researchers often start with a name and try to find out as much as possible about the person’s online presence. However, the name might be written differently on different sites. “Jane Doe” might also show up as “J. Doe” or “Doe, Jane”. The tool suggests different possible variations of a name and provides search results for all those variations. It is also possible to instruct the tool to search for a name specifically on Linkedin or Facebook.</p><p>Example: Name Variant Search results for different variants of the name “Jane&nbsp;Doe”</p><p>Our<a href="https://osm-search.bellingcat.com/"> OpenStreetMap search tool</a>, on the other hand, supports the geolocation process. A core task of many open source researchers is to find out where a photo or video that they found online has been taken. To do that, they try to identify specific features and compare those with what is visible on satellite imagery or maps. If researchers already have a rough idea in which region a photo might have been taken, they can input a list of features that are visible in the photo (for instance, a residential street, a school and a supermarket) into our tool, which will try to list all locations in a pre-defined region in which those features show up together. This can really help narrow down possible locations.</p><p>SH: What’s an example of an unusual story or insight one can find from OS&nbsp;tools?</p><p>JW: If open source researchers have no idea where a picture might have been taken but they know at which time it was captured and the photo shows objects that cast clearly visible shadows, they can try our<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/GalenReich/ShadowFinder/blob/main/ShadowFinderColab.ipynb"> ShadowFinder</a> tool which is able to calculate at which locations around the world shadow lengths correspond with what can be seen in the photo at a specific point in time. This helps open source researchers concentrate their geolocation efforts to the areas suggested by the tool instead of searching across the whole&nbsp;world.</p>Example of a<a href="https://github.com/bellingcat/ShadowFinder"> ShadowFinder</a> tool result: Possible locations are shown by the yellow&nbsp;circle.<p>Another tool that has gained popularity within the open source researcher community is<a href="https://peakvisor.com/"> PeakVisor</a>, a tool that was originally targeted at helping mountaineers orient themselves but which can also be used for<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/07/13/more-than-mountaineering-using-peakvisor-for-geolocation/"> geolocation tasks</a>. For instance, we used it to research the location of the<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/12/11/the-sound-of-bullets-the-killing-of-colombian-journalist-abelardo-liz/"> killing of Colombian journalist Abelardo Liz</a>. This example in particular shows that a combination of research skills and the use of tools can go a long&nbsp;way.</p><p>SH: What frustrations or barriers do you see as a trainer, and how could the field democratize knowledge of command line&nbsp;tools?</p><p>JW: First of all: Teaching open source research is great. People who are interested in learning these methods come from so many different backgrounds which allows everyone to learn new things from each other, including the trainers! The topic is also quite accessible, meaning that everyone can start doing open source research with very simple methods, like using search engines in creative ways. Sometimes, this can lead to surprising results: For instance, just by googling, my colleague Foeke Postma revealed how<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/05/28/us-soldiers-expose-nuclear-weapons-secrets-via-flashcard-apps/"> US soldiers exposed nuclear weapons secrets via flashcard apps</a>.</p><p>Of course not all methods are as simple, and one of the things people are struggling with the most are research tools. During my <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/">Nieman-Berkman Klein fellowship</a> my research assistant Cooper-Morgan Bryant and I interviewed forty open source researchers about their use of tools. Their answers confirmed my<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/08/12/these-are-the-tools-open-source-researchers-say-they-need/"> previous findings</a> on this topic: Open source researchers, who are either beginners or who are looking at a topic that is new to them, find it really difficult to figure out what tool they should use at what stage of the research process and how those tools work. With such a wide variety of online tools, some more useful and some easier to find than others, and many researchers feel overwhelmed by the task of finding their way through the landscape of available tools spread across various platforms.</p><p>In addition, the majority of open source researchers are not able to use command line tools since this requires a certain degree of technical skills. However, those are exactly the type of small tools that the open source software community is building most frequently. There is a clear divide between those who are building tools for open source researchers and the researcher community itself, for whom those tools often turn out not to be accessible.</p><blockquote>“Open source researchers want complex tools that are easy to use and that are stable and well-developed but such tools need funders and teams who build them, and these conditions are not always easily met in the open source research and journalism space.”</blockquote><p>On the other side, open source researchers are often not aware of the resources that are required to build mature tools that have an easy-to-use interface. It is getting easier now, but tool builders need to invest a lot more time to build such tools and this is difficult for people who do this task in their free time and without any funding. Open source researchers want complex tools that are easy to use, stable, and well-developed, but such tools need funders and teams who build them. These conditions are not always easily met in the open source research and journalism space. I hope that researchers will become a little bit more open to learn some basic technical skills, and even more importantly that they understand that not every tool that is useful for their research has to function like a fully built commercial tool.</p><p>At Bellingcat, we focus on bridging this gap between tool builders and open source researchers. We work with tech communities —often through programs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOHj7r0_CKA">hackathons</a> or fellowships — and make them aware of how important good user guides are, even for seemingly easy-to-use tools. On the other hand, we teach open source researchers how to use command line tools. We also launched a video series with the goal to help researchers make their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymCMy8OffHM">first steps</a> towards the more technical side of research&nbsp;tools.</p><p>SH: Tools take a lot of resources to build. Do any OSINT tools have a complicated provenance in terms of private sector origin or geopolitics?</p><p>JW: It is definitely problematic that researchers and journalists can be so dependent on tools provided by big tech companies. Meta’s social monitoring platform Crowdtangle will be shut down in August and this has caused a lot of discontent amongst journalists, in particular amongst those who are covering elections. For instance, many of the platforms and tools open source researchers use are provided by Google, like Google Search, Google Maps and Google Earth Pro. We are often at the mercy of the decisions that big tech companies take regarding use of their&nbsp;tools.</p><p>However, their tools are usually provided for free, which is not the case for other commercial tools. Open source researchers definitely need to look into the companies from which they are buying tools. One risk is that tool providers might be able to see what type of keywords people are typing in or on what topic someone is working on. Researchers and journalists need to be sure that their sensitive research topics are safe from being monitored by tool providers.</p><p>At Bellingcat we focus on mostly small open source tools, but those tools come with their own set of challenges. For instance, it is often not clear who is behind a tool that is offered on code-sharing platforms like Github, which can raise security-related questions.</p><blockquote>“I would love to see universities getting more involved in building and maintaining tools for open source researchers and journalists…since both sides have the common goal of advancing research in the public interest”</blockquote><p>This is why I really hope we can build a different tool ecosystem for open source researchers in the future. I would love to see universities getting more involved in building and maintaining tools for open source researchers and journalists. I think that such collaborations could work well since both sides have the common goal of advancing research in the public interest, and many of the tools that are used by open source researchers are equally useful for academic researchers. I also see opportunities to research security-related aspects of widely used tools together, as journalists and open source researchers could definitely use some help in assessing the risks that some of the tools they are using might be posing. If anyone who reads this would like to discuss these topics with me: Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/johanna_wild">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p><p>SH: Misinformation, disinformation, conspiratorial thinking: What are some of the uses and abuses of “research” you see in these contexts?</p><p>JW: What is most common — especially during conflicts and wars — is that people share either photos or videos from a different conflict or old imagery and make people believe that they are related to current events. In the context of the Israel-Gaza conflict since October 2023, this phenomenon has reached a new scale with countless examples circulating online. For instance,<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/11/hamas-attacks-israel-bombs-gaza-and-misinformation-surges-online/"> Bellingcat</a> found videos that were shared with the claims that one showed rockets that were fired at Israel by Hamas and another that claimed to show recent Israeli strikes on Hamas; both turned out to be recycled videos that had been uploaded to YouTube several years&nbsp;prior.</p><blockquote>“People who post such pictures might sometimes think they are doing ‘research’ and that they are sharing relevant information about an ongoing conflict, without realizing that they are actually sharing incorrect information.”</blockquote><p>What is dangerous is that some of those posts go viral and are able to reach significant numbers of people who will never know that they fell for misinformation. People who post such pictures might sometimes think they are doing “research” and that they are sharing relevant information about an ongoing conflict, not realizing the information is incorrect. Others, however, will do it on purpose to evoke emotions either in favor or against one of the conflict parties. Users of online platforms cannot really do much to prevent being confronted with such posts. This is another reason it is essential that we all learn to question what we see online and to invest some time in learning <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2021/11/01/a-beginners-guide-to-social-media-verification/">basic verification skills</a>.</p><p>What we have also been seeing is that supporters of conspiracy ideologies are increasingly using open source research tools and presenting the information as journalistic findings. For example,<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/11/24/toy-rabbits-chemtrails-and-german-qanon-fanatics-how-not-to-conduct-open-source-investigations/"> Qanon supporters</a> in German-speaking countries started using flight-tracking sites to search for flights which they falsely believed were circling above “deep underground military bases” in which children were hidden and mistreated. This is problematic since people who are not aware of the methods and standards of open source research might not be able to differentiate between serious research and the distorted version of&nbsp;it.</p><p>SH: What are some of your favorite guidelines or best practices for journalists who aim to cover (and fact-check) broad conspiratorial thinking enabled by OS information?</p><p>JW: Looking at their business models can often be a very promising approach. More often than not, conspiracy-minded communities have business-savvy people amongst them who manage to benefit financially from those communities’ beliefs. When I was researching QAnon online communities in Germany, big platforms like Amazon and eBay had started implementing measures to ban QAnon products from their platforms. However, this seemed to have created new opportunities for QAnon influencers who were offering merchandise via their own small online shops. On top of that, customers in Germany were able to buy QAnon products from abroad, for instance from Chinese or British companies who offered products targeted specifically at German-speaking customers.

It is well established that women and gender-nonconforming people have traditionally had a much harder time to enter and succeed in the space of investigative journalism.

The idea of one lone wolf who solves all the research challenges on their own is really the exact opposite of how open source research works best, which is by nature collaborative and often requires the efforts of many to put together various small pieces of verified online sources for a specific research case. For those of us who don’t want, and are also not able to fit into this commonly portrayed male hero picture, this field might not necessarily feel like a good&nbsp;fit.</p><p>However, since more and more traditional newsrooms are setting up open source research units right now, I see more women entering the field and hopefully, this will also change how we publicly talk about open source research over time. To everyone who organizes a public event on open source research, I recommend to not only approach the few already well known voices in the field but to take the effort to find and invite speakers who can contribute new perspectives and who have done research on topics that are not always in the spotlight.</p><p>SH: What were the most meaningful conversations you had during your time at the Berkman Klein Center? Do you plan to use any of your connections or insights from the fellowship in your future&nbsp;work?</p><p>JW: I am very grateful that I was able to be a Berkman Klein Fellow this year. It was a great opportunity to be part of a community of people who all reflect on how we integrate new technologies in our lives but from various different angles. Each fellow and community hour provided me with insights into a different technology-related topic and I liked the “surprise” effect of being able to learn new things about topics I usually don’t have the time to think about. This has definitely had an impact on how I approached my own projects with Bellingcat. I feel that being immersed in such a knowledgeable and collaborative community has unlocked my creativity and I am looking forward to continuing to learn from everyone in the Berkman Klein sphere in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Johanna Wild was a joint 2023–2024 <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/fellowships/nieman-berkman-fellowship-in-journalism-innovation-2/#:~:text=The%20Nieman%2DBerkman%20Klein%20Fellowship,project%20relating%20to%20journalism%20innovation">Nieman-Berkman Fellow in Journalism Innovation</a>, a joint fellowship administered between the <a href="https://nieman.harvard.edu/">Nieman Foundation for Journalism</a> and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University.

<p></p>      First Web3 Global Battery Passport Implementation for Current and Future Regulatory Compliance           <p>DENSO, Honda, Mazda, and Nissan among MOBI members who have completed Stage 1 of the Cross-Industry Interoperable Minimum Viable Product, a three-year initiative towards a decentralized Global Battery Passport built for data privacy and selective disclosure   </p>
          <p>Los Angeles, 10 July 2024 — MOBI, a global nonprofit Web3 consortium, is thrilled to announce a significant milestone in development of the Web3 Global Battery Passport (GBP) Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In a historic first, the MVP has successfully demonstrated battery identity/data validation and exchange between nine organizations using open-standards — <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">MOBI Battery Birth Certificate</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework — an achievement that carries exciting implications for stakeholders of the battery value chain and lays critical groundwork for the Web3 Economy. Organizations worldwide are invited to <a href="https://dlt.mobi/participate/">join and collaborate</a> in this trailblazing effort.</p>
<p>Participants of MOBI Circular Economy and the GBP Working Group, constituting close to USD 1 Trillion in annual revenue and representing diverse functions within the global battery ecosystem, have successfully completed Stage 1 of the three-year MVP and are set to begin Stage 2. Implementers of the decentralized GBP include <a href="https://www.anritsu.com/">Anritsu</a>, <a href="https://www.densoautoparts.com/">DENSO</a>, <a href="https://www.hioki.com/">HIOKI</a>, <a href="https://global.honda/">Honda</a>, <a href="https://www.mazda.com/">Mazda</a>, <a href="https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/">Nissan</a>, and <a href="https://trade-log.io/">TradeLog Inc</a>. </p>
<p>As the world increasingly turns to batteries for sustainable energy solutions, global battery value chains are making continuous improvements to enhance operational efficiency, circularity, and cross-border compliance. Forward-looking global policies like the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/17/2023-06822/section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit">US Treasury’s Section 30D Guidance on EV Tax Credits</a> and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32023R1542">EU Battery Regulation</a> mandate digital recordkeeping to track battery life cycles, underscoring the need for a global battery passport — a digital credential containing key information about the battery’s composition, state of health, history, and more.</p>
<p>Creating a scalable GBP will require cross-industry interoperability, such that entities across the value chain can securely coordinate and selectively share relevant data without the need to pay for costly one-off integrations or abandon their existing systems. MOBI and its members believe Web3 can become a key enabler for cross-industry interoperability at scale. SSI in particular introduces a promising approach to unlocking powerful synergies, enabling entities to securely control and share credentials across different web applications and platforms without the need for centralized intermediaries. To this end, MOBI and its members are building a decentralized Web3 marketplace ecosystem with standardized communication protocols for Self-Sovereign Data and SSI, designed such that the federated infrastructure and data therein are not controlled or managed by one organization. While MOBI MVP initiative demonstrates a specific use case for implementing the GBP, the benefits of MOBI Web3 implementation extend to almost any use case that involves multiparty transactions. </p>
<p>In Stage 1 of the initiative, implementers demonstrated the<a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/"> Integrated Trust Network</a> (ITN) identity services of one-to-one cross-validation for battery identity and data. The ITN serves as a federated (member-built and operated) registry for W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>, offering SSI management for connected entities such as batteries and their value chain participants. The ITN is the first enterprise network supporting multiple blockchains at the same time. These features are unique to the ITN, built for high resilience by ensuring the network’s functionality and sustainability do not rely on a single organization or blockchain. </p>
<p>Stage 2 will demonstrate <a href="https://citopia.global/">Citopia</a> decentralized marketplace services through creation of the cross-industry interoperable, privacy-preserving GBP. ITN services are one-to-one whereas Citopia services are one-to-many (and many-to-one). Through Web3 implementation, the availability and selective disclosure of trusted data and identities throughout the battery value chain will beget digital services and applications such as enhanced battery and carbon credits management, vehicle-to-grid communications and transactions, risk-based insurance calculations, and data-driven used electric vehicle pricing.</p>
<p>“Today’s global battery value chain is complex and it’s difficult to simultaneously ensure efficiency, scalability, safety, circularity, and regulatory compliance. To balance these priorities, we need to enhance battery lifecycle management through the creation of a shared ecosystem with SSI framework for secure coordination and selective disclosure of sensitive data,” said MOBI CEO and Co-founder, Tram Vo. “Driving innovation at this scale requires cross-industry collaboration. We invite public and private organizations worldwide to join us in this critical pursuit.”</p>
<p>“Web3 is an interesting technology which may facilitate a more scalable approach to exchanging battery data in a peer-to-peer fashion between organizations,” said Christian Köbel, Senior Engineer at Honda Motor Co., Ltd. </p>
<p>“It is confirmed how Web3-based self-sovereign data management works throughout Stage 1 of the MVP,” said Yusuke Zushi, Senior Manager at Nissan. </p>
<p>Said Mazda Motor Corporation, “Through participation in the GBP Working Group, we not only acquired the technical knowledge of Web3 but also understood a vision of an ecosystem that realizes the exchange of reliable information. We appreciate MOBI for giving us this invaluable opportunity.”</p>
<p>“The Stage 1 MVP experiment was instrumental in deepening our understanding of a system that enables sovereign data management. In the current era of data, the integrity and safety of information flow are paramount. As an experienced manufacturer of measuring instruments, HIOKI has always placed a premium on the reliability and accuracy of data,” said Kenneth Soh, Executive Officer at HIOKI. “We believe that the insights gained from this MVP are vital for the future progress of measurement instrument manufacturers and the industries we serve, from the perspective of innovation and societal contribution driven by mechanisms that offer both security and precision in data distribution.”</p>
<p>“The successful implementation of the Web3 GBP MVP is a significant step towards a more transparent and sustainable battery ecosystem. We are honored to contribute to the realization of the GBP as participants in this important initiative,” said Hisashi Matsumoto, Senior Manager at Anritsu. </p>
<p>“We, TradeLog, Inc., proudly support the decentralized Global Battery Passport project, driven by the efforts of MOBI and its dedicated Implementers,” said Alvin Ishiguro, Project Coordinator at TradeLog, Inc. “Going forward, we will continue to deliver our customers new experiences through blockchain technologies in the energy sector.”</p>

 An Identiverse 2024 Panel Recap 
<p>The attendance for this <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089504/">panel, which featured all co-chairs of the Shared Signals Working Group (SSWG</a>), was near capacity and the engagement from the audience in the Q&amp;A was resounding…because the hype is real with CAEP. The panel was moderated by IDAC podcast host, Jeff Steadman. His questions ranged from provisioning use cases to applicability in connected scenarios with other IAM domains (such as ITDR) and diving deeper into the CAEP specification and Shared Signals Framework. The “IAM CAEPable” T-shirts were also a hot commodity…and there might be another order coming soon.</p>
<p>The many questions from the audience made the discussion even more lively, allowing for open and real conversations to occur with the assembled panel of experts. The panelists felt the audience’s engagement as they saw people scribbling notes, typing on a laptop, or nodding their heads before raising their hands to elaborate or branch off into new areas. Sometimes the energetic Q&amp;A led to a conversation between the audience and multiple panelists. This article covers the highlights.</p>
 Highlights &amp; Key Points 
<p>Q: What are the practical use cases and applications of CAEP Events?</p>
<p>Apart from the immediate “session revoked” scenario, now implemented by platform providers like <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-business-manager/federated-authentication-identity-provider-axmfcab66783/web">Apple</a>, CAEP can be applied in numerous other scenarios. These include, for example, revoking a suspicious device’s session without impacting the end user or informing an IdP of assurance level changes – informative and actionable signals. </p>
<p>A real world scenario is when an event is emitted from an anomaly detection engine, which results in a CAEP event being transmitted so you could take action to revoke the specific session for both the user and possibly the device, if applicable.</p>
<p>Q: Where do CAEP and ITDR intersect? Can you explain the significance of this intersection?</p>
<p>CAEP brings the “R” in ITDR (Identity Threat Detection and Response). Additionally, Shared Signals (SSF) can be leveraged to enhance ITDR by providing a way to communicate detected threats and trigger responses to security systems…using an open standard. Think of Shared Signals as the management framework and CAEP as, effectively, the events that sit on top of it. The new events introduced in the latest CAEP draft, “Session Established” and “Session Presented”, can also help detect usage anomalies like lateral movement across cloud resources.</p>
<p>Q: Can this be used in provisioning use cases?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new draft in the IETF called “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-scim-events/">SCIM Events</a>” defines events that can be shared using the Shared Signals Framework (SSF). This can be used to communicate changes to accounts such as new account provisioning or account termination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: How can you link events to the same underlying action or reason?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest draft of the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-03.html">Shared Signals Framework (SSF)</a> includes guidelines on using the JWT “txn” claim to ensure that transmitters and receivers do not process multiple events for the same underlying cause or reason and to establish a lineage between cause or reason to the events transmitted for reconciliation or closing the loop.</p>
 New Features and Drafts Released 
<p>There have been some exciting new developments from the Shared Signals Working Group. The new drafts have been released for review by the OpenID Foundation membership and voting. This stemmed from feedback at the Gartner Interoperability Summit, robust security analysis by the University of Stuttgart, natural maturation of the specification, and Work Group feedback where more use cases were brought to light.</p>
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-03.html">Shared Signals Framework (SSF) – Draft 03</a> 
<p>Clarification and bug fixes have been added to this draft. There have also been security issues addressed with issuer and stream audience mix up and potential attacker subject insertion. New features added include: the use of the txn claim to prevent cascading chains from the same underlying event and a means of using it for reconciliation and transmitters can now specify in their metadata which streams have no subjects by default or “appropriate subjects”.</p>
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-04.html">Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) Draft 03</a> 
<p>The big update here is the introduction of 2 new events: “Session Established” and “Session Presented”. Additionally, the draft has been updated to reflect new formats and fields in examples to match the new SSF draft.</p>
 <a href="https://openid.github.io/sharedsignals/openid-caep-interoperability-profile-1_0.html">CAEP Interoperability Profile – Draft 00</a> 
<p>The first version of the CAEP Interoperability Profile, which defines how implementations can be fully interoperable for specific use cases such as session revocation and credentials change, is also released.</p>

 Elastos’ Friction Point 
<p>Elastos has long struggled with bridging issues, which affects ecosystem growth. Users on exchanges like Coinbase faced difficulties accessing Elastos as only ELA on Ethereum was available. Previous solutions, such as<a href="https://glidefinance.io/"> Glide Finance’s</a> high-fee shadow token bridge and<a href="https://elk.finance/"> ELK Finance</a>‘s complex swaps, frustrated the community. Just as airports facilitate international travel and business, cross-chain interoperability is vital for a cohesive DeFi ecosystem, reducing costs, enhancing tourism, and promoting overall business.</p>
<p>Unlike<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/centralized-exchange-vs-decentralized-merkeleon-software-q70uf/"> Centralised exchanges</a> (CEXs) with third-party control, stringent identity checks (KYC), and entry/exit restrictions, decentralised cross-chain exchanges (DEXs) like Chainge offer a permissionless alternative. They enable secure, seamless asset transfers across blockchains, supporting decentralised identities and eliminating centralisation risks, thus improving utility, security and efficiency for all Web3 stakeholders.</p>

 Stemming from<a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/6605604e60cec9007c846ea6"> CRC Proposal 151</a> and led by Sasha Mitchell, <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elacity-revolutionising-drm-in-the-digital-transformation-era/">Elacity</a> CEO and <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-new-bretton-woods-system/">BeL2</a> Head of Operations, in collaboration with Chainge team CEO <a href="https://x.com/djqianfusion">DJ Qian</a>, Elastos and BeL2 Co-Founder <a href="https://x.com/SunnyFengHan">Sunny Feng Han</a>, and the <a href="https://app.bunnypunk.io/">BunnyPunk</a> team, Chainge’s cross-chain DEX has been integrated with Elastos. This integration merges liquidity pools on Ethereum (Uniswap) and ESC (Glide Finance) and adds 18,513 ELA and 41,655 USDC liquidity on Chainge’s Fusion blockchain, allowing users to swap assets into ELA from over 14 chains. These chains include Fusion, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, Avalanche C, Polygon, Aurora, Syscoin Rollux, X Layer Mainnet, CoreDAO, Syscoin NEVM, Arbitrum, Optimistic, Linea, zkSync and B2 (recent BeL2 partner). 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this screenshot, we show how USDC on Arbitrum was successfully used to purchase ELA on ESC in a single transaction using a decentralised wallet. This simplifies access to the Elastos ecosystem and its various Dapps, effectively opening up Elastos to the entire Web3 community with a new international airport.</p>
<p></p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Cyber Republic Proposal #294: Banking, Liquidity and Slippage 
 
 
 
 
<p>Next, working with Chainge, the goal is to soon connect to a fiat on/off ramp service, allowing users to buy ELA directly with credit cards or bank accounts and exchange ELA for US dollars into their bank accounts, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, there is still a necessary challenge to tackle surrounding liquidity and slippage. Liquidity is the ease of converting an asset to cash without affecting its price, while slippage is the difference between the expected and actual trade price. High liquidity and low slippage ensure quick, predictable trades, enhancing user experience and driving adoption. Deepening liquidity and reducing slippage are crucial for an efficient financial ecosystem. Below we can see how on the left, a 1,000 ELA order on Chainge has low fees, however, on the right, a 10,000 ELA order has drastic fees of above 15% due to lacking liquidity and high slippage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/sash__mit">Sasha Mitchell</a> proposes using the remaining 197,152 stablecoin assets from the G20 proposal to match with CRC ELA and add to Chainge’s liquidity pool, which currently holds 18,513 ELA and 41,655 USDC. This will drastically boost cross-chain and banking purchase liquidity, reducing slippage and transaction costs and setting Elastos up for the upcoming fiat on/off ramp service. This increased ELA liquidity will allow stakeholders to move assets between chains and banks more efficiently without high costs. Deep liquidity and low slippage help enable quick, stable, and predictable trades.</p>

<p>The government has quietly ushered in the beginnings of what it hopes will be the answer to people’s experiences of fraud and lack of trust online. Its new digital trust framework has gone live in recent days.</p>



<p>Digital Identity New Zealand Executive Director Colin Wallis spoke to Radio New Zealand this morning, “The intent is that you’ll have a safer digital playing field as a baseline to build other services on top of. It’s just going to take some time for the ripple through where we are now for it to become seismic.”</p>

 A step-by-step guide to our project kickoff with Jobs for the Future and International Rescue Committee  Context <p><a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> (WAO) is kicking off some work this week, collaborating with <a href="https://jff.org">Jobs for the Future</a> (JFF) to assess the Job Readiness Credential provided by the <a href="https://rescue.org">International Rescue Committee</a> (IRC). WAO is managing the project, developing a user research strategy, preparing necessary materials, and conducting interviews with employers, IRC staff, and, if possible, IRC&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Our broad key question relates to how the visual design and metadata contained in a digital badge impact employer perceptions and interactions. We want to help JFF and the IRC have the most impact possible with the Job Readiness Credential because that impact means changing the lives of real&nbsp;people.</p> How we approach this kind of&nbsp;work <p>At the start of any project, it’s important to know the absolute basics. In fact, it’s a good time to get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9pftOJW0uk">Busytown Mysteries theme tune</a> in your head as an earworm! The 5W’s and an H shown above help make sure we know all of the things necessary to set the project up for success. Ideally, we’d know most of this before even signing the contract, but anything missing we can pick up in the client kick-off&nbsp;meeting.</p><p>Before the client kick-off meeting, we have an internal project kick-off where we talk about everything from timelines and responsibilities, to setting up the digital environments in which we’ll do the work. If we need to purchase any new equipment or subscriptions, we’ll identify those in this meeting. Our guidelines for this can be found on the <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/guidelines/project-kickoff">WAO&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p> Communications and&nbsp;cadence Early days of JFF/IRC Trello board. It’s the usual kanban format with the additional of the self-explanatory ‘Feedback Needed’ along with ‘Undead’. The latter is for cards that would otherwise get stuck somewhere but we don’t want to delete/archive just in case they come back to bite&nbsp;us!<p>Getting into the right rhythm with clients is an art rather than a science. While it’s easy to put an hour in the calendar each week for a catch-up call, this is a sub-optimal for anything other than the very short term. This is because, in our experience, these kind of calls quick devolve into status update meetings.</p><p>Much better is to work as openly as possible. Sometimes that means entirely publicly with etherpads, public Trello boards, and the like. Other times, it’s working transparently with tools that provide either real-time or summary updates. Often this means that the number and frequency of meetings can be reduced. With our recent work with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">DCC</a>, for example, we met every other week, aiming for 45 minutes. Between meetings, we sent Loom videos and other sorts of outputs to make sure our collaborators knew how thinking had&nbsp;evolved.</p><p>While it’s important that there is a project lead from both sides, it’s also crucial that their inboxes do not become information silos. Larger organisations might use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM systems</a>, but for us information is best in context. So, for example, a Google Doc for ongoing meta-level important info, and everything else on the relevant Trello card (or equivalent).</p><p>Documentation is not putting a message in a Slack channel or mentioning something during a meeting. Documentation is writing something down in an uncontroversial way that makes sense to everybody involved in the project. This is important because humans can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven%2C_Plus_or_Minus_Two">only hold so much information in our heads</a> at one time, and our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory">memories can be&nbsp;faulty</a>.</p> Everything is a work in&nbsp;progress CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>‘Perpetual beta’ is another name for saying that everything is a work in progress. What’s true of software is true of documentation and everything involved in a project. Conclusions are provisional and based on the data and knowledge we had at the&nbsp;time.</p><p>To account for this, we usually version our work, starting at v0.1 rather than 1.0. The reason for this is to show the client (and ourselves) that we’re working towards our first fully-formed opinions and outputs. It’s all part of our attempt to <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">work openly</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">show our&nbsp;work</a>.</p><p>With this work that we are starting with JFF and IRC, we’ll be talking to stakeholders in a couple of different places. Our human brains want to take shortcuts and jump to conclusions quickly so that we can take action. However, we’ve learned to “<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-the-strategic-uses-of-ambiguity-c403bff44029">sit in ambiguity</a>” for long enough to allow thoughts and reflections to percolate. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">slower kind of thinking</a> allows us to spot things that might have been missed by our ‘System 1’ mode of&nbsp;thought.</p> Conclusion <p>We’re greatly looking forward to getting started with this work. We haven’t gone into how we perform user research, which is perhaps the topic for a future post. There’s a lot to cover from that point of view in terms of ethics, data, and different kinds of methodologies.</p><p>What we hope that we have shown in this post is our commitment to working openly, holistically, and thoroughly so that the outputs we generate are trusted, interesting, and actionable. We’ll share more on the project as it progresses.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/behind-the-scenes-of-our-new-project-on-job-readiness-credentials-30aa9580ca18">Behind the Scenes of Our New Project on Job Readiness Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Running a Ceramic node in a production environment involves several key components. This article aims to provide an overview of the necessary resources and cost estimates for deploying a Ceramic node in the cloud. While we only showcased two specific providers for the services required (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DigitalOcean</a> and <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">QuickNode</a>), we hope these cost examples given the hypothetical scenarios we walk through will help give you a general idea of cost.</p> Components Required for a Ceramic Node <p>There are several sub-services to consider when running a Ceramic node in production, each serving different functions. As such, you will need:</p> 1. Resources for JS-Ceramic   Functionality: Tracks and stores the latest tips for pinned streams, caches stream state, provides the HTTP API service for connected clients to read, and communicates with the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) for blockchain anchoring and timestamping.   2. Resources for Ceramic-One   Functionality: These nodes store the actual data and coordinate with network participants.   3. Resources for Postgres Database   Functionality: Required for indexing data.   4. Ethereum RPC Node API Access   Functionality: Required to validate CAS anchors.   5. Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) Access   Current Status: Anchors Ceramic protocol proofs to the blockchain. This service is currently funded by 3box Labs, however, eventually, this function will be provided by node operators and with some expected cost.   Baseline Recommended Resources <p>Given the services you’ll need above, the Ceramic team has tested and organized a set of “baseline” configuration settings we recommend when setting up your node. However, seeing as these are baseline, or average, you may need to increase resourcing accordingly based on your actual usage:</p> JS-Ceramic   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for state   Ceramic-One   4 vCPU  4 GB memory  100 GB disk for storage   Postgres Database   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for indexing   High Traffic Recommended Resources <p>Given the services you’ll need above, the Ceramic team has tested and organized a set of “High Traffic” configuration settings we recommend when setting up your node. However, seeing as these are baseline, or average, you may need to increase resourcing accordingly based on your actual usage:</p> JS-Ceramic   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for state  10,000 IOPs     Ceramic-One   6 vCPU  8 GB memory  500 GB disk for storage  15,000 IOPs     Postgres Database   2 vCPU  4 GB memory  10 GB disk for indexing   High Availability Configuration <p>For high availability, an additional node can be configured to sync data and handle dynamic read/write tasks, thus doubling the cost of a single-node setup.</p> Ethereum RPC Node Endpoint Costs <p>We’ve also chosen QuickNode to provide several RPC cost examples :</p>  QuickNode Base Plan: $10/month (100 million API credits, 2 endpoints, 550 credits/second)  QuickNode Middle Plan: $49/month (500 million API credits, 10 endpoints, 2,500 credits/second)  QuickNode Premium Plan: $299/month (3 billion API credits, 20 endpoints, 6,000 credits/second)   Hypothetical Scenarios and Cost Estimates <p>Let’s walk through three hypothetical need scenarios and use these to help estimate our cost structure:</p> Application A: Small User Base   User Base: 10,000 monthly active users  Query Behavior: 30% writes, 70% reads  Availability: Low-priority  Configuration: Baseline resources  Cost Estimate:  Node: $96/month  Ethereum RPC: $10/month  Total: $106/month     Application B: Write-Heavy Mid-Sized Application   User Base: 100,000-500,000 monthly active users  Query Behavior: 70% writes, 30% reads  Availability: High priority (2-node setup)  Configuration: High Traffic  Cost Estimate:  Nodes (2x): $918/month (2x $459)  Ethereum RPC: $49/month  Total: $967/month    <p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator?hl=en&amp;dl=CiRjN2M2MzI1My0xYTQ1LTQ1N2YtOTc2MS04NjlkNzg1YjQ4YjYQCBokRjhGNDYwNjgtRTFBMC00M0MxLTgzMDAtRTRBNDFGQUFGQkVC&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Example GCP budget</a></p> Other Considerations <p>Additional cloud costs must be considered for networking - these costs will vary based on traffic patterns. Most cloud providers offer free traffic ingress to the nodes but will charge for egress, or data leaving the nodes.</p><p>Running a Ceramic node in production involves various components and resources, each contributing to the overall cost. By understanding the necessary configurations and associated costs, developers can make informed decisions tailored to their application's needs and user base. High availability setups and resource over-provisioning can significantly impact costs, especially for mid-sized applications with high traffic and write volumes.</p>

 <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">Open Identity Exchange (OIX)</a> and <a href="https://diacc.ca">DIACC</a> commit to finding alignment for global policies on digital trust and verification. 



<p>UK, June 2024 – The global non-profit <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">Open Identity Exchange (OIX)</a> and the Canadian non-profit <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</a> have committed to working together to advance global digital interoperability – a crucial element for trusted, successful international trade in a rapidly advancing digital global economy.</p>



<p>OIX is an influential global community for all those involved in the ID sector to connect and collaborate, developing the thought leadership and guidance needed to enable interoperable, trusted identities carried seamlessly from place to place in ‘roaming wallets’ for everyone. DIACC is an equally influential community of public and private sector leaders committed securing inclusive digital economy benefits by promoting user-centric design principles and verifying private sector services against the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) to support a secure ecosystem of services to enable user-directed information verification between public and private sector data authorities.</p>



<p>The two organisations will explore how different country-based policies related to identity management, verification, security, data privacy innovation and approaches to digital identity assurance can be compared and analysed so that more rapid progress can be made towards global digital ID interoperability through alignment of policy or acceptance of policy differences.</p>



<p>The collaboration will focus on advancing methods for participants in one framework to accept identity verification and digital credentials verified through another trust framework based on a mixture of policy acceptance and technology adaption. DIACC and OIX will explore equivalency and interoperability processes, identify potential alignments, new standards required, and gaps that may need to be addressed, and highlight use cases that can be facilitated through interoperability across digital ecosystems. Within this work, they will explore methods to describe common features of jurisdictional and sectoral trust frameworks, and share insights widely available as a resource.</p>



<p>The exchange and transfer of knowledge and expertise will be at the heart of this collaboration. OIX and DIACC will work together to create ‘intellectual capital’ to shape debate and bring about actions, moving identity management, data privacy, and security forward at pace.</p>



<p>Nick Mothershaw, Chief Identity Strategist at OIX, said: “The benefits of the digital global economy will be vast, but there is still some way to go before everyone can confidently access them. Our collaboration with DIACC will play a critical role. The fantastic progress DIACC has already made across Canada is an exemplar for global interoperability and will provide much needed insight, tools and guidance to pave a much clearer way forward globally.</p>



<p>“Our plans are to share our work with other trust frameworks across the globe, by publishing the criteria and values, and in the short-term creating an interim tool for trust frameworks to use for policy areas. We also want to secure their input on what they want to see in Trust Framework Comparison tool, as well as to start demonstrating how a roaming wallet will work.”</p>



<p>Joni Brennan, DIACC President, said: “We’re thrilled to collaborate with the Open Identity Exchange. The formalization of our liaison demonstrates progress in supporting our shared values to advance secure, user-centric digital identity solutions globally. Our collaboration will leverage each organization’s expertise to explore opportunities to foster innovation, enhance interoperability, and build public trust in digital services by identifying the alignments and gaps between jurisdictional and sectoral trust frameworks.”</p>

<p>Driving data interconnectivity, interoperability, and integrity, the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), now in its 6th iteration, delivers significant advancements that have benefited world-class organizations and shaped standards for industrial information exchange. Through partnerships with entities such as the British Standards Institution¹²³, GS1⁴⁵, European Blockchain Sandbox⁶, and various government-funded initiatives, the DKG has also played a crucial role in informing public policies.</p><p>DKG uniquely and effectively addresses the challenges of data ownership, AI hallucinations, and bias⁷ with the Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG)⁸ framework. dRAG drives a vast advancement of the RAG model initially developed by Meta⁹, by organizing external sources in a DKG while introducing incentives to grow a global, crowdsourced network of knowledge made available for AI models to&nbsp;use.</p><p>The DKG V8 has through a prototype demonstrated an unprecedented scale at which the Verifiable Internet for AI can drive value for anyone, on any device, and any chain. Addressing sensitive data concerns, scalability, and AI challenges concurrently has brought encouraging results that importantly shape the expected V8 release timeline.</p> DKG V8 — for Anyone, on Any Device, on Any Chain at Internet&nbsp;Scale <p>OriginTrail DKG has been battle-tested in real-world applications increasingly used by an ecosystem of organizations and government-supported initiatives. To date, no decentralized system has scaled in the production environment the way V6 DKG has. However, the current capacity of DKG reached its limits to support the growing usage requirements, prompting a transition to the V8, evolved to tackle the scale at which AI is consumed in any environment.</p><p>Data has been growing exponentially for decades, with AI driving further growth acceleration — according to the latest estimates, 402.74 million terabytes of data are created each day¹⁰. This trend is increasingly visible in the rising demands for additional capacity in the DKG, driven by data-intensive industry deployments in aerospace, manufacturing, railways, consumer goods, and construction driving DKG&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Version 8 of the DKG has therefore been designed with major scalability improvements at multiple levels, with a prototyped implementation tested in collaboration with partners from the sectors mentioned above.</p> 3 key products of OriginTrail DKG&nbsp;V8 <p>The major advancement that DKG V8 is making is in expanding the OriginTrail ecosystem’s product suite to 3 key products:</p>  DKG Core Node V8 — highly scalable network nodes forming network core, persisting the public replicated DKG  DKG Edge Node V8 — user-friendly node applications tailored to edge devices (phones, laptops,&nbsp;etc).  ChatDKG V8 — the launchpad for creating AI solutions using decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG).   DKG Edge Node — enabling the largest, internet-scale decentralized physical infrastructure network&nbsp;(DePIN) <p>The newcomer in the product suite is the DKG Edge Node — a new type of DKG node enabling the OriginTrail ecosystem to tackle the global challenges described above. As the name suggests, DKG edge nodes can operate on Internet edge devices. Devices such as personal computers, mobile phones, wearables, IoT devices, but also enterprise and government systems are where we can find huge volumes of very important data activity that DKG edge nodes will enable to enter the AI age in a safe and privacy-preserving way. The DKG edge node will enable such sensitive data to remain protected on the device, giving owners full control over how their data is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Together with being protected on the device, edge-node data becomes a part of the global DKG with precise access management permissions controlled by the data owner. In this way, AI applications that the owner allows data access to will be able to use it together with the public data in the DKG via decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation (dRAG).</p><p>Since such AI applications can equally be run locally on devices directly, this enables fully privacy-preserving AI solutions aimed at the ever-growing number of devices on the network edge that can at the same time use both public and private DKG data. The introduction of the DKG edge node enables the DKG to quickly expand to be the largest, internet-scale decentralized physical infrastructure network&nbsp;(DePIN).</p> New features of the DKG Edge&nbsp;Node <p>To unlock these powerful capabilities, DKG edge node will include new features that have previously not been available on DKG nodes but were elements of other proprietary or open-source products.</p>  To enable a seamless creation of knowledge, DKG nodes will inherit the proven knowledge publishing pipelines from the Network Operating System&nbsp;(nOS).  The data protection techniques for private and sensitive data will be based on the NGI-funded OpenPKG project outcomes.  The DKG Node will support all major standards such as GS1 Digital Link, EPCIS, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identities.  To support the growing field of knowledge graph implementations globally, it will enable seamless knowledge graph integrations of major knowledge graph providers such as Ontotext, Oracle, Snowflake, Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, and&nbsp;others.  <p>DKG Edge Node V8 Prototype — Oura Ring integration with demonstrated 400 Knowledge Assets published in 10&nbsp;seconds</p> DKG V8&nbsp;Timeline <p>The V8 DKG launch sequence consists of 4 stages, aligned with the wider OriginTrail ecosystem roadmap, with a forkless upgrade to&nbsp;V8.</p><p>Stage 1: V8 multi-chain infrastructure deployment</p>  Paranet deployment and first IPOs&nbsp;launched  Base blockchain integration  Cross-chain knowledge mining&nbsp;support  <p>Stage 2: DKG core internet-scale V8 testnet&nbsp;launch</p>  Asynchronous backing  Knowledge assets V2: Batch minting (in prototype)  DKG Core: Random sampling (in prototype)  <p>Stage 3: DKG edge nodes on V8&nbsp;testnet</p>  Edge node beta&nbsp;launch  Knowledge assets V2: Batch minting &amp; native vector&nbsp;support  DKG Core: Random sampling deployment  <p>Stage 4: V8 mainnet upgrade deployment (October&nbsp;2024)</p> To stay on trac(k) with updates on DKG V8 as it nears the deployment phase, make sure to join our <a href="https://t.me/origintrail">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/QctFuPCMew">Discord</a> channels! <p>¹<a href="https://v1.bsigroup.com/en-GB/insights-and-media/media-centre/press-releases/2023/july/new-solution-developed-for-cross-border-food-transfers/">https://v1.bsigroup.com/en-GB/insights-and-media/media-centre/press-releases/2023/july/new-solution-developed-for-cross-border-food-transfers/</a></p><p>²<a href="https://page.bsigroup.com/BSI-Academy-Blockchain-Solution">https://page.bsigroup.com/BSI-Academy-Blockchain-Solution</a></p><p>³<a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/globalassets/localfiles/en-th/innovation/blockchain-white-paper-th.pdf">https://www.bsigroup.com/globalassets/localfiles/en-th/innovation/blockchain-white-paper-th.pdf</a></p><p>⁴<a href="https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/bridgingblockchains.pdf">https://www.gs1.org/sites/default/files/bridgingblockchains.pdf</a></p><p>⁵<a href="https://www.gs1si.org/novice/novica/origintrail-resuje-izziv-ponarejenega-viskija">https://www.gs1si.org/novice/novica/origintrail-resuje-izziv-ponarejenega-viskija</a></p><p>⁶<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSISANDCOLLAB/European+Blockchain+Sandbox+announces+the+selected+projects+for+the+second+cohort">https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EBSISANDCOLLAB/European+Blockchain+Sandbox+announces+the+selected+projects+for+the+second+cohort</a></p><p>⁷<a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf</a></p><p>⁸<a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/decentralized-rag-with-origintrail-dkg-and-nvidia-build-ecosystem">https://origintrail.io/blog/decentralized-rag-with-origintrail-dkg-and-nvidia-build-ecosystem</a></p><p>⁹<a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/">https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/dkg-v8-scaling-verifiable-internet-for-ai-to-any-device-for-anyone-on-any-chain-37b9049d2e6e">DKG V8: Scaling Verifiable Internet for AI to Any Device, for Anyone, on Any Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Public review - ends July 27th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Topology and Orchestration. Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) TC are pleased to announce that TOSCA Version 2.0 is now available for public review and comment. This 30-day review is the third public review for this specification.</p>



<p>About the specification draft:</p>



<p>The Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) provides a language for describing application components and their relationships by means of a service topology, and for specifying the lifecycle management procedures for creation or modification of services using orchestration processes. The combination of topology and orchestration enables not only the automation of deployment but also the automation of the complete service lifecycle management. The TOSCA specification promotes a model-driven approach, whereby information embedded in the model structure (the dependencies, connections, compositions) drives the automated processes.</p>

<p>The digital realm has long struggled with the vulnerabilities inherent in password-based authentication systems. With iOS 18 launching in September, Apple introduces a groundbreaking API for developers to implement passkeys, transforming how users secure their online accounts. This innovation is set to create a password-less future, significantly enhancing user data protection.</p>



 What Are Passkeys? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are a sophisticated, passwordless login option for apps and websites developed by the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance</a>. They consist of a “private key” stored on the user’s device and a “public key” residing with the service. This dual-key system undergoes an encrypted verification process, ensuring that access is granted only when the user’s biometrics or device PIN confirm their identity. This system effectively eliminates the need for passwords and multi-factor authentication codes, creating a seamless and secure user experience.</p>



 The Benefits of Passkeys 



<p>Traditional logins rely on passwords, which users often reuse across multiple sites, posing substantial security risks. Passkeys, however, are tied to the user’s unique device and biometric data, rendering them immune to phishing and brute-force attacks. If a passkey is stolen, it becomes useless without the rightful owner’s biometric verification. This intrinsic link between the user and the device significantly mitigates the threat landscape.</p>



 Banks and Passkey Adoption 



<p>While the advantages of passkeys are clear, some industries have been slow to adopt, including banks. Andrew Shikiar, CEO and Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance, explains, “Banks and financial institutions operate in a highly regulated industry, so they are vigilant when it comes to ensuring that user authentication complies with relevant regulations. Synced passkeys introduce a new customer assurance model that compliance leads within banks are still adjusting to.”</p>



<p>However, Shikiar noted that “we are now seeing regulatory and other government bodies begin to give formal guidance on how industry should contemplate passkeys,” including an April 2024 <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/giving-nist-digital-identity-guidelines-boost-supplement-incorporating">missive</a> from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offering guidance about implementation.</p>



<p>But Shikiar says that “banks are hypersensitive to customer experience,” too, and thus more cautious about changing how customers log in—even if passkeys are quicker and more secure. New login methods require educating customers—and that takes time.</p>



<p>Despite these bottlenecks, Shikiar says that banks are slowly moving away from strictly password-based logins because they “inherently understand that using a passkey as a primary factor is far superior to a password.”</p>



 The Collaborative Future of Passwordless Authentication 



<p>Apple’s implementation of passkeys underlines a collective effort by tech giants within the FIDO Alliance, including Microsoft and Google, to enhance internet security. The Alliance has pioneered developments in authentication standards, striving to eliminate the vulnerabilities of password-based systems. Users can visit the FIDO Alliance to learn more about the ongoing efforts and advancements in passkey technology and the latest in <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">passkey implementation</a>.</p>



<p>As passkeys gain traction, the internet moves closer to a future where security does not come at the expense of user convenience. The collaborative efforts of industry leaders within the FIDO Alliance signal a transformative shift towards more secure, passwordless authentication methods, promising a safer digital experience for all.</p>

<p>Picture this: you’re not just in the game, you’re leading it, crafting the very rules that define success. This is the golden opportunity that unfolds when you, as a tech innovator, dive headfirst into the realm of establishing open standards.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the magnetic pull of influence and the domineering stature in the tech world. Engaging actively in setting open standards is not just about putting your name out there. It’s about embedding your products, your technologies, and your visionary outlook into the very fabric of the industry’s future. You’re not just aiming to lead; you’re set to redefine leadership. Why settle for just competing when you can be the one crafting the arena? It’s about creating a scenario where your competition isn’t just trying to catch up; they’re scrambling to decode your rulebook.</p>



<p>You’re a tech innovator armed with resilience, foresight, and an unmatched zest for breakthroughs. It’s not about facing challenges; it’s about embracing them, dissecting them, and transforming them into stepping stones towards your ultimate victory. Envision a future where your influence reverberates across markets, shaping demands, dictating trends, and steering the technological evolution. Your efforts in spearheading open standards not only catapult your products and strategies to the forefront but also enshrine your status as an indomitable leader and a relentless innovator.</p>



<p>But here’s the deal – it demands more than just ingenuity and expertise. It calls for an unyielding spirit, an insatiable appetite for excellence, and an unwavering commitment to surpass the benchmarks you’ve set yourself. It’s a call to arms for those ready to lead, innovate, and inspire. Let’s not just participate in the evolution of technology. Let’s lead it. Together, we can redefine the boundaries, push the limits, and craft a legacy that echoes through the annals of tech history. The path to unparalleled success and influence is before you. The question is, are you ready to seize it?</p>



<p>Remember, in the grand chessboard of technological advancement, it’s not about the pieces you start with, but how you decide to play them. Write the rules, win the game. Let’s make history. <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join-2/">Join us</a> at OASIS Open!</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that the BeL2 Loan Demo App has been updated to version 0.3, available at <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">https://lending.bel2.org/</a>. This update brings significant enhancements and new features to improve the user experience and functionality of the app. Here’s a detailed look at what’s new:</p>
 
 Added support for Taproot addresses 
 Added the ability to manually request ZKP proofs 
 Added support for USDC in addition to USDT 
 Additional repayment/proof information in order details 
 Implemented additional arbitration request use cases 
 Fixed expired order use cases 
 Other minor bug fixes 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Technical Update Insights 
 
 Added Support for Taproot Addresses 
<p>Integrating <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-taproot-upgrade-5210039">Taproot</a> addresses ensures compatibility with the latest Bitcoin advancements, enhancing privacy and scalability. Implemented in November 2021, Taproot makes all transaction outputs look the same, improving privacy whether for simple payments or complex smart contracts. It also boosts efficiency and reduces fees. Supporting Taproot allows our app users to benefit from these enhancements, enabling more discreet and cost-effective transactions. This aligns with our commitment to providing a secure and efficient platform, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
 
 Added Ability to Manually Request ZKP Proofs 
<p>Allowing users to manually request <a href="https://chain.link/education/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp">Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</a> enhances control and flexibility, enabling them to generate proofs as needed. ZKPs are cryptographic methods that verify a statement’s truth without revealing any additional information. In BeL2, ZKPs ensure transaction privacy and security without exposing underlying data. Previously, ZKP generation was automatic, which might not have suited all users. Now, users can decide when to generate ZKPs, providing greater autonomy and control over their transactions and improving the overall user experience.</p>
 
 Added Support for USDC in Addition to USDT 
<p>Supporting USDC alongside USDT provides users with more stablecoin options, enhancing liquidity and flexibility within the app. USDC is known for its regulatory compliance and widespread acceptance, making it a valuable addition to our platform. As a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, USDC maintains a stable value, attracting users who seek to avoid cryptocurrency volatility. Integrating USDC, widely supported in decentralised applications (dApps) on the <a href="https://esc.elastos.io/">Elastos Smart Chain</a>, such as <a href="https://glidefinance.io/">Glide</a> and <a href="https://ela.city/">Elacity</a>, offers more financial activity options and leverages existing liquidity, making transactions more seamless and efficient.</p>
 
 Additional Repayment/Proofs Information in Order Details 
<p>Providing detailed repayment and proof information in order details enhances transparency and user trust. It allows users to clearly understand their transactions, repayments, and associated proofs, essential for effectively managing financial activities. This update adds comprehensive data on repayment schedules and proof generation directly within the order details. Users can now see all necessary information in one place, making it easier to track and manage loans. This transparency is crucial for building trust in decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, ensuring users have all the information they need to make informed decisions.</p>
 
 Implemented Additional Arbitration Request Use Cases 
<p>Enhancing the arbitration process is critical for ensuring fair and efficient dispute resolution within the platform. By implementing additional use cases for arbitration requests, we aim to provide a more robust mechanism for handling disputes, and maintaining user trust and satisfaction. Arbitration in <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-new-bretton-woods-system/">BeL2</a> resolves disputes between parties in a decentralised manner, using ELA collateralised nodes, ensuring fairness without relying on centralised authorities. The new use cases expand the scenarios for arbitration, making the process more comprehensive and adaptable, reinforcing the platform’s reliability and fairness.</p>
 
 Fixed Order Expired Use Cases 
<p>Addressing issues related to order expiration is vital for ensuring smooth and reliable transaction processes. Fixing these use cases improves the overall user experience by preventing disruptions caused by expired orders. Order expiration issues occur when a transaction is not completed within a specified timeframe, leading to complications or the need for manual intervention. By fixing these issues, we enhance the predictability and reliability of the platform. This ensures that orders are processed as expected, reducing the likelihood of unexpected expirations and associated complications. These improvements help maintain a seamless transaction flow, enhancing user satisfaction.</p>
 
 Other More Minor Bug Fixes 
<p>Continuous improvement through minor bug fixes is essential for maintaining the stability and performance of the platform. These fixes address small issues that, collectively, can significantly impact the user experience. Minor bug fixes involve resolving smaller issues that may not be immediately noticeable but contribute to the overall functionality and stability of the app. By regularly addressing and fixing minor bugs, we ensure that the app runs smoothly and efficiently, providing users with a reliable and enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>These updates mark a significant step forward in our mission to provide a secure, flexible, and user-friendly platform for decentralised finance built on Bitcoin. By continuously enhancing the BeL2 <a href="https://lending.bel2.org/">Loan Demo App</a>, we aim to offer the best possible experience for our users, ensuring that they can leverage the full potential of their Bitcoin holdings in a secure and decentralised manner. Stay tuned for more updates and innovations as we continue to develop and expand the capabilities of the BeL2 ecosystem. Excited to learn more? Head over to the BeL2 <a href="http://www.bel2.org/">website</a>&nbsp;and follow&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">Infinity</a>&nbsp;for the latest updates!</p>

 Solidarity, common ground, and intersectionality in the climate&nbsp;movement <p>This post looks at ways we can channel our activist energy in ways that address multiple issues and find belonging in adjacent communities.</p><p>Recently at a week long event that brought together energy transition activists from around the Mediterranean, I was pleased to meet a variety of people with intersectional understandings of the climate crisis. Together, we explored what intersectionality looks like in the climate movement and how we can tell stories that lead to&nbsp;action.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Expanding our activist&nbsp;energies <p>Although many of us care about a variety of struggles, we don’t have the time or the energy to get involved in every single thing. We focus our energies, we have to. The problem, of course, is that each issue and cause needs the visibility a group of activists coming together can provide. So how can we focus ourselves and find energy to do&nbsp;more?</p><p>For just a couple hours last week, I worked with a small group of rabble rousers to create campaign ideas for the challenge:</p><blockquote>The intersection and complexities of our structural problems makes people feel powerless.</blockquote><p>The structural problems we are facing are complex and co-exist within a matrix of other challenges. We are dealing with environmental crisis, racist societies, and social inequalities left, right, and centre. No matter how positive your personality may be, it’s hard to stay optimistic. No matter how cognisant you are about other struggles, it’s hard to pay attention to everything.</p><p>When we are overwhelmed and feeling powerless, we tend to recede. Our group had the insight that feeling overwhelmed or powerless is lonely. Loneliness is a cascading psychological phenomena that halts action and feeds&nbsp;despair.</p><p>We started to think about how we might address loneliness in activist movements by telling stories that help people who feel like they belong to one group (e.g. environmentalists) to understand their connection to other&nbsp;groups.</p><p>Our theory of change is that finding belonging amongst your activist friends can provide you with solidarity and a source of energy. We wanted to push for intersectionality in the climate movement.</p>Intersections in audiences, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">the Audience Ikigai</a>, cc-by&nbsp;WAO Choose three: intersectionality in&nbsp;practice <p>Everybody cares about something, whether that be sports, the environment, or even status. If you can identify one thing you care about, you can surely identify three others. Using arbitrary design constraints, like “choosing three” is a good way to move any idea forward, including ideas around your own activism or civic participation.</p><p>We know that climate change disproportionately affects already marginalised communities, which can exacerbate existing social inequalities. With this in mind, we choose to look at the intersectionality of climate with three human rights&nbsp;issues:</p>  Refugee and migrant&nbsp;justice  Women’s rights  LGBTQIA+ rights  <p>Easy, right? Choosing three issues to put your energy into is a lot less than “everything”. Three is also enough to give variability and provide access to different communities. Different communities come with different energies and that is something you can tap into when&nbsp;needed.</p>We often consider the thematic intersections of our own work. See how we work in the overlaps together with thoughtful, ethical organisations in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16">Practical utopias and rewilding work</a>. Find connections and leverage&nbsp;points <p>Intersectionality is about understanding the points of interconnection between two issues. Seeing the overlaps means that you can connect issues together in new and novel ways. Novelty is just one storytelling tactic in calling attention to a particular issue. Once you’ve determined places to focus, you can further narrow your focus by looking for leverage points that lead to connection.</p>  Refugee and migrant justice — From climate-induced displacement to the fact that people who are forced to migrate whatever the reasons can face challenges in accessing their basic rights, refugee and migrant justice <a href="https://www.climate-refugees.org/why">ties heavily</a> to other environmental and human rights&nbsp;issues.  Women’s rights — Women’s societal roles as caregivers and food producers make them more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It’s now widely understood that <a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-02-24/educating-girls-is-more-effective-in-the-climate-emergency-than-many-green-technologies">educating girls is a catalyst</a> towards climate&nbsp;action.  LGBTQIA+ rights — Again, marginalised communities are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis. <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/60078/impact-climate-crisis-lgbtqia2s-pride-month/">LGBTQIA+ are often </a>members of other marginalised communities, such as racial minorities, and they are more likely to live in&nbsp;poverty.  <p>Human rights and environmental justice are big and complex areas of focus. Thinking about how the complexities of these issues overlap can help narrow down the impact you want to&nbsp;have.</p>cc-by Iris Maertens with <a href="https://www.dancing-fox.com/">Dancing&nbsp;Fox</a> Have some&nbsp;fun <p>Yes, structural problems are serious and complicated. It is essential to be aware of both your own privileges (whatever they may be) and to think deeply about the issues and communities you are working with and within. It’s also important to know that joy is a common emotional human experience. Inciting joy is a way to truly help people. It can help build psychological characteristics that help people deal with whatever life has to throw at them. Joy can also open people up to a better tomorrow.</p><p>At the event I attended last week, as we thought about the intersectionality of environmentalism with human rights, we thought about how we might be able to inspire people to be joyfully curious to learning more about an issue they might not have much involvement with.</p><p>We developed a few posters, designed to be displayed on a metro, to inspire this curiosity.</p>Our poster ideas, drawn by the incredible <a href="https://www.dancing-fox.com/">Iris&nbsp;Maertens</a> Solidarity with&nbsp;others <p>The complexity of our global problems can be overwhelming, but we cannot solve one complex issue without tackling the intertwining structural issues. Finding ways to relate what you care about to what others care about is a way to build solidarity and, therefore, momentum. It’s not always easy, but the more you can participate in cross-cutting social and environmental communities, the bigger our collective power&nbsp;becomes.</p><p>I worked with inspiring people from these organisations:</p>  “<a href="https://www.casafuturs.org">La Casa dels Futurs</a> is both an ongoing project dedicated to supporting intersectional organizing between social and ecological movements, and a campaign to create a permanent Climate Justice Center and Movement&nbsp;School…”  “<a href="https://www.rinascimentogreen.it/">Rinascimento Green</a>…aims to bring together various pieces of civil society to promote, through a path of popular participation, a bottom-up Green&nbsp;Deal.”  “<a href="https://wesmellgas.org/">WeSmellGas</a> is a collective of organisers, researchers and film-makers based in Northern Europe. Climate justice can only be realised by dismantling capitalism and the imperial processes that reinforce it, including our current extractivist energy&nbsp;system.”  <p>🔥 Do you need help with storytelling and advocacy?

<p>Last year we partnered with&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Learn Web 3</a>&nbsp;(a free educational platform for Web3 developers) to publish a tutorial on&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Saving OpenAI Chats to ComposeDB on Ceramic</a>&nbsp;to showcase an easy-to-understand design architecture and how ComposeDB could be leveraged for storage. In that example we showed how to configure and deploy a local ComposeDB/Ceramic node, walking through data model design, server configurations, model deployment, and runtime definition generation, all of which are necessary steps a developer must undergo before running the application locally.</p><p>But what if developers could bypass local node configuration altogether and start testing their database design and application logic immediately? What if they could do so with the assurances of no lock-ins, and the open option to move to a self-hosted configuration in the future? And finally, what if they could benefit from all of these things while enjoying a seamless developer experience that makes storage setup easy?</p><p>That's where <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a> comes in.</p> What is OrbisDB? <p><a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a>&nbsp;is an advanced decentralized database built on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a>&nbsp;and offers an ORM-like interface that developers can leverage when integrating the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB SDK</a>. Developers who have worked with Prisma or Drizzle with a Postgres instance will find this experience familiar and exceedingly easy to work with.</p><p>As for developer experience, what sets OrbisDB apart are the following:</p>  A user interface (UI) developers can run either locally or using a&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hosted Studio instance</a>, bypassing the need to define and deploy data models by hand (which is still an option if using the SDK). The UI also includes data visualization (you can view data relevant to your applications in table format), as well as other views for configuring add-ons like plugins (described below).  OrbisDB offers the option to leverage a variety of a growing list of plugins to enrich the data capabilities developers can incorporate into their application logic. Some example plugins offer gating ability, automatic resolution of ENS domains, sybil resistance, and more. Anyone can also build plugins and incorporate them immediately in the event they're running a standalone instance.  The&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OrbisWeb3/db-sdk?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB SDK</a>&nbsp;wraps user authentication, client creation, schema creation (if developers prefer not to use the UI), and querying all under one roof, therefore simplifying the list of dependencies developers need to worry about.  Finally, OrbisDB offers the option to run an instance locally (similar to the ComposeDB tutorial mentioned above), or on a shared (hosted) instance. This is a significant feature for overall development and testing velocity as it lets developers start writing and reading data right away without having to worry about node configuration. Once developers are ready to take their application to production after testing on the shared instance, setting up a self-hosted (standalone) instance is straightforward.  <p>For this tutorial, we will be leveraging the&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hosted Studio instance</a>&nbsp;to both define our data models and utilize a shared OrbisDB instance.</p> Let's Get Started! <p>Before we get started, you will need the following dependencies:</p>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Chrome Extension</a>&nbsp;(or similar browser wallet for authentication)  Node v20  An&nbsp;<a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OpenAI API key</a>  A project ID you will need from&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a>&nbsp;  A free&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB Studio</a>&nbsp;account - first, log in with your browser wallet. We will use this later to define our data models and obtain a context and environment ID   Initial Setup <p>First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot &amp;&amp; cd orbisdb-chatbot
npm install</code> <p>Next, create a copy of the example env file in your root directory:</p> <code>cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Visit <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OpenAI Signup</a> page to create an account if you don't yet have one and generate an API key. OpenAI offers a free OpenAI API trial, with $5 worth of credit (which can take you a LONG way). Go ahead and assign your new API key to <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> in your new .env file.</p><p>Navigate to <a href="https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in?ref=blog.ceramic.network">WalletConnect</a>&nbsp;and create a free account and a new project (with a name of your choosing and the&nbsp;<code>App</code>&nbsp;type selected). Copy the resulting project ID and assign it as the value for <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID</code> .</p> OrbisDB Setup <p>If you're logged into your <a href="https://studio.useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB Studio</a> account, we can start connecting our application to a shared OrbisDB instance.</p><p>First, you will need to define a new context. Contexts are a Ceramic-native feature exposed in all data management methods, and make it easy for developers to organize data across different applications or projects (there is also the option to leverage sub-contexts, but we'll save this for a future tutorial). </p><p>Go ahead and click "+ Add context" within your root studio view - feel free to give your new context a name and description of your choosing:</p><p>If you click into your new context you can view its corresponding ID:</p><p>Go ahead and copy this value and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTEXT_ID</code> in your .env file.</p><p>On the right-hand side, you should also see details about your setup:</p><p>Copy the value found under "Environment ID" and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV_ID</code> in your .env file. This ID is required to identify you when using the shared OrbisDB instance. </p><p>You will also see the endpoints for the shared Ceramic and OrbisDB instances in the same section. No need to copy these values as they are already hard-coded into the repository.</p><p>Defining Data Models</p><p>We will also use the Studio UI to define the data models our application needs. This demo application utilizes two simple data models found within the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/models/tables.sql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tables file</a> in our repository:</p>  <code>posts</code> - this will contain each message within our conversation exchange. The "body" field will house the message itself, while the "tag" field will keep track of who the message came from (user vs. bot). This model will use the "List" account relation, which means an authenticated account can have an unbounded amount of instance documents that fall under this definition.  <code>profiles</code> - this model will allow us to assign additional data to ourselves and our chatbot, including a name, username, and fun emoji. The "actor" subfield will be used to differentiate between the user (using the value "human"), and your chatbot (using the value "robot"). In contrast to posts, this model will use the "Set" account relation based on the "actor" subfield, which means an account can have exactly 1 instance document given a value assigned to "actor". For example, this ensures that our application won't allow us to accidentally create &gt;1 document with an "actor" subfield matching "human".  <p>To start creating the models, navigate to "Model builder" from the Studio navigation. You can start by defining your "posts" table. After clicking "Create Model" you will be able to view the model ID:</p><p>Copy this value and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_POST_ID</code> in your .env file.</p><p>Go through the same steps for your "profiles" table. However, be sure to select the "Set" option under "Account relation". Copy the resulting model ID and assign it to <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROFILE_ID</code> in your .env file.</p> Application Architecture <p>As mentioned above, the OrbisDB SDK makes it easy to instantiate clients, authenticate users, and run queries using the same library. As you'll note in the application repository, there are various components that need to be able to access the state of the authenticated user. While we're <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/pages/_app.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">wrapping all components </a>of our application within a <code>WagmiConfig</code> contextual wrapper (which will allow us to leverage Wagmi's hooks to see if a user's wallet is connected - learn more about this in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/walletconnect-tutorial/">WalletConnect Tutorial</a>), we also need a way to know if the user has an active OrbisDB session.</p><p>While there are multiple ways to facilitate this, our application uses <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Zustand</a> for state management to circumvent the need for contextual wrappers or prop drilling.</p><p>If you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/zustand/store.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">store file</a> you can see how we've set up four state variables (two of which are methods) and incorporated the OrbisDB SDK to authenticate users and alter the state of  <code>orbisSession</code>: </p> <code>type Store = {
  orbis: OrbisDB;
  orbisSession?: OrbisConnectResult | undefined;
  // setOrbisSession returns a promise
  setAuth: (
    wallet: GetWalletClientResult | undefined
  ) =&gt; Promise&lt;OrbisConnectResult | undefined&gt;;
  setOrbisSession: (session: OrbisConnectResult | undefined) =&gt; void;
};

const StartOrbisAuth = async (
  walletClient: GetWalletClientResult,
  orbis: OrbisDB
): Promise&lt;OrbisConnectResult | undefined&gt; =&gt; {
  if (walletClient) {
    const auth = new OrbisEVMAuth(window.ethereum!);
    
    // This option authenticates and persists the session in local storage
    const authResult: OrbisConnectResult = await orbis.connectUser({
      auth,
    });
    if (authResult.session) {
      console.log("Orbis Auth'd:", authResult.session);
      return authResult;
    }
  }

  return undefined;
};

const useStore = create&lt;Store&gt;((set) =&gt; ({
  orbis: new OrbisDB({
    ceramic: {
      gateway: "https://ceramic-orbisdb-mainnet-direct.hirenodes.io/",
    },
    nodes: [
      {
        gateway: "https://studio.useorbis.com",
        env: ENV_ID,
      },
    ],
  }),
  orbisSession: undefined,
  setAuth: async (wallet) =&gt; {
    if (wallet) {
      try {
        const auth = await StartOrbisAuth(wallet, useStore.getState().orbis);
        set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
          ...state,
          orbisSession: auth,
        }));
        return auth;
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    } else {
      set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
        ...state,
        session: undefined,
      }));
    }
  },
  setOrbisSession: (session) =&gt;
    set((state: Store) =&gt; ({
      ...state,
      orbisSession: session,
    })),
}));</code> <p>As you can see, we've hard-coded the Ceramic and OrbisDB gateways, whereas we've imported our environment ID that we previously assigned as an environment variable.</p><p>Our <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/navbar.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">navbar component</a> sits at the same or greater level as all of our child components and includes our Web3Modal widget. You can see how we're using a <code>useEffect</code> hook to check if our session is active and either set our "loggedIn" state variable as true or false. This result determines if we generate a new session for the user by leveraging our <code>setAuth</code> method from our Zustand store, or if we simply set our <code>orbisSession</code> as the value of our valid active session.</p><p>Back in the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">home page component</a> you can see how we're conditionally rendering our <code>MessageList</code> child component based on whether we have both an active orbis session AND the user's wallet is connected (allowing us to access their address).</p><p>Reading Data</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/message-list.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">message list</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/userform.component.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">userform component</a> files are responsible for performing the majority of writes and reads to OrbisDB. If you navigate to the message list component for example, take a look at how we've imported our client-side environment variables to identify our post and profile models, as well as our context ID. When this component is rendered, the <code>useEffect</code> hook first invokes the "getProfile" method:</p> <code>  const getProfile = async (): Promise&lt;void&gt; =&gt; {
    try {
      const profile = orbis
        .select("controller", "name", "username", "emoji", "actor")
        .from(PROFILE_ID)
        .where({ actor: ["human"] })
        .context(CONTEXT_ID);
      const profileResult = await profile.run();
      if (profileResult.rows.length) {
        console.log(profileResult.rows[0]);
        setProfile(profileResult.rows[0] as Profile);
      } else {
        // take the user to the profile page if no profile is found
        window.location.href = "/profile";
      }
      await getRobotProfile(profileResult.rows[0] as Profile);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return undefined;
    }
  };</code> <p>Notice how we've constructed a <code>.select</code> query off of our OrbisDB instance (provided by our Zustand store), asking for the corresponding values for the 5 columns we want data for. </p><p>Next, we need to notate which data model we want our query to reference, which is where we use <code>.from</code> with our profile model ID as the value.</p><p>We also only want the records where the profile is for the human user, indicated on the following line.</p><p>Finally, we use the context ID that corresponds to this project as the final value that's appended to the query.</p><p>If a corresponding profile exists, we then invoke the <code>getRobotProfile</code> method to obtain our chatbot's information. If it does not exist, we take the users to the profiles page so they can create one.</p><p>Writing Data</p><p>Let's take a quick look at an example of data mutations. Within the same <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/orbisdb-chatbot/blob/main/src/components/message-list.tsx?ref=blog.ceramic.network">message list</a> component you will find a method called <code>createPost</code> which is invoked each time the user creates a new message:</p> <code> const createPost = async (
    thisPost: string
  ): Promise&lt;PostProps | undefined&gt; =&gt; {
    try {
      await orbis.getConnectedUser();
      const query = await orbis
        .insert(POST_ID)
        .value({
          body: thisPost,
          created: new Date().toISOString(),
          tag: "user",
          edited: new Date().toISOString(),
        })
        .context(CONTEXT_ID)
        .run();

      if (query.content &amp;&amp; profile) {
        const createdPost: PostProps = {
          id: query.id,
          body: query.content.body as string,
          profile,
          tag: query.content.tag as string,
          created: query.content.created as string,
          authorId: query.controller,
        };
        return createdPost;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return undefined;
    }
  };</code> <p>While this looks similar to the syntax we use to read data, there are a few differences. </p><p>First, take a look at the first line under the "try" statement - we're calling <code>getConnectedUser()</code> off of our OrbisDB prototype chain to ensure that our active session is applied. This is necessary to run mutation queries, whereas it's not a necessary step for reading data.</p><p>You can also see that we've swapped out the <code>.select</code> and <code>.from</code> statements for <code>.insert</code> which references the model ID we want to use, thus creating a new row in the corresponding table.</p><p>Finally, we're referencing the user's message value for the body while ensuring we tag the message as coming from the "user" before running the query and checking on its success status.</p> Running the Application in Developer Mode <p>We're now ready to boot up our application! </p><p>In your terminal, go ahead and start the application in developer mode:</p> <code>nvm use 20
npm run dev</code> <p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000/</a> in your browser. You should see the following:</p><p>Go ahead and click on "Connect Wallet." You should see a secondary authentication message appear after you connect your wallet:</p><p>Signing this message creates an authenticated session (using <code>orbis.connectUser()</code> from our Zustand store). You can check the value of this session by navigating to the "Application" tab in your browser and looking for the <code>orbis:session</code> key pair:</p><p>Given that you have not yet created any messages, the application should automatically direct you to the /profiles page where you can assign identifiers to yourself and your chatbot:</p><p>Finally, navigate back to the homepage to begin exchanging messages with your chatbot. Notice how the values from your corresponding profiles appear next to the messages:</p> How Could this Application be Improved? <p>Since our message history is being written and queried based on static values (for example, assigning messages to the "user" tag), you'll notice that the same conversation history appears when self-authenticating with a different wallet address and creating a new session.</p><p>As a challenge, try thinking about how to implement different ways to improve the application design to improve this experience:</p>  Tagging the profiles and messages with values that align with actual authenticated accounts instead of static ones  Altering our message data model and application to accommodate different chat contexts, allowing a user to have different conversation histories   Next Steps <p>We hope you've enjoyed this tutorial and learned something new about how to configure and incorporate OrbisDB into your application! While this concludes our walk-through, there are other possibilities Ceramic has to offer:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Join the Ceramic Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/ceramicnetwork?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow Ceramic on X</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/useorbis?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Follow Orbis on X</a></p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Start Building with Ceramic</a></p>

		<p>Webinar<br>
</p>
<p>For higher education institutions offering financial aid to students, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, means your institution is required to meet compliance standards for the security and protection of financial information, and to provide transparency related to how personal information is used and shared. Failure to meet these standards carries significant risk for institutions, including restrictions or loss of eligibility for Title IV funding. In this session, we’ll review how the latest revisions to GLBA compliance standards, aligned with the NIST 800-171 revision 3, will impact higher education. Our privacy and compliance experts will review how these revisions increase the compliance burden for institutions, and key steps that institutions can take to meet the new standard and maintain compliance to receive federal financial aid support.</p>

<p>IBM, Logius, Orbex Global Markets, Publications Office of the European Union, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and Others Advance Open Standard for Enhanced Interoperability and Efficiency in Supply Chain and Digital Trade</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 27 June 2024 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the approval of Universal Business Language (UBL) V2.4 as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. Developed by the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-ubl/">UBL Technical Committee (TC</a>), UBL V2.4 is the leading interchange format for business documents, revolutionizing global business transactions with its latest version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The standard works seamlessly with frameworks like ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML), extending the benefits of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems to businesses worldwide. UBL V2.4 maintains backward compatibility with earlier V2.# versions while introducing new business document types, now totaling 93. The European Union has recognized UBL’s significance by declaring it officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“UBL 2.4 represents a significant advancement, featuring enhanced support for B2C transactions, which will greatly benefit businesses and consumers alike,” said Kenneth Bengtsson, Chair of the UBL TC. “Additionally, it offers improved alignment with U.S. tax models, ensuring compliance and facilitating smoother transactions. These enhancements reaffirm our commitment to evolving and adapting UBL to meet the ever-changing needs of global commerce.”</p>



<p>As global sustainability efforts increase, UBL will expand its utility to encompass circular data exchange, reflecting the evolving needs of modern commerce. Looking ahead to the development of UBL V2.5, the TC will integrate circular economy data elements, marking a transformative step towards embedding sustainability into global supply chain data exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UBL TC is forming a new UBL Commodities Subcommittee (SC), which aims to streamline electronic transactions for raw materials, recycled goods, and agricultural products in global supply chains, with the goal of improving efficiency, transparency, sustainability, and reliability in commodity markets. The SC will standardize UBL document types and semantic library entries for global commodity trading and procurement processes.</p>



<p>The UBL TC encourages global collaboration and actively seeks input from stakeholders to ensure the success of UBL as a cornerstone for sustainability data exchange. The TC welcomes a diverse range of contributors, including ERP vendors; software and service providers; national, regional and local public authorities; procurement and trade communities; e-invoicing networks; supply chain communities; and logistics and transportation companies. Participation is open to all through <a href="mailto:join@oasis-open.org">membership in OASIS</a>, with interested parties encouraged to join and contribute to shaping the future of structured business document exchange. Contact <a href="mailto:join@oasis-open.org">join@oasis-open.org</a> for more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

 1. Background&nbsp; 
<p>In 2022, Internet Safety Labs (ISL) conducted an <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/reports/2022-k-12-edtech-safety-benchmark-findings-report-3/">extensive benchmark of EdTech apps</a> used in schools across the United States. We sampled 13 schools in each state and the District of Colombia and identified 1,722 unique apps which were in use In K12 schools. During the benchmark, the apps were evaluated scored on their behaviors related to safety. As part of the safety evaluation, SDKs in each app were identified and researchers collected network traffic for 1,357 apps. In total, there were 275 unique SDKs in the apps, and 8,168 unique subdomains, 3,211 unique domains from the network traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key research question in conducting the 2022 EdTech benchmark was to determine how accurate SDKs were as a proxy for actual third-party data sharing, since network traffic data collection is somewhat labor-intensive. This report shares the results of the analysis.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Analysis&nbsp; 
<p>The basis of the analysis was to compare the “expected” third parties as based on the company owners of the SDKs with the observed companies in the network traffic. This required identifying the owner companies for both the SDKs and all the subdomains observed in the aggregate network traffic.<a>1</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers first identified which SDKs were in use in apps by using AppFigures as a resource. In total, 275 SDKs unique SDKs were found in use across all apps.&nbsp; Next, researchers identified the companies who published these SDKs. For each app, the number of unique company owners of SDKs found in each app is referred to as the “expected” number of companies to receive data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, researchers performed a similar analysis on the subdomains observed in the network traffic (1,175 total apps). Each subdomain was resolved to an “owner” company.&nbsp; Subdomains were identified from HTTP POST/GET requests captured in the network traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then performed two quantitative analyses: (1) we examined the network traffic of apps with at least one SDK (n=1,083 apps), and (2) we examined the network traffic of apps with no SDKs (n=92 apps).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 2.1&nbsp; &nbsp;Apps With at Least One SDK&nbsp; 
<p>Apps with at least one SDK communicated with an average of 10.1 companies based on observed network traffic (Table 1).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 2.1.1&nbsp; &nbsp;“Expected” Companies in Network Traffic&nbsp; 
<p>In apps with at least one SDK, there were an average of 4.7 unique companies represented by the SDKs–thus, 4.7 “expected” companies to receive data. However, on average, only 1.7 (or 36.2%) of the “expected” companies were seen in the network traffic of apps with at least one SDK (Table 1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that there are several contributing factors that could account for this, including:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The manual testing performed by the researchers was unstructured and therefore had inconsistencies across researchers.&nbsp; 
 The manual testing didn’t perform all functions in the app. For instance, the tested did not make any optional purchases or upgrading to a premium version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

 <br>
2.1.2&nbsp; &nbsp;“Unexpected” Companies in Network Traffic&nbsp; 
<p>Additionally, as seen in Table 1, these apps communicated with an average of 8.4 unexpected companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As expected, apps that used Webview<a>2</a>, had advertisements or behavioral ads all had even higher average numbers of unexpected companies, with apps with behavioral ads having the highest at 33.7 unexpected companies on average<a>3</a>. The ISL app score rubric regards the use of Webview and the inclusion of advertising as very high risks for K-12 students and the data in Table 1 reinforces the rubric.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Apps with at least one SDK that use Webview had 2.6 times as many third parties as apps with at least one SDK that don’t use Webview.&nbsp; 
 Apps with at least one SDK that include ads had 3.0 times as many third parties as apps with at least one SDK that don’t include ads.&nbsp; 
 Apps with at least one SDK that include behavioral ads had 4.0 times as many third parties as apps with at least one SDK that don’t include behavioral ads.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 2.2 &nbsp; Apps with No SDKs&nbsp; 
<p>There were 92 apps in the data set that had no SDKs and for which we had network traffic. Since these apps had no SDKs, there were no “expected” companies to receive data from the app [other than the app developer, of course].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apps with no SDKs averaged 4.6 companies observed in network traffic—negligibly less than the average for apps with at least one SDK. However, for apps that use Webview, or include advertising or behavioral advertising, the average observed companies is markedly lower (Table 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Apps with no SDKs that use Webview had 44.1% fewer observed companies.&nbsp; 
 Apps with no SDKs that include advertising had 40.6% fewer observed companies.&nbsp; 
 Apps with no SDKs that include behavioral advertising had 21.0% fewer observed companies.&nbsp;

 <br>
3. Conclusion<br>
 
 3.1&nbsp; &nbsp;SDKs as a Proxy for Third Party Sharing<br>
 
<p>As the data shows, SDKs aren’t a useful proxy for the actual number of third parties receiving data from the app. Moreover, apps that include ads or that use Webview will likely have significantly more third parties than apps without.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that viable measurement of third parties receiving data from apps requires testing and observation of network traffic. ISL used mostly manual methods for the collection of this data but automated methods would be extremely beneficial for ongoing and pervasive measuring of app third party sharing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>SDKs do provide value in identifying potential omissions in the manual testing process. Can we account for the specific SDKs that don’t appear in the network traffic? Did we miss a particular functional branch of the app that we should go back and test? Or might it be an indication of an error in the SDK database? So while SDKs don’t serve as a perfect indication of the third parties communicating with the app, they still provide valuable information, and as such, they will remain in our app safety labels (see <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/">https://appmicroscope.org/</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 3.2&nbsp; &nbsp;Validation of ISL App Scoring Rubric&nbsp; 
<p>As shown in section 2, use of Webview and the inclusion of advertising substantially increase user exposure to data sharing with more third parties. This finding reinforces the ISL app scoring rubric wherein the use of Webview and presence of advertising are indicators for very high risk.&nbsp;</p>

  Note: researchers determined the use of Webview manually, by observing third-party pages opening within the app. Thus, the presence of Webview as tagged in ISL’s AppMicroscope.org may not accurately assess Webview use for first-party web pages.&nbsp; 
 It would be interesting to study how many apps&nbsp;have behavioral ads and&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;use Webview.

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Earlier this month, I was lucky enough to be personally invited by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joergresch/">Joerg Resch</a>&nbsp;to attend Europe’s flagship digital ID conference in Berlin,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">EIC 2024</a>. For someone who regularly spoke on this circuit for over 10 years, it was a blast to be back, revelling in the richness of the presentations and discussion, highlighted in this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jonibrennan_eic2024-dc4eu-personaldataprivacy-activity-7206782875801669632-70VT?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">post</a>&nbsp;by my predecessor at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kantara-initiative_eic2024-kantarainitaitive-activity-7204130422773985280-FVFw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Kantara Initiative</a>. The brain is fully engaged for hours, absorbing expert insight, experience, and innovation that is found here at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC</a>&nbsp;in Germany and<a href="https://identiverse.com/">&nbsp;Identiverse</a>&nbsp;in the US, the world’s two biggest conferences in this space. I’m looking forward to a tiny fraction of the ground being covered and contextualised locally at our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;in just six weeks’ time.</p>



<p>The pre-conference&nbsp;<a href="https://sidi-hub.community/">SIDIHub</a>&nbsp;made significant progress in the challenging goal to achieve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/multi-stakeholder-cross-border-identity-eic24">digital identity cross border interoperability</a>. Participants were interested in learning about Aotearoa becoming the first common law country to implement a<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital-government/programmes-and-projects/digital-identity-programme/about-the-digital-identity-programme/">&nbsp;regulated digital identity trust framework&nbsp;</a>on July 1st. This framework regulates stakeholders that opt in for accreditation, thereby increasing customer trust in their security and privacy settings. The US, UK, Canada, and Australia have digital ID trust frameworks in operation and piloted, but not yet nationally legislated. Credential authentication and verification continue to evolve both in policy and technology at different speeds, making it a complex issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At our recent DIA-hosted public/private sector working group meeting on digital identification standards, I commented that there is still much work needed globally before we can adopt comprehensive policies, protocols and standards for decentralised digital ID and its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-the-wallets-we-want-eic24">container</a><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/panel-expert-digital-wallet-verifiers-eic24">wallets</a>. This is a plane we will continue to build as we fly it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high interest in digital ID led us to host/co-host two events in June: the capacity-filled ‘Digital Identity, Higher Education, Aotearoa’ sponsored by Middleware and featuring the University of Auckland, and a Town Hall-styled session on digital cash with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Te Pūtea Matua (RBNZ), in partnership with FinTechNZ. Both events showed how important broad digital trust is for ensuring cybersecurity and protecting against deepfakes, scams and hacking threats. Awareness and education are essential, so we thank our members for supporting DINZ initiatives, just as DINZ supports members’ initiatives like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/biometrics-education-series/">the upcoming series from NEC</a>.</p>



<p>And finally, the DIA has released a new schedule of Identification Masterclasses through to August.</p>







<p>To register for any of the Zoom sessions, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:identity@dia.govt.nz">identity@dia.govt.nz</a>&nbsp;with the G or HD reference number and a Zoom link will be supplied.</p>

             <p>To reach their goal of 40% refillable bottles by 2030, Coca-Cola Latin America needed a way to know how many times a given bottle had been through the refill cycle.</p>

<p>By laser engraving a unique identifier onto every bottle, Coca-Cola can know how many filling cycles the bottle has gone through, and whether it should be refilled or recycled.</p>

<p>Beyond the positive sustainability impact, the initiative provides a valuable set of data about each bottle’s journeys through the market across its lifecycle.</p>

<p>Dr. Pablo Breuer of Orthogonal Insights, Daniel Rohrer of NVIDIA, and Daniella Taveau of Bold Text Strategies Bring Diverse Expertise to OASIS</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 24 June 2024 – OASIS Open, the international standards and open source consortium, announced the results of its 2024 Board of Directors Annual and Special Elections. The Board, selected by the OASIS membership, will continue guiding the organization’s direction by encouraging ongoing growth and fostering increased collaboration within the open source and standards communities. Newly elected Board members from the Annual Election are Daniel Rohrer, VP of Product Security, Architecture and Research, at NVIDIA, and Daniella Taveau, President of Bold Text Strategies. Additionally, Jim Cabral, Gershon Janssen of Reideate, Bret Jordan, and Vasileios Mavroeidis of University of Oslo and Sekoia.io were re-elected. These individuals will serve two-year terms ending in 2026. Dr. Pablo Breuer, President of Orthogonal Insights, was elected in the Special Election to serve a one-year term ending in 2025. Continuing members of the Board are Jason Keirstead of Cyware, Daniel Riedel, Omar Santos of Cisco, and Jay White of Microsoft.</p>



<p>Francis Beland, Executive Director of OASIS, expressed his congratulations. “We welcome these distinguished leaders, both newly elected and re-elected, to the Board of Directors. Their extensive leadership experience will be instrumental as OASIS continues to develop meaningful new initiatives and broaden its opportunities. I look forward to collaborating with each of them as we pursue ambitious goals for the future.”</p>



<p>Dr. Pablo Breuer, President of Orthogonal Insights, brings a wealth of experience from his previous role as an executive at a Fortune 50 company and his 22-year Navy career, which included top-level positions in the U.S. Special Operations Command Donovan Group, SOFWERX, the NSA, US Cyber Command and US Naval Forces Central Command. A DoD Cyber Cup and two-time Defcon Black Badge winner, Breuer has taught at the Naval Postgraduate School, National University, California State University Monterey Bay, and Carnegie Mellon CERT/SEI. Breuer is the co-founder of the Cognitive Security Collaborative and coauthor of the DISARM (Disinformation Analysis and Response Measures) framework, the methodology used by the US and EU governments and NATO to address Misinformation and Disinformation. He is a sought-after speaker in the fields of cybersecurity and Mis- and Disinformation, sits on several Boards, and has mentored countless students and professionals.</p>



<p>“I’m honored to join the board of OASIS Open to help develop and promote open and inclusive standards for innovation and technology which promote our global ethics and shared interest. The speed of technology and innovation require standards to promote safety, fairness, and interoperability,” said Breuer. “I look forward to working on standards including countering disinformation and promoting artificial intelligence safety and resiliency. OASIS Open has been at the forefront of technology standards for more than three decades, and I’m proud to be able to contribute to their mission.”</p>



<p>Daniel Rohrer serves as VP of Software Product Security, Architecture and Research at NVIDIA, where, throughout his 24-year tenure, he has led efforts to enhance AI security, deliver GPU confidential computing, and advance research efforts in secure platform design. Rohrer has taken his integrated knowledge of “everything NVIDIA” to hone security practices, explore novel cybersecurity solutions, and help deliver some of the world’s most advanced and trustworthy computing platforms. He has been at the forefront of AI Security, contributing to the development of safe and trustworthy ecosystems through training, open source tools, and other initiatives aimed at scaling communities. An advocate for democratized access to computing resources, Rohrer strives to ensure equality and accessibility for all communities. He serves on the NVIDIA AI Ethics Review Committee and has held a Board position with the nonprofit NVIDIA Foundation, driving significant product security innovations.</p>



<p>“As AI adoption continues to grow across every industry, building systems that advance security and trust are paramount to success,” said Rohrer, VP of Software Product Security, Architecture and Research at NVIDIA. “I am honored to join the OASIS Board and contribute to the community so invested in the transparent development of open-source software and standards.”</p>



<p>Daniella Taveau, President of Bold Text Strategies, is an internationally recognized expert in developing global business and regulatory strategies. She has extensive experience working with senior political officials and advising multinational corporations worldwide. Taveau’s expertise spans international trade, finance, agriculture, food security and safety, chemicals, pesticides, new technologies, cosmetics and personal care, intergovernmental organizations, information technology, and combating mis- and disinformation. Prior to starting her own firm, Taveau was an International Trade Negotiator with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), where she represented the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO); all U.S. Free Trade Agreements including the TransPacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (U.S./E.U. FTA), and the U.S. Korea Free Trade Agreement; the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (U.N. FAO); and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). She also served as an International Policy Analyst with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and held an executive role at a global cosmetics company for a decade.</p>



<p>“I am honored to join the board of OASIS Open, considered one of the leading global forces in open-source standards. Accessible standards are necessary to ensure interoperability, innovation, and inclusivity,” said Taveau. “As we confront the growing challenges of misinformation and disinformation, I am committed to working with OASIS Members to promote accuracy, transparency, and trust in our digital world.”</p>



<p>OASIS expressed sincere gratitude to outgoing Board member Duncan Sparrell of sFractal Consulting for his invaluable service, dedication, and significant contributions during his tenure as a director.

<p>This week, US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has called for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/health/surgeon-general-social-media-warning-label.html">warning labels for social media platforms</a>. If you know anything about Internet Safety Labs (ISL) you’ll know that our primary mission is the development of free and accurate safety labels for technology. So naturally, we heartily agree with Dr. Murthy that technology needs labels—but perhaps not warning labels and definitely not just for social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various experts have written thoughtful responses<a>1</a>&nbsp;to this week’s call for warning labels, and their concerns underscore the fact that a warning label may be inappropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course we need safety labels on technology.&nbsp;</p>
 History of Product Labels&nbsp; 
<p>There are several types of product labels: ingredient labels (food), test result labels (automobile crash test ratings), warning labels from the surgeon general (cigarettes) and from other entities (OSHA’s Hazard Communication System for chemicals).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safety labels have a long-standing history in the US as a core component of product safety and product liability. The purpose of safety labels is to illuminate innate—i.e. unavoidable—risks in a product whether it is food, vehicles, cleaning solvents, toys for children, or the technology that we use with increasing reliance for all facets of living our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safety labels almost always lag commercial product introduction, and in at least a few cases, product safety can lag by decades. For instance, for cars, product safety awareness and measures (like seatbelts) emerged 50-plus years after their mass availability. Consumer computing has been around for about 40 years now, and it will likely be another 10 years before we see product safety in full swing for software-driven technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to InComplianceMag.com, US and Canadian tort-based law makes manufacturers’ product safety obligations clear (emphasis is mine):&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>” Manufacturers have an obligation to provide safe products and to warn people about any hazards related to the product. Those requirements have risen up out of the original product safety/liability cases, some of which happened in the same timeframe as the Chicago World’s Fair, the middle to late 19th century, with many more to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assumption in U.S. liability law, and also typically if a case is brought in Canada, is that the manufacturer of the product is guilty and has to prove that they did everything necessary to provide a safe product. That includes warnings, user instructions, and other elements. Today, that continues to be the basic concept in product liability, that the burden lies on the manufacturer to prove that they did everything possible to make their product safe.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://incompliancemag.com/product-safety-and-liability-a-historical-overview/">https://incompliancemag.com/product-safety-and-liability-a-historical-overview/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another interesting fact about safety labels is that they always lag commercial product introduction, and in at least a few cases, product safety can lag by decades. For instance, for cars, product safety awareness and measures (like seatbelts) emerged 50-plus years after their mass availability. Consumer computing has been around for about 40 years now, and it will likely be another 10 years before we see product safety in full swing for software-driven technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If tech were food we would have never stood for the absence of product information for as long as we have. Never. We use tech with little to no visibility or awareness of what it’s actually doing. That simply must change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need a science of product safety for software and software driven technology. And that’s exactly what we’ve been building for five years at ISL. The current attitude of placing the onus on consumers to somehow gird themselves against invisible risks that not even vendors fully understand is absurd. Of course we need labels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the good news is we’ve got them started on over 1,300 EdTech related apps. Here’s an example <a href="https://appmicroscope.org/app/1614/">https://appmicroscope.org/app/1614/.</a> The image below shows just the label header and the safety facts summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Labels for Technology&nbsp; 
<p>What type of label is appropriate for technology? A warning label is appropriate when the science is irrefutable. Are we there with the physical and mental health risks due to the use of technology? Maybe. Depends on who you ask. But maybe a label more like chemical warning labels is appropriate. Or perhaps just a test results label.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our work at Internet Safety Labs, our intention since day one was to expose invisible or difficult to recognize facts about risky behaviors of technology. As can be seen from the design of our app safety labels, we chose to emulate food nutrition labels that report measured findings. This approach of reporting measured findings works very well for this early stage of the science of product safety for technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, in our safety labels, you can see the category averages for most of the measures in the label. Why did we do that? Because there is no concrete threshold that distinguishes safe from unsafe ranges. There’s no industry standard that says, “more than ten SDKs is bad” for example. Moreover, technology norms vary by industry, such that personal information collection in fintech and medical apps is quite different than personal information collection in retail (at least one hopes). Thus, the category averages displayed in our labels don’t necessarily mean “safe”, they just provide context as we continue to measure and quantify technology behavior. An example of the shortcomings of this approach is when, for instance, the category average number of data brokers is greater than zero for apps typically used by children. (We advocate for no data brokers in technology used by children.) But we need to start with understanding the norms. We can’t change what we can’t see. &nbsp;</p>
 The Devil is in the Details&nbsp; 
<p>The call for a congressional mandate for something (not necessarily a warning label) is a step in the right direction. Why? Because it treats software as a product and tacitly places product safety requirements on it. This is an advancement in our eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, product safety is almost always the domain of government (or insurance). In the absence of a government mandate for product safety for technology, we see fragmented efforts with the FTC boldly championing privacy risks in technology, and the FCC advocating for a different type of label. So indeed, it’s encouraging that we’re starting to talk about technology in product safety terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the devil is in the details of any labeling program. In the words of Shoshana Zuboff, “who decides and who decides who decides?” As in, who decides what goes on the labels? Also who oversees the integrity of the labels? The US government is a customer of data obtained by surveillance capitalism<a>2</a>. When it comes to technology can the government be trusted to keep people safe? (When it comes to food can the government be trusted to keep people safe? When you dig into it, the track record is spotty.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product safety exists in natural opposition to the industry status quo and any kind of regulation is already facing and will continue to face strong opposition<a>3</a>. In the early 1900s, when chemist Dr. Harvey W. Wiley began a crusade for the labeling of ingredients and identifying toxic elements in food, industries who relied on the opacity of ingredients (snake oil salesmen) or who simply didn’t want to incur the cost of change (whiskey distillers) opposed such a mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Strenuous opposition to Wiley’s campaign for a federal food and drug law came from whiskey distillers and the patent medicine firms, who were then the largest advertisers in the country. Many of these men thought they would be put out of business by federal regulation. In any case, it was argued, the federal government had no business policing what people ate, drank, or used for medicine. On the other side were strong agricultural organizations, many food packers, state food and drug officials, and the health professions. But the tide was turned, according to historians and Dr. Wiley himself, when the activist club women of the country rallied to the pure food cause.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/116890/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/116890/download&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Product safety challenges the status quo and creates necessary growing pains for industry. But industry always survives. And more often than not, new industries emerge, such as the ongoing development of safety features for vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s return to the challenge of deciding what goes in the labels. We at ISL know quite a lot about what it takes to develop safety labels in a space where the naming and measurement of risk isn’t fully baked (or worse, non-existent). Determining what goes into a previously uncharted, unmeasured safety label is extraordinarily challenging. It’s even more challenging if the measurement tools don’t exist. But our situation is even worse than that: we don’t even have agreement on what the risky behaviors in technology are. AND, we are talking about behaviors here—which is not language we typically associate with products. Products don’t typically behave. From our several years in development, these are the highly iterative steps that must occur to reach consensus on labels for technology:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Consensus on naming the hazards/harms in technology.<a>4</a>&nbsp; 
 Consensus on assessing and quantifying the risks.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Identify the behaviors that embody the risks.&nbsp; 
 Figure out a way to measure the behaviors that embody the risks.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Assess the measurements.<a>5</a>&nbsp; 
 Consensus on presentation of the measurements/information.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>As far as presentation of the data, in our case, we decided to aggregate the data into clusters based on riskiness, and we also ultimately decided to provide a single app score. This was done with some reluctance, and it will no doubt be a much-evolving scoring rubric for the next few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, we believe the best thing the labels can do is objectively report the invisible (or poorly understood) behaviors of the products until such time as definitive harm thresholds can be derived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a final vital detail regarding the establishment of any labels, and that’s having what I would characterize as exceptional diversity of participants in establishing safety standards. This isn’t lip service. A few years ago, when I started to better see how what was risky for me was very different than what was risky for people who are different from me such as a person of color, or a person with a disability, or an incarcerated person, I woke up one night from a deep sleep with the awareness that any attempt at standardizing or consensus is doomed if it doesn’t have full diversity involved<a>6 </a>. Why this is so is a long and complicated matter. On the one hand, everything ever done should endeavor to have exceptional inclusion of a massively diverse set of participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it also has to do with the fact the software and software driven tech is “alive” and interactive in a way that other products in our lives aren’t. We have a special duty when it comes to product safety of software animated products. We may even need to reconsider what a “product” is. We have seen evidence of the hazards of animated technology not built with adequate understanding of the diversity of users with the embodiment of human bias in automated decision making or with hand dryers that don’t activate for people of color. The point is that technology acts on and with us in a different (and constantly changeable) way than other products. So labeling is both harder and matters more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>Overall, I remain optimistic that the lens is happily starting to focus on product safety, implicit though it may be. People will be thinking more about labels for technology. And they will see that ISL is already providing labels with privacy risks. We can call out the presence of infinite scroll, and like buttons and other widely recognized as addictive user interface patterns in labels today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, confusion stems from Dr. Murthy’s call for a “warning label” instead of a safety or ingredients label. Technology is cigarettes<a>7</a>. We use the metaphor all the time. Technology today is cigarettes in the 1940s/1950s when just about everybody chain smoked and the harms were likely all anecdotal and pooh-poohed. It took decades to assemble causal evidence. But tech is also much more complicated than cigarettes and a warning label is premature. This is not a compelling argument to say that we don’t deserve to have accurate information on tech’s risky behaviors. As it is right now, we don’t even have an ingredient label for technology. We are flying (tech-ing?) blind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course we need labels. Industry would do well to proactively embrace label enablers like software bills of material, consent receipts, and machine-readable record of processing activities (ROPAs). Because there can be no doubt that labels are imminent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier, I said that we’ve “started”. I say that because our labels only include privacy risks at present. Our labels are deliberately modular and we’ve scoped additional sections:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Risky UI Patterns –like deliberately addictive UI patterns of the sort Dr. Murthy is calling for exposing. Our <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/resources/specifications/isl-safe-software-specification-for-websites-and-mobile-apps-v1-1/">Safe Software Specification for Websites and Mobile Apps</a> already describes measurement of these kinds of risks.&nbsp; 
 Automated Decision-Making Risks&nbsp; 
 Security [client side only] Risks&nbsp; 
 Differences between observed tech behavior and privacy policy and/or terms of service.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>All of these are on our roadmap. We know exactly how to add these sections to the label, it’s strictly a resource and funding issue. If they sound good to you, please <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/donate/">consider supporting our mission</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of course we need labels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Checkmarx, Cisco, Cyware, Google, IBM, Legit Security, Microsoft, Root, SAP, US NSA, CISA, and Others Join Forces to Build a Framework to Complement SBOM Data Formats, CSAF, CycloneDX, OpenVEX, and SPDX</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 20 June 2024 – With escalating cybersecurity threats exploiting software supply chain vulnerabilities, there’s an urgent need for better understanding and proactive measures to identify and prevent future risks. Members of OASIS Open, the global open source and standards organization, have formed the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/tc-osim/">Open Supply Chain Information Modeling (OSIM) Technical Committee</a> (TC) to standardize and promote information models crucial to supply chain security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of OSIM is to build a unifying framework that sits on top of existing SBOM data models–such as CSAF, CycloneDX, OpenVEX, and SPDX. OSIM is not intended to replace or endorse any one of these models. Instead, as an information model, OSIM will bring clarity to software supply chain partners, mitigate vulnerabilities and disruptions, reduce security risks, and make it easier for companies to plan for upgrades and contingencies.</p>



<p>“CISA is excited to be a part of this technical effort to bring greater visibility to the software supply chain,” said Allan Friedman, Senior Technical Advisor at CISA. “We have many of the basic building blocks for software transparency and security, including SBOM, VEX, and CSAF. This work by OASIS will facilitate automation for easier and cheaper implementation and tooling, and help provide a unifying supply chain framework and raise the level of collaboration across industries.”</p>



<p>“OSIM represents an important effort to address the need for greater structure and comprehensibility of software supply chains,” said Isaac Hepworth, Google, and OSIM co-chair. “By establishing standardized information models we can enhance transparency, interoperability, and resilience in end-to-end operations — ultimately aiding cyber risk management and protecting critical infrastructure.”</p>



<p>Recognizing the crucial role of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) in fortifying software supply chain security, the OSIM TC aims to create, for example, a standardized SBOM information model that would enhance understanding and interoperability across diverse SBOM data formats (i.e. SPDX and CycloneDX). Competing data models, like SPDX, CycloneDX, CSAF, and OpenVex, show the need for creating information models that would bring coherence across diverse specifications.</p>



<p>“OSIM’s approach not only drives a universal taxonomy of thought, it also brings clarity and ease to how we implement standards and frameworks to support multiple industry software supply chain security needs. OSIM facilitates the identification of similarities and differences across specifications, enhancing interoperability and simplifying processes. The current cybersecurity landscape can no longer be defended in a silo,” said Jay White, Microsoft, and OSIM co-chair.</p>



<p>The OSIM TC welcomes a diverse range of contributors, including software and hardware vendors, open-source maintainers, technology consultants, business stakeholders, government organizations, and regulatory bodies. Participation is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OASIS-OPEN-MEMBERSHIP-AGREEMENT_2024_TC.pdf">membership in OASIS</a>, with interested parties encouraged to join and contribute to shaping the future of supply chain information modeling.</p>



<p>Support for OSIM<br><br>Checkmarx<br>“Checkmarx is proud to be working with OASIS and be part of the OSIM Technical Committee. A major part of Checkmarx’ mission to secure the applications driving our world involves sharing our time, experience, and threat intelligence to help make the software supply chain ecosystem safer. As one of the biggest challenges remains education and closing the knowledge gap, we believe standardization is a crucial step and are committed to assisting in laying the foundations.”<br>– Erez Yalon, VP of Security Research, Checkmarx</p>



<p>Root<br>“The OASIS OSIM is a vital project for enhancing security and trust in the software supply chain. As a part of the OSIM Technical Committee, Root is committed to advancing supply chain security and transparency, aligning perfectly with this initiative’s goals. By collaborating on data schemas, data modeling, and security standards, we aim to improve vulnerability management and software security, ensuring threats are identified and mitigated promptly. This enhances software integrity, benefiting our customers and strengthening trust in the broader digital ecosystem.”<br>– Ian Riopel, CEO, Root.io</p>



<p>SAP SE<br>“Having a unified information model for representation of objects in the supply chain domain would enable efficient integration models and interoperability. Especially with the wave for generative AI, such aligned models can bring benefits in development efficiency , reduced maintenance and operations for upcoming innovations in the domain.”<br>– Gururaj Raman, Chief Development Expert, SAP SE</p>

<p>With tens of billions invested in AI last year and leading players such as OpenAI looking for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0">trillions more,</a> the tech industry is racing to grow large generative AI models. The goal is to steadily demonstrate better performance and, in doing so, close the gap between what humans can do and what can be accomplished with&nbsp;AI.</p><p>There is however another gap that has become strikingly apparent — the AI trust gap. As challenges such as AI hallucinations, bias, and intellectual property slurping continually cause damage, we look into how the base of the current Web could be effectively transformed to support the Verifiable Internet for&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The announced<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2024/06/10/apple-chatgpt-ios-18-heres-how-it-will-work/"> Apple and OpenAI</a> integration signals the trust gap is widening, with Apple users’ data becoming the next frontier for training ChatGPT and questionable transparency on how it is used. This data is so valuable that it <a href="https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/artificial-intelligence/apple-to-pay-openai-through-distribution-not-cash/110955459">reportedly makes up for charges Apple</a> would pay for using costly ChatGPT AI models. The Verifiable Internet for AI shifts this paradigm, making such data transactions transparent on chain with ownership of data taken back by users, who ultimately get to monetize&nbsp;it.</p> Decentralized AI: Intersection of Crypto and&nbsp;AI <p>Having employed the fundamentals of crypto, AI, and knowledge graphs successfully within a <a href="https://origintrail.io/solutions/overview">plethora of sectors</a>, where trust, transparency, and accuracy are of paramount importance, OriginTrail now integrates Base blockchain with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), to help drive trust and transparency with neuro-symbolic AI. Instilling information provenance, ownership, and graph structure through blockchains and knowledge graphs together can effectively address the aforementioned problems of AI, as detailed in the most recent <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">White Paper&nbsp;3.0</a>.</p> Your Body of Knowledge, Your Choice of&nbsp;AI <p>The opportunity of graph algorithms as a foundation for reputation in the age of AI was also highlighted by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, in a recent&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>“Another piece of a puzzle that I feel could be missing, is something around reputation that’s on chain. You can imagine a version of this that’s like using the graph structure of the chains. To sort of say, okay if I trust this node, and they sent money to this node, that sort of implies some amount of trust. Kind of like a Google Page Rank had an algorithm, something like that could be built on chain.” — Brian Armstrong, CEO of&nbsp;Coinbase</p><p>The recently introduced OriginTrail Paranets (user-controlled on-chain knowledge graphs), enable users total control over their data, connecting it into the DKG decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN), while keeping it safely stored on their devices. Users are then able to choose from a growing selection of open-source AI systems integrated with OriginTrail via <a href="http://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG.ai</a>, a launchpad for user-controlled AI.</p><p>Knowledge graphs with paranets enable transparent on-chain reputation, relevance scoring with PageRank, recommendation engines, graph neural networks, and other AI reasoning applications.</p><p>The first of such knowledge graphs to launch on Base is<a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/announcing-the-id-theory-desci-ipo-initial-paranet-offering"> the DeSci paranet for autonomous scientific research</a> by <a href="https://idtheory.io">ID Theory</a>, crowdsourcing knowledge assets utilizing on-chain reputation via the OriginTrail DKG.</p><p>“<a href="https://x.com/hashtag/DeSci?src=hashtag_click">#DeSci</a> has great potential. Those who have a working product will have the power to forever improve science and the scientific process.” — Brian Armstrong, CEO of&nbsp;Coinbase</p><p>One of the first dapps deployed on the DeSci paranet on Base will be the DeSci AI agent, which will include a knowledge mining interface through which scientific knowledge will be minted on chain, with publishers receiving token incentives.</p><p>“We’re creating a user-friendly hub to coordinate scientific knowledge creation onchain — a co-owned substrate to crowdsource AI and supercharge research and discovery as we know it through autonomous science. The first iteration will focus on neuroscience as it’s very close to our hearts, but the future is boundless. Who knows, crypto might actually cure cancer.” — ID&nbsp;Theory</p>DeSci AI Agent in action built on OriginTrail<p>AI and Crypto, converging together in the OriginTrail DKG can tackle some of the largest challenges while providing users with an inclusive, unbiased, and verifiable way of making mission-critical decisions. As we bring this technology to more data-intensive sectors such as science, the trust layer — blockchain underpinning the neuro-symbolic AI approach made possible by the DKG — needs to fulfill both the scalability and user experience requirements.</p><p>This is where Base can help Trust Thy AI — in a scalable, inclusive, and user-friendly way.</p><p>Make sure to subscribe and follow the next steps as we make AI&nbsp;Base-d.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/trust-thy-ai-artificial-intelligence-base-d-with-origintrail-e866d996ca1c">Trust Thy AI: Artificial Intelligence Base-d with OriginTrail</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Validity + Reliability + Viability = Credibility Image CC BY-ND Visual Thinkery for&nbsp;WAO<p>Digital credentials are playing an increasingly important role in recognising a broad spectrum of skills in the workplace. These range from the tangible to the abstract and innovative, but in all cases, we want credentials that are credible — that is to say, something worth&nbsp;earning.</p><p>In this post, we explore two distinct scenarios, a culinary school and a large organisation looking to recognise and encourage the creativity of its exmployers. In each, the core elements of validity, reliability, and viability are discussed in terms of developing a credible digital credential system&nbsp;.</p> Validity <p>Validity ensures that an assessment accurately measures what it claims to measure. In the context of digital credentials, this means that the assessment process leading to the badge should accurately evaluate the abilities, knowledge, or competencies it is intended to certify. This alignment between the assessment criteria and the attributes it assesses is important. Without strong validity, the integrity of the credential could be questioned, undermining its acceptance by educational institutions and employers.</p>  Culinary School: Issuing badges for skills like knife handling, pastry making, and creative presentation means assessing specific competencies. Each badge must represent true mastery of these skills. Assessments might involve practical tests where students must produce a dish that adheres to professional standards. These practical assessments must be designed to measure relevant culinary skills accurately, ensuring the badge directly reflects the student’s capability.  Creative Organisation: For certifying creativity, the assessments might require participants to propose innovative solutions to real business challenges. These should be evaluated for their originality, practicality, and impact, ensuring the badge reflects genuine creative thinking and problem-solving ability.   Reliability <p>Reliability focuses on the consistency and dependability of the assessment results. A reliable digital credential system ensures that all recipients are evaluated using the same standards, and that these standards are consistently applied. This consistency builds trust in the credentialing system, making the credentials more likely to be recognised across different sectors.</p>  Culinary School: It is crucial that all culinary tests are graded on a consistent rubric. If two students deliver dishes of similar quality, they should both earn the badge. This uniformity builds trust in the credentialing system by affirming its fairness and&nbsp;rigour.  Creative Organisation: When evaluating creative projects, it’s essential that all judges use the same criteria to assess the submissions. This ensures that every employee who meets the standard of creativity receives recognition, maintaining the reliability of the credential across the organisation.   Viability <p>Viability deals with the practical aspects of sustaining an assessment system. This includes considerations such as the costs involved, the resources required, and the technology necessary to issue and maintain the credentials. A viable digital credential system is scalable and sustainable, capable of adapting to growing demands and evolving educational environments.</p>  Culinary School: The school needs a system that can efficiently handle various forms of assessments, from practical cooking exams to theoretical tests. This includes logistical aspects such as scheduling, recording results, and managing digital badges. The technology used must support these activities without prohibitive costs.  Creative Organisation: For a badges relating to creativity, the system should support diverse submission formats and robust communication for feedback. It must also be scalable and adaptable to accommodate a growing number of participants as the organization evolves.   Credibility as convergence <p>In both examples, credibility arises from the effective integration of validity, reliability, and viability. A credible digital credential system not only accurately and consistently evaluates and represents diverse skills — from cooking to creativity — but also operates efficiently and sustainably within its intended scope. This credibility enhances the value of a digital credential, making it a recognized and sought-after mark of achievement.</p> Next steps <p>Understanding and applying the principles of validity, reliability, and viability can enhance the effectiveness and perception of digital credentialing systems. Whether in a culinary school or a large corporation, these principles ensure that credentials issued represent genuine skills and achievements, fostering trust and respect in the digital badges awarded. Through these dual examples, this post demonstrates how these principles can be applied across various disciplines, encouraging readers to think broadly about the potential of digital credentials in their own&nbsp;fields.</p><p>Need help thinking about digital credentials in your organisation? <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/we-are-open-coop">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> Related posts   <a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/Badge_Project_Blueprint">Badge Project Blueprint</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/making-credentials-work-for-everyone-13bf7ae86283">Making Credentials Work for Everyone</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/a-compendium-of-credentialing-c8afe73e03bd">A Compendium of Credentialing</a>  <p>Special mention and thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paddy-craven-8544965/">Paddy Craven</a> of City &amp; Guilds, who initially pointed us in the right direction around&nbsp;this!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-credibility-into-digital-credentials-59945d07ace0">Building Credibility into Digital Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA) is an alternative to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach, emphasizing the importance of a robust, scalable, and expandable architecture. The MVA methodology mitigates risks associated with reputation, competitiveness, and architectural deficiencies, and fosters collaboration among competitors. Real-world examples, such as SSL/TLS and the Gordian system, illustrate the successful implementation of MVA in software development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A business methodology focused on producing a Minimum Viable Product blossomed in the 21st century. Unfortunately, it can set businesses up for future failure because it doesn’t properly define the larger architecture that is needed to evolve a product past its earliest, minimal state.</p>

 The Old Methodology: Minimum Viable Product 

<p>A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a business methodology that advocates creating the simplest possible version of a product as a first release, to see if the market responds positively, or else to understand why it doesn’t<a>1</a>. If an MVP is successful, possibly through iterations of the initial work, the product can then be grown and ultimately find large-scale success in the market.</p>

<p>Twitter has long been used as an example of an MVP that did great, with Dropbox and Facebook being other examples of MVPs<a>2</a> (to various extents). By the criteria of these companies, MVP would seem to be a win-win methodology.</p>

<p>However, they’re not the full story.</p>

 MVP Biases 

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, current literature about Minimum Viable Products suffers from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">Survivorship Bias</a>. We hear about the success of companies that used MVPs, but we don’t know that their doing so actually led to success. In fact, the successes that we see might just be a false signal.</p>

<p>How many hundreds or even thousands of companies pursuing MVPs failed for each Twitter or Facebook that succeeded? How many companies found that they couldn’t scale their MVP, realized that they couldn’t take commercial advantage of an otherwise successful MVP, or simply were beaten by competitors with even more viable products?</p>

<p>We can’t measure the success of the MVP methodology by the anecdotal success of a few individual companies.</p>

 MVP Dangers 

<p>The MVP system also has other dangers.</p>

<p>Some of these are related to company brand. Though a new company doesn’t have a reputation to damage, a series of unsuccessful MVPs could nonetheless curtail their future opportunities. Meanwhile, a more mature company might find their existing reputation blemished by a poor MVP. This is especially true today, as companies are increasingly saying that MVPs can be poor-quality releases<a>3</a>. That didn’t work out that well for Cyberpunk 2077, one of the highest profile and most controversial computer game releases of recent years, even though (like many modern-day computer games) it wasn’t quite released as an MVP, but not in a fully complete form either<a>4</a>.</p>

<p>There are also competitive dangers. Within a developmental niche, MVPs only work if everyone pursues them; otherwise, an MVP built on solid ideas could easily be out-competed by a firm who produced a slightly more mature prototype. Similarly, a company with more resources might be able to scoop up the ideas in a MVP and replicate them to their own advantage<a>5</a>.</p>

<p>However the biggest dangers of MVPs are probably architectural. By defining an MVP, a company can easily ignore the larger architecture issues that would have once been considered before starting work on any serious release. This can cause problems with scaling, with missing features that can’t easily be added, and with locked-in decisions that become part of the final product.</p>

<p>Twitter (“X”), for example, didn’t finalize its network architecture design until 2010<a>6</a>, four years after its advent. It would have been easy for a better architected social-medium system to get in there first; the fact that no one did is one of the pieces of luck that led to Twitter’s ultimate success. In fact, one of the developers at Twitter has noted this, saying: “In the end, Twitter barely made it, and product progress was slow for years due to post facto infrastructure investment.”<a>7</a></p>

<p>The biases and dangers implicit in MVPs suggest the need to at least experiment with other methodologies for product releases. The huge problems implicit in the potential lack of architecture in an MVP also suggest what that alternative methodology should be: a Minimum Viable Architecture.</p>

 A New Methodology: Minimum Viable Architecture 

<p>Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)<a>8</a> is a methodology that has been discussed in somewhat different forms over the last several years. It doesn’t focus on the simplest product that can be released to consumers, but instead on the simplest architecture that can support future development within a product’s technological ecosystem.</p>

<p>The goal of an MVA is still to create a product that doesn’t strain the resources of a company and that doesn’t create a situation where a company’s ultimate success or failure depends on that singular release. However, that simple product must be created with the understanding of a larger architecture that has enough flexibility<a>9</a> that designers can fill in gaps in that architecture in the future. It’s just that the decisions for filling in those gaps are delayed as much as possible<a>10</a>. It’s a melding of agile methodologies with architectural concerns.</p>

<p>Though an MVA could be created with a full understanding of future expansions that may or may not be ultimately accomodated, it’s more powerful to create an MVA that is modular and expandable — that doesn’t depend on the architect thinking of everything, but instead future-proofs itself so that the architecture could include unthought-of elements in the future. As Jorge Lebrato says: “The architecture remains cohesive and each piece cooperates with the others, despite having had different rhythms.” The best MVA is a compromise between entirely ignoring the architecture (as is likely in an MVP) and designing it entirely (which would likely result in time cost and waste)<a>11</a>.</p>

 MVA Examples 

<p>The following examples contain some real-world usages of MVA instead of MVP.</p>

 SSL/TLS 

<p>When I co-authored the TLS spec in the ’90s, I did my best to future-proof it by simultaneously constraining the design and giving it enough flexibility to be expanded in the future. This is an example of a Minimum Viable Architecture whose usefulness has proven itself: TLS is now the most deployed security system on the internet, at the heart of almost every shopping, financial, or banking transaction.</p>

<p>This future-proofing was thanks in part to our architecting elements that we suspected would be required in the future, but which couldn’t be deployed in the then-present, primarily due to CPU limitations. Perfect forward secrecy<a>12</a> is an example. Users were able to simply turn it on when its usage became viable on standard hardware platforms.</p>

<p>However, our more notable work in creating an MVA came from our inclusion of ciphersuites. These are powerful encryption and decryption rules that do the actual cryptographic work of TLS. By defining them as modular plug-ins, we supported the future innovation of TLS, even in ways that we could not envision. And, there was considerable innovation. TLS 1.2 had 37 ciphersuites, though that dropped back to five with TLS 1.3<a>13</a>.</p>

 The Gordian System 

<p></p>

<p>One of my most recent endeavors is Blockchain Commons’ Gordian system<a>14</a>, which is a layered architecture for protecting digital assets and identity that has seen early successes with the protection of seeds with systems like SSKR<a>15</a> and CSR<a>16</a> and that focuses on the Gordian Principles of independence, resilience, privacy, and openness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockchain Commons’ Mission: Advocating for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to create an MVA that future-proofs the Gordian products, the Gordian architecture identifies points of potential interoperability and breaks the architecture into discrete components across those interoperable interfaces, thus allowing individual elemetns to be replaced. This was done both at the large-scale application level and at the small-scale programmatic level. It’s important everywhere.</p>

<p>At the large-scale application level, the Gordian system achieves interoperability by the careful architecting of both discrete applications and the ways that they can interact. Airgaps are a traditional methodology for introducing security into a digital asset system<a>17</a>, but the Gordian system has expanded that to include Torgaps<a>18</a>, which is a way for making transactions between connected applications both secure and non-correlatable. This modular approach is one way to enable future-proofing, and it’s only strengthed by systems such as airgaps and torgaps that tightly constrain communications between the modules.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>At the small-scall programmatic level, the Gordian system introduces a layered stack of specifications that together enable the private and secure transmission of sensitive data. This stack includes dCBOR<a>19</a>, Bytewords<a>20</a>, URs<a>21</a>, Animated QRs<a>22</a>, Envelope<a>23</a>, Gordian Transport Protocol<a>24</a>, and Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol<a>25</a>. Together these specifications allow for the deterministic storage of binary data (dCBOR), the alphabetic representation of binary data (Bytewords), the tagged display of that representation with functionality to support multipart data (URs), the QR display of multipart data (animated QRs), the structured &amp; smart storage of content (Envelope), the communication of Envelopes (GTP), and the secure communication of Envelopes (GSTP). But we didn’t know what all the layers would be when we got started: this is another example of future-proofing, and one that easily arises from carefully layered specifications.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Blockchain Commons creates its progressive use cases we focus first on the requirements without needing to know the technology. The technological specifics can be filled in by ourselves or individual vendors in the future.</p>

<p>By abstracting and separating architectural elements—whether they be large-scale components, layered specifications, or additional requirements found in progressive use cases—the Gordian system will be able to incorporate options that we are not even considering. The ultimate goal of all of these designs is to ensure that our MVA architecture  does not limit itself, but instead remains flexible for the future.</p>



 
    
   

 Other MVA Examples 

<p>This type of MVA thinking is a pattern that can be widely successful and that doesn’t create some of the limitations that appear in MVP thinking. For example, when I was supporting the creation of the earliest specifications for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)<a>26</a>, I was pleased to see us arrive at a compromise where core DID specifications were separated from specific DID methods and from signature suites. It’s an architecture that allows for a lot of future expansion.</p>

<p>Similarly, some of my earliest Blockchain Commons work was with a company who was adapting the Gordian architecture. Even though they weren’t planning to initially implement multi-sigs, I ensured that they don’t make decisions that would lock them out of multi-sig usage in the future, because I was thinking of a MVA that went beyond the MVP they were focused on.</p>

 Coda: The Benefits of Coopetition 

<p>It can be quite hard for a single company to figure out an MVA. Thus, it’s great to work with other companies in your technology space.</p>

<p>This is particularly true if your industry supports coopetition, where business competitors can work together for a mutually beneficial good. If an industry  supports interoperability, or one company adding services to another company’s products, then it’s a great candidate for coopetition—and thus MVAs are even more likely to be successful.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has been able to take advantage of this. A variety of companies have participated in the Gordian Developer Community community<a>27</a>, each contributing their own ideas and requirements for the Gordian architecture. In turn, they’ve then gone off and created open-source libraries that adapt the architecture<a>28</a>, before beginning work on their own wallets that use the MVA that we cooperatively designed. A not-for-profit organization can be a great support for MVA work of this type; that’s what Blockchain Commons does.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Hollowing out spaces in architectures for future development and creating flexibility for the future through modular designs are two of the most successful methods for turning an MVP into an MVA. They give you something that supports minimal investment and agile development, while simultaneously maximizing the ability to scale and expand in the future.</p>

<p>We don’t always know the right solutions. We can’t predict what will work best. So the best we can do is create architectures that won’t lock us in to specific decisions about the future. By doing so, especially by working in coopetition to do so, we also ensure that no one company will lock us or our users into futures that we don’t agree with.</p>

Hopefully that means we’re moving in this direction!</p>

		<p>Bethany Hall Multipurpose Room B</p>
<p>This case study explores the impact of ChatGPT on First-Year Writing (FYW) courses at a public university. Anchored by an integrated framework drawing from Cognitive Process and Sociocultural Theories of Writing, the research addresses four central questions examining perceptions, challenges, and opportunities for integrating generative AI into FYW instruction. Concerns range from academic integrity to student anxiety, with a focus on how instructors navigate AI-assisted assignments and the implications on the writing process and outcomes. Utilizing a multiple methods case study approach, including interviews and surveys, the study provides nuanced insights into the dynamics of ChatGPT integration. Preliminary findings reveal diverse perspectives among instructors and students, challenging prevailing opinions on generative AI in student writing. As ChatGPT becomes more prevalent, this research informs effective utilization without compromising the quality of student learning in FYW courses.</p>

					 Integrating Generative AI in Higher Education Learning Environments: Opportunities and Challenges
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room A</p>
<p>This presentation explores the transformative potential of Generative AI (GenAI) in higher education. It will address how GenAI can enhance learning environments, the importance of guiding students in its use, and best practices for its integration into university courses. The presentation will provide a comprehensive overview of the benefits and challenges of incorporating GenAI in higher education.</p>
<p>This presentation will examine the importance of integrating GenAI in modern teaching and learning; enhance of personalized learning, including critical thinking and digital literacy; facilitate the development of innovative teaching methods; improve student engagement and outcomes; provide students with guidance on the use of GenAI ethically and effectively including academic integrity and plagiarism concerns, issues related to transparency, privacy, accessibility, bias, accuracy, security, and regulatory challenges. Our presentation will also discuss the need for students to understand that “AI fluency” is as important as reading, writing, and arithmetic. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has grown tremendously since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022.&nbsp; The daily avalanche of announced improvements to AI platforms increases the need for higher education to address these issues. These trends demand that we develop clear policies and guidelines encouraging student awareness, education, and fluency.</p>

					 Centering Students and Using AI within Meaningful Learning Environments
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room B</p>
<p>“How can AI be used to enhance meaningful learning environments in culturally responsive ways? This session focuses on innovative ways AI tools can be used in the classroom to support meaningful learning experiences and culturally responsive teaching. When designing meaningful learning experiences, teachers use AI to engage students in activities that are active, collaborative, constructive, authentic, and goal directed. Culturally responsive teaching is a student centered approach that enriches how AI tools are used within meaningful learning experiences.This happens when teachers situate students’ lived experiences, frames of reference, and ways of being as resources for learning. Participants will be provided a process for designing meaningful learning experiences, a list of AI tools that promote meaningful engagement, and a culturally responsive framework that advances meaningful technology integration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session also addresses educational inequities that surface when learning experiences lack meaningfulness. Teacher centered practices have historically been related to passive technology use, deficit based beliefs about students’ potential, “one size fits all” instruction, and curricular choices that do not account for diversity. As a result, teacher centered approaches have and continue to perpetuate opportunity gaps that disproportionately impact students from historically marginalized communities. To bridge digital divides and fill opportunity gaps, participants will be exposed to the strategies, beliefs, conditions, and tools that support the shift towards student centeredness. “</p>

					 Lessons Learned, Actions Unleashed: Unlocking Our Potential
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room C</p>
<p>Let’s reflect on our AI work together. We’ll use a ‘retrospective’ (a project management tool) to candidly discuss what worked well and where we can grow. We’ll focus on solutions we can control and make this a fun, collaborative conversation. We’re looking for real solutions for real people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some questions to get us started…</p>
 
  What were the outcomes of new teaching methods, tools, etc. used? Are there opportunities to refine or expand?&nbsp; 
  Let’s talk silver linings. What wisdom can we extract from decisions that didn’t quite work out? 
  Describe something you crushed! What made it a success? 
  What action items can we identify to address challenges and improve the learning environment for ourselves and our students? 
 
<p>Even if you haven’t made any groundbreaking discoveries, join us anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The session lead will share anonymized responses compiled into a toolkit after the conference.&nbsp;</p>

					 Using AI Avatar Patients to Increase Student Readiness
					   
				   
 
	 
		<p>Bethany Multipurpose Room A</p>
<p>Educators need to prepare students to enter the workforce post-graduation. Student’s readiness, which includes perceptions of knowledge, attitude, and ability, manifests in one’s sense of self-efficacy and is influenced by experiences. Additionally, experiences are impacted by context-specific readiness. The Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions framework defines context as a set of characteristics and circumstances that are active, unique, and embedded in the experience. Contextual readiness includes socio-political, community, organization, financial, and learning resources and opportunities that influence the experience. Experiences should promote active learning and simulate real-world scenarios to foster student readiness appropriately. Developing and delivering real-world learning experiences presents many challenges, including contextual characteristics, limited space for hands-on engagement, increased staffing needs, scheduling conflicts, and costs associated with patient actors or experiential opportunities. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) can address these challenges. AI is a computing system that can engage in human-like processes such as learning, synthesizing, self-correction, and data integration for complex processing tasks. AI technologies generate human-like content in response to complex and varied prompts and, blended with VR, immerse the user in simulated environments to make the experience more thoughtful and interactive, allowing for repeated practice to enhance skill development, conservation of resources, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>This panel presentation will describe the pedological design and implementation of AI avatar patients into healthcare interprofessional curricula. It will present data on financial impact and students’ perceived readiness post-AI-VR experiences and offer recommendations for future integration into the broader educational curriculum.&nbsp;</p>

While the EU AI Act put the so-called Brussels Effect into play, more regions across the globe are now weighing risks, rights, economic opportunities, and regional needs. On May 28th, the <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Global Network of Centers of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers</a> (NoC) and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at Harvard University (BKC) hosted a group of policy experts from Africa, Latin America, the US, and the EU to discuss this state of global AI regulation and outline next steps for collaboration across continents.</p><p>Lis Sylvan, Senior Director of Strategy and Programming at BKC, moderated the discussion with Carlos Affonso de Souza (Director of the Institute of Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro), Mason Kortz (Clinical Instructor at the Cyberlaw Clinic at BKC), Gabriele Mazzini (European Commission, chief architect of the EU AI Act), and Ridwan Oloyede (Certa Foundation, coauthor of their recent “State of AI Regulation in Africa” report), with NoC Executive Director Armando Guio providing behind-the-scenes support. The group delved into how governments are weighing sectoral versus horizontal regulatory approaches; the role of the administrative state and existing data protection and competition regulators; the new models of AI regulation in Rwanda and Brazil; the impact of the EU AI Act across all jurisdictions; and the potential for truly global governance.</p> Origins and Approaches <p>De Souza contextualized the current moment of global AI regulation as a decade-long journey of AI regulation that started with charters and declarations of governing principles from various governments and entities. Over time, those charters and principles were reflected in national AI strategies, which have been in the works for five years and can be seen as the precursor to AI regulation; Brazil’s AI regulatory evolution, for example, closely followed this time frame. De Souza highlighted the impact of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on this evolution; after GDPR took effect, countries have established data protection authorities that have largely been the main point of contact for early AI governance. As a result of GDPR, he said, “data protection may be an accelerator, may be an entry point for countries in the majority world, because that’s the conversation that we have been having in the last decade, and that’s where resources [and] attention had been moving forward in those countries.” However, he cautioned against using data protection law as the sole basis of AI regulation, because the data protection framework does not necessarily address the full scope of challenges raised by the development of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Mazzini explained that the technical discussions about the EU’s proposed AI legislation date back to 2019. One of the key concerns with a sectoral approach, he said, was the risk of privileging certain sectors over others. The horizontal approach, though, results in added complexity as regulators needed to find regulations that would work across sectors and avoid repetitions; moreover, the scope of EU legislation is limited by the exclusion of national security, military, and defense sectors. While the EU AI Act takes an omnibus approach, Mazzini said it did not make sense to regulate AI as its own technology but rather a general-purpose tool with a variety of applications.</p><p>“What was clear to me since the get-go is that It didn’t make sense to regulate AI as a technology as such, because indeed what we are dealing with is a general purpose technology that has a variety of applications that we don’t even foresee today…” said Mazzini, “…and therefore, from my perspective, the idea to establish rules for the technology as such, regardless of its use, didn’t make any sense…We came up with this approach of establishing rules depending on the specific use to which that account is put, with the greatest burden, from a regulatory point of view, being on the high risk,” which Mazzini outlined to include applications of the technology that are linked to health and safety, including medical devices, automated cars, and&nbsp;drones.</p> Sectoral and Regional Approaches <p>In the U.S. and in the African Union, regulatory agencies have found it more effective to apply existing laws — across data protection, competition, consumer protection, employment, and other sectors — to govern AI, often taking a sectoral approach. Oloyede said that data protection authorities and competition authorities have largely driven the initial AI regulatory agenda, as these authorities are best equipped to enforce consumer protection, data protection, intellectual property, and competition laws as the basis for national AI governance strategies. “We might see some sort of like a clearinghouse model image where not every country in Africa, for example, will try to come up with a specific AI regulation,” Oloyede&nbsp;said.</p><p>Oloyede indicated that the sector-based approach has been dominant on the African continent, with countries including Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda, and Egypt beginning to develop roadmaps for AI governance and establish regulatory task forces. Oloyede said the sectoral approach has allowed regulators to develop specific policies for the deployment of AI in healthcare, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>According to Mason Kortz, this sectoral approach is typically favored in the U.S. because the U.S. regulatory approach values subject-matter expertise over technical expertise. The U.S. will likely have subject-matter experts regulate AI in their own domains, Kortz said — for example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would regulate AI for housing. The U.S. approach relies on the country’s strong administrative state and directs specific federal agencies to take on different pieces of AI regulation. Meanwhile, certain state laws have sought to regulate specific use cases of AI in housing and employment contexts.</p><p>Kortz also noted that the current approach in the U.S. is a confirmation that existing rights-based regimes will be applied or extended to harms resulting from the use of AI systems; with a notoriously slow legislature, he said, only making small changes as needed is an advantageous approach, particularly when existing enforcement agencies may already have the power to make those changes. The U.S. common law system is well-suited to this approach, he said, as it lends judges relatively strong power to reinterpret the law in ways that are binding on lower courts without necessarily having to rewrite civil&nbsp;code.</p><p>“When it comes to some of the more rights-based statutes we have,” Kortz said, “I think, actually, we have a pretty good governance model right there, and we just need some small adjustments around the edges to modernize those statutes and bring them in line, not just with AI, but hopefully, if not future-proof them, at least provide a little more stability for whatever comes next after AI.” However, Kortz allowed that AI is so fundamentally transformative that certain existing laws, such as intellectual property law and copyright doctrine, may not be enough and global harmonization of AI laws should be a priority.</p> Global Collaboration and&nbsp;Capacity <p>Oloyede indicated that African countries have introduced solutions at the level of the Global Privacy Congress, although these solutions will need to reflect differing national and regional interests. Mazzini noted that generative AI and general-purpose AI create additional issues that require international collaboration — fighting misinformation, he said, will require such collaboration. However, de Souza cautioned that regulatory transformation must keep in mind how those laws will be applied in the future. In some cases, he noted, new liability regimes for AI are now stricter than the remaining body of law; Costa Rica, for example, has adopted a strict liability approach for high-risk uses of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>“If we turn out to have the chapters of liability on our AI laws more severe than what we have in our general law for other situations, if we are all in agreement that, in the future, AI is going to be in everything, the legislators that are designing those laws today, they are designing general laws on liability, because we will have AI in almost all sectors,” de Souza remarked. “So the decisions that we’re making today on liability, they might end up scrapping the provisions that you have on your civil code, consumer protection code, because the AI law will be the law that is more recent, more specific, and that may be the one that will be applying in most&nbsp;cases.”</p><p>This international collaboration will require capacity building across the globe, and Mazzini emphasized that the EU AI Act has prompted additional work to support the authorities in the EU that will implement and enforce the regulation. Although the AI Act will impact multiple private sectors, he said, its public enforcement will require both financial and knowledge-based resources. De Souza noted that the Brussels Effect will prompt a need for global bureaucracy to support global compliance with the EU AI Act, and well-resourced national authorities are needed to support that implementation. Oloyede, however, said that lessons learned from the GDPR rollout may inform a better approach to implementing the EU AI Act with a more nuanced understanding of the local context. While the EU AI Act will require capacity building to support new governance bodies with funding and resources, he said, it is essential to preserve existing collaborations with data protection and competition authorities and empower those authorities to address AI in their own&nbsp;domains.</p><p>Despite different countries taking more sectoral versus horizontal approaches, the global community is working to establish flexible approaches to AI governance in their respective regions. As Oloyede said, “AI is here today. Tomorrow is going to be a different technology. And we can’t keep legislating for every new technology that we have.” Mazzini described a need for international coordination when he said, “when it comes to this new type of AI that is sometimes is called ‘generative AI’ or ‘general purpose AI’ that we have specifically regulated in the EU — notably in the last few weeks, in final stages of the negotiations — I think I would like to see there certainly more international coordination, because there we are dealing with a number of questions that I think are pretty common across jurisdictions.”</p><p>Though approaches across the globe may be different, a common cross-cutting theme of the work is balance: protecting rights versus supporting innovation, legislating a critical technology while its capacity and impact is still developing, and providing necessary limitations while allowing nimble innovation.</p><p>The <a href="https://networkofcenters.net/">Network of Internet &amp; Society Research Centers (NoC)</a> is a collaborative initiative among academic institutions with a focus on interdisciplinary research on the development, social impact, policy implications, and legal issues concerning the Internet.

		<p>Dear Edge Community,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to adapt to the industry changes brought about by VMware’s acquisition by Broadcom, I want to share some important updates and reaffirm our dedication to assisting you through these transitions.</p>
<p>Pricing Changes Post-Acquisition: Following Broadcom’s post-acquisition adjustments to VMware’s licensing, contracting, and operational model, Edge will no longer manage an Enterprise Licensing Agreement (ELA) on behalf of our members. As a result, Edge will not be responsible for negotiating pricing, co-terming licensing dates, or participating in the quoting and billing process.</p>
<p>VMware Horizon Update: VMware Horizon is becoming a new organization, separate from VMware/Broadcom, called Omnissa. Licensing for Horizon must be procured separately from VMware and can also be fulfilled by partners like Carahsoft.</p>
<p>What This Means for Members:</p>
<p>Members will need to procure Broadcom/VMware licensing through standard reseller channels. Discounting will be determined by negotiations between each member and Broadcom/the reseller.</p>
<p>Edge still has procurement vehicles available for members to quickly process orders. These include:</p>
 
 The EdgeMarket TeCHS contract, fulfilled by SHI. 
 Other preferred resellers through our convenience contract via Carahsoft. 
 
<p>Additionally, Carahsoft will continue to assist the VMware reseller community in preparing your pricing and quotes.</p>
<p>Alternative Solutions and Expert Support: In light of these changes by Broadcom, we believe it is prudent to consider alternative solutions that may better meet your financial and operational needs. We have secured a robust selection of substitute products and services under Edge procurement vehicles. Most of the market available substitutes are available through the EdgeMarket portal, and I am pleased to introduce several key points of contact who can assist you with these options:</p>

 How to think about the three-sided marketplace of skills validation CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>After more than a decade of working with digital credentials like <a href="https://openbadges.org/">Open Badges</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>, we still sometimes hear the sceptical question: “Who’s asking for&nbsp;this?”</p><p>While digital credentials offer far more than just helping people into a job, this remains a significant and powerful use case. However, creating an ecosystem where this is not only possible but also straightforward takes time. It’s a complex, three-sided challenge that requires more than simply asking users what they want; it involves anticipating their needs and providing innovative solutions that work for everyone involved.</p> The Appeal of Credentials <p>People and organisations are often attracted to digital credentials for their potential to recognise and validate a broad range of skills and achievements. They can help democratise learning, making it accessible and recognisable beyond traditional educational settings. For learners, these kind badges represent an opportunity to showcase their skills in a way that is immediately recognisable — and verifiable.</p> Challenges <p>Despite the initial excitement, many individuals and organisations find themselves asking, “Now what?” In our experience, this question stems from several challenges. Earners can sometimes have a lack of clarity on how to effectively use badges in practice, and so struggle to see how these credentials translate into real-world opportunities.</p>CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Issuers such as educational institutions and other organisations may find it difficult to convince stakeholders of the value of alternative credentials. Meanwhile, employers may exhibit uncertainty about the validity and relevance of these badges, leading to hesitation in recognising them as part of the hiring or promotion process.</p> Understanding the Three-Sided Marketplace <p>To address these challenges, it’s important to understand the interplay between the three main groups involved: earners, issuers, and employers.</p>  Earners: These are individuals who seek to acquire credentials to validate their skills and knowledge. A <a href="https://www.jff.org/jobseekers-want-digital-credentials-for-skill-sharing-are-employers-ready/">significant proportion are already using digital credentials</a> in the application process, with their main concern being whether these badges will be recognised and valued by employers and educational institutions.  Issuers: These include schools, universities, and other organisations that award credentials. Their challenge is to establish the credibility and relevance of their badges as a form of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markcperna/2022/07/25/workforce-credentials-are-going-digital-heres-why-this-helps-everyone/?sh=58d6ec8673e3">skills currency</a>.  Employers: These are the entities looking to hire or promote individuals with verified skills. <a href="https://www.aacu.org/research/falling-short-college-learning-and-career-success">Fewer than half of employers</a> say that they find university transcripts useful in helping them to evaluate job applicant’s potential to succeed at their company. So they need a quick and easy way to verify skills in a way that is a reliable indicator of&nbsp;ability.   Shifting the&nbsp;Question <p>So, rather than asking, “Who’s asking for this?” perhaps we should instead focus on understanding the needs and motivations of each group in this marketplace. By shifting our perspective, we can better appreciate the value of credentials and work towards making them more effective.</p><p>Just look at the progress we’ve made as an ecosystem:</p><p>✅ Clear value proposition — digital credentials offer tangible benefits, like <a href="https://digitalpromise.org/2024/04/11/unlocking-the-benefits-5-key-reasons-for-earning-micro-credentials/">job opportunities and career advancement</a>, by validating a wide range of skills. Secure, digital wallets make it possible for earners to feel like they truly own and control their credentials.</p><p>✅ Widespread adoption and recognition — increasing numbers of institutions and employers are recognising and accepting digital credentials, thanks to the work of organisations such as the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC), <a href="https://www.jff.org/">Jobs for the Future</a>, and <a href="https://www.thersa.org/design-for-life-our-mission/hubs/cities-of-learning/create-digital-badges-and-pathways">The&nbsp;RSA</a>.</p><p>✅ Robust technology infrastructure — advanced platforms and secure technologies are being developed to support issuing, verification, and management of digital credentials, based on foundational work of standards organisations <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/">1EdTech</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>​.</p><p>✅ Collaboration between key industry bodies — industry leaders, educational institutions, and technology providers are working together to standardise and promote the use of digital credentials. See, for example, the work around <a href="https://www.skillsfwd.org/">SkillsFWD</a>, <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/">Opportunity@Work</a>, and the <a href="https://www.t3networkhub.org/">T3 Innovation Network</a>, and networking at events such as <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">The Badge Summit</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://epic.openrecognition.org/">ePIC</a>.</p><p>✅ Data standards and taxonomies — establishing consistent data standards and taxonomies helps in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/examining-the-roots-248077d11c2b">creating interoperable systems</a> where credentials can be easily shared and verified across different platforms. Credential Engine has developed the <a href="https://credentialengine.org/credential-transparency/ctdl/">Credential Transparency Description Language</a> (CTDL), supporting comparability across credential types and providers.</p><p>A huge amount of funding and effort has gone into getting us to this place. It’s going to take more money and time to get us over the line, so where should we focus our attention?</p> Creating Value for All&nbsp;Sides CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>To make digital credentials truly valuable for jobseekers, we need to address the concerns of all three&nbsp;groups:</p>  For earners: Credentials should lead to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/plausible-utopias-the-future-of-open-recognition-022ff0e8c0e3">tangible benefits</a>, such as job opportunities or career advancement. We need clear pathways for using certain types of badges, with examples of how and where digital credentials have successfully led to job offers or promotions.  For issuers: It is crucial to developing robust standards such as <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/why-open-badges-3-0-matters-09bb231be864">Open Badges 3.0</a> to promote the credibility of their badges. Issuers can collaborate with industry leaders to ensure their credentials remain relevant and respected, as well as regularly updating the criteria for earning these badges based on industry&nbsp;needs.  For employers: Providing tools and frameworks to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-future-of-trust-in-professional-networks-4e75f09286b2">easily interpret and trust</a> these badges will encourage wider acceptance and use. Employers can partner with educational institutions to co-create badges and/or develop practical tests to verify the skills claimed by the credentials.   Final Thoughts <p>In summary, the question “Who’s asking for this?” may not be the most productive one. Instead, we should focus on understanding the interconnected roles of earners, issuers, and employers in the credentialing process. By doing so, we can move beyond the trough of disillusionment and realise the full potential of these <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/creating-a-culture-of-recognition-39ffdb6cf943">new forms of recognition</a>.</p><p>At WAO, we’ve been working closely with the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a> (DCC) on storytelling and communications strategies that help everyone <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-find-the-right-mental-models-for-your-audience-c68097a7f0ed">understand and embrace</a> the value of digital credentials. The DCC is a key player in the ecosystem, and one of a number of organisations helping build a future where Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials are a natural and trusted part of the hiring&nbsp;process.</p><p>🔥 Do you need help with digital credentials?

<p>What forms of pAI—personal AI—are Apple, Mozilla, Google, Meta, Microsoft and the rest not doing?</p>
<p>Let’s look at those first two because they’re at the top of the news LIFO buffer.</p>

(Which they should re-name. Siri is Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/?cid=wwa-us-kwbi-features-slid--Brand-AppleIntellligence-Announce-&amp;mtid=20925e1t39169&amp;aosid=p238&amp;mnid=nHJFhcGO-dc_mtid_20925e1t39169_pcrid_78134256302923_pgrid_1250146041615591_&amp;msclkid=fb43aa7f55c8150c7b4ecc171ee3e360#footnote-1">Clippy</a>.) It “can draw on larger server-based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests for you while protecting your privacy.” The “larger models” will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24174786/apple-openai-partnership-chatgpt-wwdc">white-labeled ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://x.com/maxwinebach/status/1800277157135909005">plus Apple’s own small language models</a> (SLMs).</p>
<p>Mozilla, which <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/mozilla-signs-lucrative-3-year-google-search-deal-for-firefox">got $400+ million a year from Google (for search in the Firefox browser) starting in 2020</a>, announce on June 3 that they will be <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-builders-accelerator/">Building open, private AI with the Mozilla Builders Accelerator</a>. Jive:</p>
<blockquote><p>This program is designed to empower independent AI and machine learning engineers with the resources and support they need to thrive. It aims to cultivate a more innovative AI ecosystem, and it’s one of&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozillas-biggest-ai-moments/">Mozilla’s key initiatives</a>&nbsp;to make AI meaningfully impactful — alongside efforts like&nbsp;<a href="http://mozilla.ai/">Mozilla.ai</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-launches-responsible-ai-challenge/">Responsible AI Challenge</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-rise25-ai-nominations/">Rise25 Awards</a>.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Builders Accelerator’s inaugural theme is local AI, which involves running AI models and applications directly on personal devices like laptops, smartphones, or edge devices rather than depending on cloud-based services…</p>
<p>We chose Local AI as the theme for the Accelerator’s first cohort because it aligns with our core values of privacy, user empowerment, and open source innovation. This method offers several benefits including:</p>
 
 Privacy:&nbsp;Data stays on the local device, minimizing exposure to potential breaches and misuse. 
 Agency:&nbsp;Users have greater control over their AI tools and data. 
 Cost-effectiveness:&nbsp;Reduces reliance on expensive cloud infrastructure, lowering costs for developers and users. 
 Reliability:&nbsp;Local processing ensures continuous operation even without internet connectivity. 
 
</blockquote>
<p>Looks to me like both of these are Big AI writ small. It’s “local,” not personal. It’s made to serve your needs with what BigAI offers through APIs. It is still essentially AIaaS (AI as a Service), rather than truly personal AI (pAI): <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">personalized</a> more than personal.</p>
<p>That’s also what I see when I read between the lines at <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/">Mozilla’s AI job openings</a>. Take <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/mozillaai/jobs/4357000007">platform engineer</a>. This person will (among other things), “assist in managing and orchestrating workloads across multiple cloud providers.” That’s fine. I’m sure true pAIs will do that too. But most of pAI will be more personal than that. It will deal with the mundanities of your everyday life. Not with coughing up answers that can only come from AIaaSes.</p>
<p>The problem with personalizing AI giant offerings is that they are large language models (LLM) trained on everything that can be crawled on the Internet, plus who knows what else. Not on your truly personal stuff. This is why “prompt engineering” worthy of the noun is ” <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04444">not for anybody</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prompt engineering is crucial for deploying LLMs but is poorly understood mathematically. We formalize LLM systems as a class of discrete stochastic dynamical systems to explore prompt engineering through the lens of control theory. We investigate the reachable set of output token sequences $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ for which there exists a control input sequence $\mathbf u$ for each $\mathbf y \in R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ that steers the LLM to output $\mathbf y$ from initial state sequence $\mathbf x_0$. We offer analytic analysis on the limitations on the controllability of self-attention in terms of reachable set, where we prove an upper bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ as a function of the singular values of the parameter matrices. We present complementary empirical analysis on the controllability of a panel of LLMs, including Falcon-7b, Llama-7b, and Falcon-40b. Our results demonstrate a lower bound on the reachable set of outputs $R_y(\mathbf x_0)$ w.r.t. initial state sequences $\mathbf x_0$ sampled from the Wikitext dataset. We find that the correct next Wikitext token following sequence $\mathbf x_0$ is reachable over 97% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. We also establish that the top 75 most likely next tokens, as estimated by the LLM itself, are reachable at least 85% of the time with prompts of $k\leq 10$ tokens. Intriguingly, short prompt sequences can dramatically alter the likelihood of specific outputs, even making the least likely tokens become the most likely ones. This control-centric analysis of LLMs demonstrates the significant and poorly understood role of input sequences in steering output probabilities, offering a foundational perspective for enhancing language model system capabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>But all that stuff applies mostly when we’re prompting a big LLM system.</p>
<p>What about using AI in our own lives, where the data that matters most are in our calendars, contacts, financial and health records, our travels, our correspondence (email, chat, whatever)? And how about all the location data we might get from our cars, phone apps, and phone companies? These should be much easier for a pAI to gather, examine, and help us do useful things. Caring about much less data also means a pAI will be less likely to give wrong (hallucinated) answers.</p>
<p>Today the mental frame almost everybody uses for AI is the Big kind, ingesting everything they can get their crawlers on, and munching all of it in giant compute farms. Those systems are great for lots of stuff, but they still don’t deal with personal data listed in the last paragraph.</p>
<p>Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>Look at it this way. For each of us, there are three data pools:</p>
 
 The entire Net, which is what gets crawled by all the giant LLM operators, plus whatever else they can get their claws on. 
 One’s personal life, some of which is digitized in useful form (contacts, calendar, mail, stuff in folders inside PCs and attached drives). 
 Personal data that is in the hands of giants, but is rightfully ours. These include our driving record and driving practices (,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html">recorded by our late model cars and snitched to insurance companies and others</a>), our location data (kept and shared by car and phone carriers to the likes <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data">of Google</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/how-federal-government-buys-our-cell-phone-location-data">the feds</a>), our TV viewing habits, (<a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-stop-smart-tvs-from-snooping-on-you">gathered</a> by Google, Amazon, Roku, Apple, etc.). 
 
<p>The pAI greenfield is with the last two.</p>
<p>Tell us who is working on what there, preferably with open source, and not sitting on walled garden silicon.</p>
<p>[Later… ] Since readers told me I had small language models (SLMs) wrong in one of the paragraphs above, and I’m not sure I had them right, I rewrote them out of the piece. I invite readers to post comments to further correct and expand on the subject of pAIs and what they can do.</p>

<p>This document intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of attestation’s role in enhancing and advancing the digital security landscape, specifically with respect to authentication. It focuses on the core function of attestation: verifying the origin and integrity of user devices and their authentication materials. FIDO credentials are discussed with a focus on how they offer more secure alternatives than traditional password-based systems and how FIDO attestation enhances authentication security for both Relying Parties (RPs) and end-users. In this document, RPs are those entities that provide websites, applications and online services that require the need for secure user access by confirming the identity of users or other entities. FIDO Alliance’s historical journey is presented with practical analogies for understanding FIDO attestation, its enterprise-specific technical solutions, and privacy aspects involved in the attestation process.</p>



<p>Targeted for CISOs, security engineers, architects, and identity engineers, this white paper serves as a guide for professionals considering the adoption of FIDO within their enterprise ecosystem. Readers should possess a baseline understanding of FIDO technologies, the meaning of attestation, and have a desire to understand why and how to implement attestation.</p>

<p>Two predominant themes stood out at last week’s Identiverse 2024 conference in Las Vegas. First, there was the issue of how to defend against rapidly evolving advances in deepfakes, especially for live remote verification. Second, there was a common assumption that widespread adoption of passkeys is right around the corner, and that organizations must prepare to manage and secure passkeys when they become mainstream.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CEO Andrew Shikiar touched on both topics in a session Wednesday (May 29) titled “<a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089529/">FIDO, Passkeys and the State of Passwordless</a>.”</p>



<p>He announced the alliance’s new certification standard for facial-recognition technologies. The first (and so far only) organization to receive that certification is iProov. In a <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv24/session/2089484/">keynote address</a> Thursday (May 30), Shikiar added that the FIDO Alliance was ready to offer independent testing of facial-recognition technologies.</p>



<p>As for passkeys, the passwordless, FIDO-certified PKI-based WebAuthn credentials that reside on hardware keys, smartphones, PCs and in the cloud, Shikiar said the question was not if consumers would adopt them, but when.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s goal is “to make passkeys inevitable,” Shikiar said. No one at Identiverse expressed any doubt that they would be.</p>

<p>Today, the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> announced <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-14-projects-worldwide/">a Bitcoin Development Fund grant</a> to Blockchain Common for its continued support of the development of <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">FROST</a>, including holding <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/#upcoming-events">two more virtual FROST meetings for the developer community</a>.</p>

<p>FROST is a powerful quorum threshold signature scheme built using Schnorr signatures that offers many advantages over existing signature methodologies. That includes crucial integration with Distributed Key Generation: private keys can be created in pieces by discrete online servers, with no server ever having the whole key. Altogether, FROST can improve privacy, resilience, and security alike, making it truly a next-generation key-management system.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has long looked forward to the mainstream deployment of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Schnorr</a> and FROST because of their considerable benefits over traditional key-management and signature schemes. We held out first <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/">FROST Implementer’s Round Table</a> in 2023 to give FROST library implementers and cryptographers a chance to talk with each other, and we were asked to do more. We also hosted a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting1/summary/">FROST Developer’s Meeting</a> this year where we worked with Jesse Posner to offer wallet developers a look at what the future of FROST means.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is thrilled by HRF’s recognition of our work. Their funding makes it possible to continue this work this year: we’ll be hosting a second round table for FROST library implementers &amp; cryptographers on September 18, then a second meeting for wallet developers on December 4. If you’re a cryptographer or library implementer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#frost-implementers">FROST implementer’s list</a> and if you’re a wallet developer, sign up for our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers">Gordian developer’s list</a> to receive the announcements on these events. Admission is free thanks to the support of HRF!</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has also placed FROST on our developmental road map for the year, to consider incorporating it our reference code and tools. More details as additional funding and our schedule firm up.</p>

<p>In the meantime, put September 18 and/or December 4 on your calendars so that you can join Blockchain Commons for these important events that will unveil the future of multi-party signatures and key management.</p>

		<p>CC* Regional Networking: Connectivity through Regional Infrastructure for Scientific Partnerships, Innovation, and Education (CRISPIE)&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEWARK, NJ, June 4, 2024 –Edge has been awarded an $857,000 grant from the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> to enhance network connectivity and access to advanced research networks and related cyberinfrastructure for seven higher education institutions in New Jersey, including a community college and several Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). The partner institutions include Brookdale Community College, Kean University, Montclair University, Ramapo College, Rider University, Rowan University, and Saint Peter’s University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will improve access to advanced research networks and related cyberinfrastructure, aiming to reduce disparities for smaller and less resourced institutions. The initiative offers specialized training programs for IT personnel, faculty, and students, and establishes essential infrastructure elements using tools like perfSONAR for deploying network monitoring and optimization capabilities, leveraging globus file transfer and sharing service, a regional, centrally managed Data Transfer Node (DTN) for efficient data transfers and Science DMZ for direct access to regional and national resources, secured by the InCommon Federation for remote access to instruments and HPC resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alan Mayo goes beyond digital identity to consider identity in person, online, and by telephone. He has developed a structured way of describing identity that has, until now, been severely lacking. Alan questions the currently accepted status quo, suggesting that we will need to pass through an Identity 2.5 phase before reaching Identity 3.0.</p>

 Setting up a successful leadership transition <p>After years of working with and for a variety of different kinds of social impact organisations — from educational institutions to cooperative federations, small community-based charities to global non-profits — we’ve been lucky to see how our strategy and “critical friend” services can help leaders set foundations for an organisational programme or initiative.</p><p>It’s only lately that we’ve thought about some of what we do through the lens of “Fractional Leadership”. We are experts in cooperation, learning, technology and community, which means the type of leadership that we bring into projects is quite <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">specifically OPEN</a>.</p> What is Fractional Leadership? cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Fractional leadership is essentially outsourcing a role or a part of a role to an expert who can help you hit the ground running. Such positions are great when you know you need a new department (e.g. Digital Transformation) or if you’re kicking off a new project that needs someone to lead. They’re also helpful when you know you want to hire someone full-time, but want to find the right person for your organisation.</p><p>Fractional leadership provides you and your organisation with some flexibility because it gives you the time and space to make the right decisions in staffing and for your organisation as a whole. It’s potentially less expensive than hiring someone full time and can be explicitly bound in a statement of work. It’s also a way to test whether or not a particular new position makes sense to your organisation.</p><p>It is a way to work with diverse experts who have wide-ranging experience that you would like to apply to your organisation as it grows, changes and transitions.</p> The shadow side of fractional leadership cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>As with any concept we pull from the world of bizniz into the social impact space, we need to be aware of how it can manifest inside an organisation that isn’t only trying to maximise&nbsp;profits.</p><p>Often, organisations in our space are unaware that what they need is a leader and look to us to create a specific “thing”. “We just need a digital strategy,” or “We just need a training programme,” are things that often come up in projects that obviously need something more. Working openly and helping people to understand how technology and funding intermingle, how community drives participation, how recognition motivates or how a learning programme can scale all require leadership.</p><p>Often funding in the social impact space is to develop a specific thing, not the impact that thing should have. Complex realities also mean that someone who might be a leader in one context might not have what it takes to lead in your context. This is why an open leader is so important. Fractional leadership in the open is a rare thing&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>A fractional leader needs to be adaptable and find ways to stay within the bounds the organisation has, while also setting a project or department up for future&nbsp;impact.</p> Preparing for a new colleague cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Still, experienced fractional leaders are well versed in making do with what they’re given. They can lay out plans and programmes with the future in mind. The strategies and processes put in place during a time of transition reflect a moment in time. Setting them up as iterative and designing them to evolve empowers future&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>We’ve offered “critical friend” services to help onboard the people who will take over from what we were asked to start. We’ve advise on workload and priority based on community engagement in tandem with organisational goals. We like to do the work of documenting and establishing open, productive processes and policies help future collaborators take over when the time&nbsp;comes.</p> Is Fractional Leadership for&nbsp;you? cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Your fractional leader can&nbsp;start:</p>  Developing a strategy that focuses on long term social&nbsp;impact  Creating processes or frameworks to measure impact or create processes for gathering data and&nbsp;insights  Building assets to begin implementing the change needed to achieve the impact you’re looking&nbsp;for  Supporting and working with others on your team to co-design principles and approaches that support your&nbsp;mission  Determining the skills and competencies necessary to lead the project, programme or department they’re working within and helping your organisation find someone to take&nbsp;over  <p>The whole point is that you can bring in engaged experts to help you get something going while looking for your forever person. There are lots of people working in the social impact space who have deep expertise in everything from finance to HR to product development and&nbsp;design.</p><p>Fractional leadership is something you can simply try out. As you create briefs or write out job descriptions just ask yourself, “Would a designated fractional leader give me more time and space to ensure this is a long-term success?” If so, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/fractional-leadership-in-social-impact-organisations-5c03daf9e08e">Fractional Leadership in Social Impact Organisations</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This paper explores the emerging practices surrounding the use of synced passkeys which allow passkey use across multiple devices by syncing the passkeys over the cloud, specifically addressing the initial choices and considerations for service providers (aka relying parties or RPs). These practices are in their early stages and are likely to progress, since operating systems, browsers, and passkey providers are still in a phase of enhancing functionality. This document outlines crucial areas such as registration, authentication, passkey management, and accessibility for RPs to consider and presents a range of emerging approaches for adopting this technology. The objective is to guide RPs through these budding strategies, acknowledging that the specifics of ensuring secure and convenient passkey usage may evolve as the digital landscape continues to advance.</p>



<p>This paper is written with independence for each section, allowing readers to read specific topics of interest without the need to read the entire paper from the beginning.</p>



<p>This white paper is intended for various stakeholders of relying parties, including non-developers, such as information security executives, product owners, identity and access management practitioners, UI/UX designers, and accessibility practitioners.</p>

<p>An innovative collaboration has emerged in the AI sector, as <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a>, a leading AI platform developer headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, and Trace Labs, the core development company of <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a>, based in Hong Kong, have just announced a strategic partnership aimed at supporting the development of the Knowledge Layer — the Internet of Knowledge.</p><p>This partnership signifies that two prominent players in the AI industry have come together to support a decentralized ecosystem where AI agents and infrastructure partners collaborate within the decentralized knowledge graph (DKG) landscape.</p><p>OriginTrail is an ecosystem dedicated to building a Verifiable Internet for AI, and this partnership marks the beginning of their collaboration with SingularityNET’s leading AI platform and robust ecosystem.</p><p>In some of the key highlights of this partnership, Trace Labs is tasked with developing sophisticated infrastructure that allows for efficient access and retrieval of information stored on the DKG, tackling challenges of AI hallucinations, bias, and model collapse due to an explosion in the amount of synthetic data produced by AI. This effort is aimed at enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of the decentralized knowledge graph within the OriginTrail network.</p><p>SingularityNET will then provide users access to its decentralized platform, where specialized AI models and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be purchased and used for data analysis. These models are designed to operate seamlessly with the data supported by the OriginTrail network, fostering a more robust ecosystem. The company will also develop AI models that can be trained directly on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph. This approach helps realize the shared vision of the two partners; eliminating the need for data centralization, and leveraging the decentralized nature of the blockchain to enhance privacy and security.</p><p>Leveraging SingularityNET’s leading position in mission-critical research of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Trace Labs’ experience in commercializing Web3 and AI solutions, the strategic partnership is in particular aimed at solving the real world challenges with decentralized AI within the key sectors, such as Industry 4.0, decentralized science (DeSci), real world assets (RWA), and education.</p><p>Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET, stated, “As we move from an Internet of documents, media and apps to an internet of knowledge and AI, the basic composition of the Internet as a ‘decentralized network of decentralized networks’ becomes ever more important. Both SingularityNET and Trace Labs have powerful capability to grow decentralized networks around knowledge graphs and associated AI capabilities; connecting these networks together into a cross-linked, cross-token meta-network will yield a host of different synergies enabling a broad-based boost in intelligent functionality. As a practical example: Putting together a subgraph of OriginTrail’s DKG decentralized knowledge graph covering shipping logistics, with a knowledge meta-graph living in the OpenCog Hyperon system deployed on SingularityNET covering the timing of events in various markets, one could achieve an unprecedented level of emergent knowledge in the minds of AI agents carrying out supply-chain planning and forecasting. SingularityNET’s new MeTTa-Motto tool integrating Hyperon symbolic AI with LLMs and other deep neural nets could play a critical role here. Similar examples exist in every vertical market, which gives this partnership an almost unbounded potential for economic benefit and human&nbsp;good.”</p><p>Žiga Drev, Managing Director of Trace Labs, added, “The benefits of AI are limitless and so are the risks, like hallucinations and model collapse as the growth in synthetic data outpaces the provision of real world data. A truly open AI that fosters inclusion and a more equitable distribution of value can only be achieved through a collaborative and modular approach. We are proud to partner with SingularityNet, founded and led by the visionary Dr. Ben Goertzel, who coined the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Working alongside the leading visionaries at the convergence of crypto and AI opens exciting opportunities to accelerate real-world adoption of neuro-symbolic AI, combining the power of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and SingularityNET’s specialized marketplace for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI&nbsp;models.”</p><p>Both organizations will also engage in collaborative marketing and social media efforts to promote their partnership and the innovations it brings to the blockchain world, the AI industry, and the intersection of these two sectors. The two partners are also mutually exploring and plan to integrate AI services into Trace Labs’ DKG and paranets.</p><p>The partnership is about working together today to solve the challenges of tomorrow; synergizing blockchains and knowledge graphs for safe, verifiable AI that emphasizes secure and privacy-preserving mechanisms for user authentication and authorization within the knowledge layer, and ultimately ensuring all data processing by users is rooted in their&nbsp;consent.</p> About SingularityNET <p><a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a> was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel with the mission of creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI is not dependent on any central entity, is open to anyone and is not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country. The SingularityNET team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers. Our core platform and AI teams are further complemented by specialized teams devoted to application areas such as finance, robotics, biomedical AI, media, arts and entertainment.</p> About OriginTrail <p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> is an ecosystem building a Verifiable Internet for AI, providing an inclusive framework that tackles the world’s challenges in the AI era, such as hallucinations, bias, and model collapse, by ensuring the provenance and verifiability of data used by AI systems. OriginTrail is used by global leaders like the British Standards Institution, Swiss Federal Railways, Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN), representing over 40% of US imports and several consortia funded by the European Union among others. Advised by Turing award winner Dr. Bob Metcalfe, renowned for his law of network effects, the Trace Labs team (OriginTrail core developers) plays a crucial role in promoting a more inclusive, transparent, and decentralized AI.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/singularitynet-and-origintrail-advancing-decentralized-knowledge-graphs-5bd74f029801">SingularityNET and OriginTrail: Advancing Decentralized Knowledge Graphs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the 4th edition of CeramicWorld! Last month has been busy with new features and developments happening across the Ceramic ecosystem. Here’s a TL;DR for what has happened:</p>  Ceramic released an a new library for building points on Ceramic  Index is making strides in powering decentralized AI  Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is moving away from IPFS pubsub  Ceramic’s Data Feed API is here    A new library for building points on Ceramic has dropped 🔥 <p>Ceramic core team has just released the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ceramic-solutions/points?activeTab=versions&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">points library</a>, designed to facilitate developers in initiating experimentation with reputation systems on Ceramic and accelerating iteration. The points library serves various use cases, including implementing rewards for community engagement, incentivizing collaboration, or facilitating community quests and educational initiatives.</p><p>As an illustration of its functionality, the Points library has been integrated into the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Sandbox</a>. By following the steps outlined in the Sandbox, you can earn your first points, stored on Ceramic! 🔥</p><p>And that’s not all. In addition to the points library, there is also a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/demo/fullstack-app?ref=blog.ceramic.network">points demo application</a> that you can use as the basis of your own project. This example app showcases how the points library can be utilized to incentivize community members for their engagement, such as participation on key social platforms. To learn more, check out the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/web3-points-library-tutorial/">comprehensive tutorial</a>, and watch the accompanying video walkthrough:</p> <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/solutions-sdk/tree/main/libraries/points?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Start building with points library</a>   Powering Decentralized AI with Composable&nbsp;Data <p><a href="https://index.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index</a>, a composable discovery protocol, is revolutionizing web discovery by empowering users to curate personalized search engines, known as indexes, tailored to their specific needs.</p><p>Built on Ceramic's decentralized graph database, <a href="https://mirror.xyz/indexnetwork.eth/pETWkxZcN3OW0fUWohAo6vAh4IPqfnF6h5v9O-Pwi_k?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Index is driving decentralized AI</a>. It leverages a decentralized semantic index, utilizing ComposeDB, to enable semantic interoperability and a highly relational composition of use cases. By integrating AI-based discovery functions with Ceramic's decentralized network, Index ensures data integrity, privacy, and personalized discovery experiences across peers, mitigating privacy risks associated with centralized systems. This interconnected approach fosters a discovery experience where responses are both personalized and trusted, exemplified by a chat setup drawing from both community and private indexes.</p><p>Today, Index network is partnering with a number of projects in the ecosystem, including Ceramic, Lit Protocol, Fluence, Disco, Intuition Systems, Verax, and Olas Network, among others.</p><p>Just a few days ago Index team <a href="https://docs.index.network/docs/resources/libraries/langchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">announced the collaboration with LangChainAI</a> which enables developers to seamlessly build their composable semantic indexes with LangChain's suite of LLM pipelines. The new integration is supported in both Python and JavaScript.</p> <a href="https://index.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Explore the Index Network</a>   Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is moving away from IPFS pubsub<br><br>Earlier this month, the core Ceramic team shared an update regarding the work that has been done to enhance Ceramic network's reliability, scalability, and performance, particularly focusing on the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS). As the team is approaching the release of Ceramic’s Recon protocol, CAS is transitioning away from using IPFS pubsub to synchronize Streams in Ceramic. To facilitate this, a new HTTP-based mechanism has been developed for sharing Time Events from CAS to Ceramic nodes. This eliminates the dependency of newer Ceramic nodes on IPFS pubsub.<br><br>To ensure seamless data delivery and prevent potential data loss, it's crucial for all Ceramic nodes to be upgraded to at least v5.3. Learn more <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/upgrade-your-ceramic-node-to-v5-3-before-the-6th-of-may/1563?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.    New Ceramic features: SET Account Relations, Immutable Fields and shouldIndex flag<br><br>Earlier this month, a set of new features providing a sophisticated toolkit for data management, have been added to Ceramic. More specifically, you can now use the following tools to build your applications:<br>- <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/relations?ref=blog.ceramic.network#model-to-model">SET account relation</a>&nbsp;- enabling users to enforce a constraint where each user account (or DID) can create only one instance of a model for a specific record of another model.<br>- <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/data-modeling/schemas?ref=blog.ceramic.network#type-validation-directives">Immutable fields</a>&nbsp;- allow specific data to be prevented from being altered.<br>- <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/interact-with-data?ref=blog.ceramic.network#removerestore-record-from-index">shouldIndex flag</a>&nbsp;- gives developers an option to manage the data visibility by choosing which fields should be indexed.<br><br>Learn more about these features in a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/exploring-ceramics-new-features-set-account-relations-immutable-fields-and-should-index-flag/">written tutorial </a>and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2BRQqPI354&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">video walkthrough</a>.    Data Feed API is here!<br><br>Data Feed API is finally out. The new Data Feed API formalizes the underlying Ceramic event streaming protocol and allows developers to build data(base) products using raw event streams.<br><br>The release finalises the initial stage of implementation of Data Feed API with additional features and improvements coming in the near future.

<p>Face Verification Certification launched to bring confidence to ID ecosystem among rising online identity theft and bias concerns&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>May 29, 2024 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> announced today the launch of the first globally available certification program to test and certify the performance of remote biometric identity verification technology when verifying a user against a trusted identity document for accuracy, liveness, and bias. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a> program comes at a time of soaring demand for face biometric identity solutions and recognition of the importance of robust enrollment and identity re-binding processes to the overall security of online accounts. <a href="https://www.iproov.com/liveness-detection">Dynamic Liveness</a>, the science powering the <a href="https://www.iproov.com">iProov</a> Biometric Solution Suite’s Remote Onboarding Solution and Authentication Solution, is the first product to pass the rigorous certification testing.</p>



<p>The certification program, consisting of 10,000 tests at a minimum, assesses a biometric system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender. It measures resistance to spoof and deepfake attacks with Imposter Attack Presentation Accept Rate (IAPAR), and also assesses the usability and security of solutions by measuring False Reject and Accept Rates (FRR and FAR respectively). The certification also tests “selfie match” capabilities to ensure a user’s “selfie” matches their government-issued ID in the initial account setup process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combating bias and deepfake threats in biometric ID systems</p>



<p>Biometrics has <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Authenticate-2023-Barometer-Report.pdf">ranked top as global consumers’ preferred way to log in</a> and the method they think is most secure for the last two years. However, as governments and businesses globally roll out remote identity solutions, two urgent issues remain to address – bias in some biometric systems and new security threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations including NIST have been closely <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software">monitoring the disparities in performance for some time</a> – with NIST’s most recent <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_demographics.html">evaluation of solutions across different demographics</a> ​​released this year. The issue of bias is tightly linked to brand reputation too; new research from FIDO Alliance released today has found 50% of American and British consumers said they would lose trust in an organization if its biometric system was found to be biased, while 22% said they’d stop using a service entirely. Similarly, generative AI’s boom has also heightened security apprehensions about online verification; the same survey revealed over a third of consumers (37%) are more concerned about verifying themselves online due to the rising number of deepfakes. In ENISA’s latest remote ID report, researchers observed that while deepfake injection attacks are increasing and more sophisticated, deepfake presentation and injection attacks remain the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/remote-id-proofing-good-practices">top two biometric attack types most difficult to mitigate</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bringing trust to the ID ecosystem</p>



<p>Commenting on the news, Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CEO of the FIDO Alliance, said: “Remote identity solutions unlock huge benefits for governments, organizations, and consumers alike, but as appetite grows across the globe, there are understandable concerns mixed with excitement. Identity theft is rising, while bias in biometric systems has caused organizations to delay or reconsider implementations at a time when inclusivity and accessibility have never been more important.</p>



<p>“Certification unlocks the power of open standards and catalyzes ecosystem-wide innovation and opportunity. With iProov’s market-first certification for biometric face verification now completed, we look forward to serving additional providers who understand the value of independent, accredited lab testing. This new certification program provides a launchpad that enables all stakeholders to fast-track deployments that are robust enough for the modern threat landscape and work well for everyone, anywhere in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leading biometrics solutions provider, iProov, has become the first vendor to complete the rigorous certification process. iProov provides market-leading biometric solutions that protect the world’s most security-conscious organizations from deepfakes and other types of identity fraud. Andrew Bud, founder and CEO at iProov said: “Biometrics are a powerful tool that organizations can utilize to facilitate secure, inclusive, and user-friendly interactions online. Each of these three fundamental components must be given equal consideration as organizations evaluate their options. With the FIDO Face Verification Certification program, organizations now have a trusted compass for navigating these decisions. We applaud The FIDO Alliance for addressing the importance of biometric identity verification to strengthen the full user identity lifecycle. Independent certification creates a much-needed quality benchmark for this evolving technology and further demonstrates our ability to provide trusted identity assurance in an age of AI threats and identity fraud.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing requirements are built upon proven ISO standards and are developed by a diverse international authority of stakeholders, including industry, government, and independent subject matter experts. Participating vendors can benefit from identifying gaps in product performance and demonstrating clearly to the market their solutions can be trusted, which can reduce individual testing needs and boost adoption. Two independent labs are currently accredited to support this certification – <a href="https://ingeniumbiometrics.com/">Ingenium Biometrics</a> and <a href="https://www.tuvit.de/">TÜV Informationstechnik (TÜV NORD GROUP)</a> – with more expected to follow later this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program expands upon the Alliance’s existing <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">Biometric Component Certification</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/document-authenticity/">Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification</a> programs and demonstrates FIDO’s ongoing commitment to meet marketplace demand and address evolving threats with third-party certifications. Combined, these programs provide unrivaled end-to-end assurance to implementing organizations, consumers and vendors and support the world’s migration to more secure digital verification systems and passwordless security.</p>

<p>May 29, 2024 – The FIDO Alliance today released new design guidelines to help accelerate <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">passkey adoption</a> and deployment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Design Guidelines aim to help online service providers design a better, more consistent user experience (UX) when signing in with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guidelines are developed for designers, engineers, product managers, content strategists, and UX researchers to use for reference and guide their initial implementation of passkeys and expansion of passkey support over time.</p>



<p>The new guidelines are available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines">https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As organizations are increasingly deploying passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards around the world, the end users of passkeys – along with the practitioners implementing them – have become top priorities for successful adoption,” said Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CEO of The FIDO Alliance. “Our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/content-ebook-consumer-password-and-passkey-trends-wpd-2024/">research</a> shows consumers and employees are adopting phishing-resistant passkeys at a rapid pace while relying organizations are experiencing cost savings and fewer security incidents.&nbsp; By continuing our investment in the evolving user experience, the FIDO Alliance is committed to ensuring brands have a consistent and accessible set of guidelines that are fully aligned with design best practices and FIDO technology requirements. We encourage online service providers everywhere to use these publicly available guidelines to enhance the user experience and enjoy greater success with FIDO passkey deployment and adoption.”</p>



<p>Following the first release of FIDO UX guidelines for passkeys in 2022, the 2024 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-guidelines/">Design Guidelines</a> have been updated with optimization included for service providers evaluating and deploying passkeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2024 Design Guidelines are organized into five sections to provide clear guidance, confirm design principles, and offer flexibility:</p>



 
 User experience research: Provides confidence that the guidelines are informed by design research 



 Principles: 10 UX principles and 3 content principles for passkeys that are core to any passkey implementation 



 “Get started” design patterns: Patterns are the heart of the guidelines, containing self-contained experiences that can be combined to match unique business needs 



 Optional design patterns: Patterns that can be added after the “get started” patterns over time 



 Resources: Provides additional resources like events, Figma UI kits and community groups to jump-start work with passkeys 
 



<p>The FIDO UX Working Group created the guidelines and comprises 131 UX researchers, designers, and PMs from 31 global brands. The guidelines were created in partnership with usability research firm Blink UX – with added underwriting support from 1Password, Dashlane, Google, HID, Trusona, U.S. Bank, and Yubico.</p>

 How can we verify users are genuine in an online world? 



<p>Online identity theft has steadily risen in recent years, while the generative AI boom has driven a new wave of deepfake-powered attacks that threaten remote enrollment and identity security. Meanwhile, bias in biometric systems has been monitored for some time, varying significantly across solutions and impacting consumer trust and perception of the technology.</p>



<p>As the adoption of remote identity verification technology rises, two critical concerns and challenges need to be addressed: bias and new security threats.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance recently sponsored an independent study of 2,000 respondents across the U.S. and the U.K. to understand consumer perception towards remote identity verification, online security, and biometrics. This eBook reveals those insights on remote biometric face verification, including how many people have used biometric face recognition successfully, and their opinions on verification accuracy, potential discrimination, and concerns about deepfakes.</p>



 Key findings 



 
 Consumers want to use biometrics to verify themselves online more, especially in sensitive use cases like financial services – where one out of two people said they would use biometric technology (48%). 



 One in four feel they experience regular discrimination when using automated facial biometric systems (25%). 



 Equity in biometric systems is vital to trust – with half saying they would lose trust in a brand or institution (50%), with one out of five saying they’d stop using a service entirely if found to have a biased biometric system (22%). 



 Over half of respondents are concerned about deepfakes when verifying identities online (52%). 
 



<p>Read the full results of the survey in this eBook and learn about these consumers’ experiences with biometric face verification technologies, and discover how organizations can improve global digital access, authentication, and security when leveraging these remote identity verification technologies.</p>

 Greater agility, faster innovation, increased engagement Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Excuse us as we go full on bizniz mode for the rest of this post. We’re quite serious about the benefits of openness and have built our cooperative as well as our individual careers on the fact that Open Source is about more than just code. What follows is the “business case” for shifting your organisation to a more open model. We’ve borrowed liberally from the <a href="http://theopenorganization.org/">Open Organization community</a>, a group of people (including one of our members) who have written about the models and behaviours inside of FOSS for many&nbsp;years.</p><p>The evidence is clear: open working leads to greater agility, faster innovation, and increased engagement. Members of your organisation are more capable of working toward goals in unison and with shared vision. Ideas from both inside and outside the organisation receive more equitable consideration. Members clearly see connections between their particular activities and an organisation’s overarching values, mission, and&nbsp;spirit.</p><p>These advantages translate directly into better business performance and a stronger bottom line. If you want your organisation to obtain better results with the resources you currently have available, then embracing open working practices is one of your best paths toward sustainable success.</p><p>But don’t just take our word for&nbsp;it:</p>  Agility: According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization">McKinsey &amp; Company</a>, organisations that adopt information transparency across their operations can achieve up to 30% gains in efficiency and customer satisfaction.  Innovation: <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/12/how-open-innovation-can-help-you-cope-in-lean-times">Harvard Business Review</a> reports that companies that support open and collaborative working environments can see a speed increase of up to 30% in their innovation cycles.  Engagement: Research by <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-satisfaction.aspx">Gallup</a> reveals that highly engaged business units realise a 41% reduction in absenteeism, 17% increase in productivity, 10% higher customer ratings, see a 20% increase in sales, and are 21% more profitable.   5 Characteristics of an Open Organisation <p>Open Organisations are <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition">defined</a> as exhibiting the following characteristics:</p>Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Let’s explain what’s meant by each of&nbsp;these:</p> Transparency <p>This is fundamental to open organisations and involves everyone involved on a project to access all relevant materials by default. As a result, this means that team members are all able to review, assess, and contribute effectively to the work being done. Moreover, transparency means team members being not only informed about decisions and processes, but being encouraged to participate in discussions and provide feedback. Both successes and failures are discussed openly, meaning that valuable lessons can be learned, goals can be clarified, and roles well-defined. All of this enhances the overall organisational accountability.</p> Inclusivity <p>Open organisations actively welcome diverse viewpoints and ensure that everyone has a voice in the future of both the project, and organisation as a whole. This can be achieved not only through well-established technical channels but also through social norms that encourage a range of perspectives. It’s important that there are clear protocols for participation so as to promote an inclusive environment where feedback is valued. Leadership for inclusivity includes proactively including overlooked voices and ensuring that all relevant opinions are heard and considered. This approach enriches the decision-making process and also reinforces a sense of duty among employees to contribute meaningfully to discussions about their&nbsp;work.</p> Adaptability <p>The adaptability of open organisations is characterised by their flexibility and resilience, based on collective problem-solving and collaborative decision-making. To allow true adaptability, feedback mechanisms need to be accessible to both internal and external members. This allows for peer support and agency which can have clear impact on operational methods. This orientation towards continuous learning and the readiness to adapt based on feedback helps organisations avoid repetitive mistakes. It also helps them stay responsive to the changing needs of their environment.</p> Collaboration <p>In open organisations, collaboration is the default mode of operation. These is a general belief that working together produces superior outcomes, not only in project work, but also in terms of improving organisations. Ensuring a spirit of openness means that work is not only shared within the organisation but is also available for improvement by external parties, leading to greater innovation and continuous improvement. The ease with which people can discover, provide feedback on, and join ongoing work is a useful barometer for how different, welcoming, and collaborative open organisations are compared to&nbsp;others.</p> Community <p>The community aspect of open organisations is based on shared values and principles that guide participation and decision-making. These values should be clear to all members and help define the organisation’s boundaries and success criteria. Team members within this community approach are empowered to make significant contributions based on a common ‘language’ to prevent miscommunication. Sharing knowledge and experiences is encouraged to further the group’s work, which strengthens the communal bond and ensuring collective progress towards organisational goals.</p><p>As you can see, these characteristics are interconnected and intertwined, leading to a virtuous cycle of openness.</p> Practical Steps Towards&nbsp;Openness Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Ultimately, working openly is about cultural change. A change in attitude as much as a change in processes.</p><p>To transition to more open working practices, consider the following steps:</p>  Clear guidelines: Work together to document and share clear guidelines on what open working could look like in your organisation. This includes how information is shared, how feedback is given and received, and how decisions are&nbsp;made.  Culture of transparency: Encourage leaders and team members to share their work and the reasoning behind their decisions openly. This can be facilitated through regular meetings, shared digital workspaces, and open forums where ideas and projects are discussed transparently.  Inclusive communication: Ensure that all team members have equal access to communication tools and platforms. Use a variety of channels to accommodate different working styles and preferences, and encourage everyone to contribute to discussions and decision-making processes.  Collaboration across boundaries: Use technology and collaborative tools to break down silos within your organisation. Encourage teams to work together across departments and even invite external partners or customers to contribute to projects where appropriate.  Community engagement: Create spaces (physical/virtual/hybrid) where employees can interact, share ideas, and support each other. Regular community-building activities and team-building exercises can strengthen the communal bonds and enhance the shared sense of&nbsp;purpose.   Addressing Potential Challenges Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>While transitioning to an open working environment offers many benefits, it also comes with challenges that need to be managed. For example, information overload can be avoided by sharing information in a structured and digestible way so as not to overwhelm team members. Try using tools that allow for information to be categorised and easily searched.</p><p>While transparency is to be encouraged, clearly define sensitive information to ensure that robust security practices are in place to protect it. Provide training to team members around data protection standards and the importance of respective privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>While open working encourages broader participation, this needs to be balanced with the need for efficiency. So set clear objectives and deadlines for collaborative projects to avoid decision-making bottlenecks or&nbsp;delays.</p><p>Some team members may resist changes to traditional ways of working. Overcome such cultural resistance by demonstrating the tangible benefits of open working practices through pilot projects and sharing success stories. Provide training and mentoring to help adaptation to the new ways of doing&nbsp;things.</p> Conclusion Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>The shift towards working openly and transparently is a strategic move that can significantly enhance an organisation’s agility, innovation, and engagement.

<p>IDunion SCE, the neutral and democratically organised European cooperative created from the IDunion research consortium, has been offering their managed network infrastructure for industrial and productive use since April 2024.</p>

<p>As a neutral basic infrastructure, the distributed and redundant network enables every company to independently store and manage identity information and all types of company-related data. Companies can store unique and distinctive company identity-related identifiers (DID – Decentralised Identifier) on the IDunion network, which are permanent, unchangeable and verifiable and do not require the use of a central register. The identifiers can be linked to user-defined company data or company attributes. All company data can be managed according to predefined parameters and can of course also be revoked. IDunion SCE makes the identifiers available to companies as required and assigns corresponding write authorisations for network use on an individual contractual basis.</p>

<p>The network is based on the open source software Hyperledger Indy. All network nodes are operated exclusively by cooperative members in accordance with the principles of the IDunion SCE and monitored by the latter as a neutral body. The IDunion SCE and the infrastructures it manages and supports are subject to the principles of openness, neutrality, sovereignty, transparency, integrity and cooperative competition. All members of the cooperative have the same voting rights, regardless of their company size. This ensures that all participating companies can have an equal influence on the technical and organised development of the IDunion SCE and thus the ecosystem. Companies can join the European co-operative as members at any time.</p>

<p>Visa has introduced <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> to the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkey-use-case/payments/">payment industry</a>, enabling customers to authorize online purchases <a href="https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2024/05/14/the-key-to-1715698035525.html?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=VisaPaymentPasskey&amp;utm_id=VPF&amp;linkId=431538864">through a biometric scan</a> on their smartphones or computers when making a purchase online.</p>



<p>This capability is powered by the Visa Payment Passkey Service, which is built on Visa’s Fast Identity Online (FIDO) server. The service allows merchants to integrate the Visa Payment Passkey Service into their checkout systems without needing to establish their own servers, thereby simplifying the setup process.</p>



<p>For users, this means they can use the same biometric authentication methods they use to unlock their devices to approve Visa payments online, with a one-time enrollment required during checkout. Visa also plans to extend enrollment options to banking apps in the future.</p>



<p>The development of passkeys was a collaborative effort among major technology companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft, which joined forces around 2012 to form the FIDO Alliance. This group aimed to overcome the limitations of traditional passwords by creating <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-overview/">open standards</a> for more robust authentication, involving biometric experts like HYPR and Nok Nok Labs.</p>



<p>FIDO released its first standards in 2014, setting the stage for authentication methods that do not depend on passwords. Subsequent advancements led to the establishment of the WebAuthn standard in 2019, which quickly gained acceptance among major web browsers. This progress facilitated the creation of passkeys, leveraging FIDO protocols to link authentication credentials to users’ mobile <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">biometrics</a>.</p>



<p>Visa’s recent move has been welcomed by supporters of FIDO and passkeys. HYPR’s co-founder and CEO, Bojan Simic, commented on this development, stating that nearly every regulated business he has interacted with in the past year has included a passkey initiative in their plans in an online post. “I’m so proud of the work that we have all done at the FIDO Alliance to make this a reality. When we wrote the first FIDO implementation in 2014 here at HYPR, seeing the top brands adopt the standard in a major way seemed like fantasy.”</p>



<p>In making this vision a reality, Visa joins several other prominent companies that have recently introduced support for passkeys, including PayPal, Samsung, and Amazon.</p>

<p>Spring conference season is in full swing and the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) is heading to Europe to participate in several major conferences:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) </a>— June 4-7, Berlin, Germany 



 <a href="https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/identity-week/">Identity Week Europe </a>— June 11-12, Amsterdam, Netherlands 



 <a href="https://diceurope.org/">Digital Identity unConference Europe (DICE</a>) — June 18-20, Zurich, Switzerland.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>We will also be attending the second regional summit of the <a href="https://sidi-hub.community/about-sidi/">Sustainable &amp; Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI)</a> Summit 2024 series.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP, which celebrates its fourth birthday this month, has long been known for its dual stack that emphasizes why we must combine technical interoperability with governance interoperability in order to establish truly interoperable digital trust ecosystems.</p>







<p>Although in our early history we were best known for our work on the governance side of the dual stack, at these June conferences our emphasis will be on two new technical specifications for which we just published Implementers Drafts: the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/11/toip-announces-the-first-implementers-draft-of-the-trust-spanning-protocol-specification/">Trust Spanning Protocol</a> and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/03/toip-announces-the-implementers-draft-of-thetrust-registry-protocol-specification-v2-0/">Trust Registries Protocol</a>. Both of these protocols are designed to maximize interoperability and authenticity and minimize risk, while still enabling each ecosystem to make the choices they need for their specific context.</p>



<p>The following is a schedule of all the conference sessions and talks in which ToIP members or our partners will be participating.</p>



 



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join us at EIC for a panel of ToIP Steering Committee Members, moderated by Executive Director, Judith Fleenor.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5643/1">Panel: The Emerging Trust Layer for the Internet: Using Minimum Viable Protocols to Achieve Maximum Interoperability</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 13:30—14:30</p>



<p>Interoperability is not created alone and that is why ToIP collaborates with other standards organizations and certifications bodies.&nbsp; Executive Director, Judith Fleenor has invited the Executive Directors from <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">Open Identity Exchange</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> to unpack the role each foundation plays, how we collaborate to create the full picture for digital trust, and why it is so important for organizations and individuals to support and participate in several foundations, not just one.</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5709/1">Panel: Executive Directors Speak: Why We Need More Collaboration</a> 



<p>Friday, June 07, 2024 14:30—15:30</p>



<p>At last year’s EIC Judith gave a keynote on <a href="https://youtu.be/Hhv5-xbcmkw">Decentralized Identity Why is it all the rage?</a>&nbsp; Her premise was that the technologies that enable decentralized identity could be used, not only for traditional identity and access management, but more importantly for content authenticity and to assist in the challenges that AI brings.&nbsp; This year, Al will be a big topic at EIC, and several ToIP Steering Committee members will be addressing these topics in various sessions throughout the week.</p>



<p>On Wednesday Wenjing Chu, Futurewei Technologies and Drummond Reed, Gen Digital will be on the panel:</p>



 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a> 



<p>Wednesday, June 05, 2024 12:00—13:00</p>



<p>Following that Wenjing Chu will be giving the session:</p>

  You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android. But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s.

<p>You’re reading this on a machine with an operating system: Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, or Android.</p>
<p>But that’s not your OS. It’s your machine’s.</p>
<p>How about one for you, that runs on your machine but is entirely yours? Let’s call it a Personal OS, or a POS.</p>
<p>The POS will have a kernel onto which abilities (not just applications) can be added. An extreme example of how this might work is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94">Neo learning ju jitsu</a> in The Matrix:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GftSkyUsA94"></a></p>
<p>That OS amplified&nbsp;Neo’s own intelligence, in his own head. We’re far from that today. But we can at least add abilities to a POS of our own. Those too can give us more agency of many kinds.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there is only one POS so far. It’s called <a href="https://paios.org/">pAI-OS</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pAI-OS/paios">Github code</a>), and it’s led by <a href="https://kwaai.ai">Kwaai</a>.* To my knowledge, pAI-OS is the first and only truly personal operating system. (If others do the same, let me know and I’ll talk those up too.) And it is built to run our own AIs. Let’s call them PAIs, where the A can mean amplified or augmented (<a href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/">sourcing Doug Englebart</a> for the latter).</p>
<p>So, what kind of abilities are we talking about?</p>
<p>Let’s start with something that could hardly be more mundane and important: memory.</p>
<p>In Laws of Media, Marshall McLuhan said (five decades ago) that computing promises “perfect memory—total and exact.” For many millennia, our species has been outboarding memory through speech, the written word, and collecting all of that in libraries and museums. And now, in the digital age that dawned with microcircuits and the Internet, we now occupy a <a href="https://www.digitallife.center/index.php/digital-life">digital world</a> where everybody can publish whatever they want. To peruse that, we made search engines. Those ruled from the late ’90s until approximately yesterday, when AIs took over servicing our interest in answers to questions. Google, Microsoft, ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, and others have moved into a space we might call AI answerware.</p>
<p>Running all that answerware are corporate AIs. Lets call them CAIs. Nothing wrong with CAIs, but also nothing personal, because they are not ours. I explain the difference in <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/10/personal-vs-personalized/">Personal vs. Personalized AI</a>. Here’s a graphic from that post showing a bit of what abilities might run on your PAI:</p>
<p></p>
<p>PAIs can extend our own memories by accumulating personal stuff we need to know better, and our ability to meet, access, and use the external abilities of the CAI world. So we’ll have our agents + their agents, working together.</p>
<p>For an example of how that might work, take a look at <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2022/10/11/p7012/">The most important standard in development today</a>: <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">P7012:&nbsp;Standard for Machine Readable Personal Privacy Terms</a>, which “identifies/addresses the manner in which personal privacy terms are proffered and how they can be read and agreed to by machines.” After seven years with a working group, it is now in the IEEE editing and approval mill, edging toward becoming a finished standard by next year. It works like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here your agent (a PAI, represented by the ⊂ symbol) proffers your privacy terms (<a href="https://customercommons.org/solutions/tools/terms/p2b1/">here is one example</a>) to a corporate agent (which might or might not be a CAI, but is still represented with the reciprocal symbol ⊃. (This should be familiar to ProjectVRM veterans as the <a href="https://projectvrm.org/category/r-button/">r-button</a>. We may finally get to use it!)</p>
<p>The ceremony here is the exact reverse of what we have today with the cookie popovers on most website home pages. This can and should be done ⊂ to ⊃. So should signing and recording the agreement, or the choice of the site, should it tell you to screw off. (An agent running on your PAI will record that diss.)</p>
<p>I also bring this up because it will be a key required ability—not just for you and me but for the world, starting with Europe, where <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/">the GDPR lists six lawful bases for processing personal data</a>. They begin—</p>
<blockquote><p>(a) Consent: the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose.<br>
(b) Contract: the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract.</p></blockquote>
<p>By now everyone knows that (a) Consent has failed. It’s an expensive and meaningless dance, with high cognitive (mostly cynical) overhead, and almost no accountability. Now they’re ready for (b) Contract, especially in ceremonies where the individual (not a mere “user”) takes the lead.</p>
<p>I believe there is less limit to what each of us can do with a PAI than there is to what we can do with a laptop or a phone. Because our PAI is our own. It runs on a deeper machine OS, but is not limited by that. Your PAI, running on your POS, may prove to be the first truly personal layer ever put on a machine OS.</p>
 
<p>*Full disclosure: I am now the <a href="https://www.kwaai.ai/about">Chief Intention Officer</a> there. At this stage, it’s a voluntary position.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>Digital ID has been increasingly in the news lately, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/27632/&amp;sid=0017">Australia</a>&nbsp;begins to ramp up its systems pilots development following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196986150773792768/">the passing of legislation</a>. In Aotearoa there’s been<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202405/nz-cabinet-minister-champions-digital-id-in-government-transformation-at-data-summit?utm_source=MarketingList&amp;utm_campaign=dc16ec863f-Top+Reads+17-05-202417%2F5%2F24+11%3A59+AM&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_3ab9d4375a-dc16ec863f-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">&nbsp;a lot happening too</a>&nbsp;as Minister Collins opened<a href="https://nzgovdata.co/">&nbsp;this year’s Summit</a>&nbsp;where DINZ was on stage later.</p>



<p>Contained within the avalanche of consultations posted in March and early April, was the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DISTF-Rules-Draft-April-2024.pdf">second revision of the rules</a>&nbsp;that support NZ’s own<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2023/0013/latest/LMS459583.html">&nbsp;Digital Identity Trust Framework (DISTF) Act</a>. The Department of Internal Affairs(DIA) presented to a packed virtual lunchtime audience on it earlier this month. Digital Identity NZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/dinz-distf-working-group/">DISTF Working Group</a>, comprising both private and public sector participants,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Response-DISTF-Rules-submission-May-2024.pdf">responded in detail</a>, reflecting the overall message that, despite good intentions to improve security, data protection, and privacy to reduce online fraud, there are alot of moving parts for stakeholders to consider. The fact that it is ‘opt-in’ for stakeholders and that alternative/non-digital channels should always be offered to people and organisations because it is not compulsory, should help provide time to become comfortable and confident with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;made a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Submission-Biometrics-Code-Exposure-Draft-May-2024.pdf">deeply considered submission</a>&nbsp;on the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s (OPC)<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/news/consultations/biometrics">&nbsp;exposure draft of a Code of Practice for biometrics under the Privacy Act 2020</a>. We continue to assert that a code is premature with potential for unintended consequences, whereas well drafted, clear guidance at the outset will deliver better outcomes for all New Zealanders. As if the above two were not enough, the<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html">&nbsp;CDR/CPD bill&nbsp;</a>is set to be introduced to Parliament, which also has a critical digital identity component.</p>



<p>Since the CPD and the Biometrics Code (should it be implemented) are mandatory for specific digital ID service providers undertaking particular identity-related processes, whereas the DISTF is opt-in, I sense that the weight of regulatory burden will result in tough choices for the industry in this small market, despite the good intentions of all stakeholders. In my view, we’ll have to be conscious of the potential for market stall. Could the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2024/0044/latest/whole.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=5e09a5a86b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">CDR/CPD bill</a>&nbsp;help unify our data and streamline our sector and service laws to better suit our market size?</p>



<p>Meanwhile, sectors continue to analyse the role of digital identity and the potential to operate schemes within the DISTF, with financial services leading the way. This is demonstrated so clearly by the&nbsp;<a href="https://comcom.govt.nz/about-us/our-role/competition-studies/market-study-into-personal-banking-services?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=8c96051db1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_03_18_11_43_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-5d57a7a812-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D#projecttab">Commerce Commission’s consultation on personal banking</a>, which highlights the importance of robust digital identification for frictionless bank-switching and faster progress towards Open Banking.</p>



<p>With the above very much in mind,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7194476205281087488/">Payments NZ and DINZ co-hosted a highly productive investigative sprint earlier this month</a>&nbsp;across its combined membership. We brought together experts, representatives from the private, public and NGO sectors, and heard inspiring presentations from Australia’s&nbsp;<a href="https://connectid.com.au/">ConnectID</a>&nbsp;and our very own<a href="https://mattr.global/">&nbsp;MATTR</a>.</p>



<p>The research and education sector have been deeply engaged with digital identity for many years and continue to lead on many fronts. Learn more at our lunchtime webinar on Thursday 13 June simply titled ‘<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-higher-education-aotearoa/">Digital Identity, Higher Education, Aotearoa</a>’, when DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.themiddlewaregroup.com/">Middleware</a>&nbsp;showcases fellow DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university.html">University of Auckland</a>.</p>



<p>The following week, DINZ and FinTechNZ members with a general understanding of ‘digital cash’ should diary note 20 June for a ‘town hall’ styled dynamic submission with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/news/2024/04/consultation-opens-on-a-digital-currency-for-new-zealand#:~:text=The%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand%20%2D%20Te%20P%C5%ABtea%20Matua%20is,coins%20will%20still%20be%20available.">criticalities (including digital ID) surrounding ‘digital cash</a>’ – a Central Bank Digital Currency as a potential alternative to physical cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DINZ and FinTechNZ members who are familiar with ‘digital cash’ should watch for details about a town hall meeting on Thursday, June 20, with The Reserve Bank of New Zealand – Te Pūtea Matua, discussing a potential Central Bank Digital Currency as an alternative to physical cash. The meeting will cover important topics such as digital ID.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, the Ceramic network was meant to be an open and customizable platform for developers to build on. The core Ceramic team is excited to keep delivering on that promise and launch Ceramic’s new Data Feed API.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/networking/data-feed-api?ref=blog.ceramic.network">The Data Feed</a> provides a new API for Ceramic that allows developers to receive notifications of updates to JSON documents that are managed via Ceramic. This feed of document updates allows developers to customize the way their data is indexed and queried, and enables the development of new custom database products on top of Ceramic. Databases built on top of the Data Feed API get the advantage of powerful querying capabilities custom-tailored to the needs of the application, while retaining interoperability and composability of the underlying data with all other databases built on the Data Feed API throughout the Ceramic ecosystem.</p> What is the Data Feed API <p>The Data Feed API enables developers to keep track of all the new state changes happening to documents in the Ceramic network, as they are observed on a Ceramic node. These state updates can either be from writes sent to the Ceramic node through the HTTP Client, or writes discovered from the network for Streams belonging to Models that are indexed on the Ceramic node. Ultimately, the Data Feed API can be used to build custom indexers and other database products, e.g., <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">OrbisDB</a>.</p> Supported API Methods <p>The Data Feed is a read-only API, allowing you to retrieve the feed data through HTTP GET methods. The Data Feed operates on the aggregated state of documents (such as Models and ModelInstanceDocuments), abstracting away the lower-level concerns of the underlying event streaming system. This allows developers to build with familiar JSON documents while taking advantage of automatic application of updates to document state with built-in schema validation.</p><p>Feed data can be accessed via a new HTTP endpoint on the js-ceramic node with the URL path <code>api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code>. The feed utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push messages with the following schema:</p> <code>FeedDocument = {
  resumeToken: string
  commitId: CommitID
  content: any
  metadata: StreamMetadata
  eventType: EventType
}
</code> <p>So for example, the following request:</p><p><code>curl http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents</code> </p><p>will return the following response:</p> <code>data: {
  "resumeToken": "1714742204565000000"
  "commitId": "k6zn3t2py84tn1dpy24625xjv65g4r23wuqpch6mmrywshreivaqiyaqctrz2ba5kk0qjvec61pbmyl15b49zxfd8qd3aiiupltnpveh45oiranqr4njj40",
  "content": "{...}",
  "metadata": {
    "controllers": [
      "did:key:z6MknE3RuK7XU2W1KGCQrsSVhzRwCUJ9uMb6ugwbELm9JdP6"
    ],
    "model": "kh4q0ozorrgaq2mezktnrmdwleo1d"
  },
  "eventType": 2
}
</code> <p>The Data Feed API can also be consumed through event listeners to continuously pull and process events from the feed. For example:</p> <code>import { EventSource&nbsp; } from "cross-eventsource";
import { JsonAsString, AggregationDocument } from '@ceramicnetwork/codecs';
import { decode } from "codeco";

const source = new EventSource('&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;')
const Codec = JsonAsString.pipe(AggregationDocument)

source.addEventListener('message', (event) =&gt; {
	console.log('message', event)
	//use JsonAsString, and AggregationDocument to decode and use event.data
	const parsedData = decode(Codec, event.data);
	console.log('parsed', parsedData)
})

source.addEventListener('error', error =&gt; {
	console.log('error', error)
})

console.log('listening...')
</code>  Resumability <p>The Data Feed API also comes with a resumability feature that provides “at least once” delivery semantics. Resumability is the ability for a consumer of the feed to pick up “where it left off” after downtime. Without resumability, an indexer that goes down has no way of receiving and indexing data that was propagated while the indexer was offline. The goal of resumability is to ensure that a consumer of the Data Feed API can be guaranteed to receive the most recent data for each Stream at least once, even in the event of failure.</p><p>Resumability in Data Feed API is enabled by the <code>resumeToken</code> property, which is added to every object emitted by the Data Feed API. This property enables you to initiate a connection and ask for the entries starting immediately after <code>resumeToken</code>.</p><p>For example, let’s say your application got an entry containing <code>resumeToken: "1714742204565000000"</code> . When connecting, you can pass the token value as a query parameter, as follows:</p> <code>// ... same as a code snipped above
const url = new URL("&lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents&gt;")
url.searchParams.set('after', '1714742204565000000') // Value of the last resumeToken
// Connection to &lt;http://localhost:7007/api/v0/feed/aggregation/documents?after=1714742204565000000&gt;

		<p>Slalom and New Jersey Institute of Technology Launch “Sophie”–A Prototype Digital Student Concierge</p>
<p>NEWARK, NJ, May 22, 2024 – The EdgeCon conference series continues to solidify its place as a destination event for higher education decision makers, with EdgeCon Spring garnering the event’s highest-ever attendance rate and attendee satisfaction rate. Edge members and vendors are taking note, and choosing the event as a key venue for innovative announcements.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en">Slalom</a> and longtime Edge member, <a href="https://www.njit.edu/">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> (NJIT), chose EdgeCon as their venue to officially debut a prototype AI Student Success Tool to attendees.</p>
<p>EdgeCon served as the ideal environment for the debut, given the prevalence of higher education membership in attendance, as well as the timely discussions of how AI is transforming higher education. Currently being referred to in development as Sophie, the AI tool is called the NJIT Digital Student Advisor, and is a prototype “digital student concierge”. Sophie was built using Soul Machines technology, with chat capabilities provided by GPT 3.5, and hosted in Microsoft Azure. The prototype was designed to work on any cloud platform with a native LLM integration (AWS, Google, etc.).</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>“Launching the prototype for our digital student advisor ‘Sophie’ in partnership with NJIT is just the beginning of a transformative journey for higher education in New Jersey. As we embark on a journey to humanize the future of AI, we’re not just shaping technology, we’re shaping the future of education itself, unlocking limitless possibilities for personalized learning and student success.”&nbsp;</p>
 — Stephen Walsh<br>
Senior Director – Public &amp; Social Impact<br>
Slalom 
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>In this prototype stage, Sophie was programmed to address a specific use case regarding a student interested in switching majors. The Q&amp;A format shown in the demo was developed around typical questions a student may ask when switching majors or attending NJIT for the first time. Further development will focus on additional use cases to support students in their journey when accessing academic or social services at NJIT. The overall purpose is to create and improve upon a digital humanizing experience for students and faculty – one that is both informative and supportive.</p>
<p>Ed Wozencroft, Vice President for Digital Strategy and Chief Digital Officer, Vice President Digital Strategy CIO, NJIT, shared, “NJIT’s Artificial Intelligence Initiative seeks to embed AI in all facets of our university–from teaching and learning; to research and innovation; our operations and infrastructure – all while remaining human-centered. Undoubtedly AI is here to stay, and higher education must adapt to succeed. With great partners like Slalom, we can quickly develop and deploy great tools and services that change the nature of education and improve the value proposition of investing in a now highly personalized higher education.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the prototype is in its early stages, NJIT is currently in development discussions with Slalom to determine the next phases and potential release dates. Stay tuned for launch dates and availability.</p>
<p>Slalom’s professional services are available for procurement by the higher education and public sector communities via Edge’s cooperative pricing system, EdgeMarket. To learn more about EdgeMarket, visit https://edgemarket.njedge.net/home.</p>

<p>Traditionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager">passwords</a>&nbsp;have served as the primary means of securing digital identities, yet their limitations are becoming increasingly evident. To pave the way for a passwordless future, accessibility is paramount. Any alternative authentication method must be inclusive, catering to users across diverse technological environments. Whether it’s the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-business-smartphone">smartphone</a>&nbsp;or a dated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing/pc/10-of-the-best-desktop-pcs-of-2015-1304391">desktop</a>, the authentication process should seamlessly adapt. For example, solutions like the FIDO Alliance’s Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard aim to bridge this accessibility gap, enabling passwordless logins across a spectrum of devices and platforms.</p>

<p>A deep dive on Smartflow by Energy&nbsp;Web</p><p><a href="http://smartflow.org">Smartflow</a> enables enterprises to configure worker nodes — a new technology developed by Energy Web. These nodes comprise distributed computing networks that securely execute sensitive business operations impacting multiple companies. Worker nodes themselves are decentralized nodes controlled by companies or individuals who have staked Energy Web tokens in order to become trusted worker node operators. All nodes are anchored to the Energy Web X parachain, itself a Parachain on the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>This technology was originally developed to solve a paradox that hinders advanced renewable energy tracking solutions like renewable matching and green electric vehicle charging: credibility relies on accurate, publicly verifiable results (e.g., proof that digital representations of renewables are not double-counted). But inputs from separate organizations, such as granular renewable energy production and electricity demand data, are commercially sensitive and need to remain private. Complex commercial, legal, and technical requirements often make it challenging for a single actor to unilaterally access and process all requisite data. The ability to establish a shared source of truth from segregated, individual information sources has been an ongoing challenge in multilateral settings; the challenge is even greater for energy market participants seeking to exchange and process granular data in order to procure services from distributed energy resources.</p><p>Smartflow solves these challenges by enabling enterprises to configure, launch, and maintain distributed computing networks that ingest data from external sources, execute custom workflows based on business logic, and vote on results in order to establish consensus and trustworthy results without revealing or modifying the underlying data. Worker Nodes apply proven and tested concepts and components from blockchain technology in a novel, enterprise-friendly architecture to provide all stakeholders with cryptographic proof that mutually-agreed rules and and processes are followed correctly, ensure computational outputs from business processes are correct, trustworthy, and preserve the privacy and integrity of underlying data for auditing purposes.</p><p>In addition to Smartflow being used as a generic configuration tool for any enterprise by Energy Web customers, the following are examples of existing worker node networks configured using Smartflow:</p>  <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/maritime-book-and-claim-system-advances-pilot-study-to-support-first-movers-in-zero-emissions-shipping/">Worker nodes supporting the Maritime Shipping registry</a> supported by the Maersk McKinney Moller center for Zero Carbon&nbsp;Shipping  Worker nodes are also supporting a recently released solution for green electric vehicle charging on Energy Web X, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/introducing-autogreencharge-by-energy-web-a-decentralized-application-for-decarbonizing-electric-995436e8fea8">Autogreencharge</a>  A network of nodes powering the <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">Sustainable Aviation Fuel registry</a> in partnership with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers&nbsp;Alliance  A network of worker nodes is currently powering the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-releases-digital-spine-toolkit-to-the-public-e65847d468dd">Digital Spine solution</a> supporting multiple grid decarbonization projects  <p>How Smartflow and Worker Nodes Work: Worker nodes can be implemented in any development framework, including node.js, python, and rust. Each worker node is programmed to execute a specific conditional logic workflow based on a predefined dataset (i.e. source and schema) and event trigger (e.g. a regular time interval, or a specific external event). Workers are given read-only access to one or more external data sources via API or message broker. When the workflow “event” is triggered, the workers initiate a round of calculation and voting (worker nodes can be configured to either poll an external data source at regular intervals, or “listen” to an external source for a specific trigger).</p><p>In the calculation step, each worker node independently executes the same conditional logic based on the data it received during the trigger. Then, each worker submits its results (i.e. output of the logic workflow) to the smart contract, which collates the worker nodes’ votes into a unique voting round and keeps track of each round to maintain continuity. The smart contract defines a voting threshold (typically a simple majority, such as 2 of 3, or 4 of 7, etc.) that must be reached in order to establish consensus on the results of each voting round. Each voting round is defined by a voting ID, the number of unique votes (from worker nodes), and a consensus result. If the threshold is reached (i.e. a majority of nodes independently reach the same conclusion and submit identical results to the vote), then the voting round is closed and the result is hashed on the Energy Web X Parachain; this creates a connected tree of results that can be queried and validated for auditing purposes. If consensus is not reached in the voting round, the entire process from event trigger through voting is repeated; if a second round fails, a custom workflow is executed (this can include alerts, failover to other nodes, or acceptance of results from a plurality of workers).</p><p>In addition to collating the voting results, the smart contract is configured to issue rewards for workers in the pool based on performance criteria. A base reward can be issued simply for workers being available in the pool, and additional rewards can be issued based on metrics such as consistency (i.e. availability for all voting rounds), accuracy (i.e. being part of the winning consensus), and speed (i.e. being fastest to submit voting results following the event trigger). Workers presenting faulty results are penalized, so the only profitable strategy for a worker is to provide honest, accurate results. This mechanism ensures that the outcome of the process, the consensus reached, can be trusted by everyone, even without knowing all the input&nbsp;data.</p><p>This entire process is now abstracted away via Smartflow which enables enterprises to configure their own Worker Node networks in a no-code environment. Please see <a href="http://www.smartflow.org">smartflow.org</a> for additional information.</p><p>The infographics below summarize the value proposition of Smartflow. The first graphic shows how solutions are typically configured by enterprises without Smartflow before showing what the new process can be leveraging worker nodes and Smartflow.</p><p>Without Smartflow:</p><p>With Smartflow:</p><p>Industry testimonials:</p><p>“As long-time Energy Web supporters, we are excited by the decentralized approach to multi-party computation provided by SmartFlow. It is a digital tool that provides a new kind of trust layer in business relations based on shared information. We are eager to discover how it can be integrated into our processes, and what kind of value it can create,” said Etienne Gehain, New Digital Solutions Director at&nbsp;Engie.</p><p>“Energy Web’s collaboration with Deutsche Telekom shows that Web 3 technology can be an important tool in the fight against climate change,” says Dirk Röder, Head of Deutsche Telekom’s Blockchain Solutions Center. “Deutsche Telekom is not only securing the energy grid, but also accelerating progress towards climate targets while promoting renewable energies.”</p><p>On Smartflow’s embedded self-sovereign identity solution: “To ensure network security and stability, the integration of renewable energy sources into our energy systems will require household and industrial flexibility to be activated. SSI will be an important tool for creating a registry of decentralised and flexible assets that will allow us to monitor the state of the network and steer these decentralised assets.” Kris Laermans, Innovation at Elia&nbsp;Group</p><p>Jasper Verwaal, Digital Assets Manager at Deloitte recently provided the following insights on Energy Web X’s architecture, solutions, and worker nodes: “The architecture Energy Web has already built around asset management, exchanging data, and green proofs…can be seen as public infrastructure. The more standardization that’s in place, the easier it is to adopt common methodologies.” He continued, “Many enterprises find it challenging to put data on-chain. But we hope that Energy Web X will contribute to making it easier to decide what data lives on-chain and what data off-chain.”</p><p>Sahas Katta, CEO at Smartcar, the leading connected car API platform and Autogreencharge partner, said “This partnership will empower EV drivers with the knowledge and confidence to maximize the sustainability of their EV charging experience. With Smartcar, Energy Web can seamlessly integrate across diverse vehicle brands, giving more EV drivers access to accurate insights into charging transparency and renewable energy options,” in reference to the new Autogreencharge solution powered by Smartflow, worker nodes, and Energy Web&nbsp;X.</p><p>Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at the clean energy nonprofit <a href="http://www.rmi.org/">RMI</a> commenting on the SAFc registry deployed on Energy Web X supported by worker nodes, “The SAFc Registry is the culmination of RMI’s ongoing work to catalyze the sustainable aviation fuel market. By creating a throughline from corporate consumers to fuel producers, we can expand investment in SAF infrastructure and increase supply of low-carbon fuels. Voluntary uptake is critical to scaling a burgeoning market, and we hope this registry can serve as an example for other sectors in the&nbsp;future.”</p><p>Frederik Jacobsen, project manager at the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping commenting on the Maritime registry on Energy Web X supported by Smartflow worker nodes: “The collaboration with ZEMBA further strengthens the development of a global Maritime Book and Claim System and underlines how important such a system will be to overcome obstacles to accelerate the adoption of low-emissions fuels at&nbsp;scale.”</p><p>“We’re very interested in driving trust and transparency across the supply chain, which is why we’re so excited to join the Energy Web ecosystem,” said Thatcher Young, CEO of CarbonEnfo. “In addition to supporting the public blockchain, we see tremendous value in leveraging the Energy Web technology stack to advance our own application development.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/case-study-smartflow-3215f32ed2f5">Case Study: Smartflow</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Azusa Kawakami, Nikkei staff writer | April 23, 2024&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p>【ニューヨーク=川上梓】ホンダや日産自動車、米フォード・モーターなど日米企業120社で構成する企業連合が、電気自動車（EV）電池に関するデータの活用で欧州発の企業連合と連携する。電池の材料やリサイクルにつながる情報を相互に安全に共有・運用できるインフラを企業主体でつくり、EVの普及につなげる。</p>
<p>ホンダや日産、米自動車大手「ビッグ3」、IT（情報技術）企業など120社でEV電池の情報をデジタル上で管理する国際規格づくりを進めている「モビリティ・オープン・ブロックチェーン・イニシアチブ（MOBI）」が、欧州発の企業連合「GAIA-X（ガイアエックス）」と組む。</p>
<p>ガイアエックスは欧州で企業間のデータ連携を推進している。日米中心の企業連合のMOBIと、欧州のガイアエックスが組むことで、日本、米国、欧州の3地域の企業間で、電池の材料や劣化状態、充放電などの情報を相互に共有し、運用できるようにする。</p>
<p>具体的には、暗号技術を使って機密性を保ったうえで企業がデータを記録・管理できる「ブロックチェーン（分散型台帳）」の技術を使う。今後、両者で実証を始める。</p>
<p>相互運用が進めば、企業は利用できるデータの数や範囲が増え、サービスの低コスト化につながる。電池の劣化状態が見える化されれば、将来的に電池の残存価値をEVの中古車価格に反映できるようになる。利用者にとっては1つのアプリケーションから利用できるEVや充電インフラの種類が広がり、EVを利用しやすくなる。</p>
<p>電池の情報を巡っては、日本の経済産業省傘下の団体と欧州の官民データ基盤「カテナX」が連携を決めた。ガイアエックスはカテナXの上部組織にあたり、製品に使う素材や二酸化炭素排出量などのデータを企業間でやりとりする仕組みをつくっている。</p>
<p>電池の情報を管理・共有する仕組みは欧州で先行してきたが、米国企業も導入を検討している。22年に成立したインフレ抑制法でEV補助金を受けるため北米域内で電池材料や部材を調達することが条件になったためだ。</p>
<p>特に電池の材料であるレアメタル（希少金属）は中国への依存度が大きい。米国企業としては、日欧企業と連携することで電池の材料調達に関する情報を透明化したい狙いもある。</p>

 Confirming Chicago Title Insurance Company’s VerifID™ service PCTF Verified Person Component conformance 



<p>May 14, 2024 – Toronto –&nbsp; We proudly announce that Chicago Title Insurance Company’s ID verification platform, VerifID™, obtained the DIACC Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-verified-person/">Verified Person</a> certification, a massive milestone in becoming a trusted and reliable service in the Canadian ecosystem. DIACC welcomes Chicago Title’s VerifID to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/trusted-list/">growing cohort of certified providers</a> in digital identity, particularly in the critical area of real estate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Canada, mortgage and title fraud is a pressing concern, presenting an opportunity for fraudsters. In response, Chicago Title has developed VerifID, an innovative identity verification and fraud solution. VerifID combats fraudulent real estate transactions, demonstrating its proactive approach to addressing industry challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re passionate about stopping fraud; it’s why we developed VerifID,” said John Rider, Senior Vice President of Retail and Commercial Title at Chicago Title Insurance Company. “We wanted to take that passion to the next level by completing our PCTF certification, demonstrating our commitment to being&nbsp;the best in the business. VerifID doesn’t allow users to modify the verification process, which, in our experience, reduces the intake of valuable information; ours is the only solution that will meet DIACC standards 100% of the time.”</p>



<p>VerifID’s journey to DIACC PCTF certification was rigorous, marked by a thorough third-party evaluation that left no room for shortcuts. This evaluation ensured that the service met the stringent requirements of the Verified Person Component at LOA2, which shows Chicago Title’s commitment to leading the fraud and identity industry through continuous innovation and best practices.</p>



<p>The DIACC certification is a standardized process that includes a point-in-time audit conducted by DIACC Accredited Auditor KUMA and an independent committee review for quality assurance. As a result, DIACC has issued a three-year cycle Trustmark, subject to annual surveillance audits, and added Chicago Title’s VerifID to its <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/trusted-list/">Trusted List</a> of certified providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Chicago Title’s VerifID achieved a significant industry milestone and competitive advantage by becoming the first Canadian vendor to earn certification against the PCTF identity proofing requirements,” said Joni Brennan, DIACC President.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PCTF is a comprehensive risk management and assurance framework for validating the design of private-sector digital trust services. Its criteria address aspects of digital trust and verification, including privacy, security, and interoperability, mitigating risks associated with fraud and breaches. This framework supports robust digital verification and enhances user confidence by providing a reliable means to authenticate digital verification across services, fostering a safer and more integrated digital environment. The PCTF helps people and organizations across the public and private sectors to recognize verified trusted services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To explore the benefits of certification, contact <a href="mailto:voila@diacc.ca">voila@diacc.ca</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>Established in 2012, DIACC is a non-profit organization of public and private sector members committed to advancing full and beneficial participation in the global digital economy by promoting design principles, PCTF adoption and conformity assessment. DIACC prioritizes personal data control, privacy, security, accountability, and inclusive people-centered design.</p>

		<p>Dear Edge Community,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well as we continue to adapt to the industry changes brought about by VMware’s acquisition by Broadcom. In our ongoing commitment to transparency and support, I want to share some important updates and reaffirm our dedication to assisting you through these transitions.</p>
<p>Pricing Changes Post-Acquisition:<br>
It has become apparent in our recent assessments and communications with Broadcom that the pricing structure for VMware’s services may undergo changes. At this time, it does not appear that Broadcom intends to maintain or reduce the prices from their current or previous year’s levels, even when considering potential discounts. This development is significant, and we want to ensure it factors into your planning and decision-making processes.</p>

In light of these potential changes, we believe it is prudent to consider alternative solutions that may better meet your financial and operational needs. We have secured a robust selection of substitute products and services under Edge procurement vehicles. Most of the market available substitutes are available through the EdgeMarket portal, and I am pleased to introduce several key points of contact who can assist you with these options:</p>

 ChatDKG.ai: Driving synergies across the AI solution landscape to tackle hallucinations, bias, and model&nbsp;collapse <p>Abusing social networks for political manipulations may look minuscule compared to a lack of trust in solutions to which we are “outsourcing” our cognition — AI systems. As we would trust them to process large amounts of knowledge and provide us inputs for our actions, or even perform certain actions autonomously, they have the highest possible requirements for transparency and verifiability.</p><p>There should be no compromise in designing AI solutions when it comes to data ownership, information provenance, verifiability of information, or bias that would include any censorship-by-design approach. The risk of this revolution not unfolding in an inclusive way is a societal threat of establishing a monopoly on&nbsp;AI.</p><p>We therefore introduced an effective way of establishing a new paradigm, using a Decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG) framework. dRAG advances the RAG model by organizing external sources in a Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) while introducing incentives to grow a global, crowdsourced network of knowledge made available for AI models to use. See an example of a ChatGPT4 without and with dRAG&nbsp;use:</p><p>The dRAG framework enables a hybrid, decentralized AI system that brings together neural (e.g. LLMs) and symbolic AI (e.g. Knowledge Graph) methodologies. Contrary to using a solely probabilistic neural AI approach, the symbolic AI approach enhances it with the strength of Knowledge Graphs, introducing a more deterministic component.</p>Figure 1: The interplay between neural (LLMs) and symbolic (KGs) AI methodologies. Source: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08302.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08302.pdf</a> [4]<p>To harness a harmonious development between Web3 fundamentals and rapidly deployed AI systems, our approach is to integrate the core Web3 technologies such as the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and AI systems (OpenAI, Gemini, Microsoft Co-pilot, xAI’s Grok, and&nbsp;others).</p><p>We believe that we can realize the potential of trusted AI by creating a Verifiable Internet for AI that is founded on principles of neutrality, inclusiveness, and usability, while giving users freedom of choice with a multi-modal and a multi-model AI framework.</p> ChatDKG.ai: neuro-symbolic AI driving synergies across the solution landscape <p>Below, you can find a comparison table of AI types and frameworks with very diverse advantages and disadvantages. The globally most adopted and centralized AI solutions like Google Gemini, OpenAI, xAI, Perplexity deliver an immense value for a spectrum of use cases. Leveraging OriginTrail’s dRAG — brand name ChatDKG.ai, they can improve their shortfalls by harnessing the synergy of neuro-symbolic AI, data ownership, and better cost performance. Therefore, ChatDKG.ai is not competing against any established AI solutions, but rather empowers users to enhance them with its dRAG, driving knowledge verifiability, cost effectiveness, users’ sovereignty in owning their data and freedom of AI model&nbsp;choice.</p><p>The open source and permissionless nature of the OriginTrail DKG, allows for inclusiveness and neutrality, giving users a tremendous level of freedom on all layers — to choose AI models enabled by the DKG data portability, choose knowledge sources discoverable in the DKG, as well as pick AI services, centralized or decentralized on different blockchains.</p><p>The same principles apply to AI agents, search engines, and a growing variety of AI services integrating into every tool in existence — leveraging dRAG they will enable user freedom of choice, AI autonomy and trust, all while leveraging network effects through connectivity.</p><p>As AI becomes the new UI, make sure you are on the right side of history. Let’s build towards a Truly Open AI, together!</p><p>Apply for the <a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG.ai</a> inception program&nbsp;today!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/chatdkg-ai-driving-synergies-across-the-ai-solution-landscape-to-tackle-hallucinations-bias-and-95afe67aece3">ChatDKG.ai: Driving synergies across the AI solution landscape to tackle hallucinations, bias, and…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The convergence of Internet, Crypto, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) appears as the antidote to many of the current shortcomings of AI — hallucinations, bias, data ownership challenges, even model collapse. It also holds the key to unlocking AI’s full societal potential by enabling a truly open AI. In a world of AI solutions relying on performance battles of pre-trained AI models, <a href="https://chatdkg.ai">ChatDKG</a> stands for freedom of choice. A truly open AI approach allows anyone to define the trusted knowledge as the foundation for their AI solutions. It further extends the freedom of choice from trusted knowledge to multimodal support of a plethora of different AI models. For creators ready to take the plunge into the truly open AI future, an inception program is available to onboard them to&nbsp;ChatDKG.</p> A new paradigm for AI — Your knowledge network is your net&nbsp;worth <p>The currently prevalent approach in creating AI solutions is a siloed one — either in the shackles of a single AI model or a walled garden of external sources provided by a single organization. ChatDKG is breaking down those walls with an inclusive and open approach to creating AI solutions. Leveraging the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), it creates a neutral, inclusive knowledge foundation. As anyone publishes their knowledge to the DKG, their addition gets equipped with a timestamp, their identity, ascribed ownership, and verifiability proofs ensuring their knowledge is kept intact. Through a framework of decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG), such knowledge is made available to any AI model as input to produce outputs that both have information provenance and respect data ownership. As trusted knowledge inputs become mission-critical for AI solutions, it ignites a knowledge economy where your knowledge network is your net&nbsp;worth.</p> Getting involved with Initial Paranet&nbsp;Offering <p>In addition to building trusted AI solutions with ChatDKG, participants in this new knowledge economy can get involved in growing the DKG in knowledge domains important to them. New types of autonomous knowledge networks can appear in any domain, narrow or wide, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Decentralized Science — building a truth layer from existing scientific knowledge to power autonomous AI research and decentralized scientific advancement.  Real World Assets (RWA) — creating tokenized digital twins from any asset that exists outside the digital spectrum, such as real estate, commodities, art, and&nbsp;more.  Industry 4.0 — revolutionizing production processes to achieve the highest safety and efficiency, faster innovation, and tailored customers’ interactions with trusted AI solutions.  <p>Launching an Initial Paranet Offering (IPO) allows anyone to open up their mission to others who would like to join creating a knowledge foundation in that domain. Through an IPO, a paranet operator also ensures incentive rewards for participants that will add useful knowledge — knowledge miners. By accessing <a href="https://neuroweb.ai/">NeuroWeb</a> network incentives for mining new knowledge, the paranet’s trusted knowledge grows in a crowdsourced way.</p> Future-proofing for continuous advancements of&nbsp;AI <p>The ChatDKG’s truly open AI does not only lower dependency on any single AI company, the freedom of choice of AI also ensures that any development in the field of AI models, prompt engineering, agent frameworks, or similar, is making your solution stronger. By putting the trusted knowledge foundation in the driving seat, the tech giants working on advancing AI systems are working in your favor as you are always able to use your knowledge network with the latest AI technologies.</p> Inception program open for application <p>Those looking to build the next big thing with ChatDKG’s trusted AI solution or launch an Initial Paranet Offering can submit their application for the ChatDKG inception program to receive additional support from the OriginTrail team. Applications are open on the&nbsp;<a href="https://chatdkg.ai">website</a>.</p><p>Discover a Truly Open AI &amp; apply for the ChatDKG inception program at: <a href="https://chatdkg.ai.">https://chatdkg.ai.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/powered-by-origintrail-chatdkg-ai-is-unlocking-a-truly-open-artificial-intelligence-f078885acb1c">Powered by OriginTrail, ChatDKG.AI is unlocking a Truly Open Artificial Intelligence</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
