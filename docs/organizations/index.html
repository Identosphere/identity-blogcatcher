<p>This statement was co-written by DIF and ToIP, it can also be read at <a href="https://trustoverip.org/category/blog/">ToIP’s blog here</a>.<br></p><p>On 3rd August 2021, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/PR-did-core-20210803/">proposed</a> advancing the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification to their W3C Recommendation stage, the ultimate level of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsW3C">W3C standards process</a>, which indicates that the specification as currently defined is technically sound, mature and ready for adoption. This includes the expectation that this will allow for widespread implementation, as well as further development and ongoing evaluation, paving the way for future versions.<br></p><p>Collectively, the memberships of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/#members">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/about/members/">Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a> represent over 350 companies globally who are committed to the development and implementation of decentralized identity and trust infrastructure. Many of these organizations have contributed directly or indirectly to the W3C DID 1.0 specification for one simple reason: the DID layer of cryptographically verifiable identifiers is foundational to the common infrastructure we are building together and on top of; therefore, this spec is an integral part of DIF’s and ToIP’s shared vision for an empowered, secure and interoperable future, and in line with <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/">W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles.</a><br></p><p>As such, DIF and ToIP support the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification becoming an official W3C Recommendation. DID 1.0 represents the efforts of over thirty active W3C Working Group contributors over the past two years— on top of contributions from dozens of others in the W3C Credentials Community Group and its predecessors for several years before that. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. Having common ground for development, particularly in terms of interoperability, allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus. It also mitigates the risk of shifting goalposts, which seriously hinders long-term development, investment, and widespread adoption. <br></p><p>DIDs are a critical part of a technical foundation for the products and activities of many of our members. Many of the implementations in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/#report-by-methods">DID Working Group’s implementation report</a> were developed by engineers and companies who collaborate openly at DIF on points of technical interoperability, and at ToIP on points of policy and governance. DIF also hosts the <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">Universal Resolver</a>, a community project which puts practical intra-DID method interoperability into practice by co-developing a “translation engine” for diverse DIDs with contributions from DIF members and non-members alike. Similarly, other DIF efforts like the <a href="https://didcomm.org/">DID Communications</a> protocol and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> protocol and ToIP efforts like the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification">ToIP Trust Registry Protocol</a> serve to align a broad range of implementations and ecosystems already building on these standards, laying the groundwork for robust interoperability across ecosystems and diverse families of technologies.</p><p>This specification is the result of half a decade of sustained, broad-based, dedicated work on the part of W3C, DIF, and ToIP members. We acknowledge also the work done by numerous, forward-thinking organizations who have already built working implementations using the provisional specification, thereby laying the foundations of new infrastructures for “identity data”. We believe DIDs will change the course of digital identity by building in better user controls, portability, and interoperability at the lowest possible level, while also offering increased security and simplicity for implementers and service providers. This advancement unlocks new opportunities for our digital lives, and we look forward to leveraging DIDs and other technologies developed in the community to champion a new class of user-first, self-owned digital identity systems.</p><p></p><p>Signed,</p><p>Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) &amp; Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)<br></p><p>October, 2021<br></p>

<p>First public review ends December 1st</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Energy Interoperation TC are pleased to announce that Energy Interoperation Common Transactive Services (CTS) v1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is its first public review.</p>



<p>Common Transactive Services (CTS) permits energy consumers and producers to interact through energy markets by simplifying actor interaction with any market. CTS is a streamlined and simplified profile of the OASIS Energy Interoperation (EI) specification, which describes an information and communication model to coordinate the exchange of energy between any two Parties that consume or supply energy, such as energy suppliers and customers, markets and service providers.</p>

<p>This statement was co-written by DIF and ToIP.</p>



<p>On 3rd August 2021, the World Wide Web Consortium <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/PR-did-core-20210803/">proposed</a> advancing the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification to their W3C Recommendation stage, the ultimate level of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsW3C">W3C standards process</a>, which indicates that the specification as currently defined is technically sound, mature and ready for adoption. This includes the expectation that this will allow for widespread implementation, as well as further development and ongoing evaluation, paving the way for future versions.</p>



<p>Collectively, the memberships of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/#members">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/about/members/">Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a> represent over 350 companies globally who are committed to the development and implementation of decentralized identity and trust infrastructure. Many of these organizations have contributed directly or indirectly to the W3C DID 1.0 specification for one simple reason: the DID layer of cryptographically verifiable identifiers is foundational to the common infrastructure we are building together and on top of; therefore, this spec is an integral part of DIF’s and ToIP’s shared vision for an empowered, secure and interoperable future, and in line with <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/">W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles.</a></p>



<p>As such, DIF and ToIP support the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification becoming an official W3C Recommendation. DID 1.0 represents the efforts of over thirty active W3C Working Group contributors over the past two years— on top of contributions from dozens of others in the W3C Credentials Community Group and its predecessors for several years before that. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. Having common ground for development, particularly in terms of interoperability, allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus. It also mitigates the risk of shifting goalposts, which seriously hinders long-term development, investment, and widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DIDs are a critical part of a technical foundation for the products and activities of many of our members. Many of the implementations in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/#report-by-methods">DID Working Group’s implementation report</a> were developed by engineers and companies who collaborate openly at DIF on points of technical interoperability, and at ToIP on points of policy and governance. DIF also hosts the <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">Universal Resolver</a>, a community project which puts practical intra-DID method interoperability into practice by co-developing a “translation engine” for diverse DIDs with contributions from DIF members and non-members alike. Similarly, other DIF efforts like the <a href="https://didcomm.org/">DID Communications</a> protocol and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> protocol and ToIP efforts like the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification">ToIP Trust Registry Protocol</a> serve to align a broad range of implementations and ecosystems already building on these standards, laying the groundwork for robust interoperability across ecosystems and diverse families of technologies.</p>



<p>This specification is the result of half a decade of sustained, broad-based, dedicated work on the part of W3C, DIF, and ToIP members. We acknowledge also the work done by numerous, forward-thinking organizations who have already built working implementations using the provisional specification, thereby laying the foundations of new infrastructures for “identity data”. We believe DIDs will change the course of digital identity by building in better user controls, portability and interoperability at the lowest possible level, while also offering increased security and simplicity for implementers and service providers. This advancement unlocks new opportunities for our digital lives, and we look forward to leveraging DIDs and other technologies developed in the community to champion a new class of user-first, self-owned digital identity systems.</p>

 Reference Libraries 

<p>Some of our most important work at Blockchain Commons is on specifications that improve the interoperability and resilience of cryptocurrency wallets. Our reference libraries allow developers to incorporate those specifications into their own code.</p>

<p>SSKR Security Review. However, there’s one more thing required before our libraries can be used in production releases: security reviews. Our vision is that third-party developers using our libraries will work with us to contract a security review from a third-party. They can take advantage of all the libraries already reviewed, and then they can increase that selection with a review of their own. Our sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, began that process this quarter by arranging a security review for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a> libraries through <a href="https://radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security (ROS)</a>.</p>

<p>The folks at ROS tested our software and noted potential security problems. We then worked with them to close all issues that we felt were a priority. Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to transparency, we have published the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/reviews/2021-security-review.pdf">review</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md">response</a>, which includes a listing of issues that we resolved, as well as those we did not (and why). Thanks to this review, we feel that the <code>bc-shamir</code> and <code>bc-sskr</code> libraries are the first of our reference libraries ready for production deployment.</p>

<p>Project Nayuki Port. We also released a minor new utility library, a port of the Project Nayuki QR library into Swift as <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/QRCodeGenerator">QRCodeGenerator</a>. We’d discovered that Apple’s native iOS QR generation is inefficient for QR codes where individual segments require different optimization. Nayuki does the right thing, by individually optimizing each segment, so we ported it over as a replacement for the native Apple libraries, for use in our own code and by other developers.</p>

 Reference Apps 

<p>Our reference apps provide exemplar use of our specifications (and libraries).</p>

<p>SeedTool Updates. The release of Seedtool was one of our big events in Q2. In Q3 we’ve continued that work through two notable upgrades, releasing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/README.md#version-history">1.1 in July, 1.2 in August, and 1.2.1 in September</a>. Some of the biggest updates included arbitrary key derivation, preset SSKR schemes, and developer functions that make it easier to test out QR &amp; UR-based requests and responses. We also added our first Ethereum support, through the ability to derive Ethereum private keys and addresses from your stored seeds. Our updated <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/MANUAL.md">SeedTool Manual</a> describes all of the latest functionality.</p>

<p>QRTool Updates. Seedtool wasn’t the only reference app to get attention; <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QRTool</a> also received some minor updates in July, though those largely took the form of minor bug fixes. Updating QR Tool to use the Project Nayuki library port will be our next big update for QR Tool, sometime in the future.</p>

 Bitcoin Utilities 

<p>Other utilities make it easier to use Bitcoin and other blockchain and crypto-technology.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Standup Updates. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup</a> was one of Blockchain Commons’ first releases. It automates the installation of a secure Bitcoin Core setup on a Debian Linux device or virtual machine . However, Bitcoin Core is always changing, requiring occasional updates. Our newest version of Bitcoin Standup, 0.8.0, updates the scripts to work well with Bitcoin Core 22.0 (which made some changes to its code signing).</p>

<p>However, Bitcoin Standup 0.8.0 does more than that. We’ve always imagined Standup as an engine that can install a wide variety of cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, and the new version of Standup offers the opportunity for the first such addition: <a href="https://cypherpunkpay.org/">cypherpunkpay</a>, an easy and accessible server for receiving Bitcoin payments. This addition, though just a starting point, was one of the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> projects initiated by our 2021 interns, to offer cyryptocurrency support for activists.</p>

<p>Gordian Server Officially Released. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a> project took Bitcoin Standup as a jumping-off point and offered the same ability to easily install Bitcoin Core on the more accessible macOS UI. Like Bitcoin Standup it’s intended as the heart of a self-sovereign setup, where you can control both your wallet and your server. We released Gordian Server in some preliminary versions in 2020, but we’ve now polished it to improve its stability and ease of use, and have released it as the Feature-Complete <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.0.0">1.0.0</a>. Like our newest Standup release, this version of Gordian Server has also been updated to work correctly with Bitcoin Core 22.0.</p>

 Learning Resources 

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ goals has always been to improve the developmental understanding of Bitcoin. We also extend that goal to our own releases by working to make our specifications as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our popular <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a> has brought numerous developers into the industry. We’re thus thrilled to offer complete translations in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a>. This enormous amount of work was the product of a number of volunteers, some of whom were also working with us as interns, which means that the <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a> should again be thanked for their support. We hope that these translations will help bring Bitcoin development to the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, which seems particularly important given El Salvador’s recent move to Bitcoin as a currency. (Learning Bitcoin also enjoyed quite a few minor edits as a result of the translations, as well as updates to include i2p and some recent revisions, resulting in our release of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/releases/tag/v2.1.0">version 2.1</a>; we’ve also got plans for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/TODO-30.md">3.0</a>.)</p>

<p>New SSKR Docs. Shamir’s Secret Sharing is a critical element of #SmartCustody in today’s digital-assets world, which is why our SSKR library received our first security review. We’ve also been expanding our docs to talk more about how and why to use secret sharing (and why not to). Our newest <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR docs</a> include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">Designing SSKR Share Scenarios</a>, which discusses many models for sharing (including all of the default scenarios now found in SeedTool), and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md">SSKR Dangers</a>, which talks about why we ultimately prefer multisigs to secret-sharing.</p>

 Building to Specifications &amp; Laws 

<p>Specifications and supportive references are the first steps in bringing new ideas to the industry. To reach their fullest potential, those ideas eventually have to become something more …</p>

<p>DID Standardization. The DID specification, which is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">1.0 candidate recommendation</a> for an international standard, is our next big technical step forward for self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, big centralized companies such as Apple and Google have taken notice and unsurprisingly raised complaints. We’ve offered some support with language and with championing the hard work already done, though the heavy lifting continues to be done by the editors, including Drummond Reed, Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, and Markus Sabadello.</p>

<p>Principal Authority. Many specifications and standards need legal support to reach their fullest potential. Our work in Wyoming has resulted in the state legislature arriving at a legal definition of digital identity that centers on the concept of principal authority. This quarter, we released <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">a paper</a> on how principal authority defines self-sovereign identity, and what the next steps are. (We also presented the paper and testified about it to the Wyoming legislature.)</p>

<p>eResidency &amp; Other Testimony. Overall, we’ve been thrilled to be working with Wyoming, creating some of the first and best laws for supporting blockchains, cryptocurrency, digital identity, and digital companies. In a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2021092109-01E-Residency.pdf">recent presentation</a>, we urged them to leverage the infrastructure they’ve created into an eResidency program that can extend these benefits to companies worldwide. In other testimony for Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, and the Netherlands we have provided support new laws for DAOs, updates to GDPR regulations and have advised how to avoid vendor lock-in and future-proof technology.</p>

 Other Future Expansions 

<p>Finally, we’re also looking to the future in other ways.</p>

<p>Ethereum Expansion. As noted, we’ve expanded Gordian SeedTool to support Ethereum key derivations. We’ve also been experimenting with selling some self-sovereign-identity NFTs to raise funds for Blockchain Commons. Generally, this all demonstrates our goal of bringing many of our philosophies, architectures, and models to the Ethereum blockchain. In particular, we believe that #SmartCustody, and especially SSKR, could help Ethereum, which has a lot of its own challenges for responsible key management, such as the lack of true multisig. If you’d like to support our expansion into Ethereum, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a> and let us know why you did (or watch for upcoming NFT auctions!).</p>

<p>Second Intern Program. Finally, we’ve just completed our second summer’s intern program, and we’re thrilled to have another batch of interns who we helped to introduce to the world of blockchain development and who in turn helped us push forward projects such as our Learning Bitcoin translations and revisions. They also: produced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Secure-Development-Setup-macOS">secure development setup guide</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Pseudonymity-Guide">pseudonymity guide</a> that offered more support for activists and HRF; developed a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli program</a> for leaving behind your digital assets; worked on creating a stable version of Esplora; and more. Some of our 2021 interns have already gone on to other paid work in the field; we’re looking forward to seeing what they create next!</p>

<p>Thank you, as always, for your interest in Blockchain Commons and the improvement of the entire blockchain field. If you like what we’re doing, we again encourage you to become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Github sponsor</a> so that we can continue forward with our work of making the industry independent, private, interoperable, and resilient!</p>

<p>As I write my first newsletter to you as Digital Identity New Zealand’s Executive Director, I’m acutely aware that I am familiarising myself with the controls as I operate them. Michael left large shoes to fill, so my feet will have to grow! I’ve been away from Aotearoa a while, so it’s good to be back and appreciate the progress being made. In my time away, I was privileged to lead an international digital identity industry organisation; one of the very few that operate a digital identity trust framework. So, you’ll understand how excited I was to arrive back in time to see the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116015/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Digital Identity Trust Framework Bill</a>&nbsp;progress through Parliament to its current Select Committee stage.<br>&nbsp;<br>I look forward to joining you on that journey and bringing some learnings from my previous gig along too. I expect it to be DINZ’s key focus these next few months. Stakeholder collaboration is the key to success in the case of Trust Frameworks, so you can be sure that I’ll be looking for opportunities where DINZ can play a role.<br>&nbsp;<br>I would also like to remind the community that nominations for the DINZ Executive Council are currently open. All member organisations&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2021/10/07/executive-council-nominations-now-open/">can nominate a representative</a>.

<p>First public review of Version 1.1 ends November 24th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security TC are pleased to announce that CACAO Security Playbooks v1.1 is now available for public review and comment. This 30-day review is the first public review for Version 1.1 of this specification.</p>



<p>About the specification draft:</p>



<p>To defend against threat actors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures, organizations need to identify, create, document, and test detection, investigation, prevention, mitigation, and remediation steps. These steps, when grouped together, form a cyber security playbook that can be used to protect organizational systems, networks, data, and users.</p>



<p>This specification defines the schema and taxonomy for cybersecurity playbooks and how cybersecurity playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions.</p>

 at the Badge&nbsp;Summit Our session description for the Badge&nbsp;Summit<p>Clay Shirky&nbsp;wrote:</p><blockquote>“Communications tools don’t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring.”</blockquote><p>Ten years on, badges have become mainstream, and we’re thinking around how we can continue to innovate with badges. <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/participation-thats-what-s-gonna-save-the-human-race-pete-seeger-ae57ba8370a5">We’ve been working with Participate</a> on a project lovingly titled “Keep Badges&nbsp;Weird”.</p><p>Keep Badges Weird is a social learning approach revolving around Open Badges (“badges”) in Communities of Practice (“CoP”). This week, at <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">the 2021 Badge Summit</a>, we are “officially” launching the project with a participatory session. We’ll give a brief overview of the project, and then invite people to explore what recognition inside of a CoP looks&nbsp;like.</p> Community Content <p>Our aim is to help people learn about both badges as well as how CoPs have activities that provide value to others. Our “CoP Curious” course explores <a href="https://wenger-trayner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/11-04-Wenger_Trayner_DeLaat_Value_creation.pdf">value cycles</a> and our “Badge Curious” course goes through the ins and outs of open badges and digital credentialing.</p><p>Although the theory and practice of badges and CoPs play central roles in our community content, it is the people who join a community who shape that community’s culture and direction. We’re excited to discover how this experiment breeds new value for social learners of all stripes. We’re eager to learn how we can support someone who is trying to get an organisation to start thinking about upskilling in a non-traditional way. We’re hopeful that we can deliver a better understanding of how CoPs actually function while showing how badges can work to build trust through recognition.</p>Thinking about Community of Practice Value Cycles as gears. Image CC BY-ND Laura Hilliger of&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a> Landscapes of&nbsp;Practice <p>As many other CoPs exist on Participate’s platform, it feels like an excellent place to Keep Badges Weird and see how recognition can motivate and encourage people in what are called “Landscapes of Practice” (LoP).</p><blockquote>“[I]n landscapes, practitioners actively find their way through a complex geography of local practices, and by doing so they gradually discover which practices matter to them the most as social spaces for developing their competence.” (<a href="https://wenger-trayner.com/resources/publications/evaluation-framework/">Wenger-Trayner et al</a>.,&nbsp;2014)</blockquote><p>Participants can contribute by:</p>  Participating — in more than one community  Creating — something of value to&nbsp;others  Reflecting — on what they have&nbsp;learned  <p>There are <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities">loads of other communities</a> on the Participate platform — from communities organised around teaching the Sustainable Development Goals to communities looking at project based learning, game design or improving remote learning offerings. We will use a LoP approach to help learners create intersections and pathways to other communities that might be of interest to&nbsp;them.</p> And of course the&nbsp;Badges <blockquote>“Motivation and peer and self assessment are great reasons to put badges into practice.” <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWayneGibbons/status/1451858488477433858">Dr. Wayne&nbsp;Gibbons</a></blockquote>Badge Design for Participate’s Keep Badges Weird CoP, CC-BY-ND by Bryan Mathers of&nbsp;WAO<p>We have a new suite of badges to encourage participation, create value for others, and reflect on that experience. Participants will be able to both earn AND award badges, so they’ll have a chance to prove that they’ve understood the theory surrounding CoPs and badges as well as put those theories into practice.</p><p><a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">We’ve made the community discoverable</a> on the Participate platform, and you can already join the learning experience.

<p>We recently had the honor to host a presentation from our Canadian counterparts in Ontario about their technology roadmap for their <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-id-ontario">Digital Identity (ID) program</a>.</p>



<p>The aim of their program is to “make accessing online and in-person services simpler, safer and more secure”, and they’re aiming to introduce Digital ID later this year.</p>



<p>They’ve been busy since their announcement in October 2020, hosting roundtable discussions with large market participants, surveying and consulting with the public and small-to-medium businesses, developing a tech roadmap to get questions and input from private-sector partners, and publishing the technical tools they’re going to leverage.</p>



Ontario’s simplified version of how Digital ID will work. <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-id-ontario">Read more on their website.</a>



<p>The recent presentation to the ToIP Foundation was to further their goal of aligning and interoperating with the broader market for digital identity. They recognize the importance of market engagement, <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards">technology standards</a>, and of partnering with the private sector in building a digital identity ecosystem. Ultimately, all this will help drive end user adoption and the delivery of value.</p>



<p>The presentation covered:</p>



  A summary of findings from government-led public consultations on digital identity  An overview of Ontario’s Digital ID technology roadmap, and discussions about the technology stacks and infrastructure  Ontario’s proposed conceptual model for digital identity, and the principles that inform&nbsp;it  



<p>The presentation emphasized how the Government of Ontario’s digital identity strategy and roadmap is building upon the ToIP <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">dual-stack model</a>. It was exciting and gratifying to see a major public sector organization contributing to a digital identity ecosystem based on the interoperable open standards that are the heart of our efforts here at the ToIP Foundation. Equally, we hope that Ontario will benefit through exposure of their efforts to our worldwide presence—and further inspire others to adopt decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>

<p>Project Specification 01 is ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that OSLC Architecture Management Version 3.0 from the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project [1] has been approved as an OASIS Project Specification.</p>



<p>Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle is very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across a product’s entire application and product lifecycle.</p>



<p>OSLC Architecture Management defines a RESTful web services interface for the management of architectural resources and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks, requirements or test cases. To support these scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>



<p>This Project Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the OP’s Project Governing Board and fully ready for testing and implementation. The applicable open source licenses can be found in the project’s administrative repository at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md">https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md</a>.</p>

 Any web developer knows the drill: In order to access an API, you need an&nbsp;API-Key. <p>This is true for e.g. Google Maps (or any other service) and has been copied by more decentralized services like The Graph Protocol. As the application developer, it is your responsibility to create an API Key which grants access to the service and allows assigning the queries to your&nbsp;account.</p><p>The picture below shows the process: The browser makes a request to the application server, which in turn calls the API with an&nbsp;API-Key.</p>browser to app server to API&nbsp;server<p>This authorization scheme works really well in the scenario in which there is an application server. What about&nbsp;DApps?</p> The difference with&nbsp;DApps <p>A Decentralized Application (DApp) typically has no application server. The logic is all on the client and the data is in some distributed storage system like a blockchain or IPFS. This is great in theory, but as most users do not have an IPFS node or an RPC node running locally on their computer, it is difficult for them to use such applications without some services being involved (e.g. <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a>, <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/">Alchemy</a>, <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/">Quiknode</a>).</p><p>The typical setup then looks something like&nbsp;this:</p>API key is stored in the&nbsp;browser<p>This of course is a problem for the application developer who has paid for the account to which the API key belongs. As any user of the DApp has to get access to the API Key, some users might be mischievous and misuse the access rights to the&nbsp;service.</p> Replacing API Key with Authentication <p>A more secure mechanism is to replace the API Key with user authentication. Each user has to send a login token to the API Service, which uniquely identifies them and allows the API Server to make sure only authorized users can access the&nbsp;service.</p><p>This could be achieved with public-facing services like Azure Active Directory or AWS IAM (collectively IAM System or IAMS) but it is cumbersome and requires a separate configuration for each API Service and IAMS. By default, nobody has access to your User Directory, and that is the way you want to keep it. So in order for an API Service to use your IAMS tenant you would need to configure it especially for&nbsp;this.</p><p>There is no way, in a centralized IAMS, to create a setup in which an API service is granted access to all IAMS tenants without their explicit&nbsp;consent.</p> Decentralizing the authorization system <p>That is where a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/digging-deeper-into-self-sovereign-identity-and-access-management-e6eefbac631e">decentralized IAMS</a> (e.g. <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">Switchboard</a>) comes into play. In a decentralized IAMS, the user information is not stored on the server, so there is no need to give the API Server access to anything; the information is held by the users themselves in the form of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials</a>.</p><p>The role definitions or access rights are saved in publicly accessible, censorship-resistant storage. The most important part is that the definitions must be signed by one of the delegated authorities. When a definition is read, it must be possible to tell if it is genuine or&nbsp;not.</p><p>In such a scheme, the API access would look like&nbsp;this:</p>the request contains a bearer token instead of an API&nbsp;key<p>The browser attaches a claim to the header of the request; which the API server can verify in the roles' definition database. <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">In the current implementation of Switchboard</a>, the role definitions are stored on the Energy Web Chain in the Energy Name Services (ENS) smart contracts.</p> The advantages to the developer <p>From a developer’s perspective, this is great news. They can control who accesses the API services they’re paying for and even set different access levels for paying customers and visitors.</p><p>While many API services already allow setting different access levels per API Key, there is no way for the developer to control if there are any malicious users among the user base. It is pretty trivial for a malicious developer to extract API Keys from a DAPP and reuse them for their own&nbsp;profit.</p><p>This might not be a problem yet because there are very few real DAPPs and among those even fewer are popular enough to be the target of an attack, but this will change with the growing adoption of blockchain and other decentralized systems.</p> Conclusion <p>If you are a developer and want to write a DApp because you believe in decentralization or simply because you find the serverless concept really cool, then you probably are using API-Keys in your front-end. If this is the case, then you should consider the security risk the publication of the API-Key in your front end represents and ask yourself if it would make sense to switch to a user authentication scheme.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/api-access-security-for-dapps-cfcfa928623c">API access security for DApps</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>Munyaradzi Kamhozo is Account Relationship Manager at NMB Bank Limited, a registered commercial bank based in Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>NMB Bank’s role in this initiative is to act as the Validation Agent, working with the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) as the Local Operating Unit (LOU), to issue SME clients with globally recognized digital business identities. Project partners GLEIF, Cornerstone Advisory Plus and Cenfri supported NMB Bank Limited to complete the required qualification process. </p>
<p>The LEI presents a significant opportunity to help close the current trade financing gap and support more SMEs to engage in international and domestic trade. NMB Bank Limited saw that potential, which drew them to the Validation Agent role, supporting its key objectives to create a market leading proposition for its SME client base, foster greater financial inclusion in the region and support the growth and formalization of the Zimbabwean economy. </p>
<p>How could this LEI initiative improve domestic and international trade out of Zimbabwe? </p>
<p>Most Zimbabwean SMEs rely on an international supply of raw materials. At least 80% of our SME customers engage with international suppliers on a regular basis. Currently, however, if an SME in Zimbabwe completes a telegraphic transfer to a supplier based in Europe, the correspondent bank will have to validate the identity of the Zimbabwean business and, without an established form of legal identity, this process can take up to a month.  </p>
<p>The LEI initiative will help by building trust in both the global financial ecosystem and in key supplier relationships. Using an LEI can significantly reduce the time correspondent banks take to validate the identity of the SME, ensuring that they can quickly access key supplies without building up excessive interest on local currency loans which, for SMEs in Zimbabwe, range from 40 per cent to 60 per cent per annum depending on the financial institution. </p>
<p>The benefits of the LEI also apply to Zimbabwean exports. By obtaining an LEI, SMEs can increase their international visibility and credibility with new overseas clients. All buyers must screen new suppliers to validate that they are who they say they are. With an LEI, this process will be faster and simpler than ever before. This will help to create new opportunities for our exporters, enabling them to foster new markets and grow domestic and international trade. </p>
<p>How is the LEI initiative helping NMB Bank compete and/or differentiate itself in the financial services marketplace? </p>
<p>One of the principal benefits of being a Validation Agent is that NMB Bank is now able to offer an entirely new service to our SME clients which allows them to save significant time when partaking in international transactions and opens opportunities to access trade finance, something which none of our competitors can offer currently. Addressing these key pain points will help us grow our client base and deliver an attractive proposition to SME customers. </p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, becoming a Validation Agent meant NMB Bank also had to undertake a comprehensive training program to get us up to speed with GLEIF’s regulatory standards. This has allowed us to realign our internal processes with an international standard of best practice. We can now set the standard for due diligence processes in the region. </p>
<p>By supporting SMEs as part of the Validation Agent role, NMB Bank is also actively supporting the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s National Financial Inclusion strategy, which aims to increase financial and economic inclusivity in the country. </p>
<p>What long-term potential do you see in the LEI initiative, both for banks and SMEs in Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>Zimbabwe, like many African countries, has a sizeable ‘informal economy’. It is estimated that around 80.8% of those employed in sub-Saharan Africa work within the informal sector.  Unfortunately, this means businesses operating in this sector lack the credentials necessary to grow and often find themselves losing money when undertaking cross-border transactions. In the long term, we can see the LEI helping to formalize our economy. With a globally standardized identifier, our businesses can prove their legitimacy and engage in regulated trade, leading to the generation of more money for the businesses and their employees. </p>
<p>We also believe that the LEI will have long term impacts on access to trade finance. SMEs currently struggle to access finance as they are perceived as ‘too risky’ by international lenders. As a result, the current trade finance gap in African stands at $81 billion.  When we apply for credit lines for our SME clients with an LEI, the screening process undertaken by the Development Finance Institutions to identify the applicant will be much simpler, meaning SMEs can access more trade finance, faster than ever before. This will also allow many businesses to be freed from the control of loan sharks as more legitimate lines of credit become available to them. </p>
<p>For banks, in particular, the LEI initiative will help to streamline onboarding processes. By adopting the role of Validation Agent, banks can provide a faster and more efficient experience for new clients by handling the LEI issuance process internally. Banks will also benefit from a simplified approach to establishing automated beneficial ownership systems, in line with Zimbabwe’s national project to do so. This means the initiative will contribute significantly to supporting Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism. </p>
<p>What kind of change in Zimbabwe would you like to see result from broad LEI adoption among SMEs?</p>
<p>Overall, we want to see accelerated financial inclusion in line with Zimbabwe’s National Inclusion Strategy. Broad adoption of the LEI is a big step towards achieving this.  </p>
<p>The formalization of Zimbabwe’s economy as a result of LEI adoption will not only benefit banks and SMEs, but the entire population. At an international level, a formal economy means more taxes are paid, which, in turn, means our government can invest more into key infrastructure projects to support the growth of the nation, improving the standard of living for all. </p>
<p>We’d also like to see a change in the perception of Zimbabwe in international markets. Our national mantra is ‘open for business’. We want to be seen in this way. Currently, we are seen as a risky market in the eyes of international lenders, banks and suppliers. The LEI presents an opportunity to help us overturn this perception. If the world knows who you are, the opportunities will flow in.</p>

Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>. <p>By Audrey Stienon, Associate, Reimagining Capitalism</p> Understanding society’s mutual responsibilities within the context of&nbsp;COVID-19 <p>Throughout the course of the pandemic, our lives have changed in ways that would have been nearly unthinkable when the crisis began. We entered lockdowns believing that it would be impossible to sustain such a drastic change to the status quo for more than a few weeks; and yet here we are, a year and a half later, with many of the rituals and requirements of social distancing still in place, having largely adapted to living in this new&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Across history, pandemics have been an existential threat to societies precisely because, beyond a staggering death toll, they have the power to strain to the point of collapse the three legs on which, like a stool, society stands: representative governments that set and enforce the rules for how diverse people wish to live together and advance their collective wellbeing; markets that mobilize decentralized incentives to generate and distribute wealth, goods, services, and knowledge across society; and communities that unite people across shared identities and build inclusive spaces where people can find a sense of belonging, support, and&nbsp;meaning.</p><p>These three legs are all social constructs that vary in shapes and sizes across countries, but our experience in learning to live with COVID illustrates the key ways in which each is essential to our ability to make it through a crisis like the pandemic. Government coordinated the formal public health response even as publicly funded biomedical research provided the basic building blocks for the vaccines, which the government then distributed across the country. The markets and businesses innovated to meet rapidly changing needs in a socially-distanced world — enabling many employees to work from home, promoting contactless delivery, and even mass-producing necessities like hand sanitizer and ventilators. And communities across the country adopted new norms and behaviors to support and protect the safety of their&nbsp;members.</p><p>Even so, the monumental difficulties that we have faced in effectively responding to the pandemic have drawn attention to the challenges undermining the support each leg provides to society. Necessary government coordination was undercut by partisanship, polarization, and ideological self-sabotage. Markets proved to be overly reliant on brittle supply chains and failed to ensure that the immense wealth created by a small subset of companies because of the crisis trickled down to struggling communities. And many communities — driven by a deep mistrust of government, companies, and even other communities in our society — rejected and fought against the adoption of public health precautions to the detriment of us&nbsp;all.</p><p>We may yet get through the worst of this public health crisis, but if history is any guide, we are certain to feel the reverberations of COVID long after the threat of the virus has been brought fully under control. If we are to make it to the other side of this challenge with our society still standing as a thriving liberal market democracy, we must shore up and strengthen all three of these&nbsp;legs.</p> What happens when we saw off two legs of a three-legged stool? <p>The types of governments, markets, and communities that ideally support democratic societies have much in common. All three are strengthened in environments of vibrant competition — be it competition between political ideologies and policy options, business models and technological innovation, or options for environments where people can build connections and a sense of belonging. This implies that all three thrive when everyone has the right to participate, challenge the status quo, and offer new ideas of how to do things&nbsp;better.</p><p>They also all share a common vulnerability to concentrations of power which — as American history and current events can attest — are inevitably used to exclude and stifle competition: unopposed political power will silence opposing views and opinions through tools like voter suppression; monopolistic market power will be used to prevent rivals from threatening profits; community power will be used to erect protectionist barriers — including discrimination, segregation, and outright violence — to avoid having to share community benefits with perceived outsiders.</p><p>Since each leg struggles to regulate itself to prevent such corrosive concentrations of power, they are each dependent on the other two to act as checks on power that can protect competition. Representative governments, responsible for securing everyone’s basic and equal rights, can enact and enforce rules against discrimination and monopolies that require communities and markets respectively to remain open to new members and ideas. Competitive markets both create and connect a diverse range of communities and political interest groups who share the common interest of opposing government or community efforts to empower one group over all others. Inclusive community needs and preferences inspire the new ideas of government and markets, and community members have the power as voters, protesters, consumers, investors, and employees to mobilize if the other two pillars fail to meet their&nbsp;demands.</p><p>All this implies that the wellbeing of a democratic society — as well as any hope of building a democratic society in which the equal participation of all of its members is truly valued — rests on the collective strength of these three legs. Should any one of them fail, our democracy will begin to&nbsp;crumble.</p><p>In recent decades, we have become overly dependent on markets to meet society’s needs. For decades, conservative politicians, economists, and many business leaders sold Americans on the idea that markets were more efficient and less prejudiced than either government or communities. In response, policymakers, business leaders, and a large number of community representatives acted to systematically shift the societal responsibilities of government and communities onto markets by restricting the activities of these two legs. Government capacity to provide public services, earn income through taxes, or regulate was limited, while the distress of communities asking for support and to have their concerns addressed was&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>Although markets are remarkable and powerful tools, they will never be capable of single-handedly upholding societal wellbeing — just as no one could hope to sit comfortably on a stool balanced entirely on one leg. Markets will always be shaped by government rules and community norms and values, and — rather than making markets stronger — weakening the other two legs has only engendered a version of markets with few checks to prevent either the concentration of economic power or the use of that power to limit competition from other businesses, political ideologies, or societal norms across all of society. As a result, our country is one in which our markets no longer provide widespread wealth and opportunity and in which neither our restrained government nor economically starved communities have the capacity to provide support or new opportunities to the people that markets have been unable to reach. This has fueled mistrust in markets incapable of delivering the shared prosperity that was promised, in governments unable to respond to the demands of their constituents, and in other distressed communities increasingly seen as competitors for scarce resources and government attention.</p><p>As America makes its way out of the pandemic and we prepare ourselves to confront the challenges, like climate change, looming ahead, we must all as individuals, voters, companies, communities, and governments make a concerted effort to strengthen the social foundations on which we stand. This will entail deepening the communal ties that bind us to each other, reinvigorating the governing bodies that allow us to work together towards common goals, and, finally, redesigning our markets so that they generate wealth not for its own sake, but for the sake of increasing the wellbeing of every person in our&nbsp;society.</p> Finding our&nbsp;balance <p>To that end, Omidyar Network aims to support organizations working to reimagine and rebalance the responsibilities that government, markets, and communities have in supporting social wellbeing. Driven by a deep appreciation for the importance of of each of these legs, we aim to help develop ideas and expectations about the economic roles each can play to support society; to advance the implementation of new rules that strengthen their capacity to act on these roles; and to invigorate counterweights and checks on concentrations of economic power across&nbsp;them.</p><p>(To learn more about how we believe ideas, rules, and power interact to shape our economy and democracy, consider reading the <a href="http://%20https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">first installment in this series&nbsp;here</a>.)</p><p>First, we need a stronger understanding of the respective roles of markets, government, and communities in the economy, as well as insight into how to strengthen their capacity to fulfill these roles after decades of underinvestment and neglect. Rather than having to choose between market or government solutions to their economic challenges, communities must be able to work with government to access and help design market systems that prioritize the wellbeing of the many rather than the&nbsp;few.</p><p>We therefore have partnered with a range of organizations developing new ideas on how to design a socially-driven economy built on a more equitable distribution of power across society. Notably, we support the work of Xavier de Souza Briggs, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/program/metropolitan-policy-program/">Metropolitan Policy Program</a>, who is identifying strategies to mobilize stakeholders from across the economy — including civil society, business leaders, worker organizations, and local and federal government agencies — around the common goal of revitalizing struggling metropolitan communities. Similarly, the <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/think-tank/corporate-power/">Roosevelt Institute</a>, for example, is leading on research exploring the consequences of power imbalances between public, community, and market actors, while <a href="https://www.demos.org/what-we-do/policy-and-research">Demos</a> is working to develop institutions for building community power over economic decisions. Meanwhile, Omidyar Network has created the <a href="https://omidyar.com/the-community-infrastructure-fund-for-mutual-aid/">Community Infrastructure Fund for Mutual Aid</a>, a learning project that aims to explore how to equitably address the socio-economic needs of communities while providing the essential infrastructure for organizations that have stepped up meet these needs where other institutions have failed&nbsp;them.</p><p>Second, we aim to revitalize competitive markets grounded by their responsibilities towards stakeholders across society. To this end, we have supported efforts to advocate for changes in the rules governing markets to allow businesses and other market actors to pursue goals beyond just short-term profit maximization. <a href="https://www.citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>, <a href="https://justcapital.com/">JUST Capital</a>, and the <a href="https://www.valuereportingfoundation.org/">Value Reporting Foundation</a>, for example, are advocating that government mandate that companies disclose information on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues and on their political spending. Such disclosures would make it easier for people who invest in companies, as well as the general public, to hold companies to account for how their activities impact society. Similarly, <a href="https://bcorporation.net/about-b-lab">B Lab</a>, an organization known for certifying businesses that advance a social purpose (B Corp), is advocating for policies to reform rules of corporate governance so that business leaders take a greater range of stakeholders into account when making their decisions. Finally, we continue to invest in organizations working to strengthen regulation that can curb the power of tech platforms, including the <a href="https://www.economicliberties.us/access-to-markets/#">American Economic Liberties Project</a>, <a href="https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/">Open Markets Institute</a>, and the <a href="https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/antimonopoly/">Anti-Monopoly Fund</a> at the Economic Security&nbsp;Project.</p><p>Finally, we are working with organizations strengthening the power of stakeholders from across society to influence the role that markets play in&nbsp;society.</p><p>One piece of this work involves building the power of communities to influence the shape of markets and the behavior of market actors. <a href="https://communitychange.org/about/">Community Change</a> and the <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/">Action Center on Race and the Economy (ACRE)</a>, for example, are building the power of communities of color to shape economic decisions and move us closer to a more inclusive democracy and economy. Meanwhile, recognizing that working people both constitute their own community and are key members of their own local communities, the <a href="https://www.californiaworkerpower.org/">California Coalition for Worker Power</a> is mobilizing worker centers, worker advocates, labor policy experts and labor unions to ensure that every worker in California has the power to come together and improve their work conditions and their communities. Finally, <a href="https://faithinaction.org/issue-campaign/economic-dignity/">Faith in Action</a>, seeks to mobilize faith-based communities to fight against an economy of exclusion and instead create a moral economy based on a new set of values, beliefs, and identities.</p><p>The second element of this work entails building the power of stakeholders who can work within markets to hold them accountable to a wider range of social values. For example, organizations such as the <a href="https://theshareholdercommons.com/">Shareholder Commons</a> and <a href="https://www.iccr.org/">Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR)</a> equip the people and organizations who invest in businesses with the tools to use their power as shareholders to engage with companies on their ESG performance. Similarly, <a href="https://www.forthelongterm.org/">For the Long Term</a> is working to support public fiduciaries and other government entities that invest in markets on behalf of citizens and public sector workers — such as public pension funds or state and municipal treasurers — to more actively pressure companies to behave in ways that serve their beneficiaries and contribute to public wellbeing. Meanwhile, organizations like <a href="https://www.leadershipnowproject.org/">The Leadership Now Project</a> are engaging directly with business leaders themselves to mobilize their existing power to strengthen American democracy.</p><p>For all our failings, America’s response to the COVID pandemic has shown that each of the three legs still has the strength to support our society, even during a destabilizing crisis. That said, we must not take this stability for granted. We celebrate the incredible work of our grantees in this space, and commit to continuing our work to maintain a more balanced&nbsp;system.</p><p>Read more: <br><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-counterweights-to-power-83e7234aa958">Pillar Three: Building Counterweights to Power</a><br><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-counterweights-to-power-83e7234aa958">Pillar Two: Building an Anti-Racist and Inclusive Economy </a><br><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8">Pillar One: Grounding Our Economy in a New Ideas and Values</a><br><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and&nbsp;Economy</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-rebalancing-the-relationship-between-government-markets-and-cfc852658f5f">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Rebalancing the Relationship Between Government, Markets, and…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In Support of Tech Whistleblowers Who are Holding Tech to&nbsp;Account</p><p>Digital technology today is more widespread, more convenient, and more ubiquitous than ever before. With a strong Silicon Valley heritage, Omidyar Network recognizes that the promise and the ethos of technology has always been about it being a distributed good, empowering and connecting people all over the world. But as most people have experienced first-hand, today’s tech ecosystem is out of&nbsp;balance.</p><p>While technology pervades nearly every aspect of our lives, it remains largely unregulated with little oversight. A handful of tech giants wield tremendous, unchecked power, and has chosen repeatedly — in contravention of the original ideals of the tech community — profit over consumer, social, and market health. This outsized market dominance, social, and political power has the potential to threaten our individual freedoms, economies, and democracies.</p><p>With little competition, regulation, or other countervailing checks and balances, Big Tech has too much influence. Until recently, these platforms largely avoided meaningful public oversight which has allowed them to do as they wish, often at the expense of consumers, start-ups, and their employees.</p><p>Even as Big Tech’s reach has extended further and faster, it has remained largely opaque. We have had a nagging feeling that the harms they cause are known to them — and are far worse than the public could imagine. That has been validated as truth by a series of courageous whistleblowers who have spoken out and delivered evidence of wrongdoing and misconduct. We stand by them as they have put everything on the line to hold these tech giants to&nbsp;account.</p><p>For those who are considering blowing the whistle, we know that it is a difficult, and often dangerous and expensive decision. That’s why we supported tech leader and whistleblower, Ifeoma Ozoma, and her many partners in creating <a href="https://techworkerhandbook.org/">The Tech Worker Handbook,</a> a collection of resources for people “who are looking to make more informed decisions about whether to speak out on issues that are in the public interest.”</p><p>We are grateful to the brave people who have called out Big Tech for its bad behavior. They are an important part of creating systemic checks and balances for Big Tech. Because of them, policymakers are taking notice and taking action to rein in their excessive power and restore trust and balance in digital&nbsp;markets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/in-support-of-tech-whistleblowers-who-are-holding-tech-to-account-7fa5f66eac1c">In Support of Tech Whistleblowers Who are Holding Tech to Account</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-entrepreneur/"></a>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-startup-no-code-no-problem/">Wired writes</a>&nbsp;enterprising entrepreneurs are turning to Low Code methods as the ideal toolset for rapidly translating their ideas into working digital businesses. 
<p>In the opening paragraph they capture the very essence of this new technology trend. Prior, any aspiring entrepreneur without coding skills would need to hire developers, easily costing thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Low Code enables non-technical folks, like entrepreneurs, to create and publish working code. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>What is very potent about the Wired case study of Dani Bell, a British copywriter starting out on her own for the first time, is that they explain how she built her online business via a suite of Low Code tools, not just one.</p>
<p>She used <a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a> to create the online presence and <a href="https://www.airtable.com/">Airtable</a> for storing details about each job. She also used <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/docs/about/">Google Docs</a> and <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> to manage the sub-contracting of work.</p>
<p>Critically she also integrated these together using another Low Code tool: <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. In other words she achieved an entirely end-to-end integrated digital business system, entirely with Low Code, something that only a few years ago would have required a considerable and sophisticated development effort; now it has been abstracted and commoditized to the ultimate level of accessibility.</p>
<p>So this means it isn’t just another iteration of user-friendly web builder tools like Wix or Squarespace, but an expanding evolution of that sector to make enterprise-type Internet technologies both affordable and useable for the smallest of businesses.</p>
<p>In short it has dramatically lowered the barrier to entry for digital entrepreneurship for every one. Think of businesses like Uber Taxis or Airbnb, global scale ventures achieved primarily through technology capability, a capability that is now accessible to all, not just highly specialized, expensive developers.</p>
<p>Forward Partners&nbsp;describes in detail this <a href="https://forwardpartners.com/latest/how-no-code-movement-going-impact-entrepreneurship/">new model of entrepreneurship</a>, Science Direct <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352673421000299">offers this report</a>&nbsp;and TechCrunch explores the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/as-low-code-startups-continue-to-attract-vc-interest-whats-driving-customer-demand/">booming investment in the sector</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Model Driven Ventures 
<p>Another especially powerful aspect of this trend is a concept we call ‘Model Driven Ventures’. Quite simply this means a template-driven approach to creating new online businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_engineering">Model Driven techniques</a> have been popular in software development for many years, because the principle is ultra simple: Don’t reinvent the wheel, reuse already developed, proven modules.</p>
<p>We can abstract this principle to a level of business models, highlighting the goldmine that the industry offers. For example Low Code tools provider Bubble offers a <a href="https://bubble.io/templates">catalogue of templates</a> you can easily instantiate and then customize further using their service.</p>
<p>This catalogue is further expanded through their partner community. For example do you have an idea for a startup that is “Like Uber/Airbnb/Twitter, but with a twist of xyz…”, then you can simply buy the associated template for <a href="https://zeroqode.com/template/ridely---ride-sharing-like-uber-template-1501857279453x140151737882509310">Uber</a>/<a href="https://zeroqode.com/template/homebnb---rentals-like-airbnb-template-1528802772019x814394449850531800">Airbnb</a>/<a href="https://zeroqode.com/template/tweedly---microblogs-like-twitter-template-1535976363541x241207472950345730">Twitter</a> and do exactly that. What might have cost Airbnb $ hundreds of thousands you can have for less than $200.</p>
<p>Of course it’s not quite as simple as that, these templates still need customization work and that is still a form of developer cost, but it is still a magnitude cheaper and to the whole point of Low Code, it is work that you can far more easily do yourself.</p>
<p>To speed you on your way, our E-Learning course ‘<a href="https://lowcode.courses/courses/lowcode-ventures/">Low Code Ventures</a>‘ offers documented videos that walk through how to implement these templates.</p>

  <p>The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) is proud of its ongoing transparency initiatives. Namely its open approach to providing unrestricted access to the latest LEI data from around the world with the Quarterly LEI System Business Reports, which are made publicly available free of charge. Through this ‘LEI in Numbers’ blog series, GLEIF aims to highlight key data from the latest report, explaining trends and profiling successes from the global LEI rollout. </p>
<p>The latest report, covering Q3 2021, shows positive growth in the volume of LEIs worldwide. More than 60,000 LEIs were issued in Q3, representing a quarterly growth rate of 3.3%. This steady increase is welcome news as it is common for issuance levels over the summer months to slow. As a result, the total active LEI population is now 1.88 million. </p>
<p>For a further summary of the past quarter’s data, the below infographic contains the key statistics from Q3 2021. </p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/q3-2021-in-review-the-lei-in-numbers/q3-business-report-infographic_final-750x1994.jpg"></a>
<p>In Q3, Iceland was the largest growth market for LEI issuance, with one of the highest growth rates seen in 2021 (30.8%). This is another significant quarterly increase for Iceland. Between Q1 and Q2, it doubled its growth rate from 9.2% to 19%. This regional growth was driven largely by strong competition among LEI issuers.</p>
<p>Aside from growth in new LEI issuance, renewal rates grew across EU jurisdictions (65.5%, up from 65.0% in Q2) and non-EU jurisdictions (63.0%, up from 62.9% in Q2). The average renewal rate of jurisdictions with more than 1000 LEIs globally remained steady. This consistently high level of LEI issuance and renewals across multiple regions is testament to the maturity of the Global LEI System and its increasingly central role in bringing trust to ecosystems. </p>
<p>In Q3, a new issuer was onboarded into GLEIF’s network of Local Operating Units (LOUs): NordLEI. Previously, NordLEI had been operating as a registration agent in the Nordics before adjusting their status to LOU to actively drive greater LEI adoption across Northern Europe. </p>
<p>For the full report which includes further detail on the status of LEI issuance and growth potential, the level of competition between LEI issuing organizations in the Global LEI System and Level 1 and 2 reference data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Reports page. </p>
<p>If you are interested in reviewing the latest daily LEI data, our Global LEI System Statistics Dashboard contains daily statistics on the total and active number of LEIs issued. This feature now enables any user to review historical data by geography, increasing transparency on the overall progress of the LEI.</p>
<p>For further detail, or to access historical data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Report Archive. We look forward to sharing our progress each quarter as we continue to drive LEI adoption in 2021.</p>

				 <p>OKP4 takes on a European dimension by opening an office in Munich</p>
<p>While OKP4 is beginning to deploy its first use cases in France, particularly in agriculture and logistics, the company is now opening a German subsidiary in Munich. This is an opportunity for the company, specialized in the creation and animation of Data Spaces, to take on a European dimension that can be very essential when it comes to data issues.</p>
<p>OKP4 has officially launched its German subsidiary in Munich at the beginning of October 2021, in collaboration with SCE Space Cooperative Europe, founding member of aNewGovernance. OKP4 GmbH, the new subsidiary of the young Toulouse-based company, will be able to deploy OKP4’s Data Spaces offerings on the German market, particularly in agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>The creation of this subsidiary was also an opportunity for OKP4 GmbH to welcome Onecub, another founding member of aNewGovernance, into its capital for their expertise in digital identity management and consent management.</p>
<p>OKP4’s goals in Germany are clear: to establish Data Spaces projects within German organizations, but more importantly, to reinforce OKP4’s position as a reference in Europe about governance and Data Spaces management for organizations.</p>
<p>Emmanuel MONDON and Markus HAUSER of SCE seized this opportunity to organize a real learning expedition with interesting meetings such as: Invest in Bavaria (the development agency of the state of Bavaria), The Bayerischer Bauernverband (the Bavarian Farmers’ Union), and innovation consulting structures such as ARTTIC or EURA AG.</p>
<p>The founders of OKP4 GmbH also met with the heads of the TUM World Agricultural Systems Center (Hans Eisenmann-Forum for Agricultural Sciences) to discuss agricultural data sharing ecosystems and to consider academic collaborations in the context of European innovation projects (Eurostars 3 and Horizon Europe).</p>
<p>The European network of actors working on Data Spaces continues to grow and shows a growing dynamic with even more collaborations and more partnerships. Data Spaces are the future!</p>

<p>About OKP4<br>OKP4 is a start-up that develops Data Spaces which are digital commons infrastructures for sharing data. OKP4 creates the optimal conditions for sharing (not exchanging) data and turning it into knowledge by implementing a system for measuring contributions and organizing their remuneration.<br>More information on: okp4.com</p>

<p>Earlier this year a popular vote has rejected a proposed law on electronic identification (<a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/digital-identity-scheme-faces-scepticism-around-data-privacy/46399636"> results </a>).&nbsp; It was however very clear that a new solution has to be found soon as e-ID can be an important enabler for multiple use-cases and accelerate digitalisation of many daily processes for both the individuals and organisations, if done correctly.</p>
<p>Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) has started a <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/zielbild-e-id.html">public consultation</a>, which should inform Federal Council’s upcoming policy decision.&nbsp; A discussion paper “on the target vision for an e-ID” has been <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/en/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf.download.pdf/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf">published</a>, which explores a number of different options and approaches to the future of electronic identity.&nbsp; Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp; (SSI) has been highlighted as one of the possible options and a number of questions has been raised.</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity for DIDAS to provide in-depth commentary to the proposed vision and contribute our collective ideas and expertise to help make a well informed decision. Our submission (in German) is available <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stellungnahme-DIDAS-FINAL-V1.0-website.pdf">here</a></p>
<p>So what did we advocate for?</p>
<p>For us, the members of DIDAS, it was crucial to emphasise that the upcoming policy decision will determine the future of digitalisation efforts in Switzerland and, consequently,&nbsp; its position at&nbsp; international level. The authors of the discussion paper have proposed 3 “levels of&nbsp; ambition”:</p>
 
 e-ID ( secure identification option without media discontinuity&nbsp; – e.g. identity card that can be used in the digital world&nbsp; + login) 
 e-ID linked to other state-regulated proofs&nbsp; ( basic electronic identify + cryptographically linked additional attributes – e.g. driver’s license, diploma, COVID certificate, criminal record, etc) 
 Ecosystem of digital proofs&nbsp; ( e-ID is just one credential, other credentials that are independent of the e-ID are possible, government and private bodies can issue credentials&nbsp; ) 
 
<p>It’s very clear to us that only the Ecosystem of Digital Proofs (Level of Ambition 3) represents the actual ambition that is worth pursuing – creation of a true, future-proof and flexible foundation for digital Switzerland.&nbsp; To create such an ecosystem it’s important to adopt the right approach ( principles, technology, governance model, etc) and&nbsp; make sure that the government plays the appropriate role and enables rather than hinders the future growth and success of this ecosystem.</p>
<p>We have made strong argument in favour of focusing on adopting SSI principles and best practices as the foundation for Ambition Level 3.&nbsp; We highlighted and outlined both the advantages that this will bring ,as well as the open questions that still need to be addressed. E.g. on technology and legislation level.&nbsp; We know that SSI is not perfect yet, but we need to focus on the rapid progress that is being made ( as well as contribute to it) in order to create solid foundation that will last for years to come rather than make a short term decision in favour of something better understood but not designed for the ownership and privacy of the data, open ecosystems, transparent governance and flexibility.&nbsp; We are fully convinced that given the timeframe to draft and implement the future legislation we have ample opportunity and time to get it right!</p>
<p>We further argued that the Government will play an important, enabling role for the ecosystem and by adopting SSI can safely focus on the attributes (or verified credentials) that it has historically been providing. Thus facilitating a smooth transition from a paper-based world to&nbsp; a future, where verifiable data enables new levels of efficiency and flexibility without negatively affecting privacy for both the individuals and organisations.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to the future collaboration with relevant governmental agencies and policy makers that are engaged in decision making process. We’ll continue to explain and promote SSI. Many of our members already implement solutions using SSI principals and technology stack – we happy to provide this expertise to help build the true digital foundation for the future of Swiss Confederation.</p>

<p>First review of updated specification - ends November 11th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC are pleased to announce that Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via HTTPS Version 1.1 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. HTTP over TLS (HTTPS) provides an authenticated, ordered, lossless delivery of uniquely-identified messages. This document specifies the use of HTTP over TLS as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2 Messages. A testing conformance target is provided to support interoperability testing without security mechanisms.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>We spoke with Alberta Abbey, LEI Analyst, Data &amp; Analytics, LSEG to discuss how this initiative will support wider adoption of globally recognized business identities, in the form of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), across Africa and how to encourage more entities across Africa to obtain LEIs.</p>
<p>LSEG performs an important role in the Global LEI System as a LEI Issuer, also known as a Local Operating Unit (LOU). LEI Issuers are accredited by GLEIF to issue LEIs to legal entities, supplying registration, renewal and other services, and acting as the LEI system’s primary interface with legal entities. They also work in cooperation with Validation Agents, a new operational model within the system which allows financial institutions to obtain and maintain LEIs for their clients, to support their issuance workflows. </p>
<p>What was LSEG’s role within this flagship initiative? </p>
<p>As the LEI issuing organisation, we provide training and ongoing support to the African Validation Agent.</p>
<p>Why did you decide to become involved with the initiative?</p>
<p>LSEG joined this initiative to facilitate wider LEI adoption across Africa. By demonstrating the uses and benefits of LEIs, our aim is that this project will encourage more entities across Africa to obtain LEIs. We started the project with a partnership approach, which we intend to continue beyond the pilot.</p>
<p>As the 2nd largest issuer of LEIs globally, this project is a good opportunity to partner with the African agent to make LEIs more easily accessible across the continent.</p>
<p>As the LEI Issuer in the Africa LEI initiative, what benefits does LSEG hope to realize through its participation, for itself and also for the banks and SMEs in the region? </p>
<p>We’re pleased to be working with NMB Bank, which is the Validation Agent. Through the collaboration, we’re providing the platform that gives entities in the region access to obtain LEIs, thereby making their status internationally verifiable through GLEIF.</p>

<p>Session Description:</p>
<p>As governments start to issue digital versions of their driving licenses, national IDs and passports, we anticipate demand by relying parties to be able to accept them both in the real world (TSA checkpoints, bars, retailers, &amp; beyond) and on the web and in apps too. How will this work?</p>
<p>We welcome the community to join for a rich discussion to learn about the current landscape and established standards (e.g. ISO 18013-5 and Open ID Connect SIOP), and what we might expect from standards in development like ISO18013-7 and ISO 23220. Where is the line between standards and private company services providing OS services? How can the community facilitate scale adoption, to realize the ecosystem wide benefits more swiftly? We will also discuss the linkages between mobile driving licenses, verifiable credentials, and self sovereign identities, and where they converge and compete.</p>

 Digital trust summit a call for action to address Aotearoa’s digital identity challenges. 



<p>The Digital Trust Hui Taumata/Summit will headline next year’s Techweek22 festival and provide an opportunity for a cross-section of stakeholders to share insights on building a thriving trust economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scheduled for the 19th of May at TSB Auditorium, and with a one-day programme featuring keynote talks, panels, use cases and roundtable discussions, the Digital Trust Summit is a must-attend event for all those invested in the future of New Zealand’s digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>Personal data is the new currency of the digital economy. Used effectively, this data can deliver benefits for individuals, businesses and government. But as Aotearoa reaches its digital adolescence, pertinent questions remain:</p>



  How will identity, security and experience integrate?  How can citizens maintain sovereignty over their personal data?  What underpins a successful transition toward open finance?  How will Te Ao Māori be woven into Aotearoa’s Digital Identity?  What are the global opportunities for New Zealand as a ‘trusted digital economy’?  



<p></p>



<p>The speed of our digital transformation and the benefits it delivers for society has much to do with trust. That is to say, declining trust in the way personal information is secured, validated and applied will prevent us from realising the collective economic benefits of digital. With an undoubtedly kiwi flavour, the Digital Trust Hui will seek to answer these questions and more with the help of local and international leaders.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Like many institutions, Bergen Community College (BCC) — a 2-year associate’s degree-granting institution based in Paramus, New Jersey, and the largest community college in the state — faced challenges to its instructional model in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The transition to online learning represented a shift not only for students, but also for many of the college’s faculty, who had little prior experience teaching online. Following the first year of the pandemic, in which the institution experienced the challenges and opportunities of online learning first hand, instructional leadership identified the need for more structured professional development tailored to online learning delivery. Bolstered by a student survey which indicated the need for more robust, quality online learning experiences and HEERF grant funding, BCC sought a partner to build professional development and student resources.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>As a nonprofit technology partner, Edge was uniquely positioned to support BCC’s need for online learning professional development. Edge’s Online Learning &amp; Instructional Technology Acceleration (OLITA) program provides a suite of services, including professional development, designed to rapidly enhance an institution’s ability to deliver online learning. The Edge team, led by Chief Digital Learning Officer Joshua Gaul and Member Account Manager Erin Brink, worked closely with Amarjit Kaur, Managing Director of the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL) at BCC, and the institution’s faculty support team, to develop a professional development roadmap to meet the specific needs of BCC’s faculty.<br>
</p>
<p>“Finding a way to develop online teaching expertise for all of our faculty is key,” said Kaur. “While we did have a distance learning mentor program in place and faculty were able to look to them for ad hoc guidance over the last year, there was a need to develop a structured professional development program for remote instruction. We looked to Edge to help us bring all of our faculty up to a baseline on &nbsp; remote teaching. You cannot survive as an instructor in modern higher education if you don’t have the basic skills to adapt your course to a new modality – whether online, hybrid, hyflex, or other models. We’re preparing our faculty for that reality.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		 Institution Summary<br>
 
<p>Customer Name: Bergen Community College<br>
Main Campus: Paramus<br>
Locations: 3<br>
Number of Students: 12,500+<br>
Number of Faculty/Staff: 1,500+</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Rather than a “how-to” guide to use a specific tool or set of tools online, the Edge team created a “Fundamentals of Online Teaching” professional development program focused on applying teaching theory to the online, hybrid, and hyflex modalities. The result was a detailed, standardized, self-paced course consisting of five modules that the college’s instructors would take on their own. Following the completion of each module, the faculty will come together with Edge experts and their peers for a roundtable session to review the content of the module, ask questions, and connect with colleagues to discuss what they’ve learned. This model creates a feeling of community and common cause for BCC’s instructors while also helping to inform the creation of future professional development modules based on specific areas of need for BCC’s faculty.</p>
<p>By collaborating closely with academic leadership in the development of the professional development program, the Edge team ensured buy-in and a positive experience from the BCC community. The course modules were also designed to be delivery-system agnostic, so that the college could allow instructors to take the self-paced courses via a web browser, or within the LMS of their choice.</p>
<p>“Working with Edge isn’t like going out to commercial providers and trying to pick the service from a mass-market menu that best fits your needs,” said Kaur. “It’s a true partnership. Edge has been able to create a customized professional development program that includes the institution’s existing academic support services, enabling us to expand instructional support to reach all faculty and students in the online setting.”</p>
<p>Alongside the professional development program for instructors, Edge developed a “Fundamentals of Online Learning” course for students, applying similar principles to the faculty professional development course. As a result, both instructors and students will be prepared to engage in a positive, unified online learning experience, paving the way for increasing student satisfaction and improved student success in online courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Fundamentals of Online Learning course Edge created for our students prepares them for the new online learning spaces we’re creating and The Fundamental of Online Teaching for our teachers provides foundational knowledge for remote teaching, when needed,” Kaur said.</p>

<p>New rules for JSON syntax - review ends October 22nd</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that Business Document Naming and Design Rules (BDNDR) Version 1.1 from the UBL TC [1] is now available for public review and comment. This is the third public review for BDNDR v1.1.</p>



 Overview 



<p>An important and powerful method to design interoperable business documents is to construct logical semantic models using concepts described in the UN/CEFACT Core Components Technical Specification (CCTS) Version 2.01. From these semantic models one can create physical syntax models with which to express the content constraints of actual business documents to be interchanged.</p>



<p>The OASIS Business Document Naming and Design Rules (BDNDR) Version 1.1 Draft Specification prescribes a set of naming and design rules used to create complete CCTS models of interoperable business documents. It also includes the rules needed to create validation artefacts corresponding to them. For XML syntax, the rules govern creating W3C Schema (XSD) and OASIS Context/value Association (CVA) validation artefacts. For JSON syntax, the rules govern creating JSON Schema validation artefacts.</p>



<p>BDNDR Version 1.1 changes no rules for XML syntax from BDNDR Version 1.0 and only adds the new rules prescribed for JSON syntax.</p>



<p>The specification documents and related files are available here:</p>

<p>The Internet is one of the most extraordinary developments in human history. It is connecting the world farther, faster, and deeper than any previous communications network. It is steadily digitizing every company, industry, and economy it touches. And it is establishing new pathways for information of all types to flow.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, all of this has come with a growing downside. The Internet wasn’t designed with an integrated layer for digital identity, security, and privacy. As a result, we are now suffering from cybersecurity and cyberprivacy problems so severe that they have at times brought entire companies and industries to their knees.</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation was launched in May 2020 to tackle this problem at its very core: to define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust. It combines cryptographic assurance at the machine layers and human accountability at the business, legal, and social layers. While ambitious, this mission is so urgent and essential that the Foundation has grown from its initial 27 founding member organizations to over ten times that number in just one year.</p>



<p>As part of the Foundation’s launch, working groups were established from the dedicated efforts of our founding members and volunteers. What those groups have accomplished in their first year has been phenomenal. Specifications, recommendations, guides, white papers, and glossaries have all been delivered. Through the groups’ efforts the Foundation has supported Digital Trust advances in many organizations and operations, especially important as the world grapples with the pandemic and the voluminous increase in everyday online activity.</p>







<p>Here’s a small taste of what our working groups have been up to since their inception last year.</p>



 Technology Stack Working Group (TSWG) 



<p>The TSWG provides guidance and specifications that support the ToIP 4-layer model from a technical standpoint.</p>



<p>The TSWG has, amongst many accomplishments:</p>



  Created and pushed a Task Force recommendation that constructs a mapping of Kim Cameron’s “Laws of Identity”  Created a task force in late 2020 to create early specifications for Authentic Chained Data Containers. This task force is focused on the semantics of source provenance, authorization provenance, and delegation.  Focused the Interoperability Task Force on the creation of interoperability test suites that leverage and extend the Hyperledger Aries test suites. Multiple underlying Layer-1 technologies are being examined as well.&nbsp;  Focused the Technical Architecture Task Force on building the TSS (ToIP Standard Specification) that defines the overall technical requirements for the four layers of the ToIP Stack  Created a Trust Registry Task Force to handle creation of the specifications and API (OpenAPI 3.0 compatible) for trust registries. This work was spawned from the urgent need identified by the Good Health Pass Interoperability Working Group.  



 Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG) 



<p>The GSWG specifies tools, templates, and other resources for developing governance frameworks (collections of rules and policies). These, in turn, support the integration of the legal, business, and social components of Digital Trust.</p>



<p>The GSWG has, amongst many accomplishments:</p>



  Made steady progress with the ToIP Governance Architecture TSS  Advanced the ToIP Governance Metamodel to the point where the GSWB now plans to issue it as a separate specification (apart from the ToIP Governance Architecture TSS), along with an associated Companion Guide  Contributed heavily to the governance framework recommendations in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint  Advised the authors of several ToIP-based governance framework projects in the market  Initiated a Trust Assurance Task Force focusing on governance risk assessment and accountability  Drafted a Risk Assessment Worksheet Template and associated Companion Guide&nbsp;  



 Ecosystem Foundry Working Group (EFWG) 



<p>The EFWG facilitates a community of practice among governance authorities, implementers, operators, and service providers of Trust over IP Layer-4 ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EFWG has, amongst many accomplishments:</p>



  Formed the Internet of Research Ecosystem Task Force to pioneer implementation of academic resource identifiers ecosystems for the research community  Created the COVID-19 Credentials Governance Framework Task Force to develop reference materials, best practices, and templates that enable diverse organizations to respond with technology  Formed the YOMA Ecosystem Task Force to create a ToIP-based Governance Framework to positively impact youth and local communities around the world  Formed the Human Trafficking Safety Response Task Force to research the use of ToIP models to effect the transformation of global human trafficking response  Drafted the initial Ecosystem Foundry Concepts and Workflow Model to aid ecosystem development and operation  



 Utility Foundry Working Group (UFWG)&nbsp; 



<p>As with the EFWG, the UFWG also facilitates a community of practice among governance authorities, implementers, operators, and service providers, but instead for Trust over IP Layer-1 utilities.</p>



<p>The UFWG has, amongst many accomplishments:</p>



  Worked alongside utility conveners to document their utility into story formats  Committed best practice documents to the WG GitHub Repository, such as Decentralized Network Best Practices and Decentralized Network Design Principles  Worked to publish a public UFWG paper with which will incorporate many of our outputs as well as case studies from utility projects we’ve interfaced with  Committed to expanding the coverage of the UFWG to non-Indy-based&nbsp;ledgers.  



 Inputs and Semantics Working Group (ISWG)&nbsp; 



<p>The ISWG provides an open forum for discussing the concepts and components that will ultimately shape a Dynamic Data Economy (DDE), a safe and secure decentralized data sharing economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ISWG has, amongst many accomplishments:<br></p>



  Delivered whitepapers such as Decentralized Resource Identifiers in the Research Landscape  Contributed to the Good Health Interoperability Blueprint (“GHP Blueprint”), such as for “Standard Data Models and Elements” and “Security, Privacy, and Data Protection”  Housed the Health Care Task Force (HCTF) that led to GHP Blueprint recommendations  Defined a privacy controller credential to ensure trustworthiness for the use of decentralized identifiers across ecosystems  Facilitated several presentations from external presenters of storage and portability solutions  Tackled important security concepts such as data correlation attacks, machine-readable data agreements, and data protection requirements  



 Concepts and Terminology Working Group (CTWG) 



<p>The CTWG analyzes and maintains terminology requirements of stakeholder groups within and outside the ToIP Foundation.</p>



<p>The CTWG has, amongst many accomplishments:</p>



  Maintained glossaries for the reuse of terms across groups, with mapping of terms and definitions across groups to encourage harmonization  Surveyed the available terminology development and maintenance tools on the market  Authored its own specification for a ToIP Term tool  Innovated with an approach called “terms wikis” to enable different stakeholder groups to develop and maintain glossaries in their own contexts.  



 Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass (IWG-GHP) 



<p>The IWG-GHP facilitated a community of practice among implementers, issuers, holders, verifiers, governance authorities, and other participants within the Good Health Pass digital trust ecosystem.</p>



<p>The IWG-GHP has, amongst many accomplishments:</p>



  Authored a blueprint based on an outline created by ID2020, going live in June 2021  



  Coordinated the meeting and responses of ten different drafting groups  Completed a 150-page report, the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint, that makes key recommendations on how to reopen global travel with verifiable credentials for sharing COVID-19 health status (tests, vaccinations, and recovery).

	<p>October 8, 2021 Update:&nbsp; Comment from the Executive Director:</p>
<p>TLDR: The Me2B Alliance believes apps including the AskingPoint SDK should be safe from malicious redirects or other exploits. </p>
<p>After publishing this blog yesterday, the Me2B Alliance received yet another communication from the Apple product security team. Turns out, the real story here is about how Apple responds to responsible security vulnerability disclosures from well-intentioned people and organizations like the Me2B Alliance. Instead of communicating openly and truthfully with the Me2B Alliance, Apple instead chose to feign ignorance through our ongoing series of emails. The Me2B Alliance approached Apple in all diligence and earnestness. And in return we received slow, sporadic and misleading responses.</p>
<p>So what happened since we published this blog? Yesterday, Apple reported to the Me2B Alliance that they were indeed the purchaser of the URL. (Note that we have not confirmed this.)</p>
<p>Which means they knew full well the risks of the dangling domain to the 150+ iOS apps on potentially millions of devices, and their responsibility in keeping iOS apps safe for people.</p>
<p>The good news is that the domain no longer appears to be a risk for those 150+ apps and the potentially millions of users.</p>
<p>The bad news is that Apple could have been more forthcoming and honest with us out of the gate, saving us substantial time and effort that could be spent on other research.</p>
<p>One might reasonably ask:</p>
 
 Why did Apple continue to claim they didn’t understand the risk—even in the email from yesterday? 
 Why didn’t Apple acknowledge their action of purchasing the domain when we pointedly asked them on September 29, right after the domain had been purchased? 
 Why did Apple go to some effort to obfuscate their ownership of the domain [i.e. how they purchased it]? 
 
<p>These are, I fear, rhetorical questions. Presumably, the answer to all of these questions is that Apple behaved the way they did to make sure there was not even a whiff of culpability. This attitude of “protect the organization at all costs” is the root source of quite possibly the worst of all the harms technology can bring to individuals and society. We saw it this week on a global stage with the Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen. And I witnessed it myself on a smaller scale with ongoing interaction with the Apple product security team.</p>
<p>Others in the technical community have far more experience with security bug reporting than I, and apparently Apple’s less than stellar reputation in this arena is common knowledge. This is my first experience with it and I can’t express how shocked and disappointed I am.</p>
<p>Our intention here at the Me2B Alliance isn’t to antagonize the makers of technology—in fact, it’s the opposite. We want to help makers of technology create safer, more respectful technology. In the past year and a half that we’ve been conducting product testing, quite often we’ve seen that the supply chain is no longer readily understood by vendors—it’s gotten out of control. It’s been an eye-opening revelation, and in particular we want to help vendors better understand their software supply chain.</p>
<p>To have one of the world’s largest platform providers, however, engage in a disingenuous and quite possibly deliberately deceitful manner with a non-profit org about an obvious systemic security flaw is infuriating and unacceptable.</p>
<p>Funny thing about this whole situation: we discovered this AskingPoint security vulnerability completely by chance—in the course of other work. As we note in the blog, our primary research focus right now is on what we believe to be an even larger story.</p>
<p>But, to my surprise, it’s clear that there are two large stories, due to Apple’s questionable handling of our responsible disclosure of a serious security vulnerability.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

	 
 

	 
	 

 

	
	<p>Over the past month, the Me2B Alliance product testing team has been investigating something we refer to as “dangling domains” and the risks they pose to people, especially children and families.</p>
<p>A “dangling domain” refers to any URL/domain previously owned by a legitimate organization or business, but which has been either abandoned due to the business shutting down, or due to a mistake where the organization or business forgets to renew their own domain.</p>
<p>It is far more common than many people realize that local schools and government organizations across the United States register seemingly random domains in order to host a website for a specific purpose or program. It seems like a great idea at the time, but time passes, personnel turns over, and credit cards on the site registrar expire resulting in a “dangling domain.” These dangling domains are available for purchase by anyone, anywhere in the world. If a malicious group purchases a dangling domain, they can set up a new advertising/user data ingestion architecture (honeypots) at the URL, send pop-ups and other scams, and potentially conduct other exploits against the app or users, depending on how each app is set up. Our research has confirmed this behavior.</p>
<p>In a soon-to-be released Spotlight Report, we will be explaining in more detail our “dangling domain” findings as they relate to school utility apps, illuminating significant risks for children, parents and school administrators — and we will highlight advertising companies profiting off the sale of kids’ data.</p>
<p><br>
Issue</p>
<p>Today’s post, however, focuses on one specific dangling domain – AskingPoint.com –&nbsp; for a company who provided software (SDKs) integrated into mobile apps which we found to be potentially integrated into over 150 iOS apps. We found the dangling domain a couple weeks ago, and last week the domain was purchased by a presently-unknown entity.</p>
<p>Through testing of about 33% of these 150+ iOS apps, about 50% of the apps tested are still attempting to connect to the AskingPoint.com server to receive code, a connection that is currently broken, but could turn back on at any moment via the new domain owners. These currently-broken requests to the dangling domain were occurring the moment certain apps were opened, without any control for the app users.</p>
<p><br>
Details</p>
<p>AskingPoint was founded in 2012 and according to their website, in 2018 their SDK was being used in “thousands of apps” and “on over 250 million devices.” This statement is slightly dated, but AskingPoint was historically installed on iOS apps with hundreds of thousands of ratings/reviews, and some of the Android apps that previously used Askingpoint had millions or tens of millions of users. Our team is unable to know exactly how many devices currently have apps installed on them who make requests to the dangling AskingPoint.com domain, but we would anticipate at least several million devices could potentially be at risk of unexpected user data ingestions, ad fraud, or scams/pop-ups/malicious redirects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Self-Reported Reach of AskingPoint SDK (from Feb 3, 2018 AskingPoint.com archived website on Wayback Machine)</p>
<p>AskingPoint.com was originally owned by KnowFu, who seems to have closed around 2018-2019. This company had “orchestration” features that focused on swapping out advertising vendors, and for many apps, the AskingPoint request is the first or nearly the first request to fire when someone opens the app.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: AskingPoint SDK Capabilities (Historical Snapshot via Wayback Machine)</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for an SDK company to go out of business — it’s expensive to ingest lots of data, and the mobile software space is extremely competitive — solid products go out of business or are sold regularly. At its height, AskingPoint’s website boasted that they were installed on hundreds of millions of devices.</p>
<p>Currently, according to AppFigures.com, AskingPoint is installed on 159 apps, with 155 being built for iOS (including iMessage and Apple TV). Historically there were Android apps, but it seems only two remain active (see Figure 3). To view a full list of the apps that AppFigures.com SDK database determined still have the AskingPoint SDK, <a href="https://me2ba.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apps-with-askingpoint-sdk-appfigures-oct-2021.pdf">click here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: Breakdown of Apps with AskingPoint SDK (source: AppFigures.com)</p>
<p>Of the 155 Apple iOS apps that still have the AskingPoint SDK installed, from our local tests of about 1/3rd of these apps, we found only about half of the apps were sending data to AskingPoint from the client side. It’s possible that all the apps had the AskingPoint SDK still integrated, but due to the domain being down, many of these integrations could potentially break before sending any client data. For the apps that did try to send data to the dangling domain the app would basically make a request to an old URL on AskingPoint.com and a specific javascript file, but the request would create a 500 “not found” error, basically a 404/not found error. The new owner of this domain could “fix this file” and start to serve unexpected javascript to users, through apps already installed on their phones.</p>
<p>Prior to this research being published, and during the time when the Me2B Alliance first discovered the AskingPoint SDK’s dangling domain, if you visited AskingPoint.com directly, you would see that the domain was available for purchase for $3,695.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4: Askingpoint.com Domain available for Sale</p>
<p>Once our team realized that there were a wide variety of kids games, crypto apps, and other unique iOS apps that had a dangling domain for a powerful SDK integrated into them, with the domain also being for sale, we immediately sent an email to Apple (specifically, to product-security@apple.com) to request that they purchase the domain, in order to protect the potentially millions of users who were still using any one of these 150+ apps.</p>
<p>Two days after our original email, we sent an additional email with more details, including Figure 1 (above) which showed the potential magnitude/reach of the problem. At this point, we received a human response indicating that they would have someone review the problem.</p>
<p>We continued to wait for Apple to confirm they had purchased the domain.</p>
<p>Then last week, one week after our original email to Apple, suddenly the parked domain was no longer available, i.e. it had been purchased. But by whom?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 5: Askingpoint.com No Longer for Sale</p>
<p>Did Apple buy this domain?</p>
<p>Nope. (Well, apparently not; we have still not received a confirmation one way or the other.)</p>
<p>Upon seeing the domain purchased, we immediately sent a semi-panicked email to Apple’s product security team asking them if they purchased the domain. Approximately 48 hours after the domain was purchased (and our query to Apple), we received a message late&nbsp;on a Friday afternoon&nbsp;that implied that Apple had not purchased the dangling domain of AskingPoint.com. Shockingly, in this reply&nbsp; – 10 days after our original report of the security risk&nbsp;– Apple asked for “some additional details…to better understand the possible security impact of this issue.” So not only had they apparently not purchased the domain, but it seems that Apple hadn’t even begun to process the information and risks to end-users. (It should also be noted that we spelled out the problem very clearly in our initial email, including an Excel list of all 150+ apps. And our follow-up email made the potential magnitude – “millions of devices” – clear.)</p>
<p>So now here we are, a week after the domain was purchased, with no information on the new owners or their intent, and a brief audit confirmed that the broken requests are still flowing from the apps, just waiting for a new server to be turned on at AskingPoint.com.</p>
<p>Our testing team at the Me2B Alliance also reached out to the former founder and CEO of AskingPoint, who seemingly hasn’t been involved in the business for a few years. We haven’t heard back at the time of this writing. We will update this post with any new details as they arrive. We believe that it’s very common for software businesses to shut down, and don’t believe that the former AskingPoint team has an obligation beyond notifying their own customers (which seemingly happened).</p>
<p>Our team believes that this “dangling domain” problem is a reality of software supply chains and believe that Apple and Google, and any marketplace that allows apps with unique vendors integrated into those apps, need to have policies to monitor and acquire dangling domains, and deal with the ramifications of a supply chain compromise when a domain isn’t purchased.</p>
<p><br>
Recap</p>
<p>As it stands, several weeks ago, the Me2B Alliance found a dangling domain that we could have purchased at any moment for $3,695. Due to the size of our organization, we reached out to Apple to make this purchase and Apple failed to take action for 7 days before the domain was acquired by a new entity. Two days after that, Apple appeared ready to start looking at the problem.</p>
<p>We have no idea who now owns this dangling domain; whether they are in the advertising/audience business, or whether they have any malicious intent. We believe that there are significant risks from dangling domains, and that companies like Apple and Google need clear policies and procedures to quickly acquire dangling domains. Right now, we believe that there are 150+ apps in the iOS store, and apps in other stores that have an SDK integrated into them that sends data to an AskingPoint.com endpoint, which was up for sale for $3,695.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, AskingPoint was bragging about collecting data from hundreds of millions of devices. Today, no organizations seem to be collecting data from these endpoints….yet. But in the days and weeks ahead, will there be new supply chain injections against 150+ semi-popular iOS apps used by a wide range of people, including numerous mobile games used by kids?</p>
<p>Everyone who worked on this issue at the Me2B Alliance wants to make it clear that we are deeply disappointed in the way Apple responded to this issue and discouraged that more immediate action wasn’t taken when it was brought to their attention. It’s clear that Apple’s product security team needs a better process for these complex data supply chain disruptions.</p>

<p><br>
Additional Note on Local Schools’ Use of .com and .org Domains</p>
<p>Additionally, many of these domains are not on .gov domain suffixes, but instead on .com, .org and other domain suffixes that have no requirements for any other person across the world to re-register one of these dangling domains.</p>
<p>Another way explain this risk: if more schools and local governments used .gov domains for their websites, they would have a slightly slower process to register these domains, but it would also be impossible for them to lose the domains to other random people across the world — there is no such thing as a “dangling domain” on the .gov domain instance, only “compromised domains” or other technical accidents — but the concept of losing control of a domain and not being able to re-establish control doesn’t exist on .gov domains, which is a core reason why, perhaps, schools and local government organizations should be required to shift their ad hoc websites to only use approved .gov domains.</p>

<p>In December 2019, members elected the first Digital Identity NZ Executive Council. The Council is the governing group for the association; providing guidance and direction as we navigate the developing world of digital identity in Aotearoa. Each Council member is elected for a two-year term, with elections held annually and results notified at the AGM in December. So, as we approach the end of the year it is time for us to call for nominations for the Council seats coming up for re-election.<br><br>This year, there are seven&nbsp;positions up for election, x3 positions in the Major Corporate, x3 positions in the Corporate Other, and x1 position for the SME/Start-up category.<br><br>When we formed the Executive Council we asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. You did that. The power of that diversity has shone through in the work of the Council this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.<br><br>As the Council has considered its own makeup, we’ve identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those involved in the business and service sectors and kaupapa Māori organisations are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. Digital Identity NZ has a policy on Board diversity which you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6cd211649fd1d09c759c0112f&amp;id=50a0dc76a6&amp;e=40f3555481">here.</a><br><br>Once elected in December, one of the first responsibilities of the new Council will be to elect a new Chair for the EC Council or consider re-electing the current chair. Following the departure of David Morrison, who served as Chair of our organisation since 2018, in February 2021, the council elected Ben Tairea as the new Chair, and both are excellent Kairahi (guides/counsellors/leaders). Currently supporting Ben diligently are Sat Mandri, co-chair and Tamara Al-Salim, deputy chair and their serving terms are through to 2022.<br><br>2022 is a pivotal year for digital identity with the introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We are looking forward to some stellar nominations to help us in exploring and pursuing the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference in 2022 and beyond. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Corporations, Capital Markets, &amp; the Common Good — How We’re Working to Reorient the Rules and Rebalance Power in Our&nbsp;Economy</p><p>By Chris Jurgens, Director, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>At Omidyar Network, we believe business can be a powerful force for good. This is a belief rooted in Pierre Omidyar’s founding of eBay and in Omidyar Network’s decade of experience investing in impact-oriented entrepreneurs. Businesses play an essential role in creating profitable solutions that benefit customers, address societal problems, sustain quality jobs, and support healthy communities.</p><p>We’ve seen particularly powerful examples of this during the COVID crisis, as corporations mobilized their research and development capabilities to invent new vaccines and leveraged global supply chains to distribute them at unprecedented speed and scale. Thousands of companies small and large responded to the needs of their employees, their customers, and their communities with compassion and&nbsp;care.</p><p>But while many individual businesses are making a positive impact, at the macro level, our corporations and capital markets are not delivering the societal outcomes we need. The current paradigm of shareholder-driven capitalism is serving as an engine of inequality and a major impediment to addressing our most pressing societal challenges — persistent structural racism, a fraying social contract, and an accelerating climate crisis. Many of these problems have only been exacerbated by the pandemic.</p><p>Essential workers have been on the frontlines of sustaining our economy through the depths of this crisis, at significant risk to themselves and their families, despite an economic system that too often does not fairly value or respect their contributions to it. In this country, the average <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/windfall-profits-and-deadly-risks/">grocery store cashier makes about $11 an hour</a>, and a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/3/15872260/health-direct-care-jobs">home health care aide</a> makes $25–27,000 a year — levels where it’s hard to make ends&nbsp;meet.</p><p>Meanwhile, the stock market has soared during COVID, and the richest shareholders have added <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/the-wealth-gains-that-made-2020-a-banner-year-for-the-richest-1">$4 trillion</a> to their wealth in just the last year. Most essential workers have not meaningfully benefited from this windfall. The top 10% of the income distribution own of 84% of stock, while half of Americans own none and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity-business-us-news-ap-top-news-69fe836e19a8dfe89d73e8e4be6d480c">Black households</a> own only 1.9%. While we are starting to see encouraging signs of a reviving economy, most Americans have fallen further behind in the last two years and overall <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/covid-pandemic-made-racial-income-inequality-much-worse">inequality has worsened</a>.</p><p>We are seeing these outcomes — more concentrated wealth and power, declining economic mobility — because our economic system has been designed to produce them. W. Edwards Deming, a pioneer of <a href="https://deming.org/category/systems-thinking/">systems thinking</a>, stated that “every system is perfectly designed to get the results it gets.” The version of capitalism that currently governs our markets is designed not to produce societal wellbeing, but to maximize returns to shareholders.</p><p>Over the last several decades, a set of beliefs, norms, rules, and laws have served to codify and entrench the idea that a business’s primary objective should be maximizing financial returns for equity holders in markets with minimal government intervention, and that this orientation will both deliver optimal outcomes for business and markets as well as for society writ&nbsp;large.</p><p>This model has failed. It is based on the wrong ideas, driving the wrong decisions, and delivering exactly what you would expect — wealth for shareholders, but problems for society. To fix this, we need to rewire the rules and incentives that are driving the&nbsp;system.</p><p>The Path Forward, from Individual Solutions to Systems&nbsp;Change</p><p>At Omidyar Network, we spent a decade supporting the growth of impact investing and working to harness the power of business to drive positive social and environmental outcomes. We’re proud of that work. But we’ve realized that the efforts of even the most well-intentioned companies and investors to contribute to positive impact won’t ultimately succeed at the scale we need unless we fix the underlying rules and incentives that wire the markets in which they operate — rules that too often reward decisions which generate financial returns for shareholders but are harmful for&nbsp;society.</p><p>The current system constrains what individual businesses or investors can achieve on their own — because the system is designed to reward returns to shareholders and punish actions which deviate from that result. We’ve seen time and again that this system is resilient, and it will strike&nbsp;back.</p><p>Just ask former CEOs <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/76cddc3e-d42e-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44">Paul Polman of Unilever</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankvangansbeke/2021/03/20/sustainability-and-the-downfall-of-danone-ceo-faber-12/?sh=107f7feb5b16">Emmanuel Faber of Danone</a>, among the most visionary champions for corporate purpose and stakeholder-centric decision making. Both pushed their companies to prioritize stakeholder and societal outcomes as part of long-term value creation strategies, and both were punished by activist investors who saw this as violating the orthodoxy of short-term profit maximization.</p><p>Individual businesses are fundamentally constrained by the pressures of competition and the demands from our capital markets. They can move on win-win scenarios, where investments or policies that improve ESG outcomes can also be clearly shown to benefit the bottom line. But let’s be honest. Not everything can be a win-win. Often, there’s a direct tension between what insatiable profit-maximizing market forces demand in the short-term and what delivers value for long-term investors and other stakeholders. In this context, we can’t rely on the voluntary actions of corporate leaders alone — we need structural solutions which change the incentives.</p><p>We also recognize the need to address both sides of the impact coin. We believe investors can contribute to tremendous positive impact by investing in solutions that solve societal and environmental problems — but this risks being outweighed by the <a href="https://29kjwb3armds2g3gi4lq2sx1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/210922_IMP_Negative-Investor-Contribution_Discussion-doc.pdf">negative impacts</a> generated by those financial sector actors that drive extractive speculation, prioritize short-term distributions to equity holders over long term value creation, and powerfully reinforce the current paradigm of profit maximization without regard for societal costs. Unless we address the rules that both enable positive impact, and curb negative impacts, our markets won’t deliver the outcomes we&nbsp;need.</p><p>That’s why as part of our commitment to <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Reimagining Capitalism</a>, Omidyar Network is committing $10 million to a new focus area: Corporations, Capital Markets, and the Common Good. The vision for this work is to reshape the rules that govern markets to incentivize corporations and their investors to contribute to the common good, curb the pressures that drive businesses to contribute to negative outcomes on people and the planet, and empower stakeholders to hold companies accountable for their impacts on&nbsp;society.</p><p>To realize this vision, we’re shifting our work with business and investors to two upstream issues which we think are critical to systems change — shifting policy and shifting&nbsp;power.</p><p>Reorienting the&nbsp;Rules</p><p>We think three shifts are key to rewiring the rules that drive corporate and investor decision&nbsp;making.</p><p>First, the rules — particularly those defining <a href="https://theshareholdercommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/From-Shareholder-Primacy-to-Stakeholder-Capitalism-TSC-and-B-Lab-White-Paper.pdf">fiduciary duty</a> — should reinforce that corporations are accountable to workers, customers, suppliers, and communities — not solely shareholders. Second, the rules should drive businesses to <a href="https://impactmanagementproject.com/">systematically account for their impacts on people and planet</a>, so that companies can better manage their impacts, and stakeholders can hold those companies accountable. Third, the rules need to curb pressures from capital markets that reinforce short-termism, drive excessive financialization, and enable outright extraction to benefit speculators at the expense of stakeholders and&nbsp;society.</p><p>This is why we are partnering with a range of advocacy organizations — including <a href="https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/">Americans for Financial Reform</a>, <a href="https://bcorporation.net/about-b-lab">B Lab</a>, and <a href="https://www.valuereportingfoundation.org/">The Value Reporting Foundation</a> — seeking to shift corporate governance rules, create a harmonized system of mandatory <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2021/06/10/500352/sec-broad-authority-require-climate-esg-disclosures/">ESG disclosure in the US</a> and globally, and build a <a href="https://bettermarkets.org/">fairer financial system.</a></p><p>Rebalancing Power</p><p>In addition to shifting policy, it’s also critical to shift power — particularly by strengthening stakeholders’ voice in corporate and investor decision making. We think this means strengthening <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ON_POV_PDF-2020.pdf">structural bargaining power for workers</a>, increasing <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Worker-Voice-and-the-Corporate-Boardroom.pdf">worker voice in corporate governance</a>, and in seizing opportunities to make more workers owners themselves.</p><p>This also means shifting the investment management industry to focus more clearly on serving the needs of the vast majority of investors (by number, if not by assets under management) who are working people saving for their retirement and their children’s education. These days, most such individuals are highly diversified investors saving for the long-term through passive investment strategies through which they own the entire market. What matters most for such investors’ long-term wellbeing and financial security is neither chasing alpha nor minimizing tracking error in an index — it’s the health of our societal systems. It’s employers that provide quality jobs, an economy that delivers broad-based prosperity, stable democratic governance, and a planet that isn’t beset by climate catastrophe.</p><p>Those interests of the average investor are fully in line with the long-term orientation of building a more sustainable, inclusive capitalism. There is a tremendous opportunity to leverage the voice of those individual investors via more active stewardship by the fiduciaries that vote their shares and represent their interests in engaging companies and fund managers. Truly representing these investors’ interests would mean making long-term investments in growth, focusing more on worker wellbeing, and <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Moving-Beyond-Modern-Portfolio-Theory-Investing-That-Matters/Lukomnik-Hawley/p/book/9780367760823">addressing systemic risks</a> like the climate&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>Mobilizing the power of these long-term shareholders is essential to countering the pressure from those financial sector actors bent on “<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/stock-buybacks-from-retain-and-reinvest-to-downsize-and-distribute/">downsize-and-distribute</a>” tactics like squeezing workers, prioritizing public company share buybacks over long-term investments, or stripping the assets from privately-held companies to fund dividend recapitalizations that juice short-term returns.</p><p>This is why we’re partnering with organizations like the <a href="https://www.iccr.org/">Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility</a> (ICCR) and <a href="https://theshareholdercommons.com/">The Shareholder Commons</a> that are working with institutional investors to drive a more systemic, forceful investment stewardship agenda.</p><p>Finally, if we are going to shift corporate and investor decision making, we also believe we need to look at the whole picture. Privately-owned firms represent a <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/articles_publictoprivateequityintheusalongtermlook_us.pdf">large and growing proportion of our economy</a>, but they lack the accountability mechanisms — like disclosure regimes and shareholder engagement — we have for public markets. That’s why we’re focused on increasing transparency and strengthening accountability mechanisms in private markets — particularly in the context of the private equity industry. We’re exploring how to work with private equity firms and their limited partners on strengthening the industry’s attention to stakeholder and societal issues, as well as advancing policy ideas that can help improve transparency for investors and mitigate risks to stakeholders.</p><p>That’s why we’re exploring opportunities to enable private equity firms and their LPs to better measure and benchmark the ESG performance of their portfolio companies. Simultaneously, we’re supporting advocacy to ensure workers’ interests are protected by working with partners like the <a href="https://www.united4respectef.org/">United for Respect Education Fund.</a></p><p>Building a new capitalism</p><p>Over the last several decades, we’ve built an economic system to optimize market efficiency and maximize shareholder returns and hoped it would also yield the societal outcomes we want. That hasn’t worked, full stop. We need to stop designing our society to serve the wellbeing of markets and restructure our markets so that they serve the wellbeing of&nbsp;society.</p><p>We see this work to shift the rules that drive corporations and capital markets as an important complement to Omidyar Network’s commitments to shifting ideas and ideology by creating a <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">new economic paradigm</a>, <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ON_POV_PDF-2020.pdf">strengthening worker power</a>, and <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Omidyar-Network-POV_Platforms-and-Power_2.7.2020.pdf">checking concentrated market&nbsp;power</a>.</p><p>Changing this system will take time, energy, and engagement from everyone that has a stake in it — particularly those whose voices have been excluded.</p><p>We aspire to play a role supporting those change-makers that are seeking to shifting policy and shifting power as two key pieces of a new economic architecture. And we are eager to partner with all of those who share our vision of building an economy that works for everyone.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>Barry Cooper is a Technical Director at the Centre for Financial Regulation and Inclusion (Cenfri), an independent, not for profit think tank which works on African financial sector development.</p>
<p>Cenfri has a wide reach across Africa, holding relationships with both regulators and Financial Service Providers (FSPs). Cenfri’s role in the initiative was multifacted and involved finding candidate banks in suitable jurisdictions where the initiative could have the most impact on MSMEs and act as a demonstration case; engaging with regulators regarding the initiative; leading working sessions with the selected bank to guide them through the LEI process and address any challenges; and report writing and validation; among others.  Cenfri and Cornerstone Advisory Plus’s evaluation mechanism successfully identified suitably regulated markets and FSPs that have a strong interest and investment in their micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) clients. </p>
<p>Why did you decide to become involved with the initiative?</p>
<p>Cenfri has done a lot of work on identity, anti-money laundering (AML), counter financing of terrorism (CFT), know-your-customer (KYC) and MSME finance issues and this opportunity resonated with our work. In addition, we strive to lead on best and next practices and were greatly attracted to this initiative as this was the first in Africa, and provided a significant opportunity to shape key practices. </p>
<p>How does your organization benefit from its involvement in the LEI initiative?</p>
<p>Involvement in this initiative benefits Cenfri as we gain unique learnings from prototyping the process, helping to inform our approaches to solving MSME finance issues, particularly in our focus countries in Africa, which include Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>The LEI initiative has also provided a tool that we can recommend to institutions and regulators to address AML-CFT, compliance and de-risking challenges. In addition, Cenfri obtained its own LEI, which we can benefit from using ourselves. </p>
<p>What problems does LEI usage enable SMEs in Africa to overcome in the medium to long-term?</p>
<p>There are 54 states in Africa, each with their own incorporation bodies and registries, which each have varying processes and idiosyncrasies. Reliable verification and further incorporation of information for due diligence and risk management processes require high local country skill levels, can take significant time and is prohibitively costly and hence employed more in larger transactions. MSME, and even some corporate, transactions in Africa are either not progressed or are subject to default assumptions of higher risk. </p>
<p>LEI usage enables MSMEs to obtain a much stronger identity which is globally accessible, trusted and verified. Local banks have deep expertise in their national systems, risks and processes. The LEI harnesses this knowledge in a globally accessible format. The LEI is positioned to overcome risk management information asymmetries enabling better formal trade flows through more accessible trade finance, more accurate finance risk ratings, reduced unfavourable risk premiums, limited transaction delays and fewer outright rejections. It also helps to create more visibility for MSMEs and increases opportunities to trade and connect with partners they may otherwise not have been able to connect with. In addition, it can solve compliance challenges for AML-CFT by ensuring they are adhering to the highest standards globally.</p>
<p>What would the African SME landscape look like if Africa’s $81bn trade finance gap could be narrowed? What would this mean for the regional economy?</p>
<p>Narrowing the $81bn trade finance gap could have material implications for the African economy and its people, with the potential to enable significant growth and competitiveness in international markets. The question remains whether changes in trade activity would be inclusive with positive impact at the lowest income levels or if the benefit would be limited to primary industries and existing corporates, benefitting established social strata. Positive measures, like the LEI, are intended to help MSMEs to participate on a fair footing, promoting sustainable growth and economic diversity. Contributing over 50% of employment worldwide according to the World Bank, a small increase in the size and income of MSMEs can have a significant impact on employment levels and enable the supply of services more efficiently throughout markets. Narrowing the trade gap should link with fostering intra-regional trade between African countries to further enable inclusive growth and development.</p>
<p>What opportunities could be created for the people of Africa if all SMEs could be equipped with globally recognized business ID?</p>
<p>Equipping all SMEs with an LEI will create a universal, continent-wide, robust and interoperable global identity. We see the unlocking of significant latent business and employment opportunities not only for global trade but particularly for trade within the Africa region which in the past has been systemically difficult between 54 states. The LEI will greatly enhance the accessibility and competitiveness of MSMEs not only globally but within their countries and the region. As mentioned previously, moderate MSME growth can have a significant impact in employment across diverse economic sectors and particularly at the lower income levels. Through enhanced networking effects the LEI can also result in better distribution of goods and services across countries, enabling access to additional local, sustainable products and services for Africans.</p>

<p>How we keep pace with changes in digital technologies, and how they are used in our economy and across our communities, will have a strong impact on Aotearoa New Zealand’s future prosperity.</p>



<p>The potential benefits from digital ways of working are exponential. They will help improve lives, expand consumer and career choices, and contribute to solving wider issues, such as climate change.</p>



<p>Our government is embarking on a journey to create&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3628718/national-strategy-digital-twin-and-skills-shortages-on-nz-tech-minister-s-mind.html">A Digital Strategy for Aotearoa</a>&nbsp;that seeks to respond to the social, economic, education and cultural opportunities from digital technology, along with the risks that these technologies can bring.</p>



<p>The strategy will endeavour to set out key goals, priorities and activities for the short to medium term (two-five years), as well as longer term results (out to 2031 and beyond).</p>



<p>The overarching framework for the strategy will consist of three pillars:</p>







 
 
<p>As we have stated previously,&nbsp;Identity&nbsp;along with&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Security&nbsp;is one of the three core elements of&nbsp;Trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Digital Strategy for Aotearoa begins to take shape, DINZ will be at the centre of the conversation around why a thriving Digital Identity ecosystem is an essential element in achieving the strategic vision of&nbsp;enabling all of Aotearoa New Zealand to flourish and prosper in a digital world.</p>
 



 

 
 



<p>In other news,&nbsp;I’m sad to say that I will be stepping down as Executive Director for Digital Identity New Zealand this month and someone very well known to many people across the Digital Identity community,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-wallis-7921274/?originalSubdomain=uk">Colin Wallis</a>, will be stepping into my shoes.</p>



<p>Colin is a Kiwi who has been overseas for a few years and has recently returned.&nbsp; For the last five years up until mid-June, Colin led the<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, a globally acknowledged Trust Framework Operator of conformity assessment and Trust Marked schemes for Identity, Credential and Consent Management Service Providers.</p>



<p>Building on 21 years of contribution to international standards and industry consortia, Colin will continue to maintain some of his other leadership positions across the consortium space in Information Security, Privacy and Trusted Identity.&nbsp; While leading Kantara he was a member of the OECD’s<a href="https://www.internetac.org/members">Internet Technical Advisory Committee</a>&nbsp;amongst others and will continue his contributions to standardisation into ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27/WG5 Identity Management and Privacy technologies.</p>



<p>Before heading off overseas, Colin worked in the Government’s digital identification programmes, initially at the State Services Commission and later at the Department of Internal Affairs (Government Login Service, iGovt and RealMe), where he has regularly represented New Zealand in international fora.</p>



<p>With his depth of knowledge and experience, it will surprise no-one that Colin was named in One World Identity’s Top 100 Influencers in Identity.</p>



<p>I’d like to welcome Colin into the role and wish him all the best.</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>The Ceramic community is committed to providing the best possible developer experience for building Web3 data applications. Over the past few months, the community has made significant upgrades to Ceramic's emerging open source developer tools and data standards ecosystem, including replacing the popular IDX.js client with a more powerful and flexible set of tools. This post describes the best ways to build applications on Ceramic today as of October, 2021.</p> The Web3 data architecture <p>The primary difference between Web3 and Web2 applications is their data architecture. Web3 applications rely on a user-centric ("self-sovereign" or "sovereign") data storage architecture. In this model, application data is hosted on a decentralized network, stored with each individual user, and is written to and queried by applications client-side. This contrasts to Web2 applications, which rely on an application-centric design where all data for all users of an application is stored in a single database server siloed to that application. </p> What's needed to build sovereign apps? <p>Therefore, building Web3 data apps requires a few foundational primitives:</p>  Network for decentralized data availability with fast mutability  Protocol for identity-centric, model-based data storage and retrieval  Client for performing CRUD operations on users' stores at runtime   User-centric data models <p>As you can see, Web3 data applications are built on the concept of data models for storing and retrieving structured data from user-controlled storage. Web3 takes a model-based approach vs. an application-based approach in order to allow for simple data reuse and composability across applications. It's much easier for applications to share individual data models with other applications (e.g. <code>user profile</code>, <code>social graph</code>, <code>skills</code>, <code>linked blockchain accounts</code>) than it is to force these applications to share entire databases containing all different kinds of data, many of which are not shared between applications. </p><p>Creating a great developer experience around building applications with user-centric data models is important to accelerating adoption of this new Web3 data architecture. Tools that improve the developer experience and increase cross-application data interoperability include: </p>  Tooling to create and deploy data models  Tooling to share, discover, and reuse data models   Example: Decentralized social network <p>As a simple example of how this all works, let's consider a decentralized social network. Behind the scenes this application can be reduced to just four data models, where each user maintains their own data in their own store for each model:</p>  <code>PostList</code>: stores an index of a user's posts  <code>Post</code>: stores a single post  <code>Profile</code>: stores a user's profile  <code>FollowList</code>: stores a list of users they follow   Application deployment and usage <p>To deploy this data application, a developer would deploy each of these data models to Ceramic. After they're available on the network, they can be used by any application to CRUD a user's data store for that model. For example, if another developer is building a new social network and wants to bootstrap it with existing users and content, they can simply reuse the same data models as the initial social network and their application will be able to automatically load and support storage interactions on this existing data. This is how multiple applications can collaborate on shared data sets, and how open data standards and protocols can emerge from any developer in the community.</p><blockquote>For an example of two applications building on the same data models to achieve data interoperability, try the <a href="https://self.id">Self.ID</a> and <a href="https://dns.xyz">DNS</a> applications. Any change to data in one application is automatically reflected in the other.</blockquote> IDX: ID-centric, model-based storage protocol <p>Ceramic provides a decentralized network for data availability with fast mutability, the foundation upon which Web3 data applications can be deployed and run. About a year ago the Ceramic community first introduced <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">CIP-11 "Identity Index"</a>, commonly referred to as the <code>IDX protocol</code>. It specifies a protocol for identity-centric, model-based data storage and retrieval implemented on top of Ceramic – the second requirement for building sovereign applications.</p> IDX.js: The most popular IDX client <p>IDX protocol (CIP-11) is just a specification and not working code. To make the protocol usable by application developers, the <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> team created IDX.js, a runtime library for performing CRUD operations on users' data stores – the third and final requirement for building Web3 data applications. They also created supporting tools such as the IDX CLI, and a reference application, <a href="https://self.id">Self.id</a>, to showcase IDX.js and related Ceramic technologies.</p><p>By serving as a simple entry-point to building applications on Ceramic, adoption of IDX.js has accelerated in lockstep with growth of the Ceramic ecosystem and has become the most popular way to build applications on Ceramic. Almost all of the applications currently deployed on Ceramic mainnet are using IDX.js.</p>Usage of IDX.js has accelerated with usage of Ceramic Why change a good thing? <p>In an attempt to offer more features, service more use cases and provide the best developer experience, the scope of IDX.js grew beyond simply providing a bare-bones implementation of the IDX protocol to a point where it became unnecessarily monolithic and opinionated. </p><p>As a result, IDX.js and associated libraries <code>idx-constants</code>, <code>idx-tools</code>, <code>idx-cli</code> are being deprecated. They are replaced by a new collection of tools outlined in the rest of this post.</p><blockquote>If you are currently using IDX.js and/or 3ID Connect, there is no rush to upgrade your code. There are no breaking changes to the IDX protocol itself, and the data interactions of the new libraries are fully compatible with IDX.js.</blockquote> DataModels: Open source for data models <p>DataModels allows developers to create, share, reuse, and discuss open source data models for Ceramic applications that can be used with the IDX protocol, enabling cross-application data interoperability.</p> DataModels Registry <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels">DataModels Registry</a> is an open-source, community-created repository of reusable application data models for Ceramic. It provides a single place where developers can openly register, discover, and reuse existing data models – the foundation for interoperable applications built on shared data models. Currently the registry is implemented as an open source Github repository dual-licensed under MIT and Apache 2. In the future, it will be decentralized on Ceramic.</p> Installation &amp; Usage <p>All data models added to the registry are automatically published to <code>npm</code> under the @datamodels organization. Any developer can install one or more data models by using the <code>@datamodels/model-name</code> convention, making those models available for storing or retrieving data during runtime with any IDX client, including DID DataStore or Self.ID, both of which are described below.</p>Install DataModels from the @datamodels npm org DataModels Forum <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/discussions">DataModels Forum</a> is located within the DataModels Registry repository. Every model in the DataModel Registry has its own discussion thread which the community can use to leave reviews, have discussions, discuss upgrades, etc. Developers can also post <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/discussions/categories/ideas">ideas</a> for DataModels to solicit input from the community prior to adding it to the Registry.</p> Glaze: Ceramic Developer Suite <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/overview/">Glaze</a> is a suite of low-level developer tools for building applications on Ceramic. Glaze aims to provide developers with more flexibility and control by unbundling IDX.js into smaller, more specific packages.</p> DID DataStore.js: Core IDX client <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/did-datastore/">DID DataStore</a> is a bare-bones IDX runtime client – a stripped-down replacement for IDX.js – with less scope and fewer dependencies. If you've used IDX.js, you'll notice that DID DataStore does not come bundled with default data models, such as <code>basicProfile</code>, nor does it support CAIP-10 blockchain accounts links out of the box. If you want to use DID DataStore with data models or blockchain accounts you will need to separately install these as packages. If you want a more bundled, drop-in solution similar to IDX.js, see Self.ID below.</p> DataModels.js: A runtime for DataModels <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/datamodel/">DataModels.js</a> is a runtime library that simplifies the process of using data models in your application. It is frequently used with DID DataStore, and supports a few useful runtime features for DataModels:</p>  Availability – ensures the data models used your application are available on your Ceramic node, so they can be used with a Ceramic or IDX client, such as <code>DID Datastore</code>  Aliasing – allows developers to assign human-readable names to their data models, so they can more easily be used within application code instead of needing to reference data models via their <code>streamID</code>  <blockquote>If you've used IDX.js or the IDX CLI, DataModels serves as a replacement for running the <code>idx bootstrap</code> command or using similar bootstrap files, and eliminates the need to create aliases at runtime.</blockquote> More Glaze Tools   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/development/#devtools-library">DevTools</a> is a library for managing the full lifecycle of DataModels, such as creating custom models, adding to existing or creating new schemas and definitions, and publishing DataModels to any Ceramic node.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/development/#cli">Glaze CLI</a> is an upgraded command line interface that is designed to support Glaze development flows. It provides more functionality than the core Ceramic CLI, and adds native functionality for DataModels and DID Datastore.   Self.ID: Bundles for building Ceramic apps <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID</a> is a suite of high-level bundles that simplify the development process for building Ceramic applications. </p> Self.ID Core: Read-only bundle <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/read/">Self.ID Core</a> is a package that comes pre-installed with everything you need to build applications that read data from accounts on Ceramic. Self.ID Core offers cross-platform support, but read-only APIs. If you are currently using IDX.js, Self.ID Core is very similar. It includes: </p>  Ceramic client: <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/http/">JS Ceramic HTTP Client</a> with all required setup. The only thing you need to do is pass in your node's <code>CeramicURL</code>  IDX client: DID DataStore.js  DataModels runtime: DataModels.js  Popular DataModels: <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-profile-basic">Basic Profile</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/3id-keychain">3ID Keychain</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-accounts-crypto">Crypto Accounts</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/packages/identity-accounts-web">Web Accounts</a>  Popular utilities: Support for CAIP-10 blockchain accounts    Self.ID Web: Browser bundle <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/write/">Self.ID Web</a> extends the Self.ID Core bundle with write APIs and provides built-in user authentication. Self.ID Web only supports browser applications, and is now the most popular bundle for building Ceramic applications.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>: Browser-based, cross-chain user authentication system that is compatible with blockchain wallets. 3ID Connect allows users to connect one or more blockchain accounts from any chain to their Ceramic decentralized identity. 3ID Connect supports all EVM chains and other blockchain platforms such as NEAR, Cosmos, Filecoin, and Tezos.   More Self.ID Tools   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/utilities/#image-interactions">Image Utilities</a>: for uploading images to IPFS, storing them in multiple sizes and resolutions, and retrieving one most desirable to your application UI. Great for optimizing application performance when handling images such as user profiles photos. Sometimes you want to show a full-resolution image (e.g. profile page), and other times you only low-res thumbnails (e.g. dashboard).  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/self.id/tree/master/packages/3box-legacy">3Box Legacy Profiles:</a> A utility function for loading a legacy 3Box profile as a BasicProfile. Previously, this was provided by IDX.js.   FAQs  Which library should I use? <p>If you are already familiar with IDX or are more advanced in your development needs, DID DataStore is likely a better option; it offers the most flexibility and new features will be implemented there first. If you use custom data models (schemas and definitions), you should get familiar with the new set of tools for data models including the DataModels Registry and DataModels.js.</p><p>If you are just getting started with Ceramic and IDX, Self.ID should provide a smoother experience. It allows you to build Web3 data applications without having to understand all the concepts in order to have a working setup. You should still learn about Ceramic and the rest of the ecosystem if you want a better understanding of the full set of possibilities.</p> What should I do now? <p>IDX.js and related packages are being deprecated. Moving forward new features and improvements will only be implemented in the Glaze and Self.ID packages. We recommend that you update your app to use the new packages whenever possible.</p> Join the developer community <p>The Ceramic community is passionate about building Web3 data applications. If you want to learn more about anything mentioned in this post, encounter any issues trying to use the new tools, either for a new project or migrating from IDX.js, please <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">join the Ceramic Discord</a>!</p><p>To get started building Ceramic applications, head over to the developer documentation for <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/glaze/overview/">Glaze</a> and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID</a> now!</p>

Bild: Diskussion über die Sicherheit von Wallets für digitalen Identitäten Aktuelle Diskussion und&nbsp;Kontext <p>Am 23. September 2021 hat die Bundesregierung erstmals den digitalen Personalausweis und Führerschein für das <a href="https://my-digi-id.github.io/index.html#mobile-app">ID-Wallet</a> einer breiten Öffentlichkeit vorgestellt und es war für kurze Zeit möglich einen Personalausweis und Führerschein in das ID-Wallet abzuleiten. Hierbei ist es leider zu Problemen gekommen, da die Nachfrage um ein vielfaches höher als angenommen war. Im weiteren Verlauf haben Mitglieder rund um den Chaos Computer Club (CCC) die ID-Wallet, sowie die zugrundeliegende Technologie in einem <a href="https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/mit-der-id-wallet-kannst-du-alles-und-jeder-sein-au%C3%9Fer-du-musst-dich-ausweisen-829293739fa0">Artikel</a> kritisiert. Da das Lissi Wallet hier genannt und gezeigt wurde, möchten wir eine Einordnung schaffen, einen Überblick über die angesprochenen Probleme geben und potenzielle Lösungen diskutieren.</p> Abgrenzung ID-Ökosystem der Bundesregierung und “Schaufenster sichere digitale Identitäten”. <p>Seit 2019 führt das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) ein Projekt zur Förderung neuer digitaler Identitätslösungen durch. Nach einer sechsmonatigen Wettbewerbsphase, für die sich jede Institution in Deutschland bewerben konnte, wurden vier Projekte zur Förderung im Rahmen der <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Sichere_Digitale_Identitaeten/sichere_digitale_ident.html">Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten</a> ausgewählt. Die ausgewählten Projekte (im folgenden Schaufensterprojekte) sind Forschungsprojekte, die mit über 120 involvierten Institutionen gemeinsam innerhalb von drei Jahren neue Lösungskonzepte für digitale Identitäten erforschen und umsetzen, darunter zahlreiche Institute mit dem Schwerpunkt IT-Sicherheit. Folgende Projekte nehmen am Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten teil: <a href="https://www.once-project.de/">ONCE</a>, <a href="https://id-ideal.hs-mittweida.de/">ID-Ideal</a>, <a href="https://www.sdika.de/">SDIKA</a> und&nbsp;<a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>.</p><p>Parallel dazu hat die Bundesregierung im <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/975188/1824788/372199dfb12ff630da046dae6ae2849d/2020-12-03-europaeisches-oekosystem-digitaler-identitaeten-data.pdf?download=1">Dezember 2020</a> ein eigenes ID-Ökosystem rund um die ID-Wallet gestartet. Das <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/Webs/PA/DE/verwaltung/projekt_digitale_identitaeten/projekt_digitale_identitaeten_node.html">BMI</a> beschreibt das Projekt wie folgt: “Bürgerinnen und Bürger können künftig persönliche Daten und digitale Nachweise verschlüsselt in ihren Smartphones speichern und dann selbstbestimmt, sicher und einfach für Online-Dienste von Unternehmen und Behörden verwenden.”</p><p>Das <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> ist bisher nicht Teil des ID-Ökosystems der Bundesregierung und wird überwiegend im Rahmen des Schaufensterprojekts “IDunion” genutzt und weiterentwickelt. Es ist bisher nicht darauf ausgelegt offizielle Dokumente wie den Personalausweis und Führerschein zu speichern und dies war bisher für Endanwender*innen auch nie möglich. Ziel der Schaufensterprojekte ist es allerdings genau dies in Zukunft zu erreichen und dafür entsprechende Sicherheitsmechanismen zu entwickeln.</p><p>Insofern sind wir für jede Kritik an der Lissi Wallet sehr dankbar und nehmen die von Lilith Wittmann und Fabian Lüpke, der unter dem Pseudonym “Flüpke” im Internet Auftritt, geäußerten Bedenken ernst. Gleichwohl ist es sehr wichtig diese immer im Kontext der verschiedenen Anwendungsfälle und deren Vertrauensniveaus zu betrachten!</p> Probleme und mögliche Lösungswege <p>In ihrem <a href="https://lilithwittmann.medium.com/mit-der-id-wallet-kannst-du-alles-und-jeder-sein-au%C3%9Fer-du-musst-dich-ausweisen-829293739fa0">gemeinsamen Artikel</a> sowie einer <a href="https://github.com/Fluepke/ssi-poc">Proof of Concept (PoC) Implementierung</a> sprechen Lilith und Flüpke mehrere Probleme der Walletlösung an. Wir möchten diese Probleme nochmal kurz in eigenen Worten erklären und mögliche Lösungsoptionen aufzeigen.</p> 1. Verifizierung von anfragenden Parteien <p>Bei verifizierten Dokumenten in einem ID-Ökosystem ist ein wichtiger Aspekt, dass die ausstellende Partei nicht in die Präsentation eines Nachweis gegenüber der anfragenden Partei involviert ist. Für den Prozess der Anfrage und der Präsentation wird eine direkte Kommunikation mit Ende-zu-Ende Verschlüsselung zwischen Nutzer*innen und der anfragenden Partei genutzt. Um die benötigten Schlüssel für die sichere Kommunikation auszutauschen, wird hierzu oftmals ein QR-Code genutzt, welcher Nutzer*innen über einen bereits bestehenden sicheren Kommunikationskanal übermittelt werden&nbsp;muss.</p><p>Beschriebenes Problem: Sollte der sichere Kanal kompromittiert werden, kann dies einer Angreifer*in erlauben, eine sogenannte “Man-In-The-Middle-Attacke” durchzuführen. Hierzu tauschen Angreifer*innen Schlüssel und Endpunkte aus und präsentieren Nutzer*innen einen gefälschten QR-Code, welcher das Ergebnis der Abfrage und damit die persönlichen Daten umleiten. Das Problem besteht darin, dass Nutzer*innen grundsätzlich keine Möglichkeit haben, die anfragende Partei innerhalb der Wallet zu authentifizieren und Betrüger*innen sich als beliebige Institution ausgeben könnten um persönliche Informationen anzufragen. Die Verantwortung den initialen Kommunikationskanal zu überprüfen liegt somit auf der Nutzerseite.</p><p>Mögliche Lösung: Um die Legitimität einer Anfrage verifizieren zu können, müssen sich anfragende Institutionen zuvor in einem öffentlichen Register z.B. mit öffentlichen dezentralen Identifikatoren (DIDs) registrieren. Die öffentlichen DIDs können durch eine vertrauenswürdige Partei (z.B. einem <a href="https://esignature.ec.europa.eu/efda/tl-browser/#/screen/tl/DE">Vertrauensdiensteanbieter</a>) in einer “Trusted List” zertifiziert werden. Das Wallet von Nutzer*innen kann bei neuen Anfragen die Authentizität über die entsprechende “Trusted List” validieren und Nutzer*innen die verifizierte Identität der anfragenden Partei anzeigen.</p><p>Grundsätzlich wäre auch denkbar, dass nur verifizierbare Institutionen hoheitliche Dokumente abfragen dürfen. Ob dies in der Realität sinnvoll wäre ist zu diskutieren. Alternativ müssen Nutzer*innen darüber aufgeklärt werden, dass die anfragende dritte Partei nicht verifiziert werden kann und die Daten nur geteilt werden sollten, wenn Nutzer*innen dem Kontext der Anfrage vertrauen. Mit der zunehmenden Offenheit der Ökosystems ergeben sich somit auch zusätzliche Risiken für Nutzer*innen.</p> 2. Der Missbrauch von verifizierten Daten: <p>Wenn Informationen mittels einer verifizierbaren Präsentation mit einer dritten Partei geteilt wurden, dann erhält diese Partei die angefragten Klardaten (z.B. Name, Geburtsdatum) und eine entsprechende Signatur vom Aussteller der Informationen, um zu überprüfen, dass die erhaltenen Informationen unverfälscht sind.</p><p>Beschriebenes Problem: Angreifer*innen, welche verifizierte Identitätsdaten abfangen konnten, können diese missbräuchlich verwenden. Dieses Problem unterliegt der Annahme, dass ein Angriff, wie in Punkt 1 beschrieben, möglich und erfolgreich war.</p><p>Bestehende Lösung: Jede verifizierbare Präsentation eines verifizierbaren Nachweises ist mit einer Nonce versehen, die sogenannte Replay-Attacken verhindert. Die Angreifer*in ist somit nicht in der Lage mit den gestohlenen Daten weitere Anfragen zu beantworten und neue verifizierbare Präsentationen zu erstellen. Sie kann ausschließlich die gestohlenen Klardaten nutzen. Da schon durch die Preisgabe der Klardaten ein Schaden entstehen kann, ist es trotzdem notwendig den unter Punkt 1 beschriebenen Angriff auszuschließen.</p> Wie geht es&nbsp;weiter: <p>Neben den aufgezeigten Lösungsansätzen gibt es sicher noch eine Reihe weiterer Möglichkeiten und auch das beschriebene Angriffsszenario ist, wie bereits erwähnt, je nach Anwendungsfall differenziert zu bewerten.</p><p>Sowohl im ID-Ökosystem der Bundesregierung als auch in allen Schaufensterprojekten kommen sogenannte “selbstbestimmte” Identitätslösungen (kurz SSI) zum Einsatz. Viele andere Staaten weltweit, entwickeln derzeit ähnliche Lösungen. Deutschland geht dabei keinen Alleinweg.</p><p>Grundsätzliche Problemstellungen werden z.B. global auf dem halbjährlich stattfindenden <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) diskutiert. Der nächste IIW findet vom 12. — 14. Oktober statt. Wir möchten gern alle Beteiligten aufrufen sich hier zu treffen, um offen und konstruktiv über die Lösungsansätze zu sprechen.</p><p>Darüber hinaus werden wir im Rahmen der Schaufensterprojekte gemeinsam mit zahlreichen Institutionen die bestehenden Herausforderungen lösungsorientiert angehen und begrüßen konstruktive Kritik und die Beteiligung der Öffentlichkeit. Nur gemeinsam können wir erfolgreich ein Fundament für unsere digitale Gesellschaft schaffen!</p><p>Das Lissi Team freut sich auf eine konstruktive Diskussion.</p>

GAIN POC FAQ</p>
<p>Is there a new organization being developed for GAIN?<br>
NO. The GAIN POC is a collaboration between like-minded stakeholders seeking to collaborate together to test for technical global interoperability in a safe, open space.</p>
<p>Is GAIN a commercial initiative?<br>
NO. The OIDF Community Group offers a sandbox environment for stakeholders to put existing OIDF-based standards to the test and to facilitate broad sharing of all learnings.</p>
<p>Is there a cost to join or any kind of ongoing transaction fees?<br>
NO. The success of the POC depends on broad based participation.</p>
<p>Do you have to be an OIDF member to join the community?<br>
NO. Participants will need to agree to a participation agreement that is suitable to interoperability testing (vs working groups that create / update standards.). The basic OIDF principles of openness and sharing will continue to apply.</p>
<p>Is the GAIN POC limited to financial services use cases?<br>
NO. Any/all IDps and RPs are welcome to test with other participants across a wide range of industry and jurisdictional use cases. The only prerequisite is that stakeholders use existing open standards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where POC learnings suggest updates/improvements to the standards, these requirements will be fed into the existing OIDF working groups.</p>
<p>
Any interested parties should email <a href="mailto:Donna@oidf.org">Donna@oidf.org</a>.&nbsp; Please specify which sessions are of interest and whether you think you will join in person or virtually.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please also use this email directly if you’d like to learn more- especially if you cannot join either of these sessions.</p>

 Investment in transportation, agriculture, healthcare, and education should take priority over investment in surveillance technologies. <p>While artificial intelligence (AI), a signature technology of the 4th Industrial revolution (4IR), has been projected to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2020/01/13/the-future-is-intelligent-harnessing-the-potential-of-artificial-intelligence-in-africa/">transform</a> the socioeconomic landscape of Africa by creating <a href="https://oecd-development-matters.org/2021/02/09/developing-an-artificial-intelligence-for-africa-strategy/#:~:text=Africa%20has%20a%20unique%20opportunity,economic%20problems%20that%20Africa%20faces.">new efficiencies</a> in the public and private sectors, it has some way to go to live up to this hope. Instead of exciting <a href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/news/36-million-boost-for-ai-technologies-to-revolutionise-nhs-care/">public-led</a> applications such as the use of AI by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom to fight diseases, the most promising applications of AI in Africa are, not surprisingly, private sector-dominated. From behemoths like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/07/mapping-africas-buildings-with.html">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/facebooks-ai-team-maps-out-where-everyone-in-africa-lives/">Facebook</a> to smaller startups, private firms are attempting to create impact at scale in Africa through applications such as <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/03/05/meet-africas-bot-builders-the-startups-pioneering-chatbot-solutions-on-the-continent/">chatbots</a> in healthcare and the financial industry and AI <a href="https://african.business/2021/04/agribusiness-manufacturing/drones-and-ai-move-africas-farmers-to-greener-pastures/">drone-empowered</a> disease surveillance in agriculture. As I’ve explained <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/4th-industrial-revolution-readying-africa-for-the-emerging-ai-decade/">elsewhere</a>, African countries will falter in their quest for an AI-led 4IR economic boost if they neglect investments in foundational 2nd and 3rd IR technologies such as efficient transport systems, power grids, and reliable broadband connections for a critical mass of the population. The 4IR does not happen in a bubble; it feeds upon successful integration with 2nd and 3rd IR technologies. Little wonder, then, that the most visible public-private partnership in AI deployment for societal good during the Covid-19 pandemic was its use for <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/news/latest-news/research-news/2020/2020-12/ai-helps-to-identify-new-covid-19-hotspots-in-gauteng.html">disease surveillance</a> in Johannesburg — within Africa’s most advanced economy where 2nd and 3rd IR technologies are better developed than in most of&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>A huge part of AI’s ineffectual public sector-led impact in Africa is poor <a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/statisticalcapacity/">statistical capacity</a>, which might be a good intervention point for AI capacity-building grants for the continent. Government and other public statistical agencies are poorly equipped to keep accurate and granular records in critical sectors such as economic indicators, health data, environmental data, and even transportation data. AI systems <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2021/09/03/can-national-statistical-offices-shape-the-data-revolution/">feed</a> on large, accurate, and digitized datasets to produce insights for development, and in Africa today, the organizations with the capacity to harness such data power are typically in the private sector. We probably should not expect a replica of a UK NHS intervention in Africa anytime soon. There doesn’t seem to be enough political will to build efficient public statistical systems in Africa. The only exception seems to be in biometric surveillance.</p>Photo: <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/security-cctv-camera-monitoring-system-with-panoramic-view-of-a-city-on-blurry-gm962263118-262802771?utm_source=pixabay&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=SRP_image_sponsored&amp;referrer_url=http%3A%2F%2Fpixabay.com%2Fimages%2Fsearch%2Fbig%2520brother%2520surveillance%2F&amp;utm_term=big%20brother%20surveillance">Pixaby</a><p>It seems ironic that one of the most extensive public sector-led applications of AI in Africa is the implementation of biometric surveillance technology. Many African cities have become urban experiments in the deployment of AI-powered biometric surveillance. A few examples will suffice. In 2019, Police in <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/surveillance-technology-in-africa-security-concerns/">Uganda</a> bought $126 million worth of CCTV surveillance technology from telecommunications firm Huawei to help control crime in Kampala, the country’s capital. In Nairobi, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/specials/connected-world/government.html">Kenya</a>, Huawei has also implemented a new communications network which links 1,800 surveillance cameras with 195 police bureaus and 7,600 police officers. In <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-05-09-big-brother-south-africa-will-not-only-be-watching-you-hell-also-share-your-biometric-data-with-the-cops/">South Africa</a>, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHA) draft identity management policy proposed that biometric information recorded by numerous surveillance cameras installed in public spaces across the country will be linked to the DHA’s population register and this database shared with the Police. In <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202003/biometrics-and-digital-id-in-africa-this-week-increasing-cctv-surveillance-new-id-document-contracts">Madagascar</a>, Huawei is also installing over 1,000 CCTV cameras in the country’s major cities. Other African countries which have deployed <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/surveillance-technology-in-africa-security-concerns/">surveillance</a> technology include Algeria, Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p><p>A conspicuous thread linking many of these projects is Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Many of these surveillance projects are linked with Huawei’s <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/watching-huaweis-safe-cities">safe cities</a> project, a Chinese-led global partnership in security infrastructure. China has been a major partner in Africa’s economic renaissance, having built <a href="https://africacenter.org/spotlight/surveillance-technology-in-africa-security-concerns/">about 70%</a> of the 4G telecommunications infrastructure on the continent. The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/02/chinese-firms-african-labor-are-building-africas-infrastructure/#:~:text=Chinese%20enterprises%20have%20dominated%20the,toward%20African%20infrastructure%20development%20projects.">estimates</a> China’s contribution to infrastructure development financing at $25.7 billion in 2018, about a quarter of the total $100.8 billion committed to infrastructure projects. China is also emerging as perhaps Africa’s most important trading partner, with an estimated <a href="http://www.sais-cari.org/data-china-africa-trade">$200 billion</a> worth of trade in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>China will remain an important partner for Africa. Nevertheless, it does not seem right that in the poorest continent on the planet, the most visible, public-led 4IR implementation is in security — and is simply a tool to maintain authoritarianism in many countries. Security is not the most urgent problem confronting Africa. Indeed, there are those who would argue that Africa’s security challenges are exacerbated by poor governance. The same local political will that has brought about these security investments in Africa can also be brought to ensure that 4IR impacts are more strongly felt in public sectors such as transportation, agriculture, healthcare, education — probably Africa’s greatest needs. A good place to start might be in partnerships to strengthen public statistical capacities and international knowledge transfers critical for the success of AI applications in Africa. The China-African partnership might be more meaningful if some of the agenda setting is African and recognizes that implementing effective public sector AI applications which improve the livelihoods of ordinary people will improve security better than a thousand biometric surveillance systems.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/big-brother-a-critique-of-the-4th-industrial-revolution-in-africa-fdcd1a5fdddd">Big Brother: A critique of the 4th Industrial Revolution</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>All around the world, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) lack the legal documentation that can prove who they are to banks, service providers and other businesses. As a result, millions are struggling to access trade finance and create partnerships, particularly in developing economies. </p>
<p>Following the launch of GLEIF’s digital business identity initiative designed to bridge this trade finance gap in Africa, we’re catching up with our key partners to hear their thoughts on how the project will bring about greater financial inclusion for SMEs on the continent and beyond. </p>
<p>We spoke with Yann Desclercs, Managing Director, Cornerstone Advisory Plus to discuss how broad adoption of the LEI in the African financial system could help to reduce the continent’s trade finance gap. Cornerstone Advisory Plus is an advisory firm based in Cote d ́Ivoire, West Africa. It specializes in compliance advisory and training services for private and public sector institutions, including regulators and financial sector supervisors.</p>
<p>As part of the multi-stakeholder initiative, Cornerstone Advisory Plus assisted with the coordination of the project in collaboration with the other project partners. In addition, the Cornerstone team provided technical content and insight, facilitated stakeholder engagements and conducted data analysis with a special focus on compliance and KYC data. Cornerstone Advisory Plus also brought a francophone West African and international perspective to the project. </p>
<p>Having worked on the ground with financial institutions in Africa, what impact could broad LEI usage have on the broader financial system?<br>
African financial institutions are struggling to access international correspondent banking networks, either because they do not have the critical size required in terms of volume of activity, or, more importantly, because they are not always fully compliant with international AML and KYC standards and sanction regimes. As a result, the African financial system is widely perceived as high risk by the international financial community. International banks have therefore formed the assumption that establishing links with these institutions would lead to costly due diligence processes, which would outweigh the potential additional revenue generated by transaction fees. The outcome of this risk vs reward analysis usually prevents these banks from establishing links with African financial institutions and can lead to them severing ties from existing relationships, a phenomenon known as ‘de-risking’. </p>
<p>Broad usage of the LEI can provide greater transparency in the African financial system. This would help improve the risk assessments for individual entities together with the perception of system itself, opening it up to a worldwide network of international financial institutions. This would certainly help support the effective inclusion of African financial institutions in the global economy.</p>
<p>Do you think the broad usage of the LEI could also have an impact on SMEs in the region?<br>
Of course. As we know, de-risking has a huge impact on African economies and SMEs in particular, which make up the largest economic subset. A recent report from AfDB and Afreximbank shows that the continent’s trade finance gap is estimated at US$81bn, largely due to compliance and KYC issues and de-risking.  SMEs are the most affected by this issue. Reversing the trend of de-risking by fostering transparency of the African financial system through the broad adoption of the LEI could help to reduce the trade finance gap for SMEs and wider African economies.</p>
<p>How can the LEI initiative help banks with their internal processes? How can they become more efficient as a result?<br>
Banks that participate in this LEI initiative and take on the role of a Validation Agent can leverage their existing KYC process to obtain LEIs for their customers, with minimal to no additional steps, depending each bank’s KYC framework. As a result, participating banks can obtain strong global business IDs for their customers and help them to address globally recognized verification processes, all while streamlining their internal processes for periodic KYC renewals and ongoing customer information updates. </p>
<p>Another key benefit of equipping clients with an LEI is the simple identification of parental links between corporations using the GLEIF database, which can prove particularly useful in establishing beneficial ownership links as required by FATF recommendations and most jurisdiction’s laws. All these efficiency gains in the KYC process could eventually lead to greater cost efficiency by reallocating compliance resources proportionally and utilizing an effective risk-based approach as per FATF’s first recommendation, which is translated into most international  and national laws.</p>
<p>What strategic benefits can banks realize by participating in the LEI initiative? How does it help them grow revenue, opportunities or market share?<br>
Participating banks can benefit from improved risk perception within the international financial community, ultimately leading to increased trade capacity and corresponding market share. They can also develop a competitive edge by offering their customers globally recognized business IDs, delivering additional benefits for their SMEs and corporate customers. </p>
<p>This competitive edge coupled with the enhanced trade capacity could lead to significant growth in both market share and revenues, subject of course to an aligned and appropriate commercial, marketing and communication strategy.</p>
<p>What kind of ID services could an African bank anticipate developing once it has equipped its SME customers with LEIs?<br>
The sky is the limit. However, for the purpose of this interview, let’s focus on existing platforms such as the MANSA repository created and managed by a partnership led by Afreximbank. The MANSA repository is a single source of the primary data required for the conduct of customer due diligence on African entities including financial institutions, corporates and SMEs. Subject to an agreement between MANSA initiative and GLEIF, the LEI could be offered as an option/choice for the identification verification part of the repository. The LEI being an internationally recognized global business ID, it could potentially add on to the already established reputation of the MANSA repository and fast track the onboarding for all entities who already have an LEI.</p>
<p>This fast-tracked onboarding process could apply to any other national or regional ID platform on the continent. To achieve this in practice, discussions need to be conducted between GLEIF and the platform managers around the continent in order to establish collaborative avenues in order to reach an LEI-based onboarding process in the existing ID platforms.</p>

Photo by Kelly Sikkema on&nbsp;Unsplash<p>Imagine a world where our oldest and youngest Americans get the care they need. A world where racial inequities are something we work to face and heal rather than exacerbate. Imagine a world where our public schools and universities provide excellent educations that set our students up for success. A world where new businesses can flourish and research and development lead to incredible breakthroughs promoting well-being in science and technology. And imagine a world where our roads, bridges, and drinking water are safe and our infrastructure helps to mitigate the looming climate crisis. This world doesn’t have to be a dream. It is possible if we view our government as a force for social good — intended to benefit the largest number of people in the largest possible way — and our tax policy as a means to get&nbsp;there.</p><p>What we decide to do together and how we choose to pay for it reflects what we value as a society. It is how we express our democratic priorities for the collective good. It signifies our priorities and considerations of fairness and reciprocity. And it signals how we treat the most privileged versus people who are left behind or left out; individuals and businesses; investors and employees. Unlike almost any other government policy, tax squarely answers the question: “What (if anything) do we owe to each other?”.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn1">[1]</a></p><p>Tax is a complicated and often emotional issue because it tends to be a proxy for the collision of two core but divergent concepts that guide American society: the roles of individual responsibility versus the common good. Beyond that, tax is also one of the most visible representations of the role of government in our lives, and it sets key incentives for many aspects of our economy and&nbsp;society.</p><p>Our government is not just an abstract, remote bureaucracy. Under democratically legitimate governance, it represents all of us. Government is intended to be a means to enact our collective will, and one of the critical ways we can build a “more perfect&nbsp;union.”</p><p>More practically, our government is responsible for maintaining our nation’s roads and bridges; keeping our air, food, and water safe; taking care of our veterans; conducting and funding research that can lead to medical and technology breakthroughs, new energy technologies, and critical vaccines; providing health care and education; and much more. Our government is what makes our market economy possible, providing a stable currency of exchange; enforceable contracts and property rights; and consumer protections. Our government has a profound impact on our everyday lives. It has played an even more important role during the Covid pandemic, keeping families and small businesses afloat during these challenging times, just as it has in wartime and other past emergencies.</p><p>But good government is not free. It must be adequately funded to carry out its charge effectively.</p><p>With sufficient revenue, we could pay for programs and services that give every American a chance to get ahead: creating jobs that pay a livable wage; investing in education and making college affordable; shoring up our safety net programs for the long term; reducing poverty; and protecting people who have been marginalized by our current systems. To make these government services accessible and responsive, we need quality civil service and civil servants — which also cost&nbsp;money.</p><p>We recognize that our government does not always live up to these ideals. Often, it falls short because it is not adequately funded. For decades, conservative politicians and thought leaders have been advocating for smaller government, which erodes its ability to function properly. At the same time, political pressures can sway policymakers to do the bidding of special interests at the expense of those with less influence or&nbsp;power.</p><p>We believe in the role of government and the value it can bring. Tax policy is a critical means to achieve a healthy and stable democracy, economy, and shared values. Americans agree. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/321041/new-high-government-solve-problems.aspx">According to a September 2020 survey by Gallup</a>, “For the first time in Gallup’s 28-year trend, a majority of Americans think the government should do more to solve the nation’s problems. As the U.S. continues to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic, the resulting economic downturn, and racial injustice issues, 54% of U.S. adults favor increased government intervention.”</p><p>For these reasons, we believe US tax policy should be guided by four core principles that reflect the values of a democratic country; values that center the well-being of the many over the benefits of a privileged few.</p><p>Omidyar Network’s Principles for Fair and Equitable Tax&nbsp;Policy</p>  People with less shouldn’t pay more than people with&nbsp;plenty.  Wealth should not be rewarded more than&nbsp;work.  Big businesses should pay their fair&nbsp;share.  Tax expenditures should build toward the future we want for&nbsp;all.  <p>The Current Situation</p><p>Our tax code furthers the divide between the haves and the have-nots — not just in the size of their wallets, but also in how they relate to and support each other. This can and has led to erosion of our sense of shared belonging and reciprocity.</p><p>In a variety of important ways, our tax code is not aligned with our American values of fairness and equity.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn2">[2]</a> It contributes to a corrosive inequality (across incomes, wealth, geography, gender, and race) that undermines our social fabric and our democracy, which in turn creates openness to authoritarian responses and solutions, <a href="https://institute.global/policy/themes-we-think-will-shape-2018">a theme the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change warned of in&nbsp;2018.</a></p><p>If we look at our federal tax system as a whole and for individual taxpayers, it is, broadly, progressive<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn3">[3]</a>. People with higher incomes tend to face higher tax rates on their income. For instance, the bottom 20% of households pay just 0.9% of their income in federal taxes, while the top 1% of households pay one-third of their income in federal&nbsp;taxes.</p><p>However, rates do not tell the whole story. From a <a href="https://www.epi.org/explorer/taxes">tool created by the Economic Policy Institute</a> to examine how US taxes and spending affect income inequality:</p><p>Decades of corporate tax cuts and increases in payroll taxes, which are less progressive, have weakened the equalizing effect of the federal tax system. Those taxpayers who derive most of their wealth from capital assets enjoy preferential tax rates while flat taxes on consumer goods, such as the gas tax, disproportionately harm those at the bottom of the income distribution. And the decline in corporate tax rates also explains why some analyses of the absolute richest households (the top 0.1% or the Forbes 400, for example) show their tax rates are actually lower than those faced by typical taxpayers.</p><p><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/substantial-income-of-wealthy-households-escapes-annual-taxation-or-enjoys#_ftn1">Because of our upside-down tax code</a>, in many cases, as Warren Buffet famously pointed out, people who have lower incomes end up paying a higher share of their income in taxes than people who have higher&nbsp;incomes.</p><p>We also tax income generated from labor at a higher rate than capital generated from wealth and investment. And businesses can take advantage of loopholes to avoid taxes that most employees cannot, again preferencing those with&nbsp;power.</p><p>What We Believe &amp; What We Should&nbsp;Do</p><p>Our society, democracy, and the functioning of our economy depend on citizens knowing that our social contract is being honored, and that there is fairness and reciprocity and opportunity for all, not just for some. The current tax code and its outcomes, however, do not live up to this standard; rather, they undermine trust and stand in the way of shared prosperity.</p><p>We know it requires much more than a fair tax code to build an equitable and inclusive economy. Often, tax is an output, redistributing money as a result of other economic policies. Ultimately, we believe we will have better outcomes if we focus upstream, building the markets and systems we want rather than trying only to remedy their unequal outcomes on the back end. So we view tax policy as a, “Yes,&nbsp;and.”</p><p>To that point, Omidyar Network also works on issues like expanding <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ON_POV_PDF-2020.pdf">worker power</a>, reshaping markets so that they incentivize businesses to contribute to the <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism-4/">common good</a>, and <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Omidyar-Network-POV_Platforms-and-Power_2.7.2020.pdf">reining in monopoly power</a> to increase competition and spark innovation.</p><p>In our effort to <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">reimagine capitalism</a> and seed a new economic paradigm, we argue that our government must govern markets in ways that prioritize the public good. We also call out the failings in our economic system that foment economic insecurity, exacerbate inequality, and deny opportunity, and as we have recently experienced, has resulted in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/10/capitol-insurrectionists-jenna-ryan-financial-problems/">the consequent openness to authoritarian siren&nbsp;songs</a>.</p><p>Omidyar Network, in alignment with our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Call to Reimagine Capitalism in America</a>, believes our <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2012/04/19/11404/the-federal-tax-code-and-income-inequality/">tax code currently reinforces wealth and income inequality</a>. We believe instead it should promote fairness, reciprocity, and a renewed social contract based on mutual trust between individuals and government. We urge our funding partners, current and future grantees, and policymakers at the local, state, and federal levels to consider the following principles when evaluating, advocating, and enacting tax&nbsp;policy:</p>  People with less shouldn’t pay more than people with&nbsp;plenty.  <p>The current tax code doesn’t ask enough of the&nbsp;wealthy.</p><p>This is grounded in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility">Peter Parker Principle</a>: With great power comes great responsibility. Before Spiderman, even Adam Smith, the Father of Economics and Capitalism wrote in The Wealth of&nbsp;Nations:</p><p>“[I]t is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion”, because a tax on “the luxuries and vanities of life [which] occasion the principal expense of the rich… would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very unreasonable.”</p><p>We believe we have mutual obligations to each other that should be reflected in our tax code, and that wealthy individuals have a responsibility to pay their fair share. People with higher incomes and assets should have both higher nominal and effective tax rates. Our tax code should reflect our values and reinforce broadly shared prosperity for the many, not just the privileged few.</p><p>2. Wealth should not be rewarded more than&nbsp;work.</p><p>Currently, our tax code gives preferential treatment to wealth-holders by taxing capital income at lower rates than labor income. This is true nominally through lower statutory rates and substantively through lower effective rates. This not only fuels inequality but disincentivizes work and deemphasizes investment in the real economy at the expense of increasing returns for shareholders.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn4">[4]</a></p><p>Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman wrote, “Less capital taxation means that the wealthy — who derive most of their income from capital — can mechanically accumulate more. This feeds a snowball effect: wealth generates income, income that is easily saved at a high rate when capital taxes are low; this saving adds to the existing stock of wealth, which in turn generates more income, and so&nbsp;on.”</p><p>Research suggests that many CEOs who take a $1 salary are rewarded with stock, option, or bonus packages that match — or even outweigh — the cash they sacrifice on a pay stub.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn5">[5]</a> One 2011 <a href="https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2011-7.pdf">study</a> of 50 executives concluded that the average “$1 CEO” gives up $610k in salary but gains $2m in other “not-so-visible forms of equity-based compensation.” These skewed compensation schemes are a predictable response to the incentives in our tax&nbsp;code.</p><p>There are many potential policy remedies to bring capital and labor taxation more in balance, and in turn, reduce economic inequities. Reflecting this principle, we support equalizing the treatment and rates (nominal and effective) between labor income and capital gains, which would likely entail raising tax rates on&nbsp;capital.</p><p>3. Big businesses should pay their fair&nbsp;share.</p><p>As with individuals, we suggest that large companies who earn more should pay&nbsp;more.</p><p>Part of that belief is based on an obligation to the common good but also acknowledges that many companies benefit from a range of government-provided services or investments (like the internet, highways, the postal system, government-sponsored research) that contribute to their ability to get off the ground, their profitability, and their basic operations.</p><p>Our tax policies and a raft of <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/tax-policy/tax-expenditures">tax expenditures</a>, both large and small, create a broad labyrinth of incentives to catalyze smart investments, support research and development, foster competition and competitiveness, slow the pace of climate change, and fuel our economy<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn6">[6]</a>.</p><p>At its best, tax policy can motivate businesses to hire people who would otherwise have a hard time finding work, including veterans and people with disabilities; encourage them to invest in communities that have been overlooked and left out; bring jobs home from overseas; promote clean energy to address our growing climate crisis; and help small business owners get started and&nbsp;succeed.</p><p>We are an organization founded by an entrepreneur. We believe our tax policies should help new businesses get off the ground, and we share the goal of fostering a vibrant, dynamic start-up economy. In alignment with The Tax Foundation, we too believe our<a href="https://taxfoundation.org/tax-policy-entrepreneurship/"> tax code should be seen as a vehicle for accelerating economic growth and dynamism</a>.</p><p>For decades, economists posited that higher individual and corporate tax rates stifle entrepreneurship and new start-up formation. The opposite is true. Data shows if you overlay corporate tax rates with rates of new business creation, you’ll see that as <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/historical-corporate-tax-rates-brackets/">corporate tax rates decreased over time</a>, so <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/trends-in-new-business-creation/">did new business creation</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn7">[7]</a></p><p>Additionally, evidence on the effect of tax on entrepreneurship is mixed at best, as the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/blog/more-evidence-that-you-cant-lure-entrepreneurs-with-tax-cuts">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a> has&nbsp;noted:</p><p>150 executives surveyed by <a href="http://www.endeavor.org/blog/about-insight/">Endeavor Insight</a>, a research firm that examines how entrepreneurs contribute to job creation and long-term economic growth, said a skilled workforce and high quality of life were the main reasons why they founded their companies where they did; taxes weren’t a significant factor.</p><p>Our government and our tax policies provide the infrastructure for new businesses to not only get started, but to thrive. From support for R&amp;D, to roads and bridges that move goods, to public services and universities that educate our students and working people, to basic elements and institutions that guarantee rule of law and the enforceability of contracts and private property, our government and our tax policies champion corporate opportunity.</p><p>With that opportunity again comes an obligation for corporations to pay their fair share. The corporate share of federal tax revenue has dropped by two-thirds in 60 years. Corporate tax revenue accounted for 32.1% of federal revenue in 1952, but by 2012, the share of corporate tax revenue had fallen to 9.9%, according to the Office of Management and&nbsp;Budget.</p><p>Why? It’s not because businesses are less profitable, or less competitive (In 1952, post-tax corporate profit was 8.6%; in 2012, it was 11%<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn8">[8]</a>). Rather our tax code now has enshrined a range of loopholes and exemptions that not only allow, but encourage, corporations to avoid or evade taxes.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn9">[9]</a></p><p>In 2020, 55 of the nation’s largest and most profitable corporations — including FedEx, Nike and Archer-Daniels-Midland — paid no federal corporate income tax, <a href="https://itep.org/55-profitable-corporations-zero-corporate-tax/">according to</a> the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy. This was legal. It was not&nbsp;fair.</p><p>Tax avoidance schemes involving tax havens in places like the Cayman Islands are estimated to cost as much as $100 billion a year in lost revenue, according to a <a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/files/REPORTTaxHavenBanksJuly1708FINALwPatEliseChgs92608.pdf">US Senate subcommittee</a> report from&nbsp;2008.</p><p>We do not fault them for taking advantage of the laws as written to minimize their tax obligations. They are behaving legally and rationally given the system’s rules. But we believe the laws themselves should change to better reflect our shared&nbsp;values.</p><p>While corporations can reduce the amount they owe in taxes in a variety of legal ways, we believe that avoiding fair taxation should not be a badge of honor. As billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban said, “While some people might find it distasteful to pay taxes, I don’t. I find it patriotic.”</p><p>Growth over the past 60 years has actually <a href="http://www.epi.org/files/2013/ib364-corporate-tax-rates-and-growth.pdf">been stronger when corporate tax rates were higher,</a> according to the Economic Policy Institute.</p><p>We need to close loopholes and strike the right balance in our corporate tax policy so that businesses can remain competitive while fulfilling their obligation to the broader community for the benefit of most Americans.</p><p>4. Tax expenditures should build toward the future we want for&nbsp;all.</p><p>There is always a push and pull with our tax code. Above, we spoke primarily about how we can pull back bad behavior and promote fairness. We also can use tax policy and tax expenditures to push good behavior forward and toward the outcomes we want as a&nbsp;society.</p><p>According to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the projected cost of the tax expenditures in 2020 was $1.795 trillion, with $172 billion in corporate expenditures and $1.62 trillion in individual expenditures.<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn10">[10]</a> The US tax code in recent years annually enshrines between 280–300 separate tax expenditures, roughly 60% of which are aimed at individual taxpayers, and the other 40% at business taxpayers.</p><p>The three biggest individual tax incentives by dollar amount are for employer-sponsored health plans, earnings on defined contribution pension plans, and reduced rates on dividends and long-term capital gains (see principle #2 above). A number of them are broad-based and well-intentioned, for instance, home mortgage interest deductions to promote home ownership, charitable contributions, or several more recent corporate tax expenditures, aimed at encouraging companies to repatriate income and jobs from overseas and remove intellectual property loopholes to avoid paying US tax. Others are quite narrow, for instance, commuting to work by&nbsp;bicycle.</p><p>However, in any broad analysis, like the vast majority of our tax code, tax expenditures tend to favor the wealthy and well-connected corporations. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52493">According to the Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO), on the individual taxpayer side, the top 1% of earners receive 17% of the benefit from individual tax expenditures. Lobbyists have wrangled expenditures for their clients’ special interests, including special depreciation schedules for corporate jets, loopholes that allow inversions, subsidies for fossil fuels, and deductions for CEO bonuses, as well as regular tax law that allows wealthy owners to depreciate their ownership of multi-billion-dollar sports&nbsp;teams.</p><p>Instead of being unduly swayed by corporate lobbyists, we encourage policymakers to examine tax expenditures with a holistic lens toward the future we want to build. We suggest the questions below as a guide so that expenditures are a vehicle for prosperity, fairness, and equity in our tax&nbsp;system:</p>  How can tax expenditures help close the racial wealth gap and address the systemic inequities that marginalize Black, Brown, and poor families?  How can tax expenditures help us mitigate and adapt to a rapidly changing&nbsp;climate?  How can tax expenditures spur research and development to prepare for the future, and invest in the real economy (while correcting for current shortfalls that allow R&amp;D investments to be opaque on tax returns)?  How can tax expenditures spark innovation to create the tech we want in service of the common&nbsp;good?  How can tax expenditures promote economic mobility and growth for the many, and improvement of the safety net for the least fortunate?  How can tax expenditures more generally reinforce a fairer, more progressive tax&nbsp;system?  <p>The recent changes to and expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) provide one clear answer to these questions. If made permanent, the CTC could “dramatically <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/600f2123fdfa730101a4426a/1611604260458/Poverty-Reduction-Analysis-American-Family-Act-CPSP-2020.pdf">reduce childhood poverty</a> and improve children’s chances of upward intergenerational mobility, increasing both their future earnings and the corresponding tax revenue that will be collected on it.”<a href="https://omidyar.com/our-vision-for-fair-equitable-tax-policy/#_ftn11">[11]</a> These are the types of tax expenditures that can have a dramatic, positive impact on our society for many Americans.</p><p>In theory, our tax code is “race-neutral.” However, it builds on a toxic legacy of policies that unfairly and unequally distribute resources. <a href="https://apps.urban.org/features/race-and-taxes/">Recent analysis by the Tax Policy Center </a>shows a variety of ways in which tax policies also exacerbate <a href="http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/">income and wealth inequalities</a> stemming from <a href="https://next50.urban.org/question/structural-racism">long-standing discrimination</a> in areas such as housing, education, and employment. According to a <a href="https://ncrc.org/holc/">study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition</a>, three out of four neighborhoods redlined on government maps 80 years ago continue to struggle economically.</p><p>Educational outcomes are also linked to redlining. <a href="https://www.edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai21-363.pdf">The Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University found that districts and schools located in formerly redlined neighborhoods have lower average test scores</a>. Today, 44% of Black families own their own home, compared to 74% of white families. To encourage more Black families to buy homes and build wealth, we could give a credit for first-time home buyers instead of a deduction for mortgage interest, which benefits borrowers buying bigger&nbsp;homes.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>As policymakers consider new tax policies, we suggest they meet the following tests:</p>  Does it benefit the many, not just the privileged few?  Does it address collective challenges, not just individual ones?  Does it reduce wealth and income inequalities, rather than increase them? Does it promote upward mobility for&nbsp;all?  Does it help achieve our shared values (e.g., reducing child poverty, creating good jobs, equity across race and&nbsp;gender)?  Does it foster innovation, economic growth, and investment in the real economy, rather than incentivize shareholder primacy and stockpiling cash and&nbsp;profits?  Does it preserve the principle of progressivity in our tax policy&nbsp;overall?  Does it discourage “bad behavior” and mitigate externalities (e.g., carbon tax, sin taxes on alcohol and cigarettes, financial transactions tax)?  <p>We are committed to applying this test to our own advocacy work related to revenue-focused policies at the federal and state&nbsp;level.</p><p>Tax policy must be reformed so that it is fairer and more equitable.

That night together they dreamed up a vision of the future where festivals were powered by solar, venues were off-grid and covered in flowers, museums were community energy providers, artists were united as beacons for&nbsp;change.</blockquote><p><a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> are currently helping JB with two strands of work. The first strand, which we can discuss here, involves digital transformation that includes hiring a digital product team. If you, or anyone you know, might be interested in applying for any of the roles, check out <a href="https://apply.workable.com/julies-bicycle/j/984AF66A8C/">JB’s recruitment page</a>. The first position is currently live, and more positions will be released over the next few weeks and&nbsp;months.</p><p>The second strand, led by <a href="https://outlandish.com">Outlandish</a> and to which we’re contributing, involves work with a large commercial music organisation.

The tools developed achieve this, <a href="https://ig-tools.com/login">Creative Green Tools</a>, are used by more than 5,000 organisations and sit alongside high-impact programmes and policy&nbsp;change.</p><p>These tools have, however, been developed piecemeal and in response to rounds of funding over the last decade or more. While they are looked after by a specific member of the JB team, they have been developed by freelancers based on the needs of particular projects and programmes.</p><p>Now, at a time when the urgency of the climate crisis is being felt everywhere, JB is creating their first digital team. This team will not only improve and expand Creative Green Tools, but potentially create new products and services.</p><p>Bringing this development in-house can be scary for not-for-profit organisations like JB.

<p>Authentication plays an increasingly important role in how governments are providing services around the world.</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit on Sept. 23, 2021, users, experts and vendors from around the world detailed how strong authentication helps to enable government services and new efforts to secure online identities. Users including the U.K. National Health Service (NHS), as well as the U.S. Government’s <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provided insights into the present and future of online authentication and digital identities.</p>



  



<p>In the opening session of the event, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance, outlined the strategic imperative for FIDO in government services around the world.</p>



<p>“COVID-19 created an imperative to really accelerate digital transformation activities,” Shikiar said. “When the pandemic hit all of a sudden, everyone was at home and all activity brought requirements for modern authentication schemes that go far beyond passwords, even beyond traditional multi-factor authentication.”</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance standards align very well with global regulations and policies and there is a growing trend of government guidance for authentication that cites the use of FIDO.</p>



<p>“It’s important to enable trust in the government ecosystem,” Shikiar said. “This comes through the engagement FIDO does with different regulators and government bodies and ultimately will be manifested through the secure implementation of digital identity services to citizens worldwide.”&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Technology Helping to Push FIDO Strong Authentication Forward</p>



<p>A key path for enabling FIDO specification is via vendors that support government efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patrick Sullivan, CTO of security strategy at Akamai, commented that password credential stuffing attacks are very common. He noted that Akamai’s platform sees as many as a billion password attacks per day. That’s where multi-factor authentication and more specifically strong authentication based on FIDO Alliance standards play a strong role. Sullivan noted that there is a clear need to provide multi-factor authentication in a low friction environment where it’s delivered in the form factor of an app on a smartphone.</p>



<p>“We’re not asking users to carry around a hardware token to accomplish FIDO2 as we move in that direction, and by introducing less friction, there’s less risk of our users doing something anomalous,” Sullivan said.</p>



<p>Jeff Frederick, manager of solutions engineering at Yubico, noted during his session that in government, many agencies in the U.S use Common Access Card (CAC)/Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials that go beyond basic passwords. Frederick noted that FIDO2 standards, which are supported on his company’s YubiKey device, provide a strong impersonation resistant authentication protocol that uses public private key cryptography.</p>



  



<p>“It’s very similar to PIV/CAC and FIDO2 is an open standard that’s managed by the FIDO Alliance, so that any vendor can support this and use it today,” Frederick said. “It’s built into all major operating systems and all major browsers so there’s no middleware that you need to install to make this work and it’s just an easy to implement solution that will modernize the federal authentication infrastructure across the board.”</p>



<p>Making Identity and Authentication Less Taxing at the IRS</p>



<p>The IRS proofs and authorizes tens of millions of taxpayers every year, across both digital and non digital channels, according to Courtney Rasey, assistant to the director, Identity Assurance, Privacy Governmental Liaison, &amp; Disclosure (PGLD) at the IRS.</p>



<p>“None of those tens of millions of taxpayers who are calling the IRS are doing so just because they want to, it’s not really a fun weeknight activity,” she said. “They need to resolve an issue to meet their tax obligation and we know that, so we’re always striving to provide better service to taxpayers, to help them get the service that they need in the most convenient and efficient way possible.”</p>



  



<p>One way the IRS is looking to be more convenient to taxpayers is with its Secure Access Digital Identity (SADI) platform that was launched in June of 2021. Rasey explained that SADI leverages a Credential Service {rovider (CSP) that identity proofs the taxpayer and then provides the IRS with a digital identity credential.</p>



<p>“Users are eventually going to be able to access all IRS online applications utilizing that single digital identity credential,” Rasey said. “The IRS is moving more and more applications behind SADI throughout fiscal year 2022 and as we do move more applications taxpayers are going to be able to do so many things with just one credential.”</p>



<p>Moving Toward Zero Trust with Strong Authentication</p>



<p>In May, President Biden signed Executive Order 1402, which directs U.S. government agencies to improve cybersecurity. One of the primary provisions of the executive order is to move the federal government toward a zero trust architecture.</p>



  



<p>“When we talk about zero trust, we’re talking about an architecture where people and their devices aren’t trusted just by virtue of being inside an organization’s enterprise network,” explained Eric Mill, senior advisor, Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>



<p>Mill noted that in a zero trust model, people and devices are validated at each step and&nbsp; authentication is context-aware. The OMB is strongly encouraging the adoption of phishing resistant multi-factor authentication, with FIDO WebAuthn as a good alternative option in environments where CAC/PIV isn’t feasible.</p>



<p>“We’re pushing very hard on multi-factor authentication and we really view reliable authentication as a critical foundation of zero trust architecture,” Mill said.</p>



<p>In a Policy Deep Dive session, Jeremy Grant, managing director, technology business strategy at Venable, noted that there are a number of reasons why authentication is important to governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grant said that FIDO specifications can help governments to protect access to their own assets and can help to enable more high-value citizen facing services to the public.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think what we’re seeing in 2021, is a really different environment across the globe, where FIDO authentication is emerging, not just as another permitted option, but in many cases as a preferred choice of governments across the world,” Grant said.</p>



  



<p>How the National Health Service (NHS) uses FIDO</p>



<p>Among the areas in the world where FIDO is finding a home is in the U.K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded medical and healthcare system in the U.K. and it has embraced FIDO standards to help improve human health.&nbsp; With the NHS Login service, citizens get a centralized identity for health services while the NHS app provides a simplified application for accessing and managing an individual’s access to health services.</p>



<p>Priyanka Mittal, technical architect for the NHS Login and NHS app, said that over the past 18 months there has been a 10-fold increase in the user base for NHS login as demand has grown during the pandemic.</p>



  



<p>Sean Devlin, tech lead for the NHS App, explained that initially the services started out using an SMS based two-factor authentication approach, but wanted to find a more seamless approach. NHS decided to use FIDO UAF and built out its own implementation, using eBay’s open source FIDO implementation as a starting point.</p>



<p>Devlin said that before using FIDO, users had to navigate as many as five different screens to get through a multi-factor authentication flow. With FIDO, it’s a single screen.</p>



<p>The NHS has also saved a lot of money by moving to FIDO. With over 500,000 FIDO logins per day, Devlin estimates that the NHS is saving on the order of £8,000 per day on SMS messaging costs.</p>



<p>Bringing FIDO Strong Authentication to Login.gov</p>



<p>FIDO specifications also play a pivotal role at login.gov, which is a single sign-on platform for U.S. government services.</p>



  



<p>Jonathan Hooper, login.gov Engineering Lead at the General Services Administration (GSA), explained that the authentication portal fronts over 200 sites across the U.S. government,&nbsp; spread across 27 different agencies. Hooper explained that starting in 2018,<a href="http://login.gov"> login.gov</a> began expanding the use of multi-factor authentication, including the WebAuthn specification.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to be ‘big brother,’ we want to make sure that we can protect users’ privacy and the things built into the protocol that helped to do that were very attractive to us,” Hooper said. “WebAuthn is also very cheap, it is much cheaper to do a WebAuthn authentication event than it is to do SMS by several orders of magnitude.”</p>



<p>Improving Digital Identity with FIDO</p>



<p>A FIDO-based approach for digital identity could soon be finding its way to Canada as well according to Joni Brennan, president, Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC). An effort currently underway is the Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) which is an information assurance framework.</p>



<p>“We think that there’s a great opportunity here to leverage an information assurance framework, coupled with FIDO Alliance driven specifications, to create and to verify that end to end experience that’s needed for&nbsp;digital ID adoption,” she said.</p>



  



<p>The need for secured digital identities was also highlighted by Amit Mital, special assistant to the President and senior director, National Security Council at the White House.</p>



<p>“Today, when we authenticate ourselves and identify ourselves, we might use one of dozens of popular systems,” Mital said. “</p>



<p>So the ecosystem itself is very decentralized, and it’s very unharmonized. It is also fundamentally unsecure.”</p>



<p>Mital said that there is a clear need for strong remote identity solutions that can provide easy, secure, affordable and reliable ways to identify consumers across digital systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s clear that there are a diverse and large number of scenarios that need digital identity and there is no single entity that can solve all these scenarios,” Mital said. “We need an ecosystem that brings together the best ideas and innovation from the private sector, both large companies and startups, as well as the government at both the federal and the state, the local, tribal and territorial lands.”</p>



<p>Wrapping up the day’s event, Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, observed that there are a lot of conversations ongoing about&nbsp; different types of government services and their dependency on secure digital identity.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, identity and authentication are core to deploy new services at scale, in a way that meets the requirements for government agencies, and for citizens alike,” Shikiar said.</p>

<p>The growing interest in verifiable digital credentials, such as mobile driver’s licenses or digital health passes, means companies and governments need new tools for managing risk in this decentralized infrastructure. “Risk management in financial services, such as banking and credit card networks, is a mature field,” said Scott Perry, co-chair of the ToIP Foundation Governance Stack Working Group. “But as we move into decentralized identity management, where individuals manage credentials in their own digital wallets, we need new risk management tools designed for this paradigm.”</p>



<p>To begin to fill this gap, today the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation announced the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ToIP-Risk-Assessment-Worksheet-Template-GSWG-Final-Draft.xlsx">ToIP Risk Assessment Worksheet (Excel format)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ToIP-Risk-Assessment-Companion-Guide-RACG-ToIP-Format.pdf">Companion Guide (PDF)</a>. These new tools are intended to equip architects of&nbsp;digital governance frameworks&nbsp;— ”rulebooks” for establishing trust online—with the knowledge they need to perform a risk assessment grounded in generally accepted global standards and techniques, including:</p>



  Proper consideration and identification of potential risks,  Critical analysis of risks in terms of likelihood and severity,  Calculating a systematic risk impact score,  Triaging risks for further treatment,  Risk mitigation requirements and strategies,  Performance of an annual review to reassess existing risks and consider new ones.  



<p>The Risk Assessment Worksheet and Companion Guide provides a step-by-step method of performing a systematic risk assessment that conforms with industry-standard guidance such as ISO/IEC 27005 and NIST 800-30. This process identifies and categorizes risks by likelihood and severity in order to create a risk score that can be color-coded, and stack ranked to highlight the need for countermeasures as shown below. The Worksheet and Companion Guide include enough background and educational content that even risk assessment novices should be able to drive the risk assessment process. “A key missing piece of building open digital trust ecosystems has been a deep understanding of the various risks they introduce.</p>







<p>This can scare off key stakeholders“, said Darrell O’Donnell, CEO of Continuum Loop and Chair of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">ToIP Governance Stack Working Group</a>. “The Risk Assessment Worksheet is a powerful tool that helps create clarity about where the real risks are in an ecosystem and what to do about them.”</p>



<p>The Risk Assessment Worksheet and Companion Guide are the first deliverables from the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">ToIP Governance Stack Working Group</a>&nbsp;(GSWG), whose mission is to produce a complete suite of tools, models, templates, and guides for digital governance frameworks. GSWG member Vikas Malhotra, CEO of WOPLLI Technologies, explained why risk assessment was at the top of the list: “Willingness to take risks is key to forming trust. A risk assessment process helps to qualify and quanfy the risk in a situation, so that the potential trustor can use the information to understand if they should take the risk or not.”</p>



<p>These new tools for risk assessment are already being put to use by digital trust ecosystems being incubated within the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">ToIP Ecosystem Foundry Working Group</a>. An example is the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Yoma+Ecosystem+Governance+Framework">YOMA governance framework</a>&nbsp;for youth education and life skills credentials in Africa. “Designing a digital trust ecosystem without first assessing the specific risks it is intended to address is like laying underground pipes without testing them to determine the possibility of leakages” said Frednand Furia, who is leading the Yoma Trust Assurance Task Force. “The ToIP Risk Assessment Worksheet and Companion Guide have already proved to be very effective in architecting the YOMA Rules governance and trust framework.”</p>

 Project EDGE is setting the standard for a customer-centric grid architecture that maximizes the value — and impact — of distributed resources <blockquote>“Customers don’t want kilowatt-hours; they want… hot showers and cold&nbsp;beer.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://rmi.org/insight/negawatt-revolution/">Amory Lovins’ famous quip</a> highlights a paradox of the global energy transition: although hardly anyone gives a second thought to the machinations of the grid, consumer behavior is perhaps the most significant force transforming the electric utility industry.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-03/hyperdrive-daily-ev-adoption-outpaced-off-the-mark-outlooks">Each year actual adoption of electric vehicles, flexible loads, rooftop solar arrays, battery storage systems, and other DERs exceeds even the most bullish of predictions</a>. Transitioning to a decarbonized, distributed electricity system seems less like a wicked problem and more like an irreversible trend.</p><p>Case in point: the Ford F-150 Lightning. When the best-selling vehicle (a pickup truck, no less) in the most car-crazy country on Earth turns into a 180 kWh power plant on wheels with the ability to provide full-home backup power for over a week, distributed energy has officially gone mainstream.</p><p>There is no doubt that an <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/energy-transport-sustainability-10-predictions-for-2021/">ever-growing fleet</a> of DERs represents a massive opportunity to improve resiliency, lower costs, and reduce carbon emissions in grids across the world. Yet even as DERs get cheaper, more powerful, and more plentiful, they remain chronically underutilized.</p><p>Regulations like <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">FERC Order 2222</a> and frameworks like <a href="https://eepublicdownloads.entsoe.eu/clean-documents/Publications/Position%20papers%20and%20reports/TSO-DSO_ASM_2019_190416.pdf">Integrated TSO/DSO Coordination</a> have been developed specifically to address this challenge and tap into burgeoning DER resources in the US and Europe, respectively. Yet while FERC 2222 is ostensibly designed to remove barriers to DER participation in all energy markets, it has caused much hand wringing, delayed regulatory filings from every major ISO / RTO, and as yet, no tangible results. In Europe, progress on TSO/DSO coordination isn’t much further along. Despite plenty of <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/30/17868620/renewable-energy-power-grid-architecture">excellent work on conceptual frameworks</a>, hesitation remains amongst grid operators (and regulators) to lean into the transition.</p><p>Why? By and large, incumbents are focused on solving the wrong problem. Too often, the assumption is that the key to unlocking the full potential of DERs is some sort of optimization: How can we perfectly utilize lots of small-scale, flexible assets to balance the variable nature of large-scale renewables like wind and solar? That work is important, but it’s not the real barrier to redesigning our grids’ architecture and toolsets. Focusing on DER optimization is like debating the merits of Gmail vs. Apple Mail vs. Microsoft Outlook before you’ve solved a more fundamental issue: how to send and receive email through a common, narrow waist protocol.</p><p>Before we can optimize DERs, the grid needs its own equivalent of SMTP — an open protocol through which DERs of all shapes and sizes can seamlessly exchange data and integrate into markets. The solution may not be easy, but it is surprisingly simple: there needs to be a shared view of DER attributes, relationships, and behaviors across all participants so each can perform their respective function. Just as the physical grid evolved over a century ago, the best way to achieve this is through shared, public digital infrastructure, rather than leaving it up to individual companies to manage independently. We can all move better and faster when we move together.</p><p>To see the answer in action, look to Australia.</p><p>Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) is at the bleeding edge of the distributed energy world, and it’s only getting more advanced in the coming years. With the <a href="https://onestepoffthegrid.com.au/australia-leads-the-world-on-solar-per-capita-at-664-watts-per-person/">highest per capita penetration of solar PV in the world</a>, an incredibly <a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/05/31/australias-energy-storage-installed-base-to-grow-more-than-five-times-by-2030/">mature storage market</a>, a<a href="https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/topics/climate-change/net-zero-plan/electric-vehicle-strategy"> host of EV incentives</a>, and greatly expanded <a href="https://aemo.com.au/en/initiatives/trials-and-initiatives/wholesale-demand-response-mechanism">opportunities for demand-side market participation</a>, Australia is on pace to get <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/henbest-energy-2040-faster-shift-clean-dynamic-distributed/">nearly half of its electricity from DERs by&nbsp;2040</a>.</p><p>In a deregulated energy market like the NEM, there are lots of proverbial cooks in the kitchen. For any given customer who owns rooftop solar or storage, there’s a long list of stakeholders, including the DER manufacturer (or “OEM”), the DER installer, the local distribution utility (Distribution Network Service Provider, or “DNSP”), their energy retailer, perhaps an aggregator, and of course the Australian Energy Market Operator&nbsp;(AEMO).</p><p>Each of these parties, including the customer themselves, is interested in the DER for different reasons. The customer might primarily care about how the DER delivers comfort or economic benefit, the OEM cares about operational performance and warranties, the DNSP cares about the DER’s impact on network congestion, the retailer on tariffs and/or wholesale market exposure, the aggregator on its impact to deliver grid services or optimize its DER portfolio, and AEMO cares about its contribution (or lack thereof) to the aggregator’s portfolio delivery.</p><p>Today each of these stakeholders operates more or less in their own separate world with limited, if any, information about the others. Typically, the information each stakeholder has about the DER and its influence on their domain is protected; sharing is not encouraged and customers need to register separate accounts with each entity. This presents a number of problems.</p><p>The primary revenue opportunity for DER owners is providing one or more services in the NEM wholesale market via an aggregator. As more aggregators enroll more DERs into more services and markets, the collective impact on the distribution network can be detrimental if DER behavior is not informed by physical grid constraints. Even though they manage interconnection requests, the DNSPs don’t ordinarily enroll DERs to use for local services, so they don’t monitor or manage their behavior on an ongoing basis. Yet most customers would happily enroll in complementary local services programs for DNSPs to maximize their revenue potential.</p><p>So we currently have markets where participants often act in operational silos, and DERs are not utilized to their fullest potential. Data exchanges, where they exist, are accomplished through bespoke point-to-point integrations between each participant’s system. Maintaining alignment across all their systems, managing access and permissions, and establishing relationships is extremely costly relative to the value of any given&nbsp;DER.</p> Project EDGE: Overcoming the Barriers of Legacy Data&nbsp;Exchange <p>In <a href="https://energyweb.org/aemo/">Project EDGE</a>, Energy Web (EW) is working with AEMO, AusNet (a key DNSP), and Mondo (a large aggregator), to build a shared infrastructure for establishing identity, roles, and permissions for all market participants. Instead of the bilateral point-to-point integrations, we’re building a hub and spoke architecture in which each participant’s IT system integrates with a common, shared data exchange solution. In other words, the hub isn’t unilaterally controlled by any single party; rather, it’s built using EW’s Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS), which allows every single market player to participate by hosting nodes (i.e., servers) that facilitate data exchange between all parties’ internal IT and OT systems. It provides a shared, trusted view of identity, relationships, and permissions for different actors and components within the system. EW-DOS also streamlines message exchange, and allows AusNet (the distribution utility), and AEMO (the wholesale market operator) to coordinate on the utilisation of DERs simultaneously across local and wholesale services.</p><p>In EDGE, all participating organizations and DER assets are given a unique digital identity via <a href="https://did-explainer.energyweb.org/#/default-dashboard">decentralized identifiers, or DIDs</a>. DIDs not only contain information about the physical location and attributes of DERs, but also define relationships (e.g. mapping a given DER to a specific aggregator’s portfolio) as well as roles within the EDGE marketplace (e.g. permissions to send/receive, or read/write certain types of&nbsp;data).</p><p>On the aggregator side, DIDs act as a common anchor point for enrolling and operating DERs in multiple markets based on their technical capabilities and where they are connected in the distribution grid. On the grid operator side, DIDs help the DNSP pair enrollment information with actual, physical grid constraints — such as congestion or capacity limits on certain distribution feeder circuits — so AEMO can factor those constraints into wholesale market operations. In short, DIDs become the common currency — the narrow waist protocol — by which all parties develop a shared understanding of the system state and move forward from&nbsp;there.</p><p>DERs are interconnected physically to the grid. With EDGE, they are now also interconnected digitally to each other and to grid operators’ systems, unlocking a next wave of the energy transition. By leveraging a shared infrastructure, EDGE removes the traditional friction for identity verification and data reconciliation among aggregators, DNSPs, and AEMO. Being fully open source, there are no licence fees, which helps significantly reduce market operating costs, as well as competitive barriers for existing and new entrants. Having designed it to be protocol agnostic, the EDGE architecture is highly flexible, ensuring participants don’t need to reengineer their own systems to engage with&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the ongoing energy transition, decarbonization via renewable energy is an unstoppable runaway train. Meanwhile, decentralization — via connecting and leveraging low-carbon DERs at scale — is gaining major momentum due to growing investment by customers, and in part regulatory tailwinds from FERC Order 2222 and similar regulations. But despite their rapid growth, DERs too often remain islands unto themselves — myriad isolated outposts connected to the edges of the electricity grid, collecting data in siloed, private databases.</p><p>Before we can make use of that data to optimize DERs for local or system benefits, the grid needs a narrow waist protocol through which DERs can seamlessly and securely establish identity and share data amongst all stakeholders.</p><p>Grid operators from the U.S. and EU can and should look at what’s happening in the Southern Hemisphere with Project EDGE: DIDs anchored to public digital infrastructure provide the necessary on-ramp for DERs to be the integral grid-connected assets evangelists have been saying they are. What we’re building may be driven by the requirements of the NEM, but the open-source EW-DOS stack is directly relevant to any market looking for ways to better tap into DERs.

 Link to the recordings: <a href="https://t.co/lTyCZnwef1?amp=1">https://t.co/lTyCZnwef1?amp=1</a> 
 Both specs are ready to start implementing and being improved based on implementation feedback. 
 In OIDC4VP, progress has been made on using Presentation Exchange in the request-response syntax, for example, agreeing to include presentation_submission inside the signed ID token even when VP is being sent back separately as a VP Token. 
 In SIOP v2, some relevant discussions worth highlighting are how to use DIDs as Relying Party's (RP) client_id to resolve it and obtain RP's registration metadata; using universal links and trust frameworks to invoke SIOP instead of using custom URL schema.

<p>Submitted by SecureKeys' <a href="https://medium.com/@baha.abushaaban">Baha Shaaban</a>, edited by <a href="https://medium.com/@chris.lp">DIF's Chris Kelly</a>.<br></p><p>In short, ECDH-1PU is a key derivation process that allows for sender authenticity and enables a “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/what-is-perfect-forward-secrecy/#:~:text=Perfect%20forward%20secrecy%20means%20that,of%20the%20user's%20sensitive%20data.">Perfect Forward Secrecy</a>” mechanism, in addition to significant performance gains over JWS message nested in a JWE envelope, as used by existign ECDH-ES aproaches. This article walks through how ECDH-ES works step by step, showing how it achieves sender identity authentication using nested messages (JWS in JWE), and finally showing how ECDH-1PU is a better choice for authenticating the sender. This helps maintain the use of a single JWE message (without JWS) to meet the need for constrained agents (such as IOT devices) by reducing their communication footprint.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mathyaskurmann?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Mathyas Kurmann</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/post?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman</a> (ECDH) is a protocol that allows two parties to establish a secure and private channel over an insecure and observed network, and forms the basis for the secure encryption on many popular messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Signal and Skype… as well as DIDComm V1, which is being superseded by a more broadly interoperable V2. So-called “Diffie-Hellman” key exchanges ensure that messages sent over the channel they create can only be correctly interpreted by the sender and intended recipient, regardless of eavesdropping or security breaches on the communications channel.</p><p>As described in the<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#message-encryption"> Message Encryption</a> section of the DIDComm v2 specification, the DIDComm protocol for transmitting Decentralized IDentifiers (DIDs) requires protecting a message using either Anonymous Encryption (aka `Anoncrypt`) or Sender Authenticated Encryption (aka `Authcrypt`). Either of these methods take different inputs and create a secure channel between two or more parties.</p><p>In the “AnonCrypt” handshake, there is no pre-existing “sender key” involved and it is intended for only the recipients of the message. This mechanism requires encryption with a Content Encryption Key (a “cek”) being wrapped with a key agreement mechanism using `ECDH-ES` for each recipient. DIDComm uses this “key-wrapping mode” with<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6"> ECDH-ES</a> to ensure only the intended recipients can decrypt the final message. The benefit of using `ECDH-ES` is that it's widely used and available in many crypto libraries for most modern languages. Building JWE envelopes using this type of encryption should be relatively easy using existing JOSE libraries in your preferred language.</p><p>“AuthCrypt'', however, requires a pre-existing (and published/discoverable) sender key to encrypt the message for the sender, and against which the sender can be authenticated. This encryption mechanism uses the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04"> ECDH-1PU</a> specification from IETF, the main topic of this article. As a growing number of independent implementations get announced, 1PU advances on the Standards Track at IETF and achieves maturity as a specification; for this reason, we are offering this educational resource so that understanding of its mechanisms can grow as well.</p> The all-important “Z” in ECDH-ES, first step in understanding ECDH-1PU <p>To understand how ECDH-1PU is significant, knowledge about the internals of ECDH-ES is required. ECDH-ES key agreement requires the sender to execute the following steps for each recipient to derive the key used to wrap the `cek`:</p><p>1. Generate an<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6.1.1"> ephemeral key</a> (aka `epk`).</p><p>2. Build `apu`, the producer (sender) identity. For Anoncrypt, this will represent the X value of `epk`, base64URL-encoded.</p><p>3. Build `apv`, the receiver (recipient) identity. It can optionally contain the recipient `kid`, base64URL-encoded.</p><p>4. Compute `Z`: the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4.6.2"> key derivation</a> process output of ECDH for each recipient using the above values with the **private** `epk` key and the recipient’s **public** key on the sender side. An example is found in<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#appendix-C"> appendix C</a> of the IETF RFC7518. On their end, the recipient will get the **public** `epk` and therefore does the same computation with their own **private** key.</p><p>5. Finally, the computed derived key is used to wrap the `cek`, the symmetric key used to encrypt/decrypt the payload content (the `ciphertext` section) of the JWE envelope .</p><p>So, to be clear, ECDH-ES takes as mandatory inputs an ephemeral key generated by the sender and the recipient's public key (a static long-lived key) to compute the key derivation `Z`; for this reason, the ES notation means Ephemeral-Static in ECDH-ES. This derivation fits neatly the requirement to protect messages for recipients without revealing the sender's identity (ie: no static sender key is used in the key derivation process when the recipient derives `Z`).</p> Key derivation beyond ECDH-ES to enable AuthCrypt <p>In the previous section, key derivation using an ephemeral key does not reveal who sent the message. This is useful for messages requiring anonymity of the author, e.g. a router agent receiving a message does not need to authenticate the sender in any way; its only purpose is to route the message to an end recipient. For this router agent, passing along Anoncrypt messages is acceptable.</p><p>In most cases, an end recipient requires authenticating the original sender. This means recipients will need to hold the sender's public key prior to receiving their messages in order to authenticate them. Since ECDH-ES does not involve the sender key, the only way to authenticate a sender is to nest a JWS in a JWE message which is “heavier” &nbsp;than a plain JWE-only message, i.e., more complex (i.e. expensive) to process and route.</p><p>Another, newer, option would be to use a new key derivation process that involves the sender's key.<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04"> ECDH-1PU</a> was introduced for this specific purpose; it uses the sender's static key in the key derivation process. The following section is dedicated to this process.</p> The Advantages of using ECDH-1PU (adapted from the DIDComm v2<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-1"> Introduction</a>) <p></p><p>The advantages of public key authenticated encryption with ECDH-1PU<br>compared to using nested, signed-then-encrypted documents include:</p><p>Size and Efficiency</p><p>The resulting message size is more compact, as an additional layer of headers and base64url-encoding is avoided. &nbsp;A 500-byte payload when encrypted and authenticated with ECDH-1PU (with P-256 keys and "A256GCM" Content Encryption Method) results in a 1087-byte JWE in Compact Encoding. &nbsp;An equivalent, nested-then-signed-then-encrypted JOSE message using the same keys and encryption method is 1489 bytes (37% larger).</p><p>In both cases, though, the same cryptographics primitives achieve the same levels of confidentiality and authenticity, so these savings in code size, so crucial for constrained environments, come at no cost to privacy and security outcomes.</p><p>Increased Security</p><p>The generic composition of signatures and public key encryption involves a number of subtle details that are essential to security (namely, to the traits of Public Key Authenticated Encryption or<a href="https://neilmadden.blog/2018/12/14/public-key-authenticated-encryption-and-why-you-want-it-part-iii/"> PKAE</a>). Providing a dedicated algorithm for public key authenticated encryption reduces complexity for users of JOSE libraries, which lowers the incidence of human error and design flaws with cybersecurity implications.</p><p>Flexibility</p><p>ECDH-1PU provides only authenticity and not the stronger security properties of non-repudiation or third-party verifiability. This can be an advantage in applications where privacy, anonymity, or plausible deniability are goals.</p> ECDH-1PU for sender authentication <p>Similar to ECDH-ES, the 1PU process executes key derivation to compute a Z but has 2 computations rather than 1, with the final result being formed by concatenating both as described here (Adapted from the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-2.3"> Key Derivation</a> section of RFC7518):</p><p>1. The first is called `Ze`, which is the exact same key derivation as ECDH-ES using a private encryption provider key (`epk`) and the public recipient key on the sender side. (The recipient side will involve the public `epk` and the private recipient key).</p><p>2. The second is called `Zs`; in this second computation, we use the sender's static (long-lived) key instead of `epk`. So on the sender side we derive `Zs` by using the sender's private key and the recipient's public key. (The recipient side will use the sender's public key and the recipient's private key on their end).</p><p>The final `Z` is the concatenation of `Ze` and `Zs` which is then used in the key-wrapping, analogously to ECDH-ES.</p><p>There are special considerations in the process to protect against sender impersonation as described in Section<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madden-jose-ecdh-1pu-04#section-2.1"> 2.1</a> of the draft:</p>  In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, the JWE Authentication Tag is included in the input to the Key Derivation Function as described in section Section 2.3. &nbsp;This ensures that the content of the JWE was produced by the original sender and not by another recipient, as described in the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-4"> Key Management Algorithms Section</a> of the RFC.  Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode MUST only be used with content encryption algorithms that are compactly committing AEADs as described in the Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2-05"> specification</a>.  The AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 algorithms described in<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-5.2"> section 5.2</a> of RFC7518 are compactly committing and can be used with ECDH-1PU in Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode. Other content encryption algorithms MUST be rejected.  In Direct Key Agreement mode, any JWE content encryption algorithm MAY be used. This mode is NOT supported in DIDComm V2.  <p>The requirement to include the JWE Authentication Tag in the input to the Key Derivation Function implies an adjustment to the order of operations performed during JWE Message Encryption described in section 5.1 of [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7516">RFC7516</a>]. &nbsp;Steps 3-8 are deferred until after step15, using the randomly generated CEK from step 2 for encryption of the message content.</p><p>To sum up, these considerations require:</p><p>1. The use of the `AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA` family of content encryption algorithms to encrypt the payload. Currently, JWE supports the following three algorithms in this family:</p><p>1. A128CBC-HS256</p><p>2. A192CBC-HS384</p><p>3. A256CBC-HS512</p><p>Note, however, that the DIDComm v2 specification<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#curves-and-content-encryption-algorithms"> constrains payload encryption options</a> to minimize interoperability issues across implementations, so only the third-listed encryption algorithm, A256CBC-HS512, should be used for DIDComm v2 purposes.</p><p>2. Encrypt the payload prior to wrapping `cek` with the derived `Z`. The output is labelled `ciphertext` and `tag`</p><p>3. Use the resulting `tag` from the previous step as the value `len(tag)`+`tag` set in `cctag` in the key derivations of `Ze` and `Zs`.</p><p>Additionally, the `skid` protected header is also introduced as a `kid` (key ID) to reference the sender key. This will help recipients resolve the key behind `skid` and execute the ECDH-1PU process explained in the previous section.</p><p>For the sake of consistency, `apu` and `apv` must be set to the values mentioned in<a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#ecdh-1pu-key-wrapping-and-common-protected-headers"> section 5.8</a> of the DIDComm Messaging protocol to further restrain and protect the message.</p> Conclusion <p><br>ECDH-1PU is a public-key derivation process that allows for sender authentication and offers not only increased security, but also performance gains as mentioned above, especially when compared to a JWS message nested in a JWE envelope. This article walked through the implementation of ECDH-ES, showing how it achieves sender identity authentication using nested messages (JWS in JWE), and finally showing how ECDH-1PU is a better choice for authenticating the sender. This helps maintain the use of a single JWE message (without JWS) to meet the need for constrained agents (such as IOT devices) by reducing their communication footprint, as well as making it suitable where anonymity and privacy are of particular concern.<br></p><p>To find out more about joining the DIDComm Working Group at DIF, visit their page<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html"> here</a>, or follow their work on GitHub<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging"> here</a>.<br><br><br><br></p>

     <p><a>Os GLNs são utilizados para distinguir de forma única uma entidade/localização de outro. Como resultado, uma mudança ou descontinuação para um GLN NÃO DEVERÁ exigir que outro GLN seja alterado ou que a sua utilização seja descontinuada se nada mais tiver sido modificado.</a></p>    <p> Importante: Se ocorrer uma alteração que possa afetar vários GLNs, todos os GLNs impactados DEVERÃO ser avaliados separadamente com base nas Normas de Gestão dos GLNs (por exemplo, fusão ou separação). Outras alterações ao GS1 Company Prefix (Prefixo da Empresa GS1) ou ao estatuto de licenciamento das chaves de identificação individuais GS1 DEVERÃO ser avaliadas com base nas Especificações Gerais GS1, secção 1.6 Atribuição. O prefixo da empresa GS1 ou os titulares das chaves de identificação GS1 DEVERÃO referir-se às Organizações Membro da GS1 para informações específicas sobre as suas licenças.</p>    <p>Exemplo 1:</p>    <p>A GS1 Garden Company dissolveu a sua entidade jurídica e depois formou uma nova entidade jurídica sob uma estrutura diferente. Como resultado, o seu GLN tem de mudar. Um novo GLN é atribuído à entidade jurídica recém-formada. Todos os GLNs pré-existentes que a GS1 Garden Company tinha em uso são reassociados ao novo GLN, identificando Dal Giardino como a entidade jurídica. Os GLNs pré-existentes não precisam de ser descontinuados ou alterados.</p>    <p>Quadro 2‑7 Actualização do GLN: Exemplo 1</p>    <p></p>    <p>Exemplo 2:</p>    <p>Uma empresa tem três GLNs atribuídos: O GLN A identifica uma entidade jurídica, o GLN B identifica um armazém, e o GLN C identifica um departamento de contabilidade.</p>    <p>A empresa faz uma alteração que os obriga a alterar o GLN B. Não ocorreram alterações ao licenciamento do Prefixo da Empresa GS1. Os GLNs A e C permanecem os mesmos porque as modificações apenas têm impacto no GLN B.</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>Quadro 2‑8 Atualização do GLN: Exemplo 2</p>    <p></p>     <a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a></a><a>2.3.1 Impacto na componente de extensão do GLN</a>     <p><a> </a></p>    <p><a>Os componentes de extensão GLN só têm significado quando associados a um GLN que identifica uma localização física. Um componente de extensão GLN só DEVERÁ ser utilizado internamente por uma empresa/organização ou então através de acordo mútuo entre parceiros, para identificar uma sub-localização na ou dentro da localização do GLN que identifica a localização física. Ver secção </a><a title="Go to 2.1.2.1">2.1.2.1</a> para mais pormenores. A descontinuação de um GLN suspende automaticamente o(s) componente(s) de extensão do GLN associado(s). Quando uma sub-localização associada a um componente de extensão do GLN descontinuado precisa de ser identificada dentro de um novo local físico, terá de ser atribuído um novo GLN ou reassociado a um novo GLN.</p>    <p>Exemplo:</p>    <p>O GLN H foi descontinuado como resultado de uma remodelação de um edifício que modificou a disposição física do local. Consequentemente, os componentes da extensão do GLN que estavam associados ao GLN H foram também desativados. As prateleiras, no entanto, permaneceram relevantes para o novo espaço, pelo que os componentes de extensão do GLN H foram reassociados ao GLN K.</p>    <p><a>Quadro </a>2‑9 Atualização de GLN e decomponentes de extensão do GLN</p>    <p></p>    <p>*EC é utilizada para representar a componente de extensão do GLN no Quadro 2-9</p>

The U.S. has seen examples this year from a variety of immediate causes: February’s <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/14/texas-power-grid-conserve-ercot/">grid failure in Texas</a> from extreme cold, this summer’s grid challenges in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/new-york-heat-wave-nears-its-sweaty-peak-as-northwest-highs-ease?sref=vuYGislZ">New York City from extreme heat</a>, and reduced transmission capacity and power supply due to wildfires in the&nbsp;West.</p><p>These challenges show no signs of abating, and therefore grid operators need to pursue a variety of strategies to ensure the grid operates reliably in times of extreme stress. One of the tools that grid operators use is load flexibility: rather than treating electricity demand as fixed at any given time and adjusting supply to meet it, grid operators increasingly try to adjust demand as well. Demand flexibility takes various forms, ranging from <a href="https://rmi.org/the-california-blackout-that-wasnt/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=spark&amp;utm_content=spark&amp;utm_campaign=2021_07_01">utility demand response programs</a> to <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/california-governor-makes-emergency-bid-to-prevent-blackouts/">calls for the public to voluntarily conserve</a> in times of, especially, high&nbsp;demand.</p> Limitations of legacy demand flexibility systems <p>Among the programs in the latter category is one managed by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which is responsible for managing the transmission grid across much of California and a small part of Nevada. That program, called <a href="https://flexalert.org/">Flex Alerts</a>, historically has worked as&nbsp;follows.</p>  If CAISO foresees that, because of the weather forecast, supply and transmission conditions, and expected demand, demand will be critically high relative to supply in the coming days, it calls a Flex&nbsp;Alert.  Calling a Flex Alert simply means that CAISO communicates a call to conserve electricity during specific critical hours. That communication takes several forms, including an email to Flex Alert subscribers and posts to social&nbsp;media.  The message is a request for consumers to voluntarily conserve during the specific hours. Consumers then conserve if, and as much as, they wish: CAISO has no ability to adjust consumers’ thermostat settings or take any other steps to force anyone to conserve.  <p>One limitation of this system has been that CAISO has had no visibility into how many consumers might try to conserve electricity. That is to say, when CAISO calls a Flex Alert, is the public paying attention? Will people try to save energy? The only way to measure the effect of the program has been afterward to compare the demand that CAISO would have expected if not for the Flex Alert to the demand that the system actually&nbsp;saw.</p> Advantages of California’s new Flex Alert&nbsp;system <p>CAISO now has deployed an improved Flex Alert platform based on Energy Web’s open-source technology stack. The new system has several advantages:</p>  Consumers can subscribe to receive either emails or SMS messages whenever CAISO calls a Flex Alert. Open and response rates are much higher for SMS messages than for emails, and therefore people who choose to subscribe to receive SMS messages on their phones are more likely to see a Flex Alert in time to conserve. Enrollment in either or both subscription options is simple for consumers.  Non-subscribers (e.g., people who see a Flex Alert message on social media) and subscribers can respond to the Flex Alert message, so CAISO has some insight into how much demand flexibility it might expect. This insight can become more accurate over time, as past response numbers can be correlated with observed demand reduction.  Subscribers have the option to provide the postal (ZIP) code where they live and see how response rates for their area compare to those for other areas. It also gives CAISO some insight into, in the aggregate, where conservation efforts are greatest.  Because the platform is designed with Energy Web’s approach to self-sovereign identity, CAISO cannot link personal data — email address or mobile number, or postal code — to response history. CAISO can view aggregated data about, for example, how many subscribers in a particular county responded to the most recent Flex Alert. However, CAISO has no ability to connect individual responses with personal information. This means that consumers can be more confident that when they participate (i.e., subscribe or respond to a Flex Alert) they are not creating a data trail for malign actors to&nbsp;mine.   Opportunities to expand demand flexibility anywhere <p>Our identity approach and the data protection it provides also are extensible to potential future&nbsp;uses.</p><p>First, digital identities can be assigned to IoT devices (assets) and integrated into the platform, if it were desirable to integrate other types of demand flexibility programs. This could allow, for example, secure communication directly with smart thermostats, which could then pre-cool automatically (or after the owner’s approval) and then conserve during critical hours. Likewise, electric vehicle charging could be shifted to non-critical hours, so long as charge levels are reached before the vehicle is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Second, because the platform can be operated without anyone organization owning the data or excluding others from it, it enables other power sector stakeholders (regulators, local utilities, or others) to participate as well. For example, if a local utility wished to collaborate with CAISO and use the platform to know which customers and devices were participating in a demand response program, it could do that while keeping access to sensitive customer data limited to the appropriate parties.</p><p>Furthermore, this platform could facilitate compensation of consumers for the flexibility provided. This would depend on the relevant stakeholders (transmission grid operator, local utility, regulator) all being supportive, but the point is that the technology enables greater levels of reliable, measurable flexibility — all while ensuring appropriate privacy and data ownership — and is independent of whatever market or program design is applied by those stakeholders.</p><p>Finally, because the technology is open-source, it could be implemented by other grid operators, with or without Energy Web’s engagement. We see other places in the U.S. alone where the power sector might wish to enhance existing practices, like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/new-york-heat-wave-nears-its-sweaty-peak-as-northwest-highs-ease?sref=vuYGislZ">New York</a> or <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/14/texas-power-grid-conserve-ercot/">Texas</a>. But of course, the technology is not limited to the U.S. and could be useful anywhere that the ability to increase demand flexibility while maintaining privacy is desirable.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/california-grid-operator-launches-new-demand-flexibility-platform-enhancements-to-flex-alert-system-e01ae8030da0">California grid operator launches new demand flexibility platform enhancements to Flex Alert…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Global Assured Identity Network White Paper was the centerpiece of the OpenID Foundation’s &nbsp;Chairman Nat Sakimura’s keynote at the European Identity Conference just a few days ago. His presentation can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://nat.sakimura.org/2021/09/14/announcing-gain/">https://nat.sakimura.org/2021/09/14/announcing-gain/</a>.&nbsp;Nat describes GAIN as an overlay network on top of the Internet with all its participants&nbsp;identity proofed. One key benefit of the approach proposed in the white paper is that the standards required to enable this network already exist: OpenID Connect and eKYC/IDA.</p>
<p>The White Paper was&nbsp;a “no&nbsp;logo, pro bono, open source” collaboration of over 150 co-authors including many members of the OpenID Foundation. It’s well on its way to achieving its goal of generating&nbsp;a&nbsp;community wide discussion on the business, technical and legal requirements for pragmatic international interoperability.</p>
<p>One of our newest&nbsp;members and&nbsp;GAIN co author, Donna Beatty will&nbsp;co-lead&nbsp;the OpenID Foundation’s GAIN Technical Proof of Concept with Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt. Until recently Donna, was Executive Director, Digital Identity&nbsp;and Authentication, JPMorgan Chase and is a widely recognized technical, regulatory and business domain expert. Donna and Torsten are now organizing participation and processes to test the technical approach described in the White Paper. &nbsp;Interested parties should contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:donna@oidf.org">donna@oidf.org</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, Var Group entered the capital of commercio.network, one of the most innovative European blockchains. In fact, commercio.network is focused not on cryptocurrencies but rather on three crucial topics of digital transformation for companies:</p>
 
 E-identity. Identity management respecting privacy 
 E-signature The management of advanced electronic signatures 
 E-delivery Certified delivery of documents and proof of their existence 
 
<p>Var group, through its BlockIT company, became one of 100 independent validator nodes on July 4, 2020. The commercio.network blockchain &nbsp;instead of using electricity to validate its network, &nbsp;uses a new consensus algorithm called POS. This consensus mechanism consumes in a year what Bitcoin consumes in a minute, making it the most sustainable blockchain in the world and consequently the cheapest in the world as each transaction costs only a euro cent plus VAT</p>
<p>From July 4, 2021 Commerc.io srl offers the opportunity to all independent developers to use its commerce.app platform to create applications. commerce.app allows to solve the problem of wallet security through a fully-hosted platform based on HSM devices and programmable via API.</p>
<p>For developers participating in Var Group’s hackathon, commercio.io has provided two free online seminars consisting of 10 one-minute videos that explain respectively:</p>
<p>How to do business with blockchain :(in italian only) &nbsp;in which it is finally explained the substantial difference between blockchain and Internet and 36 use cases of applications to be developed related to 36 big problems that can be solved only through the blockchain of Commerce network. The video is available at the link <a href="https://commerc.io/farebusiness">https://commerc.io/farebusiness &nbsp; </a>Using the invitation code: VarGroup</p>
<p>How to make apps with blockchain:&nbsp; (in italian only) &nbsp;a seminar explaining how to use the Commerce.app , a managed wallet platform that provides a set of APIs to develop any application on Commerce.network. This platform allows developers to save 99% of time and cost to create any application after a few minutes and not months. The video explains how to access the 250 bronze memberships in the test-net version made available for free to the participants of the Var Group hackaton.

Now, however, autumn has arrived, and we’ve run our September Co-op&nbsp;day.</p><p>After checking in, saying hello and discussing the phrase “brand new second hand desk chair”, we got to work and focused on two main areas of the co-op: Operations and Marketing.</p> Operations <p>Digital stuff, workflows and processes are not static components of business.

   More clearly than before, we are seeing the recent pandemic as a catalyst and accelerator for Digital Transformation, or Dx as the term is now designated. As many higher education institutions have been on a Dx trajectory, there is now no denying that higher education’s future is digital.

		<p>Via EdgeMarket and our Lead Agency status, Edge connects our members with industry-leading vendors for streamlined solutions procurement. We’ve invited our vendor partners to share their stories and expertise with our members via guest blogs on the Edge website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) technology provides a number of benefits to educational institutions, including secure data protocols and regular software updates.</p>
<p>With the increasing availability of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ocelotbot.com/blog/practical-applications-of-ai-in-higher-ed">artificial intelligence (AI) technology</a>&nbsp;and its potential to harness big data to drive efficiency and real-time decision making, many colleges and universities are exploring ways to use AI within their existing technology ecosystem to impact the student experience.</p>
<p>An emerging approach is AI as a Service (AIaaS): the AI partner provides not just the “AI” technology platform but also manages the “AI” so that the college does not shoulder the burden of routine maintenance and ongoing training.</p>
 Four Key Benefits to AIaaS 
 1. Speed to Launch / Ease of Maintenance / Technology Advances 
<p>An AIaaS provider can draw on its experience with similar institutions to quickly spin up a fairly robust AI tool with little effort from the school. On an ongoing basis, an AIaaS partner can ensure that the AI keeps learning from interactions. Colleges and universities provide their content; the AIaaS partner handles the rest. And when the AIaaS partner provides federal and state regulatory content as part of its service, it’s a killer combination. Finally, an AIaaS partner keeps investing and improving upon the technology and pushes those advances along to all of its school partners.</p>
 2. Ability to Leverage Big Data 
<p>An AIaaS partner can pool anonymized data and learn across a whole network of instances while still allowing for customization. In this scenario, the institution may not have 100 percent control over the AI, but it will benefit from taking more of a big-data approach with machine learning, which can bring more depth and consistency to AI actions.</p>
 3. Long-term Risk Mitigation 
<p>Building AI models that rely exclusively on your institution’s ongoing efforts may sound exciting and interesting at first blush. But without the appropriate long-term level of focus, supervision, support, and maintenance, the AI will decay over time. As the number of AI tasks increases and becomes more complex and varied, AI requires both data and supervised machine learning to properly understand the nuances of human thinking and interpretation to effectively turn it into action. Using an AIaaS partner dramatically reduces an institution’s risk by leveraging learning from across all college and university partners using the technology.</p>
 4. Being a Part of a Larger Community 
<p>An AIaaS partner with a common,&nbsp;multi-tenant&nbsp;shared platform that supports a multitude of institutions is a unique community. This approach ensures that the advances and learning at each individual school benefit the broader community of users. An AIaaS partner can facilitate a community that enables clients to effectively collaborate, share best practices, share content when it’s not proprietary and help each other with tools that build upon the success others are having.</p>
 AIaaS in Practice 
<p>At Ocelot, we focus exclusively on higher education and take a big data AIaaS approach to supporting colleges and universities. Ocelot’s AI is currently based on over five million student interactions and over a hundred thousand questions across our entire network of schools. Individual schools supply their own content to the platform, but they do not need to build their own dataset or supervise their own AI. Instead, the AI for each school is learning and training from all student interactions across the entire Ocelot network. The “intents” and “entities” are built from datasets that are much larger than what a single school can offer.</p>
 AI Chatbots as a Case Study in AIaaS 
<p>In general, AI chatbots have different levels of sophistication. Some chatbots are search and index bots. Some are point and click bots or AI powered bots. Some are a combination of these options. All AI powered chatbots require some level of human supervised machine learning. Bots need to be trained to understand the “intents” (the purpose or goal of a user’s input) and “entities” (a term or object relevant to the intent) in order to properly classify a question. Once a question is classified, the chatbot is able to understand what users are asking and can then return a direct match (“response”) to their question.</p>
<p>Ocelot has a dedicated AI Conversation Design team that manages the AI and general content for our clients. The backend of the Ocelot chatbot is powered by a combination of natural language processing (the process of organizing language into structured data), natural language understanding (teaching machines reading comprehension), and deep learning and neural networks (understanding relationships in data). It is backed by a combination of proprietary Ocelot technology and IBM’s Watson platform.</p>
 The Benefits of the AIaaS Approach 
<p>An AIaaS model enables chatbots to have more impactful conversations with students that can range from admissions and registration to student life and housing. In other words – Ocelot does the heavy lifting when it comes to managing the technology and building the AI algorithms, so its higher education partners can focus on creating the most impactful service and content for their students.</p>

<p>As the Data Strategy and the Data Spaces are being put in place in Europe, as the new US Administration is questioning the operating practices of global platforms, as new digital public and private services are created the world over, it is critical our approach over Personal Data Sharing is truly Global, and brings elements which are not just influenced by the framework of the European Data Strategy we help shape, but is the mirror of the actual needs of individuals, tech-savvy or not, and the realities of a very competitive market. This is why we are thankful Dixon has agreed to join us, bringing his experience of Chief Evangelist of Personium which is the only open-source personal data store platform in Japan.</p>
<p>In parallel to his role at Personium, Dixon is a software engineer at Fujitsu Limited. Currently, he is also leading the MyData movement within Fujitsu.</p>
<p>After attending MyData 2018, he was moved by the passionate people involved and is now heavily involved in the overall MyData movement in Europe, Asia, and Global South. He also drives human-centric projects in areas like data interoperability, child data protection with UNESCO, and common data platform for the next pandemic.</p>
<p>Given his breadth of experience and alignment with a number of strategic sectors where aNewGovernance is currently developing ecosystems, I am sure, he will bring incredible contribution.</p>

<p>This summer, we’ve been iterating through an article intended to talk
about the success that Blockchain Commons has had working with the Wyoming
legislature to help to define a first-in-the-country legal definition
of digital identity.</p>

<p>The Digital Identity Working Group for the Wyoming Select Committee on
Blockchain meets again next week, on September 21-22, 2021. I will be
providing testimony there at 2pm MST. As a result, we’ve decided to
release the current draft of this article on digital identity and how
Wyoming has defined it using Principal Authority, with the goal of
helping to shape the agenda for digital identity for the next year,
both in Wyoming and elsewhere.</p>

<p>—Christopher Allen</p>

 

<p>In 2016, I wrote <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign
Identity”</a>
to talk about the historic evolution from centralized identity to
user-centric identity and to define the next step: a self-sovereign
digital identity that was controlled by the user, not some third party.
In it I also offered <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">10 Self-Sovereign Identity
Principles</a>
which have been widely accepted by the decentralized identity community.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity has matured and grown considerably since, as I
chronicled in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">“Self-Sovereign Identity: Five Years
On”</a>.
There are now specifications, products, and entire companies supporting
the concept. However, recent legal efforts to define self-sovereign
identity may be just as important for catapulting it into the mass
market.</p>

 Defining Identity 

<p>Defining identity is by no means easy. That core topic could encompass a
paper much longer than this. The following are some various definitions
of identity drawn from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/glossary-primer.md">RWOT
Glossary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identifier: A label that refers to an entity and can be used to establish or maintain an identity. For example, a name or UID.</p>

  <p>Identity: A conceptual construct that enables the differentiation between distinct entities that are individually considered to be unique, but which may possess class or group characteristics. An identity gives these entities the ability to interact as peers in collaborative or competitive ways. It is not the entity that it represents.</p>

  <p>Identity, Digital: A digital representation of an entity, managed by digital tools, over which that entity has personal or delegated control.</p>

  <p>Identity, Functional: How we recognize, remember and respond to specific people and things.</p>

  <p>SSI: Self-sovereign identity. A decentralized digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and whose information is portable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digital identity is just one aspect of a complex, interconnected web of
different digital models. It’s not the same thing as identification
(where you prove you are a distinct entity with unique characteristics),
authentication (where you prove you were the same entity as before), or
personal data (which is information related to an identified or
identifiable entity).</p>

<p>Those other elements all need to be considered, but it’s digital
identity, and now self-sovereign identity, that gives us the linchpin to
do so.</p>

 Turning Digital Identity into Law 

<p>For self-sovereign identity to truly achieve international success, I
feel that it needs to not just be embraced by the technological sector,
but also to have a basis in law. In recent years, I’ve been progressing
toward that goal through work with various state and national
legislatures.</p>

<p>Collaborating with the Wyoming legislature has borne the first fruit.
This year they passed
<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">SF0039</a> on digital
identity, which the Governor signed into law and which went into effect
on July 1, 2021. It defines digital identity as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(xviii) “Personal digital identity” means the intangible digital
representation of, by and for a natural person, over which he has
principal authority and through which he intentionally communicates or
acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where’s the self-sovereign identity in that?</p>

<p>As with much legislation, it’s all about the careful selection of words.</p>

 Defining Principal Authority 

<p>To understand how Principal Authority relates to self-sovereign identity
requires insight into what Principal Authority is. The concept comes out
of English Common law. It appears in most Commonwealth countries but has
also found its way into the laws of other countries, including the
United States. It’s primarily used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency">Laws of
Agency</a>, an area of
commercial law where an agent is empowered to take on certain tasks.</p>

<p>As the name would suggest, Principal Authority first requires a
Principal: a person or entity. It then requires that entity have
Authority: some power. Principal Authority is thus the power derived
from a person or entity, which they can use or which they can delegate
out to others. When applied to digital identity, Principal Authority
says that a Principal has Authority over his identity — which is a clear
restatement of self-sovereign principles.</p>

<p>In fact, the recognition of a Principal is itself a statement of the
first of the principles of self-sovereign identity: existence. It
asserts that digital identity is always a representation of an actual
entity, who predates any digital representation, and who is also the
first and foremost beneficiary of that representation.</p>

<p>However, in drawing on the Laws of Agency, the concepts of Principal and
Principal Authority go beyond that. Because the person at the heart of
an identity has the ultimate power to control the self-sovereign digital
representation that they’ve created (and/or that they use), this means
that any others who exert Principal Authority over that identity data
are doing so only as agents of the Principal.</p>

<p>By focusing on Agency, the concept of Principal Authority also ensures
that the Principal always has the ability to revoke their delegation to
the agents whom they have temporarily offered Authority regarding their
identity. This is a requirement for other self-sovereign principles such
as portability, and it’s a real necessity in the digital world, where
we might need to delete personal data or to cancel Terms &amp; Conditions
that we signed without real, informed consent.</p>

<p>Altogether, this new definition of Principal Authority adds a lot of
nuance to self-sovereign identity, and much of that comes thanks to the
implicit incorporation of Agency.</p>

 Defining Control 

<p>In saying that a Principal has the ultimate authority to control their
digital identity, care also needs to be taken to define what that
control means. It means that a Principal has (or can delegate) the
Principal Authority to identify as that identity; to authenticate as
that identity; and to know the contents of the data held by that
identity.</p>

<p>However, any digital identity also exists as part of a larger ecosystem,
and the Principal does not have control over the larger ecosystem. They
cannot control how other entities rate, rank, or note the reputation
of their identity; and they cannot control comments, flags, or other
notes that other entities might attach to their identity.</p>

<p>Further, a Principal cannot necessarily prevent other entities from
creating new digital identities related to them, which may or may not
link to an existing identity. (Though states are increasingly
recognizing the limits of voluntary disclosure of information, digital
identity laws will ultimately never prevent a police station from
creating their own identity record related to a criminal, or a civic
authority from creating government-related identity records.)</p>

<p>In other words, self-sovereign identity, and the establishment of
Principal Authority over it, lays down boundaries for what the Principal
controls — boundaries that are much wider than those established for
digital identities controlled by third parties. However, those
boundaries still exist.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, control of a digital identity means that the Principal
can expect to maintain the continuity of that identity for as long as
they see fit, but in doing so must accept the battle scars inflicted by
interactions in a larger ecosystem that are implicit to the identity
itself.</p>

 Agents &amp; Their Duty 

<p>The ability to delegate Principal Authority, as revealed by the Laws of
Agency, may be as crucial to self-sovereign identity as the concept of a
Principal itself. It allows the empowerment of agents by a Principal —
who might be physical agents or, in the increasingly digital world,
virtual agents. But, it also institutes the core requirement that those
agents be working for the good of the Principal when they are exerting
Principal Authority over the identity holder’s identity data.</p>

<p>This concept of “duty” is crucial to the Laws of Agency. Duty requires
that an Agent only use their delegated Principal Authority as the
Principal requests, in a way that benefits the Principal, and with care
and due diligence, while frequently reporting back what they’ve done.</p>

<p>This is a notable change from the way that digital identities have been
treated traditionally. Compare that to banks, who represent you in
financial transactions, and then sell your spending data; compare that
to Facebook, who collects as much personally identifiable data and other
information as you’re willing to give them, then sells that to
advertisers; or compare it to Google, who infers personally identifiable
and demographic data based on the information you input into their tools
and the choices you make. In large part, you don’t even know what these
identity representatives and data holders are doing. In the world before
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a> or <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California’s
CCPA</a>, you had little input into their
actions. Even now, with those early and rough attempts to protect
digital self-sovereignty, you’re typically opting-out, not opting-in —
which is barely agency at all —&nbsp;and you’re still not protected against
people who are self-serving nor those who are inferring information from
scattered pieces of data.</p>

<p>That’s because any duties currently required of the entities to whom you
grant agency over your data are quite minimal. Maybe there’s a duty of
privacy, maybe there’s a duty of safety, but in general they don’t need
to work in your best interest. That’s why we need to ensure that new
definitions of digital identity, particularly self-sovereign identity,
follow the Laws of Agency in ways that our current systems do not.</p>

<p>This sort of agent agreement needs to be part of delegation. To date,
this has been true to a limited extent with federation protocols such as
SAML and Oauth, but that needs to be extended to every person. Wyoming’s
digital-identity law is the first example of legislation that focuses on
Agency in this way, and that’s much of its power.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t a simple issue. Even with Agency-focused
legislation, we need to determine a source for duties. This article will
try to outline some of them, using not just the traditional duties of
agents, but also the self-sovereign principles themselves. However, it’s
a mere starting point, with a stronger legal foundation required.</p>

 Principal Authority &amp; The State 

<p>Before defining duties, it’s important to note one other interesting
element of Principal Authority and its foundation in Agency: it focuses
not just on a single person’s authority, but also on their ability to
delegate to and require duties from other entities. In other words, it’s
a peer-to-peer relationship; this relationship works within the context
of a state who recognizes the concept of Principal Authority, respects
its ability to enable Agency, and enforces its established duties.</p>

<p>However, though the state is involved, this peer-to-peer relationship
still lies in stark contrast to traditional property law, where property
is always in some way beholden to the state: the state might be the
original source for property, they might be able to reclaim it by
eminent domain, and they might be able to seize it through asset
forfeiture. Those ideas all run counter to the idea of self-sovereignty
— which is yet another reason that we choose to focus on the Agency of
Principal Authority, not property law, as the core legal metaphor for
self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Restating the Self-Sovereign Principles 

<p>The use of Principal Authority to empower self-sovereign identity
provides a legal foothold for many of my original 10 principles.</p>

<p>What follows is a restatement of the self-sovereign principles that
reorganizes the original ten as rights and duties that are suggested by
customs, expectations, and best practices, but which need to be better
codified to become true duties. It also proposes five additional duties
that could come from customs implicit in the Laws of Agency.</p>

<p>Together, these ideas may allow us to both better understand how to turn
the self-sovereign principles into concrete usage and also to more
easily translate them into duties bound by legislation.</p>

 The Rights of Self-Sovereign Authority 

<p>Some principles of self-sovereign identity are implicit in the idea of
a Principal.</p>

 
   Existence. The definition of Principal requires that there be a real entity at an identity’s heart. 
   Control. The definition of Principal Authority says that the Principal always retains control of an identity, within specifically defined boundaries, no matter who is holding it at a particular time. 
   Persistence. Because of their uncontested Principal Authority, a Principal may decide to have an identity last for as long as they see fit. 
   Consent. Anything that happens within the defined boundaries of the digital identity is implicitly with the consent of the Principal, who may delegate or revoke Principal Authority at any time. 
 

<p>Self-sovereign rights recognize that an identity exists to benefit its
Principal. These core principles likely derive explicitly from a
definition of digital identity such as that created by the Wyoming
legislature.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The remaining principles of self-sovereign identity can be stated as
duties owed to a Principal by an agent who has been granted Principal
Authority over an identity for certain purposes.</p>

 
   Access. An agent must provide the Principal with access to data related to their digital identity. 
   Transparency. An agent must be open about how they will administer a digital identity. 
   Portability. An agent must make a digital identity portable upon the request of the Principal. 
   Interoperability. An agent must use standard, interoperable protocols when making an identity portable, and should also use those interoperable protocols when interacting with other identity systems. 
   Minimization. An agent must minimize the data collected, stored, transmitted, and shared regarding an identity so that it only includes data that is strictly necessary in the context of a request made by the Principal. 
   Protection. An agent must place the protection of the identity above their own needs or desires. 
 

<p>Identity duties says that agents will tell you how they’re using your
identity, use it in the most minimalist way possible, and make it easy
for you to reclaim the identity. However, legislation may be required to
turn these best practices into duties bound by law.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Agents 

<p>The idea of Principal Authority itself suggests additional duties that
were not included on the original list of principles of self-sovereign
identity, but which are generally defined in the Laws of Agency to be
due from agents to Principals.</p>

 
   Specificity. An Agent will use Principal Authority to serve specific tasks as instructed by the Principal, or as required by Custom, and do nothing more with an identity. 
   Responsibility. An agent will serve those tasks with reasonable care and skill, with due diligence, and without further delegation. 
   Representation. An agent will act in the best interests of the Principal, without secret profit, and will not take on other responsibilities that might conflict with that. 
   Fidelity. An agent will serve those tasks in good faith. 
   Disclosure. An agent will maintain accounts and report their actions back to the Principal. 
 

<p>Agent duties say that agents will be trustworthy in their use of your
identity. These duties are more likely to implicitly be a part of any
legislation that was built atop the Laws of Agency.</p>

 Taking the Next Steps 

<p>Wyoming’s definition of personal digital identity helps us to lay more
foundation for self-sovereign identity, but it’s still just a starting
point.</p>

<p>There’s more to do.</p>

 Laws of Custom 

<p>To start with, the Laws of Agency are largely built on Laws of Custom,
which are as likely to be common law as any formally codified
legislation. When creating new laws related to self-sovereign identity,
we’ll be creating new Laws of Customs for the digital frontier, an area
that’s so fresh that the tradition of customs has been limited.</p>

<p>This creates real challenges, as we must decide what customs we want to
create and then we must develop them from common law to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_law">legal
customs</a> to (eventually)
codified duties. We can integrate these with the Laws of Agency, and we
can figure out how that interrelates with old common laws such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_(law)">Use Laws</a>. We may even need
special courts to set these common laws and achieve remedies, such as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Chancery">Court of
Chancery</a>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, there’s a lot of work to be done here; recognizing the
existence of a Principal and the use of delegatable Principal Authority
bound by the Laws of Agency is just a starting place. New customs, even
though understood as best practices, will not automatically become legal
duties.</p>

 Open Questions 

<p>Beyond that, I’m not a lawyer. There may be other legal elements that
can support our definition of digital identity. Are there additional
duties that we could bring in? Are there fiduciary or agency laws that
we could leverage? Are there other legal models of interest we can draw
from, such as the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce approach,
which says that “The actions, promises, rights and obligations of a
person shall not be denied legal validity on the sole ground they are
effectuated through their digital identity”? These possibilities need to
be studied, preferably with the help of legal experts.</p>

<p>Even once we’ve fully defined digital identity, we still must consider
how digital identity may need to be more carefully protected. Are there
ways we can give specific protection to private keys used for signatures
and to express authority? Can we protect against the theft of private
keys that might allow impersonation or false witness? Can we prevent the
misuse of digital biometric or genetic information? Can we protect
against other “crimes of authority”?</p>

<p>There’s also a flipside: digital identity should give us some new
advantages not found in traditional identity. For example, there have
always been problems with individuals with low market power being at a
disadvantage when negotiating with larger parties. Can new digital
identity laws help start to resolve that imbalance?</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>One of the most important steps going forward will be to continue
working with the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming
legislature. However, I’d also welcome discussions with other states and
nations, to ensure that we have great definitions of digital identity
that support self-sovereign identity everywhere.</p>

<p>If this is important to you too, consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">supporting Blockchain
Commons</a> to make this a
reality.</p>

Over time, this online behavior creates a profile that can be traced.</p><p>HOPR addresses this challenge by ensuring all the data and metadata you produce and consume online stays private. To do this, HOPR feeds content through a state-of-the-art mixnet - the HOPR network. </p> The HOPR protocol <p>HOPR incentivizes node runners who relay packets using its own currency, the HOPR token. Messages routed through the network are embedded with HOPR tokens in the form of “tickets” to pay each node along the route. HOPR’s proof of relay mechanism ensures a node can’t claim a ticket until the data packet is relayed to the next downstream node. This creates positive incentives for nodes to be good actors in the network. Tickets are cashed out via an Ethereum compatible blockchain (EVM) but are not always valid. This probabilistic payment system ensures a node’s online behavior can not be analyzed using timing attacks.</p><p>To ensure privacy at any level of network usage, the HOPR network is constantly fed with cover traffic: arbitrary data which provides cover for real users. This is particularly important in the early years of the network, when usage will understandably be lower.</p><p>The HOPR Association has allocated 250M HOPR tokens to cover traffic, to be released over four years. These will be issued anonymously by nodes sponsored by the HOPR Association and routed through nodes based on multiple parameters including HOPR tokens staked, amount of channels open, and general connectivity.</p> Verify off-chain activity without compromising privacy <p>This incentivized cover traffic system, combined with proof of relay, is what sets HOPR apart from other privacy networks, which either lack the proper incentives to scale or end up compromising on privacy or decentralization. Privacy networks are very challenging to develop and then test - how can you monitor and verify node activity without sacrificing privacy? <br><br>This is particularly important for the development of cover traffic and the long-term economic balancing of the network. Since running HOPR nodes incurs electricity and internet bandwidth costs, it’s important to be able to distinguish between the kickstarter cover traffic (artificially high for the first four years) and real traffic (initially minimal, but growing as the network scales). <br><br>Tickets issued by cover traffic can be tagged as such and shared off-chain. This would allow analysis but prevent inspection by other nodes. The HOPR team needed a reliable way to implement this approach, since simply logging this information in a decentralized IPFS node, which anyone can add data, would allow &nbsp;information about cover traffic metrics to be skewed or manipulated by any party in the network.</p> Using Ceramic to create a decentralized monitoring tool for HOPR nodes <p>Using Ceramic, HOPR can propagate user-specific data and allow node runners to inspect and share their node's information as needed. To do this, nodes create a log entry in a Ceramic Stream, a DAG-based data structure for storing continuous, mutable streams of content on IPFS, every time they receive a particular message (for example, one with the cover traffic tag). Since this information is published with the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">secp256k1</a> private key used by the HOPR nodes, this information can be connected to a HOPR node and verified as such. This prevents outside manipulation of data.</p><p>HOPR node runners can use the HOPR dashboard to see their node data, and by checking the Ceramic Streams pinned by their nodes, obtain meaningful information about the cover traffic sent to their nodes. In this way, Ceramic not only helps HOPR developers, but also allows users themselves to verify the state of the network without involuntarily compromising their privacy.</p><p>Previous iterations of HOPR testnets issued unverifiable cover traffic via a bot, which was cumbersome and of limited utility. Thanks to Ceramic, HOPR nodes can now easily compare notes and assess their own ability to connect to other nodes.</p><p>The HOPR Network is the first of its kind using Ceramic to log decentralized data for an open-source protocol, and we believe this approach can be used by any project which relies on peer-to-peer off-chain data, which would otherwise be unverifiable.</p> Using IDX to connect HOPR nodes to external accounts <p>Since HOPR nodes have their own private keys, which need to quickly sign and submit transactions on-chain, each node has a unique private identity. This is extremely important for privacy, but it also makes engaging with a community of node runners challenging. As a result, it wasn't trivial for the HOPR team to link HOPR node runners to another digital identity, enrich node runner data, or perform promotional actions linked to their <a href="https://stake.hoprnet.org/">staking program</a>, which would be trivial in a centralized (but not private) setting. This is where Ceramic provides a lot more flexibility.</p><p>The identities of HOPR node runners are private, but they don’t have to be anonymous. It’s possible to connect node runners with another digital identity, as long as that connection is verifiable.<br><br>The HOPR team has already started using Ceramic’s identity protocol, IDX, for this use case in a recent testnet on the Polygon network. HOPR nodes leverage IDX to connect to external Ethereum accounts outside of the HOPR network. With IDX, HOPR nodes now have the ability to sign an Ethereum account, enabling users to connect their nodes with an existing pseudonymous digital identity - real or not.</p> What's next for HOPR? <p>In the coming weeks, the HOPR team will start to test our cover traffic nodes, which will become the cornerstone for the HOPR network. The HOPR Association will continue to run testnets with the community to finetune the HOPR protocol. From there, node adoption and development of the protocol will continue alongside the community. The HOPR team will continue to use Ceramic to strike the right balance between data gathering and privacy.</p><p>We’re excited about what’s next to come for the HOPR team and the impact they'll have on data privacy.

 Protocol Labs and Energy Web complete first showcase of an open-source solution to decarbonize Filecoin <p>In support of the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord (CCA)</a>, <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a> today announced a successful showcase of an open-source solution for decentralized renewable energy purchasing by crypto miners. In this solution showcase, six Filecoin storage providers (i.e., miners) purchased verified renewable energy certificates from <a href="https://3degreesinc.com/">3Degrees</a> and <a href="https://www.spgroup.com.sg/sustainable-energy-solutions/our-low-carbon-solutions/renewable-energy-certificates">SP Group</a> using <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, a public renewable energy search engine(PL and 3D are both CCA Supporters.) The solution will eventually be applicable across any blockchain to make it easy for any crypto miner to deliver proof of green&nbsp;mining.</p><p>The CCA is a private sector led initiative to decarbonize the crypto sector with open-source decentralized solutions and promote best industry practices. Energy Web is a co-convener of the CCA and both Protocol Labs and 3Degrees are CCA Supporters.</p><p>In the showcase announced today, renewable energy purchases are <a href="https://filrep.io/?columns=energy&amp;order=desc&amp;sortBy=energy">recorded in Filrep</a>, a reputation system used by clients aiming to store data on the decentralized Filecoin network. Integrating renewable energy data from Energy Web Zero into the reputation system allows clients to factor renewables into their decision when choosing a storage provider. Each record on Filrep points to a <a href="https://zero.energyweb.org/partners/filecoin/purchases/c8ffa1c8-c763-44c1-bb4d-b370c15694b3">verification page</a> in Energy Web Zero, showing where the energy was produced, documenting the renewable source, and providing an attestation certificate proving ownership of the corresponding renewable energy&nbsp;credits.</p><p>Over the next year, Protocol Labs and Energy Web will create a package of open-source solutions that make it easy for all Filecoin storage providers to search for and purchase renewable energy on Energy Web Zero. Both Filecoin storage providers and clients will be able to verify procurement to substantiate their environmental claims because transactions will be anchored on the public Energy Web Chain, and in turn be traceable to existing renewable energy registries as well as individual solar, wind and hydroelectric power projects.</p><blockquote>“We are excited to develop open-source decentralized technologies to support investments in renewable energy and track energy use throughout the supply chain,” said Alan Ransil, the technical lead for Filecoin Green at Protocol Labs. “By serving as an early adopter of these technologies, the decentralized network of Filecoin storage providers will set an example for both crypto miners and other industries to&nbsp;follow.”</blockquote><p>Filecoin is an open-source cloud storage marketplace, protocol, and cryptocurrency that serves as a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud storage. Traditional cloud storage providers like Apple, Amazon, Google, and others have been moving aggressively with renewables. Now, decentralized storage and blockchain, too.</p><p>Many members of the Filecoin Storage Provider community voiced support for the new&nbsp;project:</p>  “The dream of a decentralized storage network powered by renewable energy has been a motivating force behind the company since our first prototype,” said Kevin Huynh, the CEO of PiKNiK, a San Diego, California-based storage provider. “We believe it is imperative for the future of Web3 to grow our industry in a way that protects nature, while setting a sky-high standard for transparency as to our environmental footprint and renewable energy sourcing.”  “I was deeply impressed by The Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol, which established the need to act quickly to support the environment,” said Alex Ma, a Filecoin storage provider based in Asia. “In my view, linking Filecoin to Energy Web Zero brings the community closer to a sustainable data storage solution.”  “I’m happy to do my part in making Filecoin more environmentally clean and sustainable,” said Nelson Chen, “this approach allowed me to support renewable energy and prove my contribution easily, without having to change my power provider or install new equipment.”  Stuart Berman, who serves as CTO, also at PiKNiK, said that “We started participating in Filecoin because we believe in the long-term vision. This proof of concept connecting Filecoin to renewable energy markets is a major first step towards solving the challenge of environmental sustainability within Filecoin and Crypto more broadly.”  Alex Altman, the COO of Seal Storage Technology Inc. said: “As we enter a new age of corporate environmental responsibility, Seal Storage Technology is delivering on its commitment of carbon neutrality with the ambitious goal of achieving carbon negativity in 2022. Filecoin already empowers Seal to offer decentralized cloud storage using significantly less energy than other blockchain-based networks, and the integration with Energy Web will allow our renewable energy use to be tracked and verified”  <p>The full cross-chain solution to be deployed in mid-2022 will create a unique decentralized identifier (DID) on the Energy Web Chain for each Filecoin storage provider who chooses to participate and link storage providers’ renewable energy purchases to their respective DIDs. This linking of a given Filecoin storage provider’s DID with verified green Filecoin mining will enable that storage provider to reflect their zero carbon status in the Filecoin Reputation System, and allow energy attributes to be traced from client to storage provider to individual renewable energy projects.</p><p>This cross-chain solution being developed can be extended to miners in other ecosystems because the underlying technical architecture will leverage the verifiable, interoperable hash links that are the basis of Web3 technologies such as <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> and all blockchains. The project will therefore support the development of verifiably renewable crypto mining projects such as <a href="https://cryptoclimacc.medium.com/open-source-green-hashrate-software-solution-will-track-and-verify-green-bitcoin-mining-6b4e9cabe8b">Green Hashrate</a>.</p><p>Protocol Labs and Energy Web will share progress updates over the months ahead in advance of releasing commercial ready open-source solutions.</p><p>— — —</p><p>About Protocol&nbsp;Labs</p><p>Protocol Labs is an open-source research, development, and deployment laboratory. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and many more. We aim to make human existence orders of magnitude better through technology. We are a fully distributed company.

Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J.P. Morgan were making their fortune, and most people toiled in exhausting, unsafe jobs for paltry wages. Working people, including children as young as five, labored in 12-hour shifts, seven days a week — and still were not paid enough to escape poverty. Individuals had little power to change the status quo, but when they banded together in labor unions, they were able to effectively demand better pay, hours, and working conditions from their employers.</p><p>This shift in power didn’t happen quietly or easily. The wealthy few who profited by exploiting labor wielded their money and political connections to mobilize private security forces, police, and the judicial system against working people. In turn, the labor movement used all the tools at its disposal — from strikes and boycotts to protests and marches — to fight for change, even in the face of violence. In 1894, after twelve working people were killed during the Pullman railroad strike, President Cleveland tried to repair the government’s frayed ties with working Americans by declaring the first Monday in September “Labor Day,” a holiday commemorating the essential contributions of working people to our&nbsp;country.</p><p>A new holiday, of course, did not suddenly balance power between working people and their employers. Today, working people — along with the labor unions, grassroots movements, small business associations, and community organizations that represent them — continue to engage in many of the same battles for equal power that they fought more than a century&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Equal power means freedom of choice for working people. That freedom is what makes possible the American Dream, with its promise that everyone should have the equal right to build the life they desire by participating in the economy in whichever way they choose — through hard work, risk-taking, innovation, or entrepreneurship.</p><p>Like democracies, capitalist markets — especially those intended to support democratic societies — work best when participants enjoy a high degree of equality in decision-making power. Ideal markets, after all, depend on individuals’ ability to buy what they choose as well as to walk away from any exchange that does not satisfy them — something true for people entering a store just as much as it is for people assessing how they want to spend their time and&nbsp;labor.</p><p>But whereas democratic power is shared through the vote, markets’ power often comes from money. Any capitalist system intended to support a democratic society depends on checks and balances that prevent any one group from writing rules that benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else. A society in which this power of choice is not balanced — in which the rules of the economy leave working people with no choice but to accept jobs that leave them in poverty, and with no way to achieve meaningful change — cannot be truly democratic.</p><p>We know American capitalism has routinely failed to live up to this ideal. The two-pronged restriction on voting access and market participation by race, gender, disability, and class ensured that whole swaths of our society were (and in many cases, continue to be) robbed of both the political power to write economic rules that protect their interests and the economic power to gain enough resources to live with dignity. And yet, by learning from the combined struggles of the labor movement, civil rights movement, and alliances between them, we know that it is possible to build an economy truer to our democratic values.</p><p>We are currently experiencing two crises simultaneously: both American democracy and capitalism are in critical condition owing to the increasingly unequal concentration of political and economic power throughout our&nbsp;society.</p><p>Of the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8">many failed ideas US policymakers have implemented in recent decades</a>, one of the most dangerous has been to systematically erode the checks and balances within both government and markets. Lax regulations have made markets less competitive, allowing corporate behemoths to block the entry of new competitors, robbing consumers of the freedom to buy alternatives to products they do not like — including digital products that require them to give up personal data — and depriving working people of the ability to find better jobs. Right to work laws and anti-union employers have produced a steady decline in the wages paid by industries that used to be pillars of the middle class. Our political system has been corrupted by private money that fuels election campaigns and lobbying efforts, giving the wealthiest in our society an unparalleled ability to influence the policymaking process and ensure that the rules continue to work to their advantage.</p><p>All of this means that, even as most of us recognize the socio-economic status quo is harming many Americans, we lack the power to enact the change necessary to bring it more in&nbsp;balance.</p><p>We at Omidyar Network believe that if we want our democracy to survive, we need a new form of capitalism that promotes and protects balanced power. As in our democracy, we need checks on those with the most power to make sure they cannot rig the rules to their benefit, and we need to build <a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/testimony-by-heather-boushey-before-the-joint-economic-committee-on-the-coronavirus-recession/">counterweights to concentrated power</a> so that the people who suffer under unfair rules are certain to have their voices&nbsp;heard.</p><p>One of our priorities is to help build the power of working people so they can advocate for the wages, working conditions, and policies needed to thrive. That’s why we <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-endorses-pro-act-to-expand-worker-power/">endorsed the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021</a>, which would expand people’s right to organize and engage in collective bargaining, ensuring their interests are well-represented when employers respond to economic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future trends, such as automation.</p><p>In addition to the PRO Act at the federal level, many of the fights for worker power are taking place closer to the ground. As the pandemic increased people’s recognition of the importance of caregivers, hospital employees, and service workers — whose jobs typically pay low wages and provide little protection — we have supported the <a href="http://alwaysessentialworkers.com/partners/">National Essential Workers Campaign</a>, an initiative intended to coordinate state and local efforts fighting to give essential workers more voice and power, especially over health and safety. We have also supported the <a href="https://www.californiaworkerpower.org/">California Coalition for Worker Power</a>, a new coalition anchored by a number of partners dedicated to ensuring that every worker in the state has the power to come together and improve their work conditions and communities.</p><p>We also recognize that a rapidly changing economy requires new strategies and tools to help workers organize. We support <a href="https://uwunited.org/">Unemployed Workers United (UWU)</a> and their experimentation in the use of digital organizing tactics to engage people who have lost their jobs — especially in communities of color — in local grassroots campaigns. We also support an <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/business-and-society-program/worker-voice-lab/">idea lab</a> at The Aspen Institute’s <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/business-and-society-program/">Business in Society Program</a> to allow a number of stakeholders — including corporate governance experts, business leaders, and worker organizers — to explore solutions for increasing worker voice in corporate governance structures.</p><p>Working people, however, are not the only group that needs a greater say in the future of our economy. Alongside the Ford Foundation and W.K. Kellogg Foundation, we launched the <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-ford-foundation-w-k-kellogg-foundation-launch-carry-on-the-fight-fund/">Carry on the Fight Fund</a> to support grassroots organizations so they have support beyond Election Day to hold elected officials accountable to their campaign promises and build long-term power. We have also partnered with organizations such as <a href="https://mainstreetalliance.org/">Main Street Alliance</a>, which advocates for policies that support small business and helps small business leaders become their own advocates for policy change. We’re working with <a href="https://www.changethechamber.org/">Change the Chamber</a>, a student movement taking on the Chamber of Commerce through <a href="https://twitter.com/lobbyforclimatehttps:/twitter.com/lobbyforclimate">social media campaigns</a> and direct conversations with companies and policymakers in response to the Chamber’s continued lobbying efforts on behalf of fossil fuel interests to hinder essential climate change regulation.</p><p>We are also focused on ensuring economic policies do not concentrate wealth — and the power that comes with it — in the hands of a few individuals and corporations. To do so, we support groups such as <a href="https://bettermarkets.com/">Better Markets</a>, a watchdog organization that advocates on behalf of the public interest for a fairer financial sector and serves as a check on Wall Street’s immense lobbying power on financial regulatory matters. We are also working with several organizations pushing to reform the outsized impact large corporations currently have on the American political processes. Notably, the <a href="https://www.politicalaccountability.net/">Center for Political Accountability (CPA)</a> is working to increase accountability and transparency for companies’ political spending. They developed the <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CPA-Wharton-Zicklin-model-code-of-conduct-for-corporate-political-spending-10-13-20-.pdf">CPA-Wharton Zicklin Model Code of Conduct for Political Spending</a>, which is intended to guide companies on how to ethically engage in political activities and helped mobilize shareholders to win an unprecedented number of fights, resulting in requirements that companies disclose their political spending.</p><p>We recognize that many of these efforts have been guided by organizations that provide the research and ideas for how different stakeholders of the economy can work together toward a more equal distribution of economic power. The <a href="https://earn.us/">Economic Analysis and Research Network (EARN)</a>, for example, is a network of research, policy, and public engagement organizations that provide resources and technical assistance to local groups. Through their <a href="https://earn.us/issue/worker-power/">Worker Power Project,</a> they aim to bolster the ability of working people to achieve racial, gender, and economic justice through organizing, collective bargaining, and advocating for state and local policies that promote worker power. Meanwhile, the merger of the Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute on Money in Politics created <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets</a>, which will build on the extensive datasets of its two parent organizations to track the money being invested in political campaigns and lobbying at both the federal and state level. This information is crucial for efforts to hold policymakers accountable to the&nbsp;public.</p><p>We celebrate this Labor Day amid a pandemic that has acted as a shock to the system and has given may people the power — often for the first time — to make a conscious choice about how they want to participate in the economy, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/07/jobs-report-labor-shortage-analysis/">triggering a “Great Reassessment of work in America.”</a> Many are choosing not to return to jobs that paid low wages and had erratic schedules or poor working conditions. These decisions are proof that the economy people want is very different than the one we have. Even a pandemic has not been enough to disrupt the systemic power imbalance that exists in both our economy and democracy. We must continue the legacy of the working people and labor leaders who have stood up to hoarders of power; we must continue to fight for a future in which each of us has the power and voice to determine how we live our&nbsp;lives.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-counterweights-to-power-83e7234aa958">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Building Counterweights to Power</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 AEMO announces open-source operating system for world-leading distributed energy marketplace design&nbsp;trial  World-first global partnership includes Energy Web (to provide the open-source data exchange system), Microsoft (to provide cloud services), and PXiSE (to provide market logic software), with local aggregators (Mondo) and network operators(AusNet) <p>Zug, Switzerland — 2 September 2021 — <br>Australian power system and market operator, Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has announced the architecture and technology partners for<a href="https://energyweb.org/aemo/"> Project EDGE</a> — a flagship initiative enabling distributed energy resources (DER) to provide for both wholesale and local network services at enterprise scale within an off-market trial environment. The DER Marketplace solution will be developed in partnership with local market participants AusNet Services, Mondo and global technology vendors, including Energy Web, PXiSE, and Microsoft.</p><p>Australia leads the world in adoption and deployment of distributed energy resources (DER), with nearly one in four homes featuring rooftop solar, and 40% in some states (South Australia and Queensland).</p><p>Combined with the rapid growth of energy storage, demand-side management, and utility-scale renewable generation, the Australian grid is transforming to a decentralised system in which consumer owned DER play a pivotal role. This has created challenges for AEMO and distribution network operators in balancing and protecting the grid, but also creates new opportunities for consumers and other market participants to create value via supporting the energy transition with their&nbsp;DER.</p><p>In response, AEMO has established a DER program to enable the transition from one-way energy supply to a world-leading system that maximises the value of DER for all consumers through digitisation and integration of DER into Australia’s power systems and&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Under project EDGE, AEMO is collaborating with Mondo and AusNet Services, with input from the broader energy industry, to demonstrate via a proof-of-concept trial, how aggregated fleets of DER can deliver multiple energy services at scale both wholesale power system and local network&nbsp;levels.</p><p>This project will provide AEMO and its partners with technical and operational experience to inform evidence-based changes to regulatory and operational processes to effectively manage Australian electricity grids and markets with increasing levels of DER participation. Additionally, EDGE will focus specifically on understanding consumers’ perspectives and preferences in selling their DER capacity to Aggregators for use in energy&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Project EDGE is focused on streamlining data exchange among market participants to maximise utilisation and coordination of DER for providing multiple grid services, informing capability for scalability. Project EDGE is testing this capability with up to 10MW of DER capacity, made up of approximately 1,000 customers.</p><p>The DER Marketplace will be underpinned by Energy Web’s open-source operating system, which will be used to establish digital identities for all assets and market participants in the program. This identity-based architecture facilitates secure, efficient exchange and validation of DER data amongst market participants using digital infrastructure shared amongst Australian market participants.</p><p>The market intelligence and logic layer will be provided by PXiSE, and the solution will leverage Microsoft Azure cloud computing resources. EDGE’s DER Marketplace will deliver three core function&nbsp;sets:</p><p>1:Efficient and scalable DER data exchange between actors through use of self-sovereign identities anchored to a digital infrastructure that in future, could be shared between market participants;</p><p>2:Wholesale integration: DER Fleets will be dispatched as if they are participating in existing wholesale markets, while considering Distribution Network Limits in the dispatch process;&nbsp;and</p><p>3:Local Services Exchange — the Marketplace will facilitate visible, scalable and competitive trade of Local DER Services that enables Distribution Network Service Providers (DNSPs) to manage local power security and reliability and enables DER Aggregators to stack local and wholesale value streams efficiently.</p><p>As DER deployment accelerates across Australia, coordinating DER across market participant operating systems and participating prosumers has become a significant challenge. Project EDGE will provide evidence to support decisions relating to investment in digital operating system and the underlying design of data exchange&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Australia’s EDGE project will begin testing services in April 2022, with project completion in March&nbsp;2023.</p><blockquote>AEMO Chief Markets Officer, Member Services, Violette Mouchaileh, said “Project EDGE aims to build understanding of and inform the most efficient and sustainable way to integrate DER into the electricity system and markets, allowing all consumers to benefit from a future with high levels of DER. There is no existing product that meets all high-level requirements for the DER Marketplace, so Project EDGE is at the leading edge of product development in this&nbsp;space.”</blockquote><p>The EDGE Project is being supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), with AEMO receiving almost $13 million in funding for the project. ARENA CEO Darren Miller said at the time that this landmark trial would provide the blueprint for integrating DER into the&nbsp;grid.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/aemo-announces-open-source-operating-system-for-world-leading-distributed-energy-marketplace-design-a211a6f6c415">AEMO announces open-source operating system for world-leading distributed energy marketplace design…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

	 Data Flow &amp; the Invisible Parallel Dataverse 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;September 1, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#InvisibleParallelDataverse #RespectfulTech #DystopianMetaverse</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
The reality of online data flows is nothing like what we expect. Our personal data flows do not start light and increase with time and trust. Instead, a firehose of personal information is released – and shared with a host of unseen third parties – as soon as we open an app or website. Me2BA’s Respectful Tech Specification V.1 is largely focused on testing for these invisible parallel dataverse data flows.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>So far in this series of Me2B 101 Flash Guides, we’ve focused on the digital world as we interact with and experience it. We now turn our attention to the flow of data during the Me2B Relationship lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 10.1 illustrates typical user expectations about data sharing over the course of the Me2B Lifecycle. It reflects our expectations – based on the relationship norms in the physical world – that the flow of personal information would start off very slowly, only to build up over time as our trust builds.&nbsp; </p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the [somewhat] idealized view of how our digital Me2B Relationships should be – reflecting the increasing trust between the Me and the B over time, and a proportional increase in information sharing over time. It would be more ideal if the flow of information ceased more cleanly at the end of a Me2B Marriage, but that doesn’t appear to be the case for most services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, this idealized lifecycle is not at all the current reality of digital Me2B Relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, as soon as we so much open a website or an app, there is a firehose of information about us being shared with countless undisclosed entities—Data Processors (or Hidden B2B Affiliates, as introduced in Flash Guide #6).I&nbsp; The reality looks more like Figure 10.2 than 10.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10.2 Invisible Parallel Dataverse&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Does This Happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A major culprit in the tsunami of unwitting information sharing is the digital advertising infrastructure, (described in Flash Guide # 5) which systematically, and at massive scale shares personal data with multiple third parties (aka Data Processors). So long as this infrastructure exists, the personal data floodgates are open.ii&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital advertising is just one of the ways that websites and apps invisibly share data with third party Data Processors. Until all these avenues are exposed, and businesses and other Data Controllers are made responsible for respectful data processing, people are at risk. Version 1.0 of the Me2B Respectful Tech Spec is largely dedicated to testing for [outbound] invisible parallel dataverse data flows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	 The 10 Attributes of Respectful Me2B Commitments 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;September 1, 2021</p>

<p>#Me2BRelationship #Me2BDeals #RespectfulTech</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
The Me2B Respectful Tech Specification measures technology behavior against 10 attributes that respectful Me2B Commitments should possess. These attributes represent how technology should treat us and our data at every step along the Me2B Relationship Lifecycle.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><a>Flash Guide #8</a> described the types of Me2B Commitments that may occur throughout the digital Me2B Lifecycle. The Me2B Alliance has identified 10 high level attributes that respectful Me2B Commitments should possess. Our Respectful Tech Specification measures technology behavior against these 10 attributes, while taking into consideration the specific context and stage for each commitment.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 
 
 
 
 The 10 Attributes of Respectful Me2B Commitments 
 
 Clear Data Processing Noticei 
 Viable Permission 
 Identification Minimization 
 Data Collection Minimization 
 Private by Default 
 Reasonable Data Use &amp; Sharing / Me2B Deal in Action 
 Data Processing Behavior Complies with Data Subject’s Permissions and Preferences 
 Data Processing Behavior Complies with Policies 
 Reasonableness of Commitment Duration 
 Commitment Termination or Change Behavior 
 
 
 
 
 


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>Each of the 10 attributes is described in more detail below:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Clear Data Processing Notice:&nbsp; Measures if the app or website provides adequate notice on how data is collected, used, shared, monetized, etc. by the Data Controller(s) and all Data Processors.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Viable Permission:&nbsp; The Me2BA uses legal scholar <a href="https://www.ali.org/members/member/344957/">Nancy Kim</a>’sii three requirements for legally viable permission to enter into a commitmentiii, and checks for the following:&nbsp;
 
 Understandability: Can the Data Subject understand the Me2B Deal?&nbsp; 
 Freely Given: Is the Data Subject coerced or manipulated in any way into providing permission for this commitment?&nbsp; 
 Intentional Action: Does the Data Subject perform a distinct act to provide permission, and is it recorded?<br>
 
 
<p>“Viable Permission” also evaluates the commitment’s permission flow to all Co-Data Controllers and Data Processors (which we refer to as “Transitive Permissions”).</p> 
 Identification Minimization: Measures if the identification constructed by the service are appropriate for the particular Me2B Commitment. Note that “appropriate” means that the identification level reflects the social norms described in Flash Guide #8.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Data Collection Minimization: Tests whether the data collected is proportional to, and appropriate, for the particular Me2B Commitment. We measure across three types of data:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 Volunteered Data – entered by the Data Subject 
 Observed Data – automatically collected by the website or app without the individual’s&nbsp;awareness, and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Derived Data – data that is derived by the Data Controller(s) or Data Processors. <br>
&nbsp; 
 
 
 Private by Default: Measures whether the Data Subject must modify any website or app settings in order to have a private experience.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Reasonableness of Data Use &amp; Sharing Behavior: Measures if the observed data use and sharing behavior is appropriate for the particular Me2B Commitment.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Data Processing Behavior Complies with Data Subject’s Permissions and Preferences:&nbsp; Measures if the observed data processing behavior matches the Data Subject’s permissions and preferences.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Data Processing Behavior Complies with Policies: Measures if the observed data processing behavior matches the promised behavior as stated in the privacy policy and terms of service or terms of use.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Reasonableness of Commitment Duration: Measures if the duration of the commitment is appropriate for the particular Me2B Commitment, and the industry sector.<br>
&nbsp; 
 Commitment Termination Behavior: Tests three commitment termination behaviors:&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 Usability:&nbsp; If it’s easy for the Data Subject to change or end the commitment.&nbsp; 
 Record:&nbsp; If the commitment termination is recorded and provided to the Data Subject.&nbsp; 
 Data Removal: If the Data Subject’s data is forgotten/deleted by all Data Controllers and Data Processors.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>Like in the case of “Viable Permission” (attribute 2), this attribute assesses whether changes to “Commitment Termination”-related permissions or settings cascade down to all Co-Data Controllers and Data Processors.&nbsp;</p>

	 
 

	 
 
 	 

 

	
	 
 Note that the Me2B Alliance and our Respectful Tech Specification use GDPR terminology. In particular, note that “data processing” under GDPR Article 4, item (2) includes collection and all other behaviors relating to data: “‘processing’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction” <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/">Art. 4 GDPR – Definitions | General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (gdpr-info.eu)</a> 
 <a href="https://www.ali.org/members/member/344957/">https://www.ali.org/members/member/344957/</a> 
 “Consent has a variety of meanings in the law, but it is typically a conclusion based upon the presence or absence of three conditions: an intentional manifestation of consent, knowledge, and volition/voluntariness.” Kim, Nancy S. “Consentability: Consent and its Limits” (p. 9).

	 Digital Me2B Commitments &amp; Deals 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;September 1, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#Me2BRelationship #Me2BLifecycle #Me2BCommitments #Me2BDeals</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
Over the course of the digital Me2B Lifecycle, individual “Me-s” (Data Subjects) will have the choice of deepening the relationship through a series of Me2B Commitments with the online vendor, “B” (Data Controller). This guide provides examples of common Commitments and Deals, and shows how they map to the stages of a Me2B Lifecycle. It also reflects social norms for being anonymous, recognized, or known at each stage.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p><a>Flash Guide #7</a> introduced the Me2B Lifecycle, both online and offline. This Flash Guide takes a deeper dive into the digital Me2B Lifecycle, with a focus on the types of Me2B Deals and Commitments that define each state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in any relationship, ongoing two-way transactions ultimately shape the arc of the relationship lifecyle over time. Over the course of the digital Me2B Lifecycle, the individual (“Me”) will be asked or will seek to enter into specific bargains with the vendor (“B”). These opportunities to move along the relationship arc are called Me2B Commitments. </p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 What’s the difference between a Me2B Deal and Me2B Commitment? 
 
<p>A Me2B Commitment is typically presented to the individual “Me” through the user interface, and it is an opportunity to transact with the B to agree to enter a new state, taking a step along the relationship arc into a specific commitment state, changing the intensity of the relationship.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>The Me2B Deal describes the terms of the commitment, i.e. what our “typical Me”, Mia, gives to the B and what she receives in exchange. (see <a>Flash Guide #5 Me2B Deal Currencies</a>).</p>
 


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>Examples of Me2B Commitments &amp; Deals, as experienced by Mia, our representative “Me”,&nbsp; are provided in Table 8.1, below.</p>



Me2B&nbsp;Commitment
Description
Me2B Deal


Cookie Commitment
Mia accepts cookies.
Mia allows the vendor (the “B”) to write cookies (and other data) to local storage in exchange for a better user experience.


Location Commitment
Mia approves location sharing.
Mia shares her location information for a better, location-aware experience.


One-off Transaction
Mia performs a one-off transaction, like buying something from a retailer without creating a log-in.
Mia provides cash equivalent in exchange for a tangible good or service.


Promotional Commitment
Mia enrolls for promotional communications from the vendor.
Mia shares email address and potentially other information in exchange for timely promotional communications from the B.


Loyalty Commitment
Mia enrolls in Loyalty Program.
Mia shares personal information and ongoing transactional information in exchange for valuable discounts from the B.


Me2B Marriage
Mia creates an account on the site/app.
Mia shares personal information, ongoing transactional and behavioral information in exchange for valuable, personalized service.



<p>Table 8.1 – Me2B Commitments and Me2B Deals&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the stars in Figure 8.1, below, depicts the point where a Me2B Commitment begins. Note that each of these commitments could also have a corresponding end point overlaid on the lifecycle. For simplicity we have not shown those end points – except for the cessation of the “Me2B Marriage” which is shown as “Close Account”.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 8.1 Me2B Commitments over a Digital Me2B Relationship Lifecycle&nbsp;</p>
<p>As described in Flash Guide #7, Me2B Deals (and the associated Me2B Commitments) should follow the identification norms — Anonymity, Recognition, and being Known —&nbsp; that match the stage of the relationship where they occur. Figure 8.2 illustrates how the behavioral norms for identification for each stage map onto the Me2B Commitments during the course of the Me2B Relationship Lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 8.2 Digital Me2B Lifecycle with Behavioral Norms&nbsp;</p>
<p>These identification norms&nbsp; provide a crucial social context that is presently missing from technology standards and privacy regulation. This missing context can be understood as the state of the Me2B relationship, and ignoring it accounts for substantial harm to Me-s, such as rampant profiling and manipulation.i&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This contextual overlay on the Me2B Lifecycle gives us the language and framework—whether as Me-s, technology makers, policy makers, or standards makers – to better describe how technology should treat us and, importantly, when it departs from expected social norms, as nearly all technology does today. In particular, it serves as a foundation from which the Me2B Alliance works to develop rigorous standards for respectful and safe technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  When we started drafting the Respectful Tech Specification a couple of years ago, it was immediately obvious that we didn’t have an adequate vocabulary to describe personal experiences in the digital world—never mind measure them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	<p>When we started drafting the Respectful Tech Specification a couple of years ago, it was immediately obvious that we didn’t have an adequate vocabulary to describe personal experiences in the digital world—never mind measure them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to even the formation of the Me2B Alliance, one of the first things I did was examine all of the interpersonal relationship categories we have in our lives to see if there was a generic term to describe the customer/purveyor relationship, because this relationship is at the heart of many of our digital interactions. After much exploration, I came up dry on a simple, pre-existing term to describe this kind of relationship. And it baffled me, since in our very capitalistic culture in the US, we have literally scores of these kinds of relationships in our everyday lives. How is it that we don’t have a category or class name for it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My early presentations describing this relationship had over 100 slides. I remember spinning through an early version at the IIW (Internet Identity Workshop), posing this question:&nbsp; what do we call these customer/purveyor relationships? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Searls">Doc Searls</a> serenely offered, “why not Me2B Relationships?” And thus, a term was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Words matter. If we don’t have words to describe it, we can’t possibly understand it. And we certainly can’t measure it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me2B refers to a class of relationships between customers (Me-s) and purveyors (B-s) of virtually any sort, in both the physical and the digital world. This concept was the starting point for a new set of terms that enabled us to be more specific about human interactions in the digital world. These included:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Me2B Deals,&nbsp; 
 Me2B Relationship Life Cycle&nbsp; 
 Me2B Marriage,&nbsp; 
 Me2B Commitments,&nbsp; 
 Me2P Relationships, (where P = product)&nbsp; 
 Me2T Relationships, (where T = technology enabler)&nbsp; 
 B2B Hidden Affiliates.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Once we recognize that we are in fact in a two-way relationship with purveyors of things and services — not unlike other inter-personal relationships we have in our lives — we can better see the full tapestry of analogs. We can, for instance, see clearly that data is not the new oil, and that it’s harmful to think of it like that. Data isn’t fungible, it is not a commodity, nor labor, nor [strictly speaking] is it property. Data is about us – it is, simply, our very lives. Our data is us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is more appropriate to think of data like blood, or better yet, DNA—it is that sensitive and uniquely identifying. We shed data like microscopic flecks of skin as we go about living our lives. We don’t expect someone to be gathering our hair and skin debris as we wander about, and similarly, we don’t want people gathering our digital “DNA” detritus on the internet. It’s just not ok.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance has recently published a number of short tutorials (<a>Flash Guides</a>) in a “Me2B101 Series” that describes the concepts underpinning of our mission and approach, and tells the story of our journey from ethical principles to metrics and measurement. We hope that you find these illuminating and helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	 The Me2B Lifecycle: Overlaying Social Norms on the Digital World 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;September 1, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#Me2BRelationship</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
Key to creating a standard to measure the behavior of technology is the ability to take several contexts into consideration, including the current status of the Me2B relationship. The Me2B Lifecycle model provides a framework and vocabulary to articulate and account for the dynamic “relationship context” over time when evaluating the behavior of technology. This real life social context is currently missing in both existing privacy regulation and in industry standards models for ethical technology, but it is crucial to the Me2B Respectful Tech Specification. Our model helps course-correct connected technology by pinpointing how the digital Me2B experience deviates from important social behavioral norms.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>The Me2B Alliance has developed a model for the lifecycle of Me2B Relationships that is rooted in interpersonal psychology. Specifically, we built on psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Levinger">George Levinger’s</a>i ABCDE relationship model, which asserts that every relationship eventually traverses through five stages:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Acquaintance&nbsp; 
 Build-up&nbsp; 
 Commitment&nbsp; 
 Deterioration&nbsp; 
 Ending&nbsp; 
 
<p>The Me2B Relationship Lifecycle follows a similar arc. It starts with acquaintance, and moves through a buildup of repeated interactions. Over time, if these interactions deepen in intimacy and trust, they may culminate in a deliberate deep commitment, which we call the “Me2B Marriage”, which is the point of creating an online account. Eventually, the relationship may deteriorate to the point of termination. (See Figure 7.1)&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7.1 – The Me2B Relationship Lifecycle&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each stage in the Me2B Relationship Lifecycle represents a unique context that reflects the trust level and intensity of the relationship from the individual’s point of view. Figure 7.2 provides examples of how each stage of the lifecycle may look in the physical world and in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7.2 – Me2B Relationship Lifecycle in the Physical &amp; Digital Worlds&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the physical world, there are specific behavioral social norms and expectations for each of these stages of the Me2B Lifecycle. One doesn’t expect to be greeted by name, for instance, before any introductions have been made. Similarly, we don’t expect store employees to know our home address unless we’ve given it to them for a specific reason (such as delivery). </p>
<p>This real life social context is currently missing in both existing privacy regulation and in industry standards models for ethical technology, but it is crucial to the Me2B Respectful Tech Specification. Our work translates appropriate and respectful behavioral norms from the physical world onto our experiences online. Figure 7.3, below, illustrates how social norms for identification –for being anonymous, recognized, and “known” or remembered– operate in the physical world, and how they should operate in the digital world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 7.3 Identification Behavioral Norms of Me2B Relationships&nbsp;</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 What is the Me2B Marriage? 
<p>The Me2B Marriage reflects the most intimate, trusted phase of the Me2B relationship, a stage where the individual chooses to be recognized, “known” or remembered, and personally responded to.&nbsp; In the physical world, this implies a level of being known by the business (such as loyalty program enrollment) and the agents of the business (such as cashiers or salespeople). In the digital world, the Me2B Marriage is the legal ceremony of agreeing to the vendor’s terms of service or terms of use, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/deloitte-study-91-percent-agree-terms-of-service-without-reading-2017-11#:~:text=A%20new%20Deloitte%20survey%20found,and%20conditions%20without%20reading%20them.">which most people never read</a>ii. This is, in fact, the act of entering a legal contract between the “Me” and the “B”. Ideally, the individual is not coerced or manipulated into signing up for an account, such that the individual freely signals to the B that they wish to be remembered, recognized, and personally responded to.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>Currently, respectful behavioral norms from Me2B Relationships in the physical world are neither reflected nor supported in digital Me2B Relationships. The Me2B Lifecycle model serves as a tool that can help course-correct connected technology to reflect appropriate social norms and behaviors for each stage in the Me2B Relationship Lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Me2B Respectful Tech Specification is specifically designed to address the disconnect between offline and online behavior. The tests in the specification evaluate connected technologies for how well they are translating respectful behavioral norms from the physical world into the digital world.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
Me2B Relationships in the digital world have even more layers than those in the physical world. In addition, our relationship with connected technology includes a set of “hidden affiliates” (third party integrations) that most of us are not aware of. This guide describes how these relationships – conscious or not – emerge as we interact with digital technologies. </p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	<p>In <a href="https://me2ba.org/flash-guide-4-introduction-to-me2b-relationships-and-me2b-deals/">Flash Guide #4</a>, we introduced Me2B Relationships and examined how they may be experienced in the physical world. In this Flash Guide, we’ll explore Me2B Relationships in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Me2B Relationships have a number of different facets. We introduced this layering in the Flash Guide #4, explaining the difference between the relationship our typical “Me,” Mia, has with a retailer or brand, and the “Me2P” relationship Mia has with a particular product. This same kind of layering exists—with even more layers—in the digital world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a fictional account of Mia unboxing a brand new iPhone:</p>
<p>Figure 6.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stage 1: The first thing that happens is that Mia powers up her phone and is immediately required to agree to the Apple Terms of Service—i.e. to enter into a Me2B Legal Relationship with the company (or “B”), Apple. As Mia uses the phone, she develops a disposition (love/hate, e.g.) towards the phone; she has an experiential relationship with the phone, not dissimilar to the experiential relationship she has with the OXO brand containers described in FG #4. This relationship with her phone is a Me2P or “Me-to-Product” relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a critical difference, however, between connected technology like Mia’s iPhone and static products like her OXO containers. Connected technology relies on a number of integrated third-party technologies, depicted as “B2B Hidden Affiliates” in Figure 6.1. These entities may have access to significant pieces of information about Mia and her usage of the phone. So in essence, Mia is having a relationship with those hidden affiliates—she just doesn’t know it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stage 2: As Mia starts configuring her phone, she decides to install the Chrome browser app: <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6.2&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to Stage 1, as soon as Mia opens the browser, she is required to establish a Me2B Legal Relationship with Google, LLC. And over time, as she uses the browser, she builds a Me2P relationship with the browser itself. She is aware that she is using the browser—essentially having an ongoing dialogue with the app. Note that, even though she’s using the phone, it’s not at the forefront of her consciousness, and it has become an Enabling Technology Relationship (or Me2T relationship). We reserve the term “Me2P” for the app or website with which the individual is directly interacting. Finally, in this stage, notice that the list of B2B Hidden Affiliates continues to grow—this time, with all the third parties included in the browser app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stage 3: Mia opens the Instagram website from the Chrome browser:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6.3&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to the previous stages, Mia is required to enter into a legal relationship with the company responsible for Instagram (Facebook). Her interaction with Instagram occupies her attention and she is in a two-way dialogue with the website. The list of B2B Hidden Affiliates continues to grow, and the browser is demoted to an Enabling Technology, like the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With just a few steps, Mia has developed a network of entities with whom she is in some kind of relationship—wittingly or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word about B2B Hidden Affiliates: while these are depicted in this explanation, we do not consider these to be Me2B Relationships since Mia has no direct relationship with those entities. We will go deeper into the network of hidden affiliates in a subsequent Flash Guide.&nbsp;</p>

	 
 

	 

 

	

	 Mapping Me2B Relationships to GDPR Terminology 
<p>The Me2B Respectful Tech Specification leverages GDPR terminology and concepts, for consistency and clarity.i We acknowledge that the GDPR’s term for people, “Data Subject”, is not particularly empowering from a semantic perspective, but it has the benefit of being clear and legally explicit.There is no doubt that people are more than “data subjects”. The terminology we’ve introduced above maps to GDPR terms as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>



Me2B TERM
GDPR TERM


Mia
Data Subject


Business or “B” in a Me2B Legal Relationship
Data Controller


Product or “P” in a M2P Relationship
Data Controller


Technology or “T” in a Me2T Relationship
Data Controller


B2B Hidden Affiliate
Data Processor

 The growing demand for digital public infrastructure requires coordinated global investment and an ethical&nbsp;lens Global leaders weigh in on the ethical facets of digital public infrastructure at a virtual conference held Monday, Aug. 30,&nbsp;2021. The 10 must-reads to keep pace with the digital public infrastructure movement <p>By Govind Shivkumar, Director of Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>You don’t need me to tell you that 2020 was an arduous year, or that the year that followed has been just as fraught. We all had a collective experience of the pandemic as a destabilizing force. It exacerbated and highlighted societal inefficiencies and inequities as no other single event in recent memory has, and it did so on a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Underlying many of the achievements and disappointments in pandemic response was digital public infrastructure (or lack thereof). Where some nations were equipped to deliver cash transfers to citizens, collect and utilize comprehensive public health data, and distribute vaccines in an orderly fashion, others struggled. What made the difference was often preexisting digital public infrastructure (or&nbsp;DPI).</p><p>Our friends at The Rockefeller Foundation explain this well in a new <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/co-develop-digital-public-infrastructure-for-an-equitable-recovery/">report,</a> showing that as more of our society becomes digital (especially the economy), it becomes increasingly imperative that we treat digital infrastructure like we do roads and bridges. They outline six key areas of cooperation. The bottom line? We need coordinated global investment in digital public infrastructure so that it’s in place before we need it. And we need an ethical lens to ensure that any digital systems reinforce safeguards such as inclusion, trust, competition, security, and&nbsp;privacy.</p> A shared vision and call to&nbsp;action <p>The need for more and better digital public infrastructure has not gone unnoticed by government and philanthropy. This week, a group of nearly 20 global leaders laid out a shared vision for co-developing broad-based, flexible digital systems to support an equitable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic while strengthening inclusion and human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Hosted by the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance</a>, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norad), and The Rockefeller Foundation, the virtual event elicited meaningful ideas and commitments from The United Nations, European Commission, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, Africa Digital Rights Hub, USAID, India, Sri Lanka, Togo, Sierra Leone, Estonia, Norway, Germany, and many other champions.</p><p>Omidyar Network’s Senior Vice President of Programs, Michele Jawando, moderated the conversation, drawing out pledges of funding and other support to <a href="https://mosip.io/">MOSIP</a> and <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">Mojaloop</a> (two of Omidyar Network’s grantees), the health data exchange <a href="https://dhis2.org/">DHIS2</a>, <a href="https://digitalsquare.org/blog/2021/8/27/digital-square-recommits-to-advancing-health-equity-through-digital-transformation">Digital Square</a>, Digital Public Goods Alliance, technical assistance to implementing nations, research, and proposals for new funding structures such as The Giving Pledge or creating a GAVI-like alliance that pools demand and resources from the public and private&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>“More than 400 people tuned in to learn more about digital public Infrastructure (DPI) — the basic systems like digital identity, payments and data exchanges that can connect us at a societal scale,” Jawando reflected. “Some heard for the first time how innovators built on DPI to slow disease spread and deliver help. They heard calls for caution and the need for safeguards for inclusion and protection. And they saw that we have a shared and coordinated agenda for equitable global co-development, based on digital public&nbsp;goods.”</p><p>As the speakers reminded us, this is just the beginning. We have a chance to bake ethics and inclusion into society’s next great socio-technological transformation; the first that is truly global AND digital. Let’s use that opportunity wisely.</p> An ethical framework <p>If history has shown us anything, it’s that creating systems that have society-wide implications without prioritizing ethical considerations is a fool’s errand at best; at worst it’s catastrophic. As the demand for digital public infrastructure becomes more widespread, it’s important to prioritize the ethical considerations when designing such&nbsp;systems.</p><p>That’s the objective of a new <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/digital-public-goods">white paper</a> funded by Omidyar Network and developed by Harvard University’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. To provide governments with a roadmap for the ethical deployment of digital public infrastructure, the Center’s Justice, Health and Democracy Impact Initiative produced a set of best practices for organizations that covers the design and deployment considerations for technologists, national governments, and philanthropic funders.</p><p>“After taking a hard look at existing work on this subject, we realized much of the debate is happening at the wrong level,” said co-author Josh Simons, who holds a joint fellowship at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy and the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. “There is too much uncertainty, change, and dynamism for hard and fast rules. What we need are concrete structures of decision-making and participation that hold actors to account for how they build digital infrastructure.”</p><p>Specifically, the paper advises technology developers to design digital public infrastructure that can adapt to emerging needs, concerns, and technological developments. Developers should consult directly with advocates of end users at all stages of development to ensure systems do not undermine their rights. Developers should also ensure their systems are able to be accessed by a variety of users, regardless of background or experience with technology, and regularly revise and maintain the systems once they’re&nbsp;built.</p><p>On the policy side, it is critical that policymakers integrate deliberation in the design and deployment of digital public infrastructure. These deliberation processes should also seek out input and feedback from groups have historically been marginalized. Additionally, policymakers should continuously conduct evaluations of how digital systems are affecting the communities they serve and establish clear ways to reform the systems, protect user rights, and establish transparency and accountability for politicians and technology developers.</p><p>Finally, philanthropists who are hoping to support the development of digital public infrastructure should identify and support developers and policymakers who have clear commitments to responsible digital public infrastructure development. They should moreover establish accountability measures for themselves such as adopting multidisciplinary ethics committees to help with oversight and navigating uncertain situations.</p><p>And the paper stresses regular discussions among all stakeholders involved to assess the merits, feasibility, and limitations of digital public infrastructure.</p><p>“Our guiding principles for stakeholders involved in developing and deploying digital public infrastructure are revisability of technology design, deliberative governance to create feedback loops, and accountability of funders and policy-makers,” said Jeff Behrends, Director of Ethics and Technology Initiatives at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and co-author on the project. “We advocate an approach to the ethics of digital public infrastructure that we believe is robust, resilient, and applicable to countries across the&nbsp;world.”</p> A growing&nbsp;movement <p>If you feel like this has only scratched the surface, you’d be right! As with so many things with social, political, economic, and technological consequences, digital public infrastructure is a complex topic. Below are links to further reading that highlights the need for digital public infrastructure and how to make it a reality everywhere, for everyone. We’re confident that once others in government, international organizations, civil society, business, and philanthropy learn more, they will want to help overcome some of the remaining hurdles.</p><p>We welcome them into a rapidly growing international community of organizations working to change how countries are supported in their digital transformation journeys. There are no quick fixes. Only through better coordination, vastly more resources, and a clear vision of what “good DPI” is and why it matters can we accelerate deployments, strengthen national digital sovereignty and local value creation.</p><p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/08/4-reasons-you-should-care-about-digital-public-infrastructure">How to bring digital inclusion to the people who need it most</a> (World Economic Forum, Aug.&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-digital-public-infrastructure-is-no-longer-just-a-development-agenda-6c3915d20598">Reimagining digital public infrastructure is no longer just a development agenda</a> (Omidyar Network, June&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://ecfr.eu/article/a-digital-agenda-for-the-eastern-partnership/">A digital agenda for the Eastern Partnership</a> (European Council on Foreign Relations, June&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.xyz/">Exploring digital public goods</a> (An eight-part series written by Richard Pope and supported by Omidyar Network, May-July&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-the-time-is-now-for-digital-public-goods-99833">Opinion: The time is now for digital public goods</a> (Devex, May&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/financing-the-digital-public-goods-ecosystem/">Financing the digital public goods ecosystem</a> (Digital Public Goods Alliance, March&nbsp;2021)</p><p><a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2020/12/07/covid-19-spurs-national-plans-to-give-citizens-digital-identities">Covid-19 spurs national plans to give citizens digital identities</a> (The Economist, Dec. 2020 — subscriber access required)</p><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/746a8643-1ff5-4e28-8f78-389f549c2b0e">‘Fire hose’ of health innovation risks going down the drain</a> (Financial Times, Nov.&nbsp;2020)</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-growing-demand-for-digital-public-infrastructure-requires-coordinated-global-investment-and-an-8ce1a22e4d6c">The growing demand for digital public infrastructure requires coordinated global investment and an…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Reflecting on WAO’s digital support of charities during the Catalyst Continuation programme Image: <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/uL99eb3GCa0">Clay&nbsp;LeConey</a><blockquote>“Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.” (Winston Churchill)</blockquote><p>A couple of months ago, we <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/all-good-things-come-to-an-end-e3d21a93da49">announced</a> that we’d been asked to help eight charities with some digital support through Catalyst’s ‘Continuation ‘programme. This has now come to an end, so we thought we’d wrap up what happened and what we learned from the&nbsp;process.</p><p>First of all, we tracked everything we did. This was vital not only to account for our time but also to co-ordinate with one another and fairly distribute our support amongst our eight charities. Doug and Laura collaborated to provide advice and support over the course of the programme.</p><p>The work being done by charities was diverse and different, and we didn’t have a lot of time to plan what kind of support we were going to offer. As our eight charities were in different places, we needed a plan that would be quite flexible. Consequently, we decided to run weekly office hours in which charities could randomly show up, meet whomever else happened to have shown up and ask questions or just chat. In addition, we offered weekly 1:1 sessions for each&nbsp;charity.</p><p>Our digital support was optional, which meant that some charities used their full allocation of time, whereas others touched in occasionally or used us as accountability partners.</p><p>From <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> training to <a href="https://typeform.com">Typeform</a> remixing, advice on SSL certs and hosting packages to analytics, GDPR, CRMs or discovering if a particular tool had its own API, over the ten weeks, we helped charities with a wide range of technical issues.</p><blockquote>I don’t believe we would have been as effective or achieved as much in this phase without the help, support and direction of the you as our Digital Mentors. (Christine Brown, Ideal For&nbsp;All)</blockquote><p>We also gave advice on community engagement, peer to peer learning, architectures of participation, user testing, UX and many other socio-technological phenomena. All of this kind of consultancy can only happen by understanding the wider context a charity is working in, so we are pleased that our participation in previous Catalyst programmes had given us that insight and understanding.</p><blockquote>Really appreciate everything you’ve taught us and that goes for the rest of the team too. (Lindsay Woodward, CFF)</blockquote><p>We’re so proud to have had the opportunity to work with such a wonderful group of charities and human beings. As we wrapped up our participation in the Catalyst Continuation programme, we made sure to let our charities know that they are always welcome to reach out and share with us what they’ve been working on. After all, the relationships don’t end just because the beginning does!</p><blockquote>We Are Open were as clever as they were time efficient, a valuable resource throughout. (Kat Lewis, The Margate&nbsp;Bookie)</blockquote> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-end-of-the-beginning-fad2447f378f">The End of the Beginning</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>We do not have to look back further than the global economic collapse of 2008 to fully understand the worst-case scenario of unverified legal entities engaging in financial transactions. The LEI was created at the request of the G20 and Financial Stability Board (FSB) in response to this global catastrophe. Its objective is to provide a means to uniquely identify any legally distinct entity that engages in a transaction and subsequently reduce fraud and mitigate risk within the ecosystem. </p>
<p>With the LEI’s origin and objective in mind, it follows naturally that it offers potentially immeasurable value too when it comes to delivering transparency and trust in payment transactions. This value is widely recognized among many payment industry insiders, and in recent years, there has been burgeoning appetite and advocacy for LEI usage in a broad range of payments use cases. There has been significant industry-wide progress with two concrete mandates for LEI usage recently emanating from the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of England in specific payment applications. Additionally, many regions and regulators are consulting on transformation within the ecosystem, and considering what role the LEI could play as a result. Since early 2020, GLEIF has shared information with regulatory authorities and organizations in the payments space on the LEI and its credentials in identity management via nine public consultations. Many more are anticipated in the years ahead.   </p>
<p>Below is a summary of key recent developments within the payments’ arena, which demonstrate widening acceptance of the LEI as a tool capable of delivering an enhanced global payments ecosystem.    </p>
<p>Mandate: LEI for Large Value Transactions </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced a new mandate for the use of the LEI for all payment transactions of the value ₹50 crore (approximately €5.5 million) and above for entities using the Reserve Bank-run Centralized Payment Systems viz. Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT). By 1 April 2021, banks had to ensure that all remitter and beneficiary information in RTGS and NEFT payment messages were populated with the LEI. Data showed that in Q1 2021, India was ranked fifth in terms of the jurisdictions with the highest rate of LEI growth. This offers an indication of the mandate’s impact on LEI issuance.   </p>
<p>A strong proponent for the LEI, the RBI had earlier introduced it as a requirement in over the counter (OTC) derivative and non-derivative markets and large corporate borrowers.</p>
<p>The RBI’s use of the LEI to verify the identity of participants in large value transactions is the first use case of its kind. Yet the potential risk management advantages it offers make it a compelling tactic that other central banks may wish to consider adopting.   </p>
<p>Mandate: LEI in CHAPS Payments Message Standard (ISO 20022)  </p>
<p>In December 2020, The Bank of England (BoE) published its ‘Policy Statement: Implementing ISO 20022 Enhanced data in CHAPS’. Within the document, the BoE reaffirms its proactive position “to support the wider uptake of the LEI - beyond the financial sector - to corporates. […] the Bank believes wider uptake of the LEI could unlock a number of key benefits and is working with Government and national and international stakeholders to promote LEI use cases. These include their potential role in enhancing cross-border payments as part of the Financial Stability Board’s roadmap, as well as the role the LEI can play to help tackle financial crime.”</p>
<p>The paper confirms the BoE’s long-held intention to “introduce the LEI into the CHAPS payment message standard when migrating to ISO 20022, in line with industry views and international consensus, including HVPSplus and CBPRplus guidance.”</p>
<p>It then sets out the following initial phasing timeline:  </p>
 
 February 2023: LEIs will be introduced into ISO 20022 standard CHAPS payment messages on an ‘optional to send’ basis. While the BoE encourages all CHAPS Direct Participants to start using LEIs as early as possible, it will not become mandatory until spring 2024.  
 Spring 2024: The BoE will begin mandating LEIs to be used in by certain circumstances, with a vision to widen out the requirement to all participants over time. The BoE will mandate the use of the LEI where the payment involves a transfer of funds between Financial Institutions.  
 
<p>Within the report the BoE notes that the earlier firms adopt the LEI, the sooner they will derive its benefits. It also states an intention for the BoE to monitor the use of LEI for all transactions, with a view to assessing whether the mandatory requirement to include LEI data should be extended to all CHAPS payments. Industry will be provided with at least 18 months’ advance notice if the BoE extends any mandatory LEI requirements. </p>
<p>Consultation: Cross Border Payments </p>
<p>In February this year, GLEIF published a blog exploring the FSB’s support for the LEI in its Stage 3 roadmap on Enhancing Cross-Border Payments. In that publication, the FSB lists several focus areas that require global coordination and action to overcome the challenges and frictions in cross-border payments. Of particular note is the identification of ‘Establish Unique Identifiers with proxy registries’ as a key building block in the FSB’s roadmap to enhanced cross-border payments. </p>
<p>An action-oriented framework is laid out in the roadmap, which commits the FSB and GLEIF to collaborate in consultation with other prominent stakeholders to: “explore the scope for, and obstacles to develop, a global Unique Identifier (UI) for cross border payments and potentially other financial transactions, that takes into account existing identifiers including the LEI for legal entities….” This collaborative work effort is scheduled to run from October 2020 until December 2021 and GLEIF welcomes the opportunity to engage with it.</p>
<p>Additionally, as a further action mapped to the same ‘Establishing Unique Identifiers…’ building block, GLEIF will work in close coordination with the FSB, the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) and national authorities to explore options for improving LEI adoption. This work effort will run from June 2021 to June 2022.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, the FSB roadmap makes the association between an enhanced payments ecosystem and legal entity identification. For cross-border payments, the ability for identity verification to happen across borders is critical and this is why the LEI is perfectly poised to provide a solution. Its universality makes it the perfect candidate for bestowing transparency in relation to entity identification across the global payments landscape.  </p>
<p>Consultation: Instant Payments </p>
<p>In March 2021, the European Commission (EC) published its Consultation Strategy on Instant Payments in the EU. The purpose of the consultation is to identify obstacles to the creation of efficient pan-European instant payment solutions, to assess the effectiveness of potential solutions and to measure the potential benefits and costs of those solutions. The first part of this consultation involves surveying payment service providers (PSPs) and providers of supporting technical services. Of relevance to the LEI are the questions regarding sanctions screening. The survey asks whether there is a need for alleviated screening of transactions by PSPs involving clients vetted or whitelisted beforehand, or if a common EU-wide list of false hits and/or the use of the LEI for firms and digital IDs for individuals could solve any sanctions screening-related issue that instant payments may create. </p>
<p>GLEIF welcomes the EC’s consideration of the LEI as a potential solution to support the screening of instant payment transactions against sanction and watch lists and has a keen interest in the outcome of the survey. </p>
<p>The ‘LEI Lightbulb Blog Series’ from GLEIF aims to shine a light on the breadth of acceptance and advocacy for the LEI across the public and private sectors, geographies and use cases by highlighting which industry leaders, authorities and organizations are supportive of the LEI and for what purpose. By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a ground swell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide. </p>

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Leaders from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and IBM met with President Joe Biden at the White House last week to discuss strategies the government and private sector can use together to improve the nation’s cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following the meeting, Amazon announced that it will provide eligible AWS customers with access to free FIDO Security Keys. Not only will this protect the burgeoning number of businesses that run on AWS, but it will help instill better authentication practices as these keys can be used across many other business (e.g., G Suite, Github, Dropbox, Stripe) and consumer (Facebook, Twitter, Coinbase, Bank of America) services.</p>



<p>Amazon has been a leading stakeholder in FIDO Alliance for several years now – it is wonderful to see their leadership extended to the market at large. As more businesses move to the cloud, it is absolutely critical that cloud service providers follow suit to protect this critical infrastructure. Threats and attackers are growing in sophistication, and the impacts are non-trivial. Hundreds of millions of personal records are being stolen and resold on the dark web on an alarmingly regular basis. This is a clear and present threat to our economy, our national security and our society.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to name a breach from the past five years that wasn’t tied to stolen credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest prominent attack, which was carried out on Colonial Pipeline, used <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-senate-cyber-defenses-were-compromised-ahead-hack-2021-06-08/">a single stolen password</a> to essentially cripple the U.S eastern seaboard.</p>



<p>It is important that all businesses take steps to educate and protect their employees and customers from such threats. “Traditional” means of multi-factor authentication (such as OTPs) simply aren’t fit-for-purpose to protect against these attacks, which can financially cripple a company or organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, credential-based breaches (like Colonial Pipeline’s) wouldn’t be possible if accounts were protected with FIDO Authentication, which requires local possession of a device with no knowledge-based authentication credentials passed over the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has come a long way since our inception. What started as a whiteboard concept has evolved into technology that is becoming part of the web’s DNA. Virtually every platform and device can now support FIDO Authentication, and there are public SDKs and tools, plus a rich ecosystem of FIDO Certified vendor products and services that can help companies implement FIDO for their sites and apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amazon’s move to provide free FIDO Security Keys sets a strong – and important – example. We encourage all other cloud service providers to urgently consider following suit by at a minimum enabling FIDO authenticators for admin access to networks.</p>

<p>Early this month we were hosted by our good friends at <a href="https://www.marsh.com/nz/home.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">Marsh New Zealand</a> to run a joint Connect event with <a href="https://fintechnz.org.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">FinTechNZ</a> on Digital and Cyber Risk.&nbsp; Overall, we see cyber security as one of three key elements, alongside identity and privacy which in combination make up Digital Trust – providing the confidence needed for people, technology and processes to create a truly safe and effective digital world. &nbsp;</p>



  
<p>The world has seen an unprecedented rise in cyber security incidents since the beginning of 2020 – a trend which is shaking up everything we thought we knew about prevention and management of this insidious risk.</p>
  



<p>We had four insightful presentations, given by Jono Soo (<a href="https://www.marsh.com/nz/services/cyber-risk.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">Marsh NZ</a>), Jonathon Berry (<a href="https://www.inphysecsecurity.com/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">InPhySec</a>), Andy Prow (<a href="https://www.redshield.co/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">Red Shield</a>) and Paul Platen (<a href="https://www.sss.co.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">SSS</a>) which provided a deep-dive into what has been going on in the world of cyber security and insurance over the past 12 months, how this has impacted on businesses in all sectors both globally as well as in New Zealand, and what we might expect looking forward.</p>



<p>Their presentations can be found <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/08/Digital-and-Cyber-Risk-Beyond-2020.pdf?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">here.</a></p>



<p></p>



<p>The key take homes for me were:</p>



<p>More human interactivity now happens at the digital layer rather than the human layer (according to the CIA!) The frequency and severity of ransomware attacks continues to climb, therefore cyber security insurance premiums are going up quickly too and are going to be tougher to acquire. <a href="https://www.cert.govt.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=7002227e56-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-7002227e56-">CERT NZ</a> is a great place to get a whole host of cyber security info.&nbsp; However, when NZ CERT was set up it was given a budget of only $22m for 4 years. The NZ Defense Force spends around 4bn per annum i.e. the comparison between what is spent to protect ourselves physically vs what is spent to protect us digitally is stark. We need to take the protection of the digital realm much, much more seriously and orders of magnitude and more resources need to be focused here. &nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi. My name is Anne Hilliger and I am the new intern at <a href="http://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a>. Not only am I new but also the first ever intern at WAO which means I’m also their guinea pig for a possible future intern&nbsp;program.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@solomac?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Adam Solomon</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hello?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>As a little taste of what makes me me here are some randomly collected facts about me: I am crazy for bike riding (nice gravel rides with coffee breaks and a good amount of icecream are just the best), the first half of this year I spend living and studying in Lapland in the same town where also Santa lives (Rovaniemi and yes I met him, twice), I live in a flat with 5 other adults and two incredibly cute kids (not mine though), I am definitely a cat person and if somebody would give me a basket full of kitties I would happily say&nbsp;yes.</p><p>I am studying cultural and media education at a small university in central/eastern Germany called <a href="https://www.hs-merseburg.de/">Hochschule Merseburg</a>. In the current semester it is time to do your mandatory internship and like my last name might tell, I know Laura Hilliger and have always been very interested in what she tells me about her work. Therefore I thought this internship might be a perfect opportunity to learn more about what WAO is doing, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/about-us/">who her colleagues are</a> and what it is like to work on projects with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Another incentive that made me want to work with WAO is that my curriculum at the university is rather focused on teaching kids and teenagers, mostly in face to face, school or kindergarten settings. This is also fun and interesting but in my world media education is even more than that. To have the opportunity to work with people who are specialized in teaching and learning in mostly online environments, who developed interesting and innovative tools and who know how to work with companies, charities or other collaborators, is going to teach me so many cool things! I am really looking forward to&nbsp;that.</p>one project I worked at in 2016: creating a virtual dinosaur museum in minecraft (CC BY-NC-SA&nbsp;4.0)<p>After receiving a very warm welcome I am now in my fourth week already, the onboarding is in full speed and I am learning a lot about the projects, the processes and of course the philosophy of openness. I worked myself through the email courses they developed (<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/">please go and check them out if you haven’t, they are great!</a>), and I got particularly caught up with the topic of working openly because this is something I never really did before and it is as exciting as it is challenging.</p><p>I am coming from an understanding of work that is very conservative and heteronormative due to the capitalistic structures I grew up in. Therefore I find it challenging to actually pursue the approach of openness. In theory I understand the principles, but what does it actually mean? You have to unlearn quite some patterns. I for example noticed that in order to ask questions not only to Laura (who is a confidant) but into the channel where everybody from the Co-op can read it, I have to jump over my own shadow a lot (a German expression that means to overcome yourself). I am still thinking in the pattern of “Am I allowed to do that?”, “Aren’t the others too important/busy to listen to what I have to say?”, “I am only the intern”. I am really looking forward to jumping over my own shadow for this more often and starting to integrate the philosophy of openness into my understanding of how work can also be&nbsp;like.</p>And this is me, very much frozen in Lapland (CC BY-NC-SA&nbsp;4.0) <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/hello-world-6b5c8caed8db">Hello world!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation announced recently a new mechanism for rewarding and funding work in the common interest of its membership, the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/introducing-dif-grants/">DIF Grants Program</a>. The Steering Committee ratified an addendum defining these collaborations between a specific DIF working group and a grant sponsor, and this shiny new tool sits ready to be debuted in the toolkit available to DIF community work. DIF’s work is leveling up with this new mechanism for transparently funding work that supports DIF’s mission and benefits the membership as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>The first such grant was initiated by Microsoft, which has a long history of collaborations in DIF. Of the various modalities described by the grant program, The Claims and Credentials Working Group will be overseeing a new work item open to all DIF members that creates and harden a JWS test suite, with this grant funding a lead editor to drive the work and keep it to a pre-determined timeline, paid upon stable and complete&nbsp;release.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@natasyachen">Natasya&nbsp;Chen</a> History <p>Pamela Dingle, co-chair of the Interoperability WG, identified a recurring theme in conversations about interoperability across the great “JSON”/”JSON-LD” divide: while considerable cross-vendor, cross-stack alignment had happened over the last years to address many other aspects of credential exchange and identifier resolution, “translation issues” and varying interpretations of the JSON sections of the VC data model specification lead to divergent ways of structuring, defining, signing, and parsing VCs in JWT form. The kinds of signature suite definitions that define Linked Data Proofs made strange bedfellows with the in-built mechanisms of JWT, which were hardened and commoditized earlier. This results in a slightly “balkanized” landscape of VC-JWTs that make different concessions to the expectations of JSON-LD-native parsers and&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Initially, the idea of iterating one or more foundational specifications seemed a natural solution: a few key sections of any specification could be made more explicit, more normative, or less ambiguous. But just as the plural of anecdote is not data, so too is the plural of specifications not disambiguation. Another tack was chosen: implementers of the existing specification would come together and compare their running code to identify every difference and incompatibility, defining a test suite that interpreted the current specification. They might still produce a list of changes they would like to see in a future specification, and that list might contain some contentious items that take a long time to align. But in the meantime, they would have a practical roadmap to alignment and a benchmark for conformance to drive interoperability amongst each other and clarity for external interoperability.</p> A signature suite that spans two&nbsp;worlds <p>The specification under test in this new work item is <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">Json Web Signature 2020 </a>(“JWS2020” for short), a CCG signature suite that defines how the signature mechanisms and data structures native to “detached signature” JWS tokens can be parsed as <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>. The signature mechanisms of the <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/jwt-jws-and-jwe-for-not-so-dummies-b63310d201a3">JWT world</a> and the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Feb/att-0130/VerifiableTrustStandards.png">LDP world</a> are quite different– bridging them requires a deep understanding of both: differing security models, canonization and serialization complexities, explicit reliance on <a href="https://www.iana.org/protocols">IANA registries</a>, <a href="https://json-ld.github.io/rdf-dataset-canonicalization/spec/">URDNA dataset normalization</a>, and the like. Advanced topics, even for this&nbsp;blog!</p><p>Understanding such a specification on a deep intellectual level and understanding its design decisions requires a firm grasp on all these complexities spanning two very different engineering traditions. Implementing the specification, however, should not; to be blunt, our community cannot afford such understanding gating off successful implementation, particularly if industrial adoption of decentralized identity is a shared goal. Before the specification gets iterated, it needs to be testable, and even more implementable than it already&nbsp;is.</p><p>This is where a test suite offers pedagogical tool for first-time implementers, as well as a negotiation tool for seasoned veterans and large corporations managing vast roadmaps and production development pipelines. While many DIF members do not encode VCs in JWT form, this grant is clearly in the common interest because mainstream adoption will indisputably benefit from a clearer, more explicitly-defined, and definitively-testable “normative VC-JWT”.</p> Selection Process <p>From 26 July 2021 to 9 August 2021, the chairs fielded applications through a google <a href="https://forms.gle/hPCNWaAQZpLFZyXd7">form</a>, and submitted all valid application to <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/tree/main/grants/grant_1/applications">github</a> for posterity. The selection criteria for the work item lead is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  familiarity with JWS mechanics and common JOSE libraries/best-practices  experience with automated testing, vector design, and test scripts/suites  familiarity with LD Proofs and signature suites generally  familiarity with JSON/JSON-LD interop problems, at the semantic, signature-verification, and representation/parsing levels   Grantee Announcement <p>On 12 August 2021, The Claims &amp; Credential (C&amp;C) Working Group at DIF gladly announced Transmute Industries as the recipient of the first DIF Grant to provide a JWS Test Suite for Verifiable Credentials. One of the chairs, Martin Riedel, summarized the chairs’ decision thusly:Transmute has been a thought leader in the SSI space for years and uniquely fits the requirement profile laid out in the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-grant-1-jws-test-suite/">Grant announcement</a>.</p>  Orie Steele, the CTO of Transmute, is the initiating author of, lead editor of, and main contributor to <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">the (LD-) JSON Web Signature 2020</a>.  Transmute has a strong background in TDD and is a strong proponent of delivering test vectors with specifications in order to achieve greater implementation-level interoperability. Examples include Test Vectors in <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/sidetree.js/tree/main/packages/test-vectors">Sidetree.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/did-key.js/tree/main/packages/did-key-test-vectors">did-key.js</a>.  The company already provides integrated libraries to support (LDS)-VC and JWT-VC side-by-side, demonstrating their familiarity with both representations. See&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/verifiable-data/blob/c61c2eeff859a902cfbaf375424b3b5cfa519ea6/packages/vc.js/README.md">vc.js</a>.  Lastly, Transmute has a strong track record of making specifications and libraries accessible to the general public in a variety of deployed web-projects (<a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries/">https://did.key.transmute.industries/</a>, <a href="https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/">https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/</a> and&nbsp;others…)  <p>Therefore we regard Transmute Industries as the ideal candidate to provide a comprehensive JWS test suite for LDS-VC and JWT-VC and support the community interactions around this project within DIF’s C&amp;C&nbsp;Group.</p> Next Steps <p>The new work item will be announced and regular meetings initiated at the 23 August meeting of C&amp;C– if you are interested in participating, please attend and/or drop a note in the C&amp;C slack&nbsp;channel.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-grant-1-jws-test-suite-a26cc4a95540">DIF Grant #1: JWS Test Suite</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>NFTs let anyone proveably own a unique digital property. This technology is revolutionizing <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/dapper-labs-nba-top-shot-has-crossed-the-million-user-mark">collectibles</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">digital art</a>, <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/metamask/to-infinity-and-beyond-the-growth-of-axie-infinity/">gaming</a>, <a href="https://ff.mirror.xyz/3FKwvkwAPltEdhe4pWnL8RX7TNruwNNZcFAqNn92tUs">media</a>, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkhls/status/1427724533713326082">science</a>. However, to date, the type of property that could be managed through NFTs has been limited to constant, static, hardcoded properties. This is great for art, collectibles, and other use cases where immutability is a feature. </p><p>Most types of property benefit from evolution, mutability, or gamification. Together, Ceramic and Chainlink give creators the tools to create more dynamic NFT experiences. Ceramic allows for hosting more flexible forms of content, while Chainlink can supply external inputs that change and gamify NFTs, creating what’s called dynamic NFTs. </p><p>With these new tools, NFT-based experiences can expand to include:</p>  Evolving art and collectibles, changed by the original creator, current owner, or new data like the weather  Collectible packs of NFTs with special edition traits randomly chosen upon opening  Property that gains value from each owner depending on how they use it, like an in-game item that keeps its own history of how it’s used in gameplay  Ownership rights that let the current NFT holder change the content associated to the NFT, for example for land parcels in AR, VR, or games  <p>“When you buy a physical piece of land, the house doesn’t disappear. There’s a foundation there,” says Geo Web founder Graven Prest. “We need to replicate that for NFTs in the digital world.”</p><p>CERAMIC is a sovereign data network for creating, storing and sharing data under the direct control of any identity. Because data in Ceramic is mutable, and only by the controller of that data object, it provides not only a fully decentralized option to store NFT content and metadata but the first way to attach dynamic content to an NFT, with strict permissions and access control rights. Because Ceramic has a cross-chain identity system built-in, this can be deployed easily for any blockchain. </p><p>There are two ways to use this in NFT experiences. First, Ceramic streams can be updated only by the original creator. This would let artists sell NFTs and then update and enhance their work over time. The history is preserved, so this mutability is purely a gain. Athletes could sell NFTs that evolve as their stats do. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork/status/1428371493407371265">NFT:DID</a>, a recently released feature in Ceramic, allows the current owner of an NFT exclusive rights to update content. For example, Geo Web is using Ceramic to store content displayed in their AR metaverse. The owner of each parcel of land, represented by an NFT, can change the content being displayed. This could be used for owner-only logbooks, storing critical metadata or permissions, profile pics with changeable attire, collective playlist creation, or more. &nbsp;</p><p>CHAINLINK provides more dynamic ownership models for NFT experiences based on reliable external data feeds and trust-minimized off-chain computations. Most notably, Chainlink <a href="https://chain.link/solutions/chainlink-vrf">Verifiable Random Function (VRF)</a> generates a tamper-proof and auditable source of randomness, which users can reference to offer fair drops of limited edition NFTs, evolve NFTs over time via pure entropy, and retain rarity odds in NFT distribution models.</p><p>Given the historical security and reliability of Chainlink VRF, we recommend that any developer launching NFTs on Ceramic and needing randomness to use Chainlink VRF. Ultimately, this will help them create a more exciting, transparent, and fraud-proof user experience, as well as help gamify NFTs by enabling them to change over time.</p> <p>About Chainlink</p><p>Chainlink is the industry standard oracle network for powering hybrid smart contracts. Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks provide developers with the largest collection of high-quality data sources and secure off-chain computations to expand the capabilities of smart contracts on any blockchain. Managed by a global, decentralized community, Chainlink currently secures billions of dollars in value for smart contracts across decentralized finance (DeFi), insurance, gaming, and other major industries.<br></p><p>Chainlink is trusted by hundreds of organizations, from global enterprises to projects at the forefront of the blockchain economy, to deliver definitive truth via secure, reliable oracle networks.

 Equity, innovation, and community gardens Image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/dUsmF-F-bJg">dylan&nbsp;nolte</a><p>Imagine a community garden with abundant fruit and vegetables for anyone to come and pick and consume. Now imagine a factory creating standardised parts to be used by manufacturers. The two metaphors feel quite different, don’t&nbsp;they?</p><p>The first, the garden metaphor, feels welcoming. You can envisage suggestions being made about which fruit and vegetables to grow to meet the needs of the community. And it feels natural that people would be able to opt-in to come and work in the garden for the benefit of&nbsp;all.</p><p>The second, the factory metaphor, feels less welcoming. In fact, unless you’re an employee of the factory, or have been sanctioned for entry, then you don’t get to see how the standardised parts are made. And if you’re not a manufacturer, then why would you get a say in how they’re&nbsp;made?</p><p>Metaphors are imperfect tools for thought but do help us grasp at deeply-held assumptions about how groups of people should interact with one another. In WAO’s work with various organisations, we’ve found the garden metaphor comes up time and time again as one to strive towards. Too often, though, organisations treat people as ‘consumers’ within a ‘market’ — rather than community members within an ecosystem.</p><p>Standards are extremely important to our everyday modern lifestyles. They’re the reason that devices don’t explode when you plug them into electrical outlets; they’re the reason that you can go to shops and buy clothes and shoes that fit; they’re the reason you can visit any website using any web&nbsp;browser.</p><p>It’s important that experts help develop standards. For example, we want people who know a lot about electrical engineering designing standards for electrical outlets. But it’s no good having standards that no-one uses, or that they use begrudgingly. That’s why it’s crucial to have end-user input into standards development.</p><p>Different types of standards, of course, require different levels of input. If we’re talking about electrical wall sockets, there’s a level of mandating that applies: in this country, if you want to plug things in, it works like this. But when it comes to things that are international and have to work in a variety of contexts, then it’s important that standards aren’t limited to only what a small group of people are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>For people who have never really worked openly, who have always interacted within the confines of closed working groups (with people who look and talk a lot like them, come from similar backgrounds, and want similar things in life) end-user requests might come as a bit of a shock. Insiders might describe these requests as ‘unhelpful’ or dismiss the people themselves as ‘not understanding the bigger picture’.</p><p>The reason that the <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2021/08/02/open-badges-3-0/">recent IMS debacle</a> has rankled the Open Badges community so much is because of the stark contrast between the way that the standard was developed by Mozilla, compared to the way it is being stewarded by IMS. The only reason that the community have any insight into the development process, which is closed off to paying members, is because of a requirement from Mozilla that IMS retain an open repository.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/IMSGlobal/openbadges-specification/pull/303#issuecomment-890346719">At that repository</a>, Kerri Lemoie has submitted a proposal to align Open Badges with the W3C standard for Verifiable Credentials. Unlike IMS working groups, anyone can turn up for W3C calls — as a number of Open Badges community members have done. The opposition to Kerri’s proposal by a faction of IMS members has not been explained clearly and much of the discussion is happening behind closed&nbsp;doors.</p><p>This is not how open standards should be developed. It might take time to develop standards in the open. You may have to deal with people different to you and that you don’t particularly understand or like. It’s also possible that you have to consider use cases outside your own experience. But in the end, bringing a wealth of diversity and experience to the table is the exact thing that brought Open Badges its initial&nbsp;success.</p><p>Western capitalist society conditions us to understand openness as a danger. However, as the Open Badges community (and indeed other Open Source communities) have shown time and time again, openness leads to innovation. We’re all here to help make standards better — for everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Returning to the factory metaphor, consumers don’t usually have a direct say in what is produced by manufacturers. That is in contrast to the community garden, where even those people who are unable to work the land can have a say in what is grown. Openness leads to&nbsp;equity.</p><p>Open standards should be developed openly because not enough people work to ensure that equity is central to innovation and development. We believe that openness is an attitude, and one which bears fruit over time from which everyone can&nbsp;benefit.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-standards-should-be-developed-openly-1f0cf552308d">Open standards should be developed openly</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Thanks to Billy Leudtke of <a href="https://www.layer0.ventures/">Layer 0 Ventures</a> for drafting this article. </p><p>The Convo Space is giving Web3 developers an easy way to add comments, content and conversations to their decentralized applications. Now live on Ceramic mainnet, The Convo Space enables content from across applications to be linked to an user’s unique decentralized identity to create a shared, decentralized layer for Web3 conversations. The easy-to-use API abstracts away the complexity of Web3, paving the way for the defragmentation &amp; democratization of the ‘conversation’ layer of the internet.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://theconvo.space/">https://theconvo.space/</a> and get started today!</p> Fragmented social context <p>Today, our conversations are fragmented across applications and platforms. Threads of conversation we have with our friends, family, coworkers and peers flow unconnected across a plethora of mediums such as text message, WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Facebook, Instagram and others, and each context of interaction is tied to a different one of our many application-specific digital identities.</p><p>These silos destroy our continuity online, forcing us to:</p>  Rediscover and reconnect with contacts on each new platform  Carry conversations across platforms, eliminating context  Choose applications based on access to our social graph, rather than purely for the product itself  Relinquish control of our data, including the value it generates  Trust platforms to protect our privacy   <p>Platforms don’t talk, people do. Web3 promises an alternative model, with data, identity and reputation separated from individual applications and easily shared across platforms. This information is always controlled by the users, so they can bring reputation and data along when moving to different applications and interfaces, instead of starting from scratch.</p> The Convo Space: de-platformed conversations <p>The Convo Space is a decentralized conversation protocol with data separated from the application/interface, allowing a unified conversation layer that can work across applications and solve the fragmentation issue. Through this separation, conversations can continue to be generated organically on the incumbent platforms, while The Convo Space unifies that content from across platforms to create a cohesive conversation for the user. &nbsp;</p><p>The team’s first product is a commenting solution similar to a decentralized Disqus. The developer product offers three ways to integrate:</p>  A 1-line integration that embeds an i-frame for an out-of-the-box comments section that can be added to any website  React components to let developers customize their own decentralized comments product  APIs to build a fully custom social experience, without having to worry about all the complexities of Web3  <p>Developers can easily leverage any of the above methods to begin building on the decentralized conversation layer of the internet. And because all the data on The Convo Space is associated with users rather than applications, any application can build on the same conversation graph and content.</p> Built on decentralized content, organized around decentralized identities &nbsp; <p>The Convo Space is intended to be fully decentralized, making sure this key social infrastructure is not confined to, or controlled by, any single app or platform. The solution pulls together the latest decentralized technologies to achieve this, including Ceramic, IPFS, Textile, Pinata, and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). </p><p>Comments are stored in ThreadsDB databases, built by Textile. This content is made available through Pinata’s IPFS-pinning service and backed up to Filecoin to ensure fully decentralized availability and redundancy. </p><p>To complete the solution, the product needed to associate the comment threads with users and give them control of their content. For this, they turned to Ceramic. IDX, the decentralized identity protocol built with Ceramic, gives The Convo Space an easy way to link multiple addresses and disparate digital identities into a single user identity. </p><p>This open, unified data network lays the foundation for rich identities that can be used across platforms. IDX also provides an easy way to associate specific comment threads with a user directly. Says Anudit Nagar, founder of The Convo Space: </p><blockquote>Ceramic truly allows your data to flow and aggregate across multiple different chains - it's truly a one-stop solution for all your storage and access needs, in a truly decentralized manner. That is really future proof.</blockquote><p>The platform lets users aggregate all their social conversations into a single place, under a single identity. This lets developers focus on building new and amazing user experiences and worry less about data management. For users, this means conversational data will never be lost or trapped, locking you into a platform because your contacts and ongoing conversations are there. This bridge between Web2 to Web3 enables users to leverage their existing social communities to create more seamless and flexible experiences. </p> What’s Next for The Convo Space? <p>Today’s solution is just the first step towards an unbundled conversation layer for Web3. &nbsp;The team is actively working on rolling out new features to further improve user engagement and experience. Decentralized governance of the protocol is also in the works, which will allow the community to eventually manage itself and set up standards for content moderation, among other things. The team is also working on a <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> Snap which will allow conversations to live natively in a Metamask wallet.</p><p>The Convo Space is currently onboarding NFT marketplaces, DAO aggregation platforms and others to begin opening the commenting layer of the Web.

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation</a>&nbsp;together with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;(GHPC) today announced the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GHP_Interoperability_Blueprint.pdf">Good Health Pass (GHP) Interoperability Blueprint V1.0.0 (PDF)</a>. Produced by over 125 participating companies and organizations spanning global travel, health, cybersecurity, privacy, and government, the Blueprint is an urgently needed solution that describes how to unify the widely disparate set of digital vaccination certificate solutions on the market.</p>



<p>“Over the past several months, different vaccination certificate formats have been announced by at least a dozen different governments, health authorities, and industry consortia around the world, including the European Union’s Digital COVID Certificate and the World Health Organisation’s Digital Document of COVID-19 Certificates,” said John Jordan, Executive Director of the ToIP Foundation. “Each of these is good and valuable in its own right, however because they are designed to be digital health documents, they share more information than is necessary simply to prove one’s COVID-19 status for purposes of travel or entry to a venue. The Good Health Pass Blueprint was designed from the ground up to provide an international trust framework that addresses the need for a simple, secure, standard, privacy-preserving health pass that works anywhere you need to prove your health status, just like a mobile boarding pass works with any airline.”</p>



<p>The Good Health Pass effort began with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;(GHPC) organized by ID2020, a non-profit organization focused on ethical digital identity. In February 2021, GHPC published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/resources/">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint Outline</a>, which specified the key problems that needed to be solved and the core design principles that needed to be followed. GHPC then formed a partnership with the ToIP Foundation to launch the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73790">Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass</a>. Working Group leadership and cross-industry expertise were also contributed by Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH), particularly its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">COVID Credentials Initiative (CCI)</a>. This combined effort resulted in a fully open and transparent process that created the full Blueprint in under eight weeks.</p>



<p>After a public review period during June with stakeholders in air travel, government, healthcare, hospitality, and other affected sectors, the Blueprint was finalized in mid-July for final approval and publication. “Publication of the V1.0.0 Blueprint is just the first step in seeing interoperable privacy preserving digital health passes adopted in order to support people being able to gather together again with lower personal and public health risk,” said Kaliya Young, chair of the Working Group and Ecosystems Director at CCI. “Our next task is collaborating with real world implementers to fill in any remaining gaps to get to an interoperable system and working with LFPH and other partners to deliver open source code that can be deployed.”</p>



<p>Judith Fleenor, Director of Strategic Engagements at the ToIP Foundation, adds “The best news is that the Good Health Pass Blueprint does not compete with or replace any of the publicly announced COVID-19 health certificates. It is compatible with all of them—and others still to come. With the right software, all those health certificates can be ingested and verified in order to issue a Good Health Pass-compliant health pass. This focus on interoperability will make life much simpler and safer for both users and verifiers.”</p>



<p>The ToIP Foundation is especially proud of this effort because it demonstrates how applying the core principles of interoperable digital trust architecture solves global problems and builds confidence in solutions that have data integrity, portability, and confidentiality built-in. This is the fundamental motivation for creating the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/resources/intro-to-toip/">ToIP Stack</a>, the ToIP Foundation’s model for developing privacy-preserving, interoperable, and decentralized digital identity solutions that form and sustain digital trust relationships.</p>



<p>The high-speed collaboration enabled by the Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass also illustrates the value of the antitrust and royalty-free intellectual property rights protections that all our Working Groups enjoy as a Linux Foundation (LF) project. “Good Health Pass is a textbook example of the kind of project the LF was formed to support,” said Brian Behlendorf, LF General Manager of Healthcare, Blockchain, and Identity. “Being able to bring together this many global experts to work so intensively in such a short period is unprecedented—and shows the kind of confidence that the LF has built in an open public collaboration process.”</p>



<p>We encourage you to review the Blueprint, endorse it, and adopt it—and to join the&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/get-involved/good-health-pass-implementation/">Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass</a>&nbsp;if you would like to collaborate with other industry leaders in creating the world’s first privacy-preserving health credential interoperability framework.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director</p>



<p>Editor’s Note: This is the second blog covering the FIDO Developer Challenge.&nbsp; To learn more about the background and process, please read the earlier blog post, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/announcing-the-fido-developer-challenge-for-developers-across-the-globe/">Announcing the FIDO Developer Challenge for Developers Across the Globe</a>.</p>



<p>We are happy to announce that 14 teams from eight different countries (the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, India, Malaysia, Vietnam, and South Korea) have been invited to participate in the implementation stage of the 2021 FIDO Developer Challenge.  Six of the teams are early-stage ventures and an equal number hail from academia; the other two are individual developers.</p>



  



<p>[Faces of participants, captured during online interviews in late July]</p>



<p>All of the teams share a commitment to using FIDO authentication to provide a smoother and more secure user experience across a variety of application areas.  As was the case in our earlier Hackathons, we are seeing yet again that the mix of entrepreneurial vision coupled with the capabilities of FIDO Authentication can be realized in a wide array of use cases and industries.  We will share more details on each of the submissions as the review process carries forward.</p>



<p>The teams are now engaged in designated virtual lounges for possible Q&amp;As and support from the Developer Challenge sponsors and broader FIDO development community.&nbsp; To that end, we would like to recognize and give special thanks to the W3C WebAuthn Adoption Community Group for managing the private Discord Channel to provide technical support for participating teams.</p>



<p>Implementations will be done by the end of August and the judges will evaluate the teams’ final presentations and demos by early September.&nbsp; Please stay tuned for our announcement of the Top 3 by the middle of September – with the winner being announced at the Authenticate conference in Seattle on October 20.</p>

 DIF "Frequently Asked Questions" Knowledgebase 
<p>DIF has launched a massive <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">knowledgebase</a>, structured as a long series of frequently-asked questions and answers. This synthesizes a year of educational efforts in the interop WG, blog posts, newsletters, and many other DIF inputs in a format we hope will be useful as a reference and onboarding document throughout the decentralized identity space.  Please peruse it, particularly the sections about your personal research focus and/or your company's specialty and products, opening issues or PRs on github wherever you feel a correction or addition is needed.  This is intended as a community resource, so PRs are open to your input!</p>
 🍾 DIF Welcomes Chris Kelly at Comms 
<p>Hello and greetings to all! I am delighted to introduce myself as DIF's new communications director. I am originally from Dublin, Ireland, and home is now Berlin, Germany. I'm excited to get involved at DIF, support members in their documentation efforts and bring the decentralised identity conversation to a wider audience. I've spent time in the advertising and non-profit sectors, as a video producer, a sysadmin, and I cohost a comedy drag talkshow on YouTube. At DIF I'll be working on things like promoting our blog and managing our social media channels, and I have some exciting ideas in store.<br>
Visit my drop-in office hours Tuesdays at 8pm CET (11am PT, 2pm EST) for a chat, or reach out to me directly via Slack or <a href="mailto:chris@identity.foundation">email</a>.<br>
I am always happy to hear your feedback and ideas for articles and initiatives!</p>

 Discussion about identity history, SIOP, WebAuthN, NFC support.
 
 history of the past 12 years in identity world
 
 OAuth1, Oauth2, Keybase etc. 
 
 
 "Different kind of trust, can anchor with more sources of identity." 
 With SIOP, you do self-generated and pairwise keys - ephemeral, not rooted to anything. 
 one of reasons I think that "Sign in with Google" is so attractive is that I expect their Google account to outlast my account - so I don't have to do recovery. 
 OIDF is interested in using VP as recovery scheme (e.g. drivers license).
 
 If shared during registration, becomes source of registration for recovery. 
 repairing a damaged trust relationship is very time-, cost- and labor-intensive for a company. Using VP can help reestablish the trust relationship, spares asking secret questions, extra data eg. Mom's name, pets etc.

<p>Having shown in our last piece how interoperability “profiles” are designed, we now tackle some key technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>In our <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets/">last essay</a>, we explored the means and ends of interoperability targets and roadmapping across stacks and markets. “Interoperability,” like “standardization,” can be a general-purpose tool or an umbrella of concepts, but rarely works from the top-down. Instead, specific use-cases, consortia, contexts, and industries have to take the lead and prototype something more humble and specific like an “interoperability profile” — over time, these propagate, get extended, get generalized, and congeal into a more universal and stable standard. Now, we’ll move on to some technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across&nbsp;stacks.</p><p>&gt; What makes sense to start aligning now? What are some sensible scopes for interoperating today, or yesterday, to get our fledgling market to maturity and stability as soon as safely possible?</p>Ponte Vecchio, Fiorenze, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/GHoX7zFRMMU">Ray Harrington</a> From testable goals to discrete&nbsp;scopes <p>The last few months have seen a shift in terminology and approach, as many groups turn their attention from broad “interoperability testing” to more focused “profiles” that test one subset of the optionalities and capabilities in a larger test suite or protocol definition. This decoupling of test suites from multiple profiles each suite can test helps any one profile from ossifying into a “universal” definition of decentralized identity’s core featureset.</p><p>As with any other emerging software field, every use case and context has its own interoperability priorities and constraints that narrow down the technological solution space into a manageable set of tradeoffs and decisions. For instance, end-user identification at various levels of assurance is often the most important implementation detail for, say, a retail bank, and DID-interoperability (which is not always the same thing!) might be a hardware manufacturer’s primary concern in being able to secure hardware supply&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Every industry has its unique set of minimum security guarantees, and VC-interoperability is obviously front-of-mind for credentialing use-cases. For example, in the medical data space, “Semantics” (data interpretation and metadata) might be a harder problem (or a more political one) than the mechanics of identity assurance, since high standards of end-user privacy and identity assurance have already made for a relatively interoperable starting points. Which exact subset of the many possible interoperability roadmaps is safest or most mission-critical for a given organization depends on many factors: the regulatory context, the culture of the relevant sectors, its incentive-structures, and its <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">business&nbsp;models</a>.</p><p>Cross-cutting industry verticals, however, are structural issues with how decentralized identity stacks and architecture vary, which can already been seen today. By applying “first principles,” (or in our case, the “<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">functions</a>” of a decentralized identity system and its many moving parts) across use-cases and industrial contexts, certain shared problems arise. As is our default approach in DIF Interop WG, we applied DIF’s in-house <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/interop-mapping-version-by-Hakan-Yildiz(TUB).pdf">mental model</a> of the “5 layers” of decentralized identity systems, sometimes called “the 4+1 layers”. (See also the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/raw/master/assets/crosscommunity-architecture-survey-oct-2020.pdf">more detailed version</a>).</p><p>We call these the “4+1” layers because our group agreed that a strict layering was not possible, and that all the architectures we compared for using verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers had to make major architectural decisions with consequences across all four of the more properly “layered” categories. This fifth category we named “transversal considerations,” since they traverse the layers and often come from architectural constraints imposed by regulation, industrial context, etc. Foremost among these are storage and authorization, the two most vexing and cross-cutting problems in software generally; these would justify an entirely separate&nbsp;article.</p><p>In a sense, none of the topics from this transversal category are good candidates for specification in the medium-term across verticals and communities — they are simply too big as problems, rarely specific to identity issues, and being addressed elsewhere. These include “storage” (subject of our newest <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working group</a>), “authorization” (debatably the core problem of all computer science!), “cryptographic primitives”, and “compliance.” (These last two are each the subject of a new working group, <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/crypto.html">Applied Cryptography</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallet Security</a>!). These interoperability scopes are quite difficult to tackle quickly, or without a strong standards background. Indeed, these kinds of foundational changes require <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">incremental advances</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">broad cooperation</a> with large community organizations. This is slow, foundation work that needs to connect parallel work across data governance, authentication/authorization, and storage in software more generally.</p><p>Similarly, the fourth layer, where ecosystem-, platform-, and industry-specific considerations constrain application design and business models, is unlikely to crystallize into a problem space calling out for a single specification or prototype in the medium-term future. Here, markets are splintered and it is unclear what can be repurposed or recycled outside of its original context. Even if there were cases where specification at this later would be timely, DIF members might well choose to discuss those kinds of governance issues at our sister-organizations in the space that more centrally address data governance at industry-, ecosystem-, or national- scale: <a href="http://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> was chartered to design large-scale governance processes, and older organizations like <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData.org</a> and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> also have working groups and publications on vertical-specific and jurisdiction-specific best practices for picking interoperable protocols and data&nbsp;formats.</p><p>That still leaves three “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is our contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community — and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all&nbsp;three.</p> Scope #1: Verifiable Credential Exchange <p>The most clear and consensus-building, even urgent way forward is to bring clarity to Verifiable Credential exchange across stacks. This has been the primary focus of our WG for the last year. Given that most of the early ecosystem-scale interest in SSI revolves around <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#vc-infrastructure-layer-3">credentialing</a> (educational credentials, employment credentials, health records), it is highly strategic to get translation and unified protocols into place soon for the interoperable verification and cross-issuance of credentials.</p><p>In fact, there has actually been a lot of good progress made since Daniel Hardman wrote an <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">essay</a> on the Evernym blog making a pragmatic case for sidestepping differences in architecture and approach to exchange VCs sooner. This aligned with much of our group’s work in recent months, which has included a <a href="https://hackmd.io/t1cotiReTXCnkpDG8k2tVA#THE-MAIN-EVENT">survey of VC formats</a> among organizations producing “wallets” for verifiable credentials (be they “edge” wallets or otherwise). Our group has also sought to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8j6niRuFWTjVMIXqmw3zX-4KkLt-sli8">assist educational efforts</a> at the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>, in the Claims and Credentials <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">working group</a>, and elsewhere to make wallet-producing organizations aware of the relevant <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/vc-spec-map">specifications</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/dif/be6763341a014d248f655aea187d7890?v=c9ac48a07f3d411c9a1bea32b55f7e76">other references</a> needed to make their wallets multi-format sooner and less painfully. Much of this work was crystalized into an <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">article</a> by co-chair Kaliya Young and crowd-edited by the whole group; this work was a major guiding structure for the Good Health Pass work that sought to make a common health record format (exported from FHIR systems) equally holdable and presentable across all of today’s VC&nbsp;systems.</p><p>One outgrowth of this effort and other alignments that have taken place since Hardman’s and Young’s article is the work of prototyping a multi-community exchange protocol that allow a subset of each stack’s capabilities and modes to interoperate. This tentative, “minimum viable profile” is called <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">WACI-PEx</a> and is currently a work item of the Claims and Credentials working group. Work is ongoing on v0.1, and an ambitious, more fully-featured v1 is planned for after that. This profile acts as an “extension” of the broader Presentation Exchange protocol, giving a handy “cheat sheet” for cross-stack wallet-to-issuer/verifier handshakes so that developers not familiar with all the stacks and protocols being spanned have a starting point for VC exchanges. Crucially, the results of this collaborative prototype will be taken as inputs to future versions of the DIDComm protocols and the WACI specification for Presentation Exchange.</p><p>Note: There has been some discussion of a OIDC-Presentation Exchange profile at some point in the future, but given that the alignment of DIDComm and Presentation Exchange started over a year ago, the most likely outcome is that work on this would not start until after v1 has been released of the “WACI-PEx” profile for DIDComm has been released.</p> Scope #2: Anchoring layer <p>Of course, other forms of alignment are possible as well in the “bottom 3” layers of the traditional stack, while we wait on the ambitious transversal alignment specifications and the ongoing work to align and simplify cross-format support for VCs (and perhaps even multi-format VCs, as Hardman points out in the essay&nbsp;above).</p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery</a> WG at DIF has long housed many work items to align on the lowest level of stack, including general-purpose <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-common-java">common libraries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">recovery mechanisms</a>. It has also received many donations that contribute to method-level alignment, including a recent <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/trinsic-donates-did-key-rs-to-i-d-wg-8a278f37bcd0?source=friends_link&amp;sk=dbd175f5db9107ed1e9d953a386441a4">DID-Key implementation</a> and a linked-data <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-document-loader">document loader</a> donated by Transmute. The group has also served as a friendly gathering point for discussing calls for input from the DID-core working group at W3C and for proposing W3C-CCG work&nbsp;items.</p><p>One particularly noteworthy initiative of the group has been the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540?source=friends_link&amp;sk=306a37f289dcf61a89d19cd11f5be04e">Universal Resolver</a> project, which offers a kind of “trusted middleware” approach to DID resolution across methods. This prototype of a general-use server allows any SSI system (or non-SSI system) to submit a DID and get back a trustworthy DID Document, without needing any knowledge of or access to (much less current knowledge of or authenticated access to) the “black box” of the participating DID methods. While this project only extends “passive interoperability” to DIDs, i.e., only allowing DID document querying, a more ambitious sister project, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, strives to bring a core set of CRUD capabilities to DID documents for DID methods willing to contribute drivers. Both projects have dedicated weekly calls on the DIF calendar, for people looking to submit drivers or get otherwise involved.</p> Scope #3: “Agent”/Infrastructure Layer <p>There is another layer, however, in between DIDs and VCs, about which we haven’t spoken yet: the crucial “agent layer” in the ToIP/Aries mental model, which encompasses trusted infrastructure whether in or outside of conventional clouds. The Aries Project has scaled up an impressively mature ecosystem of companies and experimenters, largely thanks to the robust infrastructure layer it built (and abstracting away from application-layer developers and experimenters).</p><p>Until now, differences of strategy with respect to conventional clouds and infrastructures have prevented large-scale cooperation and standardization at this layer outside of Aries and the DID-Comm project. Partly, this has been a natural outgrowth of the drastically different infrastructural needs and assumptions of non-human, enterprise, and consumer-facing/individual use cases, which differ more at this level than above or below. Partly, this is a function of the economics of our sector’s short history, largely influenced by the infrastructure strategies of cloud providers and telecommunication concerns.</p><p>This is starting to change, however, now that agent frameworks inspired by the precedent set by the Aries frameworks have come into maturity. Mattr’s <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/verifiable-credentials-with-auth0-and-mattr/">VIII Platform</a>, the Affinidi framework SDK (including open-source <a href="https://docs.affinidi.com/interop">components by</a> DIF members Bloom, Transmute, and Jolocom), ConsenSys’ own modular, highly <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/veramo_agent/plugins">extensible</a> and interoperable <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> platform, and most recently Spruce ID’s very <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">DID-method-agnostic</a> <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a>/<a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">Credible</a> SDK all offer open-source, extensible, and scalable infrastructure layers that are driving the space towards greater modularity and alignment at this&nbsp;layer.</p><p>As these platforms and “end-to-end stacks” evolve into frameworks extensible and capacious enough to house ecosystems, DIF expects alignment and harmonization to develop. This could mean standardization of specific components at this layer, for&nbsp;example:</p>  The DIDComm protocol could expand into new <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-looker-jwm-01.html">envelopes</a> and transports  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">Control recovery</a> mechanisms could be specified across implementations or even standardized on a technical and/or UX&nbsp;level  Auditing or historical-query requirements could be specified to form a cross-framework protocol or primitive  Common usages of foreign function interfaces, remote procedure calls like gRPC and JSON-RPC, or other forms of “glue” allowing elements to be reused or mixed and matched across languages and architectures could be specified as a community  <p>We are very much in early days, but some see on the horizon a day when frameworks that don’t cooperate with one another can’t compete with the ones that join forces. After all, adoption brings growing pains, particularly for the labor market — aligning on architectures and frameworks makes onboarding developers and transferring experience that much easier to&nbsp;do!</p> Next Steps <p>I would encourage anyone who has read this far to pick at least one of the three scopes mentioned above and ask themselves how they are helping along this alignment process in their day-to-day work, and if they truly understand what major players at that level are doing. Often large for-profit companies pay the most attention to what their competitors are doing, but here it is important to think outside of competition and look instead at non-profit organizations, regulators, and coalitions of various kinds to really see where the puck is heading. Sometimes consensus on one level is blocking compromise somewhere else. It can be pretty hard to&nbsp;follow!</p><p>In recent articles, DIF has encouraged its members to think about an open-source strategy as comparably important to a business plan, a living document and guiding philosophy. I would like to suggest that the subset of DIF companies working with VCs and DIDs should also think of interoperability strategy and conformance testing as the most crucial pillar of that strategy — if you cannot demonstrate interoperability, you might be asking people to take that strategy on&nbsp;faith!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/setting-interoperability-targets-part-2-of-2-671f8faa8ecb">Setting Interoperability Targets Part 2 of 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-nation/education/"></a>A keynote use case for the<a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/scottish-credential-ecosystem/"> Scottish Credential Ecosystem</a> that demonstrates the tremendous potential for this approach is Education, notably the awarding of academic credentials. 
<p>Innovations relevant to this use case include ‘<a href="https://www.learningmachine.com/badges-and-blockcerts/">Blockcerts</a>‘, an open source blockchain project for enabling a Universal Verifier that will verify any Blockcert issued by any institution, anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Via their Medium article UniversaBlockchain explore the scenario of <a href="https://medium.com/universablockchain/blockchain-in-education-49ad413b9e12">Blockchain in Education</a>.</p>
<p>They highlight keynote problems like the high rates of medical school diploma falsification as pain points a technology like Blockchain is ideal for tackling in some form, among a wave of other transformative benefits for the sector as it ripples through all workflow areas related to HR, resume checking, et al.</p>
<p>Athena<a href="https://blog.athenagt.com/blockchain-in-education-and-5-use-cases-to-observe/"> builds on this</a> some, notably detailing the core signature process that underpins the integrity of the record, as a comparison to traditional paper-based approaches:</p>
 
 Blockchain-enabled digital certificates are immutable and cannot be forged. 
 The records are stored on a distributed ledger, hence certificates can be only evaluated by anyone who has access to the blockchain. 
 Since the records are stored in a shared distributed ledger, the certificate can still be validated even if the organization that had issued it no longer exists. 
 The digital certificates stored in the ledger can only be destroyed if all the copies in every system are destroyed. 
 
<p>Countries like<a href="https://www.finder.com.au/good-clean-use-case-bahamian-students-graduate-on-the-blockchain"> the Bahamas</a> are now issuing Blockchain-based academic certificates.</p>
<p>Digitary is one vendor specializing in this sector, offering a<a href="https://www.digitary.net/products/"> suite of features</a> for managing academic credentials and digital badges, and has <a href="https://www.digitary.net/digitary-evernym-webinar/">teamed up with Evernym</a> to integrate these with Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.aruccnationalnetwork.ca/news">this news</a> highlights one of the first customers to harness this capability is the Association of the Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC),&nbsp; choosing Digitary as the solution provider for the Made for Canada National Network.</p>
<p>This initiative means the Canadian higher education community is creating the very first online platform and national credential wallet for post-secondary learners. Once fully operational, the Network will enable 3 million learners across the country to access and share their official digitized post-secondary transcripts and credentials online – anytime, anywhere.</p>
 Digital Badges – Foundation for Gamified Micro Learning 
<p>This capability would ideally go hand in hand with ‘Digital Badges’, which can also be authenticated via the Blockchain the same way. As <a href="https://www.hastac.org/initiatives/digital-badges">Hastac explains</a> :</p>
<p>“A digital badge is a validated indicator of accomplishment, skill, quality, or interest that can be earned in many learning environments. <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Open digital badging</a> makes it easy for anyone to issue, earn, and display badges across the web—through an infrastructure that uses shared and open technical technical standards.”</p>
<p><a href="http://openbadges.org">Open digital badging</a> makes it easy for anyone to issue, earn, and display badges across the web—through an infrastructure that uses shared and open technical technical standards. Organizations like <a href="https://credly.com/">Credly</a> facilitate their universality across industries.</p>
<p>A pertinent example of how this can be applied in the corporate world is this example of the <a href="https://www.badges.sssc.uk.com/getting-started/what-you-need-to-know-about-open-badges/">Scottish Social Services Council uses them</a> to underpin workforce learning. The BCS describes this as the <a href="https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/digital-badging-the-future-of-professional-development/">future of professional development</a>, with many organizations like <a href="https://new.siemens.com/uk/en/company/education/teachers/siemens-digital-badges.html">Siemens</a> using them this way.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>What if your CV was based on how many ‘<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/digitalbadges?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#digitalbadges</a>’ and skills you could list, rather than what degree you held?

<p>In the latest installment of the Lumen Researcher interview series, we spoke with Andrea Fuller, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal who specializes in data analysis. Prior to her work with the WSJ, Fuller was previously a data journalist for Gannett Digital, The Center for Public Integrity, and The Chronicle of Higher Education.</p><p>Fuller’s work combines data, spreadsheets, and code with investigative journalism and storytelling. Last May, Fuller wrote an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-dmca-copyright-claims-takedown-online-reputation-11589557001">article</a> for the Journal about her investigation into Google’s handling of DMCA takedowns. Using Lumen’s extensive database of copyright notices, Fuller exposed some of the shady copyright claims and abusive submitters that were flying under Google’s&nbsp;radar.</p><p>In this interview, Adam Holland, Project Manager at the Lumen Project, Anna Callahan and Gina Markov, Lumen’s 2021 summer interns, spoke with Fuller about her research and how the Lumen Database helped her develop her story about the bad actors in the world of DMCA takedowns.</p><p>Lumen: Could you give us a brief description of your&nbsp;bio?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: I’ve been at the Journal since 2014, so, seven years now. I’ve done tech stories, I’ve done a lot about nonprofit shenanigans, I’ve done a lot about education. So, I’m a little bit of a jack of all trades when it comes to subjects. But I mainly work on data projects at the Journal — I do spreadsheets, I do SQL, I do R, I write code, I call people and talk to them, and then I write stories. So, yeah, I do a little bit of everything.</p><p>Lumen: In 2020, you wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal about how Google approaches DMCA takedown requests. Could you give us some background about your process of researching and writing that&nbsp;piece?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: We started this article in late 2019 after it came out of some other Google reporting. We came across some of Lumen’s own blog posts and great work about the DMCA and we wanted to take this a step further. So we spent months and months downloading lots of DMCA requests from the Lumen database. We got the Lumen API key and started uploading the text of these requests and assembling our own database.</p><p>I set up a MongoDB database that we imported all these JSON files into, and we started collecting them incrementally. I actually wrote a bunch of code to turn it into a relational database so I could search them more easily. I was working in SQL. Google releases its own transparency report, which does not have all the detailed information of the text of these requests, but does say how many and which of the URLs were removed, so I was able to cross reference that.</p><p>I looked for any DMCA requests against major websites, whether they be major retail sites or news sites. It was interesting — there weren’t any successful DMCA requests from sites like The Wall Street Journal or The New York Times. What I started finding was more obscure, niche news sites — whether they be blogs or international news sites in foreign languages — [where] Google had complied with the take-down requests [it had received]. It became evident to me that Google was doing a really good job at filtering out bad takedown requests against major newspapers and major consumer sites, but not so much against more esoteric&nbsp;media.</p><p>Lumen: Do you have any speculation as to why that&nbsp;is?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: One of the things we say in our article is that the team at Google that’s in charge of DMCA is not very big. To actually manually review all of these requests is a near impossible task as the volume of DMCA requests has increased dramatically. And it’s really hard to make those judgment calls, because whether something is a real news site or not can be a really difficult determination. You get into broader philosophical discussions about the credibility of media in particular.</p><p>In one of the most compelling interviews that I had, I talked to this journalist in the Ukraine who was affiliated with an international reporting organization. He described these shady characters who will post fake copies of webpages on live journals and then file DMCA take-down requests to remove the original pages. It works, forcing them to file counterclaims, but there’s a gap before you can have it restored. So it’s a pretty effective strategy for getting content removed if you are an alleged Ukrainian gangster.</p><p>I also talked to one girl who was a blogger in Singapore, and she had a blog that was taken down through a DMCA request. She was writing letters to Google saying, “Why? I don’t understand. What did I do?” She didn’t do anything. She wrote about this Instagram influencer who was promoting a questionable sham cryptocurrency product. And that [product’s] organization created a blog post and filed a take-down request, claiming that it wrote the article first, which was laughable because it was clearly written in her voice, in her person. So, it’s really hard for people to fight these. They can definitely file counterclaims, but there is a delay in the process and then sometimes people don’t necessarily have the resources.</p><p>It’s a really tricky issue. It would take a lot of manpower to manually review all of these. Even though I was able to use queries to identify likely problematic ones, this took me a lot of time. Eventually, I sent Google about 100 things that I pretty much knew were wrong. And from that, because they have much more data than I do internally, they were able to restore something like 50,000 pages that they had taken down erroneously. And that’s just out of my one little slice of research.</p><p>Lumen: Did you see any trends in how fraudulent notices looked as you were going through&nbsp;them?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: You would see examples of things that claim to have happened earlier, but the date was something that couldn’t possibly match with the dates in the context of the piece. And it was clearly just made up. So, it was pretty self evident. I think there were a lot of really clever, yet nefarious, tactics. But once you look at some of these articles it was really blatantly obvious: We had these LiveJournals that had been hacked and were suddenly all in Russian or Ukrainian, and had all these articles about oligarchs.</p><p>In other cases, it was harder. Both of these sites in Ukrainian look kind of scammy, which is the real one and which isn’t? And it was really hard to assess that in some&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Lumen: What was the most shocking or unexpected thing that you found during your research?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: There were a couple things that I think surprised me, one being the hacking of LiveJournals. The idea that LiveJournals played such a big role was so bizarre to me. I actually, at one point, started searching for any take-down requests that were based on claiming that a LiveJournal had copyright, because that was a way I was identifying them. I think I was also pretty surprised by that story where the girl’s blog actually got taken down because it was a Google Blogger product, and that was pretty stunning to me. Not only was it not available in search, but it was just gone from the internet entirely and that was pretty troubling.</p><p>Lumen: What alternative approach do you think you would have been able to take had the notices not been available to you via Lumen? Do you think that approach would have been as effective?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: I think it would have been really difficult just going off the URLs — I don’t think this would have even been possible without the Lumen data. I don’t think we could have found such a large volume of stuff. Having the actual text of the complaint was what made this analysis possible and I can’t even really fathom how we could have done it simply based on the transparency report data. We could have probably found a few anecdotes, but I didn’t know what websites to search for because I don’t know the name of Ukrainian blogs, so I think it would have been really difficult without&nbsp;Lumen.</p><p>Lumen: Do you think there is any appetite for a follow-up piece about this&nbsp;stuff?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: Yes. My coworker, Rachel Levy, did a great story a couple months before mine about reputation management. This hedge fund manager had created fake websites to promote himself and manipulate Google search results. So, it’s certainly a really interesting area, and I think DMCA is a larger piece of that&nbsp;puzzle.</p><p>Lumen: As a data journalist who often covers issues pertaining tech and business, how important, in your opinion or experience, is transparency through notice&nbsp;sharing?</p><p>Andrea Fuller: As a journalist, we do our jobs based on this kind of transparency. If there had been no Google transparency report or Lumen database we wouldn’t have been able to do this. And so, you have to at least give Google credit for releasing that kind of data. And I think if there was more stuff like that out there in the tech world that would be really beneficial to researchers and journalists and people who can help with the accountability process. I think that the more transparent data we have, it makes stuff like that possible. And at the end of the day, it helps the public and consumers and it really helps the Ukrainian journalists. And that’s what we’re all here&nbsp;for.</p><p>[The quotes in this interview have been edited for clarity.]</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/lumen-researcher-interview-series-andrea-fuller-wall-street-journal-ec35d2800e3f">​Lumen Researcher Interview Series: Andrea Fuller, Wall Street Journal</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>In July 2021, the European Commission (EC) moved one step closer to a clampdown on illicit money flows; it published its long-awaited package of four legislative proposals intended to strengthen the EU’s rules on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).</p>
<p>Within the package, the EC officially recognized the value of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) as a unique mechanism capable of supporting transparency within any ecosystem, by formalizing it as an important component of future AML/CFT efforts. Two of the four EC proposals call for the LEI to be used in certain customer identification and verification scenarios where it is available: </p>
 
 New Regulation on AML/CFT: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing; 
 Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information accompanying transfers of funds and certain crypto-assets (recast). 
 
<p>Inclusion of the LEI within such far-reaching, EU-wide proposals for a future-proof AML/CFT regulatory  framework represents a huge leap forwards, in terms of realizing a key component of the G20 and Financial Stability Board’s vision to create the LEI as a public good. Any role played by the LEI in helping to protect EU citizens from the impact of terrorism and organized crime can be deemed of significant societal benefit. </p>
<p>A brief analysis of why the EC is championing the LEI within the AML/CFT context highlights that there are many benefits. Use of the LEI consistently for entity identification at the Member State level and the EU level can diminish the margins-of-error related to language ambiguity, human interpretation, and manual intervention. The LEI’s broad interoperability enables it to be integrated seamlessly into both centralized and decentralized digital identity management systems, together with the eIDAS-compliant digital certificates that are already harmonizing the use of e-signature technologies across the EU.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the new EC proposals are intended to create a much more consistent framework to ease compliance for operators subject to AML/CFT rules, especially for those active cross-border. Here too, and given the cross-border nature of money laundering and terrorism financing, the LEI can be used as the ‘Rosetta Stone’ for legal entities involved in financial transactions. Overseen by the <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/about/index.htm">Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC)</a>, the Global LEI System is the only system that establishes a recognized, monitored and standardized global identity for legal entities, linked to the entity’s national ID system. Its universality across borders, combined with open and online access to annually verified business card information linked to each LEI, makes it uniquely placed to enable efficient information exchange between the ‘obliged parties’ defined in the AML/CFT proposal and all competent authorities.   </p>
<p>And while this is the first time the LEI has been officially endorsed by the EC in its AML/CFT framework, the LEI has a long track record as a powerful tool in assisting the efforts of financial institutions to combat money laundering and terrorist funding. The LEI enables financial institutions to conduct fully automated, straight-through processing; by replacing outdated manual checks, the LEI increases both the speed and the effectiveness of client onboarding and ongoing compliance checks. This includes improving screening against sanctions and watch lists thereby enabling new efficiencies for both institution and client, lowering costs significantly. </p>
<p>The latest recommendation from the EC that the LEI is used, where available, for customer identification and verification in AML/CTF legislative reforms, has the potential to drastically increase the transparency of legal entities participating in financial transactions. Recent AML scandals have shown that financial criminals mostly operate through a network across borders to conceal their illicit transactions. The LEI, a global standard for unique legal entity identification, can make these connections and transactions across borders visible and easy-to-interpret to the financial institutions and Financial Intelligence Units. It can therefore contribute to the stronger authentication of entity clients, promote transparency and reduce illicit transactions.</p>
<p>By including the LEI in its AML/CFT legislative package, the EC strengthens efforts across Europe to use and reinforce global standards in the promotion of transparency and financial stability. The European Central Bank (ECB) recently recognized the benefits of extending LEI use to cover all future public reporting and financial transactions. As a result, the European Systemic Risk Board has recommended the establishment of an EU legislative framework for systemic and comprehensive adoption of LEIs across the EU by any organization involved in a financial transaction and to identify entities reporting financial information.</p>
<p>In context of the AML/CFT proposals, for those ‘obliged entities’ that want to surpass transparency goals, becoming a Validation Agent offers a vast array of business benefits. The Validation Agent role was created by GLEIF within the Global LEI System to simplify LEI issuance for clients and to deliver a variety of cost, efficiency and customer experience benefits for the Validation Agents organizations themselves. More information on the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agent role can be found on the GLEIF website</a>.   </p>
<p>How has the LEI Been Referenced Within the EC’s AML/CFT Legislative Package? </p>
<p>AML / CFT Regulation <br>
As defined in Article 1, this proposal lays down rules concerning: </p>
 
 Measures to be applied by obliged entities to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing;  
 Beneficial ownership transparency requirements for legal entities and arrangements;  
 Measures to limit the misues of bearer instruments.  
 
<p>Obliged entities are defined fully in Article 3 of the proposal, but include (with certain exceptions): credit institutions; financial institutions; and various natural and legal persons acting in a professional capacity, ranging from auditors, accountants and tax advisors to legal representatives involved in certain types of transactions, including property, precious metals and stones, gambling services, crypto-asset service providers and crowdfunding service providers. </p>
<p>Reference to the LEI is made in Article 18, which is titled ‘Identification and Verification of the Customer’s Identity’. The text makes clear that where available, an LEI should be obtained by obliged entities, in order to identify a legal entity customer. </p>
<p>Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds<br>
In a press release announcing the legislative package, the EC makes it clear that primary drivers for enhancements to the existing EU AML/CFT framework are “new and emerging challenges linked to technical innovation.” It names virtual currencies, more integrated financial flows in the Single Market and the global nature of terrorist organisations among these challenges. </p>
<p>The key focus of this Revision of the 2015 Regulation on Transfer of Funds ensures that EU AML/ CFT rules are extended beyond their current remit, to fully apply to the crypto sector. This will ensure full traceability of crypto-asset transfers and allow the prevention and detection of their potential use for money laundering or terrorism financing. </p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the LEI has been referenced twice within the package of legislatory proposals. </p>
 
 In section (25), which outlines that transfers of funds or crypto-assets from the Union to outside the Union should carry complete information on the payer and payee, a new requirement has been introduced: “Complete information on the payer and the payee should include the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) when this information is provided by the payer to the payer’s service provider, since that would allow for better identification of the parties involved in a transfer of funds and could easily be included in existing payment message formats such as the one developed by the International Organisation for Standardisation for electronic data interchange between financial institutions.”  
 In a later section that outlines the obligations on the payment service provider of the payer, Article 4 of the Revision proposal sets out the requirements for information that must accompany transfers of funds. In the latest revision, a new requirement for the payer’s current LEI has been added, “subject to the existence of the necessary field in the relevant payments message format, and where provided by the payer to the payer’s payment service provider….”.

 With an initial pilot complete, we look ahead to what’s next for one of the world’s largest renewable energy&nbsp;markets <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/guy5aS3GvgA">ActionVance</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/guy5aS3GvgA">Unsplash</a><p>In the world of power grids, PJM Interconnection is a household name. It is a regional transmission operator (RTO) whose service territory spans a 13-state region in the Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes, and Northeast region of the United States. It’s not huge by land area: as measured in square miles, all of PJM’s service territory could fit within the borders of France. But it is a massive electricity and renewable energy&nbsp;market.</p><p>PJM was the world’s largest competitive wholesale electricity market until the development of the European Integrated Energy Market in the 2000s. And it remains one of the world’s largest grid operators as a founding member of the GO15. On the renewable energy front, in 2020 PJM generated more renewable energy certificates (RECs) than the whole of Australia.</p><p>And so when we, Energy Web, kicked off a collaboration with <a href="https://www.pjm-eis.com/">PJM Environmental Information Services, Inc. </a>(PJM-EIS) — a subsidiary of PJM Interconnection — in late 2018, we were excited. That’s because PJM-EIS administers the Generation Attribute Tracking System (GATS), a platform for tracking and trading RECs in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>The focus of the collaboration was to build a blockchain-based pilot alongside PJM’s existing GATS system. Together, PJM-EIS and Energy Web wanted to explore the potential for bringing new functionality and benefits to GATS and evaluate how blockchain technology could be integrated into existing IT systems seamlessly and create value for PJM stakeholders.</p><p>Evaluating opportunities to modernize an existing U.S. REC&nbsp;platform</p><p>We set out to leverage the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS), an open-source tech stack of decentralized software and standards for the energy sector. More specifically, the pilot used <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a>, an open-source software development toolkit (SDK) for REC (and similar) tracking and trading platforms running on the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Energy Web Chain</a>, to create new functionality for the GATS Bulletin Board and assess the potential for decentralized technologies to support wider improvements to GATS beyond the Bulletin&nbsp;Board.</p><p>The Bulletin Board is a place on GATS where REC buyers and sellers can, respectively, post their bids and asks for specific REC volumes. Actually selling or buying those RECs remains the responsibility of the counterparties in bilateral agreements. We thought a blockchain-based solution could improve that experience and increase use of the Bulletin&nbsp;Board.</p><p>Historically, the Bulletin Board has been an underutilized feature available on GATS to facilitate trading of voluntary RECs. The central aim for this pilot was to test new functionality that could enhance the Bulletin Board as a means to grow the REC market in the PJM footprint while also improving security, increasing transparency, and reducing transaction costs for PJM stakeholders. In other words, this pilot assessed how improving the technical functionality and user experience of the Bulletin Board could remove market barriers and grow the local REC market — and possibly even attract greater REC imports from other U.S. REC&nbsp;markets.</p><p>The result: a pilot for the PJM-EIS version of GATS Bulletin Board with blockchain-based REC marketplace functionality that integrated with the existing&nbsp;GATS</p><p>This spring, five PJM subscribers tested the pilot GATS Bulletin Board. Seller participants posted asks on the Bulletin Board based on actual RECs in their respective GATS accounts and buyer participants posted their REC bids based on their procurement needs. Any matches made between bids and asks then triggered notifications for participants to confirm if they wanted to complete any REC transfers, where any completed trades would link back to the legacy GATS to update the buyer and seller’s respective accounts. For this pilot, the transactions were purely test transactions and so there was no financial settlement.</p><p>Here are some screenshots from the pilot GATS Bulletin Board to give a flavor of the updated user experience (shown from the perspective of a renewable energy&nbsp;buyer):</p>  Getting a view of the overall Bulletin Board market&nbsp;activity  <p>2. Starting the renewable energy procurement journey with various search filters to place&nbsp;bids</p><p>3. Identifying verified procurement options that match with&nbsp;bids</p><p>4. Viewing completed transactions and blockchain-based proof of each transaction</p><p>“We have learned a lot about what it would take to add new technical functionalities to GATS, how to integrate blockchain-based technologies ‘under the hood’ of GATS, and how PJM stakeholders support these improvements,” said Ken Schuyler, President of PJM-EIS. “We look forward to further understanding how we can use EW-DOS to support our overall digitization efforts.”</p><p>Energy Web Origin provided the back-end infrastructure for the marketplace functionality and use of a public blockchain — the Energy Web Chain — to digitize the RECs in GATS and anchor the proof of any REC transactions that occurred on the pilot Bulletin Board&nbsp;system.</p><p>Pilot feedback and next&nbsp;steps</p><p>In post-pilot interviews, pilot participants shared overall positive feedback about their experience, especially around the level of integration with GATS, and shared how they could successfully post bids and asks for RECs from their GATS accounts.</p><p>In the end, given how energy sector market participants typically adopt new technologies in phases (rather than in one fell swoop), this pilot illustrates that it is possible to integrate blockchain-based functionalities into existing IT systems to support wider digitization and tech modernization efforts.</p><p>Nevertheless, PJM-EIS and Energy Web experienced practical implementation challenges with the pilot. The core challenge revolved around how — while it’s possible to integrate new, blockchain-based tech with legacy IT systems — this integration process takes more time than designing and implementing an entirely new IT system from scratch. This is the main reason why the pilot took more time than initially expected to implement.</p><p>The pilot also raised bigger strategic questions that PJM-EIS will continue to evaluate as it explores next steps for technical upgrades to GATS in general and the Bulletin Board in particular. For example, this pilot showed that it is technically possible to integrate new technologies on a legacy system, but cannot answer the central question as to whether or not PJM-EIS wants to make the Bulletin Board an exchange where real REC purchases (and associated financial transactions) happen. In addition, the pilot did not assess the role of using new decentralized identifier technologies that make it possible to assign every energy device a unique digital identity anchored on a public blockchain so that a given device can plug into different PJM&nbsp;markets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/pjm-eis-update-modernizing-a-legacy-u-s-rec-tracking-system-with-blockchain-based-technology-db0ad5a4f924">PJM-EIS UPDATE: Modernizing a legacy U.S. REC tracking system with blockchain-based technology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Digital Content Assistant de <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com">Cuatroochenta</a></p><p>Alastria ID es uno de los modelos referentes de identidad digital soberana en el que han colaborado empresas como Cuatroochenta a través de la firma 4TIC, a la que adquirió en 2020. El proyecto quiere que la ciudadanía y las empresas sean propietarias de sus datos personales y que tengan el control con todas las garantías de seguridad que aporta la tecnología blockchain.</p>Sistema de funcionamiento basado en la Identidad Digital Soberana. Foto: Cuatroochenta<p>Un negocio que quiera tener una cuenta corriente en una entidad bancaria ha de facilitar a la sucursal una copia del DNI del representante legal. Si la firma tiene cuentas en otras entidades, debe ofrecer esa copia a cada uno, redoblando trámites y riesgos de seguridad, ya que esa documentación se expone muchas más veces a un posible robo de información… Esto es lo que pasa hoy en día, pero imaginemos un escenario totalmente diferente. Un escenario en el que una empresa no tiene que ofrecer ningún documento físico ni electrónico, sino que simplemente permite al banco acceder a su número de DNI, a través de su cartera digital, es decir, su wallet. Este sistema serviría también, por ejemplo, para hacer los trámites para ser proveedor de un negocio o para licitaciones en administraciones públicas. Estamos hablando de la <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/blockchain-como-garantia-de-confianza-en-los-negocios/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">identidad digital soberana</a>, conocida por sus términos en inglés como self sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI).</p><p>La Comisión Europea ha presentado recientemente la identidad digital europea, sustentada en la SSI y en la <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/blockchain-como-garantia-de-confianza-en-los-negocios/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">tecnología blockchain</a>, que permite distribuir en una red el control de la información y validarla sin intermediarios.</p><p>Con este sistema, la ciudadanía y los negocios pasan a ser los propietarios de la identidad digital y, por tanto, de las credenciales que la conforman. Y ¿qué se entiende por credencial? Cualquier dato que identifica a una persona o empresa. Puede ser, por ejemplo, el número de DNI o NIF, el carnet de conducir, un título universitario o una aptitud profesional. Imaginemos el supuesto de una persona que debe acreditar que es mayor de edad. Con este sistema no es necesario que aporte el DNI con todos los datos personales que recoge, sino una <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">credencial verificable (VC)</a> en que una administración confirma esa mayoría de edad preservando la privacidad de los&nbsp;datos.</p><p>Es un giro y un cambio de paradigma hacia un <a href="https://elpais.com/retina/2017/06/05/tendencias/1496646930_763686.html">modelo descentralizado</a>. La Unión Europea con su <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_es">proyecto de identidad digital</a> quiere evitar que las personas cedamos y regalemos sin darnos cuenta datos a las grandes tecnológicas. En los últimos años se han implementado en toda Europa diversas iniciativas con la vista puesta en los usos de la SSI. En España uno de estos proyectos es el que ha desarrollado el consorcio multidisciplinar <a href="https://alastria.io/">Alastria</a>, del que es socio Cuatroochenta de forma colaborativa entre más de 200 miembros <a href="https://alastria.io/id-alastria/">Alastria ID</a>, un modelo técnico de identidad digital basado en los estándares internacionales y que quiere aprovechar las <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/tendencias-tecnologicas-que-marcaran-2021/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">capacidades de blockchain</a> y de la&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>Si quieres conocer cómo se construye la identidad digital, los beneficios de la SSI y las características del modelo Alastria ID puedes leer el <a href="https://cuatroochenta.com/los-cimientos-de-la-identidad-digital-sobre-blockchain/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=art%C3%ADculo+Medium+Alastria&amp;utm_campaign=Art%C3%ADculo+blog+Medium+Alastria">artículo completo</a>.</p>

 Some Overviews 

<p>Blockchain Commons is getting big, so we produced some overviews of our work!</p>

<p>Video Overview. Over the last few years, Blockchain Commons has produced a number of specifications, including our fundamental work on Uniform Resources (URs), our other innovations such as Lifehashes and Object Identity Blocks, and our updates of sharding technology with SSKR. If you’re trying to get a handle on the technologies we’re using and the specifications that we’re creating with our Airgapped community, we invite you to take a look at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a>, which runs through our core conceptual and specification work one element at a time.</p>



  
<p><br></p>

<p>The Gordian Principles. We’ve also begun publishing some descriptions of what the Gordian architecture means to us. It’s focused on four principals that we believe are crucial to digital-asset management: independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. They’re all about ensuring that you’re the controller of your digital assets. Besides writing a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">short overview</a>, we’ve also begun adding descriptions to each of our reference apps, discussing how they embody those principles.</p>

<p>And, those reference apps were our biggest news for the quarter …</p>

 Reference App Work 

<p>Our reference apps show off how Blockchain Commons’ Gordian Principles work in real life. We made great progress on them this quarter.</p>

<p>Gordian Releases. Where we had three reference apps available for beta testing in Q1, in Q2 we advanced to having two available for release from Apple.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool is the app previously known as Gordian Guardian.
It allows for the management of your cryptographic seeds in a way that’s secure and resilient. You store your seeds in Seed Tool, ensuring that the data is encrypted and that it’s redundantly backed up to iCloud, and then you derive and export keys as they’re needed. As with all of the Gordian reference apps, this one demonstrates the usage of a number of Blockchain Common’s specifications, including SSKRs, UR, and even our new <code>request/response</code> airgap methodology that we just <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">debuted</a> this February.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
Gordian QR Tool is a simpler tool that similarly allows for the storage of QR codes in a secure and resilient way. Thus, if you had a largely unused seed or key, you could export it as a QR and store it here. QR Tool can also be used to store other private information such as 2FA seeds or the brand-new Smart Health Cards. QR Tool recognizes many categories of QR codes, including the UR types that Blockchain Commons has defined, allowing easy categorization and sorting of your cryptographic data. Our QR Tool was slightly held back by inadequacies we found in Apple’s QR creation functions, which can produce overly large QRs. We’ve already begun work <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/QRCodeGenerator">translating a better QR library into Swift</a> and expect to integrate that into v1.1 of QR Tool in the future.</p>

<p>QR Tool and Seed Tool also offer the first demonstration of the interactions possible in a Gordian architecture. One of the most powerful examples involves Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">SSKR specification</a>. Seed Tools allows a user to not only shard a seed using SSKR, but also to encode those shares as QR codes. The encoded shares can then be given to friends and family who have QR Tool, ensuring the safe storage of all the shares required to restore your seed!</p>

<p>We have more reference app releases planned for the future. Gordian Cosigner remains available as a Testflight beta release, and is our reference app for demonstrating how to conduct airgapped signing. We are also beginning work on the Gordian Recovery app, which we announced last quarter; it’ll demonstrate methodologies for recovering assets held by third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Sweeptool Debut. Recovering funds held in a third-party HD wallet can be tricky since you don’t always know which addresses were actually used. We’ve also been attacking that problem with a command-line tool called <code>sweeptool</code>, which sweeps funds anywhere in the hierarchy defined by a descriptor. Sweeptool is the work of one of our intern graduates, and is already available as an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/sweeptool-cli">alpha release</a>.</p>

<p>Timelock Experiments. Our current architecture for #SmartCustody depends on multisigs to allow for the partitioning of keys and the creation of resilience. However, we’re already thinking about the next generation of #SmartCustody, which will allow the use of timelocks to recover funds in the case of the incapacitation of a principal. We did some deeper investigation into miniscript this quarter, which allows for easier integration of timelocks into Bitcoin addresses, and also mapped out some new architectures for progressively sweeping funds forward to keep ahead of timelocks. However, we discovered that at this point miniscript isn’t yet integrated with the descriptor-wallets that are another of the core elements of the Gordian architecture. This prevents integration with our Gordian apps.</p>

<p>We’ve published a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">preliminary paper</a> on the usage of Timelocks, but it isn’t finalized yet because of these issues. Meanwhile, one of our interns has begun work on a Rust-based Timelock project called <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli</a>. This work is all meant to ensure we’re ready when miniscript is added to Bitcoin Core, or when timelocks are integrated into descriptors in some other manner.</p>

 Coding Processes 

<p>Releasing apps is just one step of a larger coding process, which requires careful consideration of what languages (and libraries) to use and careful reviewing of their security.</p>

<p>Rust Focus. Sweeptool is written in Rust, which is an increasing focus at Blockchain Commons. We’ve also been using it for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign-cli work</a> and some of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap">torgap work</a> and have touched upon it in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/18_5_Accessing_Bitcoind_with_Rust.md">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a>. We think that Rust is an important language for the future of Bitcoin development in large part because of its safety guarantee, including <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/">memory safety properties, which can resolve 70% of security problems</a>. Our main barrier for wider use of Rust has been the fact that C and C++ are the main languages used by Bitcoin Core, iOS, and Android, but we’ve already seen the start of changes there, and hope to be able to integrate Rust even more fully in the future. The fact that the Rust-based <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/">Bitcoin Dev Kit</a> is actually in advance of Bitcoin Core in some features is very encouraging.</p>

<p>Security Review. Bitmark, one of our Sustaining Sponsors, has hired <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> to conduct a security review of our SSKR libraries, <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a>. This is crucial element in making Blockchain Commons’ specification work widely available, since it would be improper for us to review our own security code. As our first partners planning to use one of our libraries in a shipping project, as opposed to just our specifications, Bitmark is stepping up to the plate to fund the review of our core SSKR libraries. We expect this pattern to repeat with future partners and libraries in the future. It shows the power of our open libraries: future companies will be able to depend on our SSKR libraries thanks to Bitmark’s contribution, and then they’ll be able to make contributions of their own that will be much less than if they’d had to security review an entire suite of themselves.</p>

 New Docs 

<p>The blockchain infrastructure is empowered by users and developers who know how to use it properly. Teaching them is the goal of our documentation projects.</p>

<p>UR &amp; SSKR Docs. The ultimate purpose of our reference applications is to demonstrate how our new specifications can be used in actual applications. Hand-in-hand with that, we’re also producing documentation that lays out in more detail how those specifications work. We’ve begun collecting many of those docs in the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/tree/master/Docs">documents area of our crypto-commons repo</a>. This quarter we added to our docs repo with several documents about our Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction system, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-users.md">SSKR for Users</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-developers.md">SSKR for Developers</a>. We also released a series of articles on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources (URs)</a> intended to show developers how they’re constructed and used.</p>

<p>We are also planning further support for our interoperable specifications such as UR and SSKR at a virtual interoperable wallet specification workshop. We’re currently working on locking down a date.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our best-known tutorial at Blockchain Commons, is our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a>, which we pushed to v2.0 last year and which has 1,700 stars and 100 watchers on Github. We’re thrilled that translations are now ongoing into both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a> thanks to a half-dozen core volunteers. Some of Blockchain Commons’ own programmers and interns entered the blockchain industry thanks to this course, so we’re looking forward to these translations opening the doors even wider.</p>

 Other Priorities 

<p>Finally, we have a lot of more varied projects that all saw some progress.</p>

<p>Our Summer Interns Have Begun Work. Thanks to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/human-rights-foundation-grants-bitcoin-defi-education-activism">a grant from the Human Rights Foundation</a>, we have a class of a dozen interns this summer. We’re engaging them with weekly calls to introduce them to crucial use cases and to let them talk with Bitcoin and Lightning experts from the industry and human-rights experts, most recently including John Callas from the EFF and Alex Gladstein from HRF.</p>

<p>Some of our human-rights-focused intern projects include a self-sovereign donation app, scripts to automate the setup of privacy and/or bitcoin services, documents on managing pseudonymity, and tracking of blockchain-based legislation.</p>

<p>Some of our more general intern projects include deployment of a full Esplora node for Blockchain Commons, the creation of scripts to make it easier for others to do so, documentation on bitcoin fee-estimation use cases, improvements to our Spotbit server including expansion of the Spotbit API and client app, and the aformentioned work on Mori and on Learning Bitcoin translations.</p>

<p>Our first completed intern ‘21 work is a short <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/15_0_Using_i2p.md">i2p chapter</a> for Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line, talking about an alternative (or supplement) to traditional Tor privacy.</p>

<p>Wyoming Testimony. Christopher’s testimony has continued in Wyoming, talking about DAO and identity, to improve and extend both laws. The most recent testimony <a href="https://youtu.be/ayQ086BVDXE?t=4060">on May 28</a> continued to work through the ramifications of the definitions of principal authority for self-sovereign identity.</p>




<p><br></p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity. Speaking of which, it was the fifth anniversary of the concept of self-sovereign identity, which first suggested that we should control our identities on the internet, not be beholden to centralized agencies. Christopher <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">wrote an article</a> for Coindesk celebrating that anniversary, talking about how far we’ve come and reflecting on how things could be improved.</p>

<p>BTCR. Finally, we’ve also been talking about another of our blockchain projects that originated in <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>: BTCR, a self-sovereign decentralized identifier that uses the Bitcoin blockchain. Recently Christopher and the other creators of BTCR talked with <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids">The Rubric</a> about the past and future of the DID.</p>

<p>As you can see, we’ve got lots of ongoing work that continue to expand the ideas of responsible key management and self-determination on the internet. If you’d like to support our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can continue to design new specifications, architectures, reference applications, and reference libraries to be used by the whole community, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a>.

 Five Years of Assembly: Interdisciplinary fellowship offers paths forward in public interest technology <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/zenzele-best">Zenzele&nbsp;Best</a></p>Assembly Program logo, Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;&nbsp;Society<p>Between 2017 and 2021, the <a href="http://bkmla.org/">Assembly</a> Program at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> (BKC) at Harvard University brought together almost 150 professionals, experts, and students to better understand and develop solutions to some of the most intractable issues in technology policy. Led by Professor <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a> and supported by faculty, staff, and experts from across the University and the Center, the program explored topics in digital security, artificial intelligence (AI), and disinformation; produced a variety of prototypes and projects; and fostered a community that spanned across sectors and disciplines.</p><p>“Being academic isn’t, at its core, about credentials or paper-writing for its own sake,” said Zittrain. “It’s about approaching problems with humility, energy, and an open mind, attacking those problems rigorously, and reviewing whether one is even asking the right questions. Assembly was begun on the theory that people outside academia, from across disciplines and sectors, would be eager to take on problems that way, and with the overall public interest in mind, rather than the interests of one player in a larger ecosystem. We found an extraordinary number of people willing to engage in that&nbsp;spirit.”</p><p>Over five years, Assembly grew from a pilot project that brought together professionals from across sectors to a multi-pronged, interdisciplinary fellowship program that developed innovative approaches and cross-sectoral collaborations focused on the public interest. In 2019, Assembly expanded to include two additional tracks, the <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/forum-about">Forum</a> and <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/studentfellowship-2021about">Student Fellowship</a>, which convened senior leaders and Harvard students, respectively, to discuss the spread of disinformation on online platforms. In 2021 — the program’s fifth and final year — the Assembly Fellowship invited ongoing alumni project teams to return (virtually) to BKC to support their work and celebrate their continued success.</p><p>“Our initial goal with Assembly was to combine the real-world expertise of people in industry with the socially-motivated nature of academia,” said <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jordi-weinstock">Jordi Weinstock</a>, one of the founders of the Assembly Program. “From day one of the pilot year, we had no idea whether any of the projects would develop beyond a nascent stage, or even if that was a necessity. Instead, we worked to create a lasting community within the cohort, one that would continue to bring positive change for the world long after their program ended. Through the years, both the thematic focus and the people involved would change, but consistent throughout has been the strength of the Assembly community. To me, it is both a bonus and a testament to our Assemblers and staff that many projects did, in fact, flourish.”</p> Over twenty prototypes explore solutions to complex tech policy questions <p>How can we build AI systems to serve the public interest and not perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities? How can we improve security vulnerabilities among “<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot">Internet of Things</a>” (IoT) devices? Who should be held accountable for the spread of disinformation on social media platforms? How do we govern cyberspace across international borders?</p><p>Five years of Assembly projects have sought to make progress on complex, whole-of-society questions like these. Created as a model to help solve some of society’s most pressing issues around technologies, the program brought together a community of professionals from around the world to leverage their expertise across disciplines and actively collaborate on provocations and prototypes in the public interest.</p><p>Incoming fellowship cohorts convened at Harvard to meet each other, identify problem spaces and form project teams, and participate in programming in-residence before working asynchronously on their projects for the remainder of the four-month development period. Each cohort was supported by an expert Advisory Board of faculty and practitioners with expertise across the range of topics fellows explored. Between 2017 and 2020, four Assembly Fellowship cohorts developed twenty-one projects that aim to offer paths forward on complex challenges in the digital public sphere. As <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/hilary-ross">Hilary Ross</a>, Assembly’s program manager, put it, “Assembly created a space for people from across disciplines to come together around complex technology and policy problems, problems that at times feel intractable and really require effort from across all sectors. Through programming and projects, fellows got to both better understand those problems from varied perspectives, and collectively find paths forward and demonstrate possibilities.”</p> 2017 <p>Assembly’s pilot year in 2017 focused on the challenge of digital security and sought to answer a central question: how do we move beyond a world where virtually every computing device and network is insecure? Over four months, the sixteen professionals that comprised the <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2017people">cohort</a> explored the complex interaction between Internet governance organizations and sovereign states, the tension between the ease of disseminating information online and the interest of copyright holders, privacy advocates, and other stakeholders, and the roles of intermediaries and platforms in shaping what people can and cannot do online. The first year of Assembly produced five <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2017projects">projects</a> aimed at addressing these challenges, including: <a href="https://cleaninsights.org/">Clean Insights</a>, a privacy-oriented analytics tool and <a href="https://berkmancenter.github.io/datatransparency/">Information Fiduciaries and Data Transparency</a>, a prototype of a visualization tool that would enable companies to better document their collection and use of consumer&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“[Assembly] provided an opportunity for participants to pop out of their usual bubbles of collaborators, to connect with committed thinkers, scholars, experts, advocates and hackers from a diverse set of contexts and experiences. Whether participating on a project or reviewing the teams’ work as [an advisor], I benefited deeply from the exposure to smart people, working collectively, to find novel approaches to difficult challenges.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nfreitas">Nathan Freitas</a>, 2017 and 2021 Assembly Fellow, 2020 Assembly&nbsp;Advisor</blockquote> 2018–2019 <p>The <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2018about">2018</a> and <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2019about">2019</a> Assembly cohorts focused on the ethics and governance of artificial intelligence. AI technology has become increasingly sophisticated over the past decade, driving innovations in industries from <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/373927">healthcare</a> to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-next-car-may-anticipate-your-needsand-let-you-add-features-on-the-fly-11625684411">travel</a> to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2020/05/18/10-ways-ai-is-improving-manufacturing-in-2020/?sh=10729b5f1e85">manufacturing</a> and becoming a feature in many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/12/16/the-10-best-examples-of-how-ai-is-already-used-in-our-everyday-life/?sh=35a9e66a1171">homes</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-smartphones-artificial-intelligence-features-phones-2018-1">smartphones</a>, and <a href="https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/backgrounders/ai-and-personal-vehicles">vehicles</a>. However, as AI becomes even more ubiquitous, these advances have raised new questions: how do we prevent, detect, and mitigate bias in AI systems? What factors should municipal governments consider before deciding whether to implement AI technology in a city space? What are the risks of pursuing surveillance-related AI work, and how do we mitigate them? Between 2018 and 2019, the Assembly Fellowship developed ten frameworks, tools, and other projects aimed at addressing these challenges, including <a href="https://aiblindspot.media.mit.edu/">AI Blindspot</a>, a framework for identifying and mitigating bias in AI systems and the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a>, a tool that improves the accuracy and fairness of algorithms by helping practitioners better assess datasets.</p><blockquote>“The [Assembly Fellowship]…gave me an opportunity to experiment: I wore many hats, performed many roles, and ultimately learned more about myself and what I am good at and what I want to do. In a world that pushes us to excel rather than to explore, I really appreciated the space to try things I never thought I’d do — from writing a TV pilot to building interactive data visualizations to reading hundreds of military RFPs — and being given the support to try.” — <a href="https://bcavello.com/">B Cavello</a>, 2019 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</blockquote> 2020 <p>In 2019, BKC launched Assembly: Disinformation, which built on the success of both the previous three iterations of the Assembly Fellowship and other programs at the Center. The 2016 United States general election vaulted online disinformation — and its real world ramifications — into the national discourse. In the aftermath of the election, the program sought to make progress on important questions about the United States’ vulnerability for foreign influence operations, the importance of digital literacy, and the role of social media companies in disseminating and amplifying false information. The 2020 <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2020">cohort</a> developed <a href="https://www.berkmankleinassembly.org/fellowship-2020projects">projects</a> that included <a href="https://medium.com/@Assembly_Program/semaphore-a-tool-to-flag-online-disinformation-3a71f522eae0">Semaphore</a>, a prototype of a tool to help users publicly flag false information on platforms, <a href="https://datavoids.2020.bkmla.org/#Part1">Into the Voids</a>, a framework for evaluating <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/">data voids</a> and the harms they pose, and <a href="https://disinfodex.org/">Disinfodex</a>, a database that indexes publicly available information about disinformation campaigns.</p><blockquote>“Outside of academia, it is so rare to be able to explore a complicated societal challenge like disinformation in a completely unconstrained way, and even rarer to actually produce a final project addressing that issue. The long-lasting relationships formed with my teammates and cohort from working on these projects will be something I take away long after the conclusion of Assembly.” — <a href="http://jennyfan.com/about">Jenny Fan</a>, 2020 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</blockquote> 2021 <p>In its capstone year in 2021, Assembly invited back five independently continuing alumni projects: <a href="https://aiblindspot.media.mit.edu/">AI Blindspot</a>, <a href="https://cleaninsights.org/">Clean Insights</a>, the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a>, <a href="https://disinfodex.org/">Disinfodex</a>, and <a href="http://cloakpixel.com/">Cloak &amp; Pixel</a> (an evolution of the <a href="https://equalais.media.mit.edu/">equalAIs</a> project, developed by Assembly fellows in 2018). The projects address the variety of challenges that the Fellowship explored since 2017: how can companies better balance user privacy and product development? How can we improve the accuracy and fairness of algorithms to help practitioners better assess the viability of datasets? How can we better track and understand influence operations on online platforms? Through this final year of the program, the cohort learned from each other, developed new iterations of their tools, and reached new audiences. Watch the cohort’s final showcase and learn more about the teams’ work&nbsp;<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/assembly-project-fellowship-showcase">here</a>.</p> Alumni community continues to integrate new approaches to responsible technology <blockquote>“Assembly was the most interesting collection of people I’ve ever met working on some of the hardest, most important problems on the internet. One unexpected gift I got from the program was a good look at the lots of different ways to change things: there are techniques and career paths I’d never have thought about [on my own]. Through the program, I met so many tremendous folks, and I now see so much more potential.” — John Hess, 2017 and 2020 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</blockquote><p>The Assembly Fellowship, one of three of the program’s core tracks, offered a model in which professionals from across sectors could learn from, challenge, and collaborate with each other. Its impact was twofold: while Assembly produced a number of public interest-focused prototypes, frameworks, and other projects, the Fellowship’s most lasting impact might be the people that comprise its community. The Assembly Fellowship helped to shape the way its alumni think about the intersection of technology and society: since their time in the program, alumni have pursued new career paths, continued to develop their Assembly projects, and used the tools and perspectives they gained as fellows to integrate new approaches to responsible technology.</p><p>Below are some stories from former Assembly Fellows about their experience in the program and its&nbsp;impact:</p><p>“As a practitioner working at the crux of democracy and technology for over a decade, Assembly was an opportunity to connect with the latest thinking about the challenges and solutions to how technology impacts people’s lives. The program offered a space to both reflect and learn, while at the same time contributing to developing practical tools and approaches that address some of the toughest challenges we face in data-driven societies… Being part of an interdisciplinary team expanded my interest in providing a useful bridge between advancing the intellectual frontiers of how data-centric technologies impact society and translating that knowledge into action by policymakers, technologists, and civil society. This has led to an exciting new path in my career as Managing Director at Data &amp; Society, working with our research and engagement teams to shift the focus onto the people most impacted by technological change.” — <a href="https://datasociety.net/people/calderon-ania/">Ania Calderon</a>, 2019 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“I was grateful that Assembly brought together people who might not have otherwise found each other…[my cohort was comprised of] a bunch of brilliant thinkers and doers who may have shared values, but certainly had different approaches and backgrounds that ultimately informed our work together. Working with activists and academics, corporate professionals and service members, and creatives and educators broadened my worldview and helped me realize that I have allies in more places than I would have thought. The fellowship also gave me an opportunity to experiment: I wore many hats, performed many roles, and ultimately learned more about myself and what I am good at and what I want to do. In a world that pushes us to excel rather than to explore, I really appreciated the space to try things I never thought I’d do — from writing a TV pilot to building interactive data visualizations to reading hundreds of military RFPs — and being given the support to try.” — <a href="https://bcavello.com/">B Cavello</a>, 2019 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“As someone working in industry, it’s almost impossible to get dedicated time to think through really challenging issues. I applied to Assembly because the fellowship gave me exactly that: a chunk of time to dig into the complexities around the ethics and governance of AI. Through Assembly, I met a truly inspirational community of people who were interested in the same questions I was asking, but coming from all sorts of backgrounds. Together, we launched a research group that continues to this day — the <a href="https://datanutrition.org/">Data Nutrition Project</a> (DNP), which builds ‘nutritional labels’ for datasets meant to increase overall awareness and health of datasets being used to build algorithmic systems. DNP, and the amazing support from the Assembly program and community since, has really changed the trajectory of my own career. I am much more aware of and focused on addressing issues of inequality in algorithmic systems, and I now bring that to everything I do during my daily work — from building COVID analytics frameworks to assessing the quality of humanitarian datasets.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kasia-chmielinski">Kasia Chmielinski</a>, 2018 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“Assembly, for me, achieved the delicate balance between the often slow, deeply considered pace of academia and the less thoughtful ‘move fast and break things’ mentality common in the tech industry. It provided an opportunity for participants to pop out of their usual bubbles of collaborators, to connect with committed thinkers, scholars, experts, advocates and hackers from a diverse set of contexts and experiences. Whether participating on a project or reviewing the teams’ work as [an advisor], I benefited deeply from the exposure to smart people, working collectively, to find novel approaches to difficult challenges. In addition, the access to and feedback of accomplished mentors and advisors was a critical aspect of the program, one that helped [project teams] reconsider, rethink, or more fully commit to a particular direction…In my case, I was fortunate to have Assembly be a place where a seed of an idea was germinated into a fully blossoming independent, grant-funded endeavor. Through our project [<a href="https://cleaninsights.org/">Clean Insights</a>], the Assembly Fellowship will have a lasting impact on data privacy, security and sovereignty for real people around the world.” — <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nfreitas">Nathan Freitas</a>, 2020 Assembly Advisor, 2017 and 2021 Assembly&nbsp;Fellow</p><p>“As a fellow, a member of the advisory board, and a member of the staff team, Assembly has been the most meaningful, impactful, and inspiring program I have been involved with in my more than seven years at Harvard: the support, the community, the ideas and their impact in the world are all things I expect to benefit and learn from throughout the remainder of my career.

So what is special about children’s data, and why did we choose to focus on children in particular?</p><p>Children’s rights are afforded extra protections under international human rights laws such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and data processing impacts on virtually all areas of children’s rights to some degree. States, companies and guardians have a duty under existing international human rights laws to prevent children’s personal information and data from being used to exploit them or violate their freedoms. The main difference between general data governance and children’s data governance is the presumption that children cannot effectively advance and advocate on behalf of their own interests because of their age and capacity. That is why we believe that children’s data merit special protection and a distinct consideration in international, regional and national governance regimes.</p><p>Privacy and protection of children’s information and identities are particularly important as they grow and experiment by making different choices and exploring different preferences, and as they develop their personalities. Children need to be afforded the agency to define who they are for themselves, without having their future pathways predetermined or their learning styles unduly narrowed down by algorithms.</p><p>Governance of children’s data also presents some challenging questions in relation to consent and children’s agency over their own data. Children, depending on their age, may be less suited than adults to provide meaningful consent for their data collection and use. This is because children are often less able than adults to make mature decisions on data use that may impact their future in ways that are difficult even for adults to understand. This problem is compounded by a general lack of transparency in relation to how data is used by technology companies — it is rare to see terms and conditions of data collection explained in child-friendly language or translated into minority languages. Generally there is already a power imbalance between the public and governments, companies, or other institutions that process their data, and children are in an especially vulnerable position within these relationships.</p><p>On the flip side, we also wanted to focus on children’s data because we are excited about the potential for its use for good. We know that children’s data can support research, development and provisions of services, and poor data governance can lead to a loss of potential benefits for children. In an increasingly data-driven global economy good data governance for children is essential for children, for development, and for business.</p>Festusminja, via Wikimedia Commons What does good data governance for children look like, and how do we get&nbsp;there? <p>The working group members wrote a series of background papers that informed the manifesto, covering <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/state-surveillance-and-implications-children">state surveillance and the implications for children</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/data-governance-young-people-commercialized-digital-environment">young people in the commercialized digital environment</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/covid-19-spotlight-child-data-governance-gaps">data governance gaps in light of Covid-19</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/responsible-group-data-children">responsible group data for children</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/childrens-rights-design-new-standard-data-use-tech-companies">children’s rights by design</a>, <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/governance-student-data">governance of student data</a>, and exploration of <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/reports/fiduciary-approach-child-data-governance">a fiduciary approach to child data governance</a>.</p><p>As part of tackling the question of what good data governance for children looks like, the working group took the manifesto through a series of regional workshops in the US, Europe, Asia, and Africa, which helped to flesh out ten key action&nbsp;points:</p><p>1. PROTECT children and their rights through child-centered data governance. Such data governance should adhere to internationally agreed standards that minimize the use of surveillance and algorithms for profiling children’s behavior.</p><p>2. PRIORITIZE children’s best interests in all decisions about children’s data. Governments and companies should give priority to children’s rights in their data collection and processing and storage practices.</p><p>3. CONSIDER children’s unique identities, evolving capacities and circumstances in data governance frameworks. Every child is different, and children mature as they get older, so data governance regulations must be flexible. Marginalized children must never be left&nbsp;behind.</p><p>4. SHIFT responsibility for data protection from children to companies and governments. Extend the protection measures to all children below the age of 18, regardless of the age of&nbsp;consent.</p><p>5. COLLABORATE with children and their communities in policy building and management of their data. Through distributed models of data governance, children and their communities should have more say in how data is processed, by whom it can be processed, and with whom it can be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>6. REPRESENT children’s interests within administrative and judicial processes, as well as redress mechanisms. It is imperative that children’s rights are integrated into existing mechanisms, such as the work of data protection authorities.</p><p>7. PROVIDE adequate resources to implement child-inclusive data governance frameworks. Data protection authorities and technology companies must employ staff who understand children’s rights, and governments should allocate funding for regulatory oversight.</p><p>8. USE policy innovation in data governance to solve complex problems and accelerate results for children. Policy innovation can help public authorities to make the most of data, while at the same time safeguarding children’s rights.</p><p>9. BRIDGE knowledge gaps in the realm of data governance for children. There are some urgent knowledge gaps that need further research to ensure that data governance regulations are evidence-based.</p><p>10. STRENGTHEN international collaboration for children’s data governance and promote knowledge and policy transfer among countries. This Manifesto calls for greater global coordination on law and policy. Uncoordinated national-level data governance laws can lead to competing assertions of jurisdiction and conflict.</p><p>At the time of writing, increased efforts are being made to regulate the technology sector in all regions. At the same time, promising local and national initiatives are exploring ways to manage data in the public interest. A key takeaway from this manifesto is that children’s rights need to be front and centre of all of these new data governance initiatives, rather than being side-lined. This is increasingly important in a world in which children’s data cannot always easily be distinguished from adult’s data, and children are often impacted by data processing even when they are not the primary intended users of a digital platform or&nbsp;service.</p><p>You can read the full manifesto <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/good-governance-childrens-data">here</a>, which contains rich information about many of the child rights issues impacted by data processing and elaborates on the ten action points listed&nbsp;above.</p><p>Watch Urs Gasser, former Executive Director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society — Harvard University; Jasmina Byrne, Chief of Policy, Office of Global Insight and Policy — UNICEF; and Emma Day, UNICEF Consultant, discussing the manifesto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g309A5Gd2_s">here</a> with a panel of&nbsp;experts:</p>  Julie Brill, Chief Privacy Officer, Corporate Vice President, and Deputy General Counsel of Global Privacy and Regulatory Affairs — Microsoft;  Dorothy Gordon, Chair of the Inter-Governmental Council of the UNESCO Information For All Programme; and  Riita Vanska, Specialist in the IHAN (Human-Driven Data Economy) Project — SITRA.  <p>For further information contact Jasmina Byrne: <a href="mailto:jbyrne@unicef.org">jbyrne@unicef.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-all-data-governance-needs-to-consider-childrens-rights-8b218a825a08">Why all data governance needs to consider children’s rights</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation announced recently a new mechanism for rewarding and funding work in the common interest of its membership, the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/introducing-dif-grants/">DIF Grants Program</a>. The Steering Committee ratified an addendum defining these collaborations between a specific DIF working group and a grant sponsor, and this shiny new tool sits ready to be debuted in the toolkit available to DIF community work. &nbsp;DIF's work is leveling up with this new mechanism for transparently funding work that supports DIF's mission and benefits the membership as a whole.</p><p>The first such grant was initiated by Microsoft, which has a long history of collaborations in DIF. Of the various modalities described by the grant program, The Claims and Credentials Working Group will be overseeing a new work item open to all DIF members that creates and harden a JWS test suite, with this grant funding a lead editor to drive the work and keep it to a pre-determined timeline, paid upon stable and complete release. </p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@natasyachen">Natasya Chen</a> History <p>Pamela Dingle, co-chair of the Interoperability WG, identified a recurring theme in conversations about interoperability across the great "JSON"/"JSON-LD" divide: while considerable cross-vendor, cross-stack alignment had happened over the last years to address many other aspects of credential exchange and identifier resolution, "translation issues" and varying interpretations of the JSON sections of the VC data model specification lead to divergent ways of structuring, defining, signing, and parsing VCs in JWT form. &nbsp;The kinds of signature suite definitions that define Linked Data Proofs made strange bedfellows with the in-built mechanisms of JWT, which were hardened and commoditized earlier. &nbsp;This results in a slightly "balkanized" landscape of VC-JWTs that make different concessions to the expectations of JSON-LD-native parsers and systems.</p><p>Initially, the idea of iterating one or more foundational specifications seemed a natural solution: a few key sections of any specification could be made more explicit, more normative, or less ambiguous. But just as the plural of anecdote is not data, so too is the plural of specifications not disambiguation. Another tack was chosen: implementers of the existing specification would come together and compare their running code to identify every difference and incompatibility, defining a test suite that interpreted the current specification. &nbsp;They might still produce a list of changes they would like to see in a future specification, and that list might contain some contentious items that take a long time to align. &nbsp;But in the meantime, they would have a practical roadmap to alignment and a benchmark for conformance to drive interoperability amongst each other and clarity for external interoperability.</p> A signature suite that spans two worlds <p>The specification under test in this new work item is <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">Json Web Signature 2020 </a>("JWS2020" for short), a CCG signature suite that defines how the signature mechanisms and data structures native to "detached signature" JWS tokens can be parsed as <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>. The signature mechanisms of the <a href="https://medium.facilelogin.com/jwt-jws-and-jwe-for-not-so-dummies-b63310d201a3">JWT world</a> and the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Feb/att-0130/VerifiableTrustStandards.png">LDP world</a> are quite different– bridging them requires a deep understanding of both: differing security models, canonization and serialization complexities, explicit reliance on <a href="https://www.iana.org/protocols">IANA registries</a>, <a href="https://json-ld.github.io/rdf-dataset-canonicalization/spec/">URDNA dataset normalization</a>, and the like. &nbsp;Advanced topics, even for this blog!</p><p>Understanding such a specification on a deep intellectual level and understanding its design decisions requires a firm grasp on all these complexities spanning two very different engineering traditions. Implementing the specification, however, should not; to be blunt, our community cannot afford such understanding gating off successful implementation, particularly if industrial adoption of decentralized identity is a shared goal. &nbsp;Before the specification gets iterated, it needs to be testable, and even more implementable than it already is.</p><p>This is where a test suite offers pedagogical tool for first-time implementers, as well as a negotiation tool for seasoned veterans and large corporations managing vast roadmaps and production development pipelines. While many DIF members do not encode VCs in JWT form, this grant is clearly in the common interest because mainstream adoption will indisputably benefit from a clearer, more explicitly-defined, and definitively-testable "normative VC-JWT".</p> Selection Process <p>From 26 July 2021 to 9 August 2021, the chairs fielded applications through a google <a href="https://forms.gle/hPCNWaAQZpLFZyXd7">form</a>, and submitted all valid application to <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/claims-credentials/tree/main/grants/grant_1/applications">github</a> for posterity. &nbsp;The selection criteria for the work item lead is as follows:</p>  familiarity with JWS mechanics and common JOSE libraries/best-practices  experience with automated testing, vector design, and test scripts/suites  familiarity with LD Proofs and signature suites generally  familiarity with JSON/JSON-LD interop problems, at the semantic, signature-verification, and representation/parsing levels   Grantee Announcement <p>On 12 August 2021, The Claims &amp; Credential (C&amp;C) Working Group at DIF gladly announced Transmute Industries as the recipient of the first DIF Grant to provide a JWS Test Suite for Verifiable Credentials. One of the chairs, Martin Riedel, summarized the chairs' decision thusly:<br><br>Transmute has been a thought leader in the SSI space for years and uniquely fits the requirement profile laid out in the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/dif-grant-1-jws-test-suite/">Grant announcement</a>.</p>  Orie Steele, the CTO of Transmute, is the initiating author of, lead editor of, and main contributor to <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">the (LD-) JSON Web Signature 2020</a>.  Transmute has a strong background in TDD and is a strong proponent of delivering test vectors with specifications in order to achieve greater implementation-level interoperability. Examples include Test Vectors in <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/sidetree.js/tree/main/packages/test-vectors">Sidetree.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/did-key.js/tree/main/packages/did-key-test-vectors">did-key.js</a>.  The company already provides integrated libraries to support (LDS)-VC and JWT-VC side-by-side, demonstrating their familiarity with both representations. See <a href="https://github.com/transmute-industries/verifiable-data/blob/c61c2eeff859a902cfbaf375424b3b5cfa519ea6/packages/vc.js/README.md">vc.js</a>.  Lastly, Transmute has a strong track record of making specifications and libraries accessible to the general public in a variety of deployed web-projects (<a href="https://did.key.transmute.industries/">https://did.key.transmute.industries/</a>, <a href="https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/">https://wallet.interop.transmute.world/</a> and others…)  <p>Therefore we regard Transmute Industries as the ideal candidate to provide a comprehensive JWS test suite for LDS-VC and JWT-VC and support the community interactions around this project within DIF’s C&amp;C Group.</p> Next Steps <p>The new work item will be announced and regular meetings initiated at the 23 August meeting of C&amp;C– if you are interested in participating, please attend and/or drop a note in the C&amp;C slack channel.</p>

<p>As many people working in the digital identity, security and privacy spaces will know, the Privacy Paradox is the discrepancy between an individuals’ intentions to protect their privacy and how they actually behave in the online world.&nbsp; The relationship between an individuals’ intentions to disclose personal information and their actual personal information disclosure behaviours, can often be very different.<br><br>Many surveys have shown that privacy is a primary concern for people across the globe in our digital age.&nbsp; However, on the other hand large numbers of people freely divulge personal information in exchange for services and convenience, often for relatively small rewards such as interacting with others within a social network.<br><br>This inconsistency of privacy attitudes and privacy behaviour is often referred to as the Privacy Paradox – people expressing privacy concerns often fail to act in accordance with them.<br><br>There have been many explanations for the Privacy Paradox.&nbsp; Examples being that people:</p>



<p>find it difficult to associate a specific value to their privacy and therefore, the value of protecting it</p>



<p>do not consider their personal information to be their own and might not appreciate the need to secure it</p>



<p>lack awareness of their right to privacy or privacy issues&nbsp;</p>



<p>believe their desire for a fully personalised experience outweigh the potential risks from big tech companies using their data for profiling.</p>



<p>Others may have chosen to take it as a sign that, despite what people say, they really just don’t care about their privacy and have used it as an excuse to look at increasingly invasive methods for monetising personal data.<br><br>Well, hopefully as pointed out&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rbird/">Richard Bird</a>, Ping Identity’s Chief Customer Officer at the&nbsp;<a href="https://identiverse.com/">Indentiverse conference</a>&nbsp;in Denver a few weeks back, this later explanation ran into a seemingly solid dead end earlier this year, when with great fanfare (and strong disagreement from the likes of Facebook) Apple released iOS 14.5 and began enforcing App Tracking Transparency.<br><br>All being well, most people should now be aware that the latest release of iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are required to request a user’s permission to track their activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.<br><br>The early data is not looking good for app developers and advertisers who rely on targeted mobile advertising for revenue.&nbsp; While the worldwide opt-in rate has been creeping up, as of 28 June (2 months into the release), it is still only at 17%.&nbsp; The US only figure is even lower, at 9%.<br><br>So ultimately if people are now showing they do care about privacy when they are given the choice, why has the Privacy Paradox been so persistent over the last ten years or so?<br><br></p>



<p>Is it simply that to date people have really not had a choice?&nbsp; Or perhaps more starkly, the only choice they have had was to not use a service at all?&nbsp; Is the greatest example of “an offer you can’t refuse” the ACCEPT button on the Terms of Use page?<br><br>Hopefully we are now heading into a time when the Privacy Paradox will be no more. A time when people are offered a genuine choice about sharing their personal information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Boardroom, the governance middleware platform that powers some of Web3's biggest DAOs, has gone live on Ceramic mainnet. Among the many new features built on Ceramic, Boardroom is debuting an Ideation feature that lets protocol contributors suggest, discuss, and pressure test ideas in a collaborative, censorship-resistant, and fully decentralized way.</p><p>Want to try Boardroom’s new Ideation feature? Visit the <a href="https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/ideation">ShapeShift DAO</a>.</p> What is Boardroom? <p><a href="https://boardroom.info/">Boardroom</a> is addressing the fragmented governance landscape with a simple and transparent platform for stakeholder management over DAOs and protocols.</p><p>As DeFi and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) have exploded in popularity, so has experimentation in new governance methods and tooling. This has led to massive market fragmentation, with no unified experience that serves all aspects of governance together. Today, proposal information, discussion, voting, and execution are splintered across many platforms.</p><p>Boardroom intends to fix this. They are building a powerful governance platform that allows many different governance tools to plug into a single seamless framework that can serve an organization throughout all stages of its governance lifecycle.</p> Governance is more than voting <p>Voting is often considered a critical part of governance for DAOs, but voting is only the tip of the governance iceberg. Long before any votes are cast, ideas are generated, discussed, signaled, and revised - then they come to a vote and potentially move to on-chain execution. Today, this frequently happens across many platforms and is often done implicitly through back-channels rather than in a clear and explicit way. This process is full of friction and often results in lackluster participation and suboptimal decision-making.</p><p>Good governance requires context around all the moving parts, and that was Boardroom's founding motivation: to bring context to governance by unifying the disparate pieces and making sure the relevant information can be surfaced in an easy and clear way to participants.</p>The portal pulls in profiles, project information, discussion forums, Snapshot votes, ideation tools, and more.<p>The Boardroom SDK normalizes data and governance-related actions from across multiple governance frameworks and lets projects build their own, into a single standardized platform. Built on the Boardroom SDK, Boardroom's governance portal provides a consistent, low-friction interface for community members to interact and engage with distributed governance.</p><p>As they were building Boardroom, the team recognized that two critical aspects were missing from most governance tools:</p>  The social layer: Contextualized discussion and debate  The people layer: Rich, pseudonymous reputations   The social layer: Contextualized discussion and debate <p>While much emphasis is put on formal proposals and votes, the Boardroom team found that ideation and discussion, while softer, are more influential in governing the direction of projects. Kevin Nielsen, Boardroom co-founder:</p><blockquote>The vote is extremely important to actually anchor a specific decision, but the most important part of the actual process is coordinating the human and social layer.</blockquote><p>To elevate this part of the governance process and connect it to decision-making, Boardroom is building a set of ideation and forum tools.</p><p>On the Boardroom app, each governance proposal will include its own forum for discussion on the same page, presented in a unified experience - with participation restricted to token holders in the network.</p><p>Additionally, a new tool designed for ideation allows the community to suggest, show support for, and discuss new ideas before moving to a formal vote. Ideation is a way to get more people involved in the process in a clear, contextualized, and collaborative way. After debuting the Ideation feature last week with the Shapeshift DAO, their community has already <a href="https://app.boardroom.info/shapeshift/ideation/kjzl6cwe1jw145n4mqq47jgbzojg9q07zgvnx0u2xy95rexpwo9kul4xydei9qt">generated and discussed</a> several new ideas using Ideation. Here's a preview:</p> Ceramic Streams: Web3-native content for DAOs <p>In governance, forum posts and discussions must be trustless and censorship-resistant, or else protocol governance could be shaped by a single party with the power to warp this crucial part of the process - including Boardroom. Storing discussion threads on a server would leave this data susceptible to corruption and posts couldn't just be stored on vanilla IPFS without a management layer to link posts, reactions, and responses together into a consistent thread.</p><p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> provided a perfect solution for this user-generated content, with signed streams of content persisted on a decentralized network. Because Ceramic content is authenticated with the same decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that sit at the heart of <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/identity/idx/">IDX</a> and Boardroom's user profiles, users can begin posting to forums without the need to authenticate in a new way. Each piece of content is signed, stored, and controlled by users, then aggregated into the complete thread by the application.</p><p>This approach provides a lightweight way to manage rich user content and enables full portability and composability of data. Other governance applications could easily build on top of the same ideation threads outside of the Boardroom UI by referencing the same Ceramic streams or discovering them through a users' IDX. This paves the way for a consistent ideation and discussion layer that can be used everywhere across the governance ecosystem.</p> The people layer: Rich, pseudonymous reputations <p>To be maximally effective, governance delegates and participants must be able to build and leverage a reputation. The anonymity provided by obscure hex addresses might be sufficient for one-off financial transactions, however governance is a long-term game and requires continuity across repeated social interactions. For example others might want to know, "Who are the delegates that are consistently making good suggestions, proving their intent, and putting skin in the game?" Says Nielsen:</p><blockquote>What we want to highlight with voter profiles is not about real-world identity. It's about mapping stakeholders in the network to their on-chain activity, their previous decisions, and their role. It's contextualizing how they fit into that specific DAO, or ecosystem, or decision.</blockquote><p>The fact that many users maintain multiple on-chain accounts and wallets adds complexity to this goal. While this practice may be good for opsec and privacy, it makes it more difficult to construct a unified governance experience for users across all of their accounts. To solve for this, Boardroom needed a way to allow users to link many accounts (and their interactions) together into a unified identity without compromising a user's desire for privacy.</p> Ceramic IDX: Aggregated identities for users <p>This is why Boardroom is moving their identity system and user profiles to <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a> - the identity protocol built on top of Ceramic. In addition to storing profiles and other arbitrary information, IDX lets users link multiple on-chain accounts to the same identity, as well as prove ownership of various Web2 accounts such as Twitter, Github, and Discord.</p><p>As more projects like Rabbithole, Sourcecred, and Gitcoin begin to also use IDX for identity and user data storage, a user's history of on-chain and off-chain transactions can aggregate into a unified, cross-platform reputation which can be used everywhere across the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>All of this information stored in IDX results in a rich source of user context which doesn't just aid the voting process, but rather adds value to every stage of engagement and governance across the Web3 ecosystem — all while staying pseudonymous.</p> Connecting the governance ecosystem <p>With Ceramic and IDX, Boardroom is building a DAO governance platform that brings together the on-chain, social, and human layers in a way that is lightweight and ready to scale. Said YJ Kim, engineer and co-founder of Boardroom:</p><blockquote>We initially thought we'd need to use Discourse forums for ideation. But data is not easy to fetch from the Discourse API, we can’t make a PR to suit our needs since it’s closed source software, and each integration required the forum admins to manually whitelist our IP.</blockquote><p>IDX allows Boardroom to build a focused, web3 version such that future applications both within Boardroom and in the broader governance ecosystem don’t have to face those hurdles. Everything is just...there. That not only makes future iterations easier, but also if a user begins using some other application built on IDX, we’ll be able to easily plug that data right into our portal if we wanted to - and vice versa.</p> What's next for Boardroom? <p>Boardroom recently announced the addition of projects using Governor Alpha, Governor Bravo, and AAVE-based governance frameworks to their platform, adding to existing integrations such as Snapshot. Any projects using these frameworks can easily onboard to Boardroom's platform and use their governance portal interface to vote, delegate, ideate, track treasury distributions, and more.</p><p>For projects using modified versions of these frameworks, Boardroom will work with teams to build adapters as needed.

  <p>The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) is proud of its ongoing transparency initiatives. Namely its open approach to providing unrestricted access to the latest LEI data from around the world with the Quarterly LEI System Business Reports, which are made publicly available free of charge. Through this ‘LEI in Numbers’ blog series, GLEIF aims to highlight key data from the latest report, explaining trends and profiling successes from the global LEI rollout. </p>
<p>The latest report, covering Q2 2021, shows that 58,000 new LEIs were issued globally during that period. Issuance was slightly lower than the previous quarter (68,000 issued in Q1), however this trend is quite common during the second quarter of the year, as the world moves into the slower summer months. The overall picture is very encouraging; in Q2 2021, total LEI issuance grew by 3.3% and the total number of active LEIs now stands as 1.82 million. </p>
<p>For a further summary of the past quarter’s data, the below infographic contains the key statistics from Q2 2021. </p>
<a href="https://www.gleif.org/thumbs/newsroom/blog/q2-2021-in-review-the-lei-in-numbers/gleif_jul21-1-750x1937.jpg"></a>
<p>For the first time, Turkey emerges as the largest growth market in Q2, with an impressive growth rate of 22.9%. This is one of the highest growth rates seen this year. This was driven largely by a regional deadline to map LEIs to legacy international securities identification numbers, in line with the joint initiative from the Association of National Numbering Agencies and GLEIF. In addition, Iceland has doubled its quarterly growth rate when compared to the previous quarter (19% in Q2, up from 9.2% in Q1). </p>
<p>While remaining high overall, there was a nominal decline in renewal rates across both EU and non-EU jurisdictions throughout the past quarter (64.3% down from 66%). In line with fluctuations in issuance and growth, it is normal for renewal rates to vary from quarter to quarter. GLEIF advocates for LEI renewals to be made mandatory whenever LEI issuance is mandatory. The prevention of lapsed credentials by proactive renewal of LEIs on an annual basis ensures that the Global LEI Index continues to provide the most accurate and up-to-date data as possible. This benefits the entire ecosystem and all users of LEI data, who rely on its accuracy to make informed business decisions with confidence. </p>
<p>For the full report which includes further detail on the status of LEI issuance and growth potential, the level of competition between LEI issuing organizations in the Global LEI System and Level 1 and 2 reference data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Reports page.</p>
<p>If you are interested in reviewing the latest daily LEI data, our Global LEI System Statistics Dashboard contains daily statistics on the total and active number of LEIs issued. This feature now enables any user to review historical data by geography, increasing transparency on the overall progress of the LEI.</p>
<p>For further detail, or to access historical data, please visit the Global LEI System Business Report Archive. We look forward to sharing our progress each quarter as we continue to drive LEI adoption in 2021.</p>

 🚀 Foundation News 
 DIF "Frequently Asked Questions" Knowledgebase 
<p>DIF has launched a massive <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">knowledgebase</a>, structured as a long series of frequently-asked questions and answers. This synthesizes a year of educational efforts in the interop WG, blog posts, newsletters, and many other DIF inputs in a format we hope will be useful as a reference and onboarding document throughout the decentralized identity space.  Please peruse it, particularly the sections about your personal research focus and/or your company's specialty and products, opening issues or PRs on github wherever you feel a correction or addition is needed.  This is intended as a community resource, so PRs are open to your input!</p>
 Interop WG election 
<p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/interop/">Interoperability WG</a> is seeking nominations for new chairs. The group is hoping to pivot to a greater focus on testing, so candidates with experience scripting tests or making specs testable (whether in decentralized identity contexts or otherwise) are particularly welcome. For details about the ballot, visit the mailing list or slack channel.</p>

 "controller" in the "verificationMethod" is less clear. 
 "verificationMethod" can only have a single "controller", but verification methods can in fact be "controlled" by multiple entities. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/697">issue</a>. 
 in practice there is always <code>did_document.id === did_document.verificationMethod[N].controller</code>

TLDR; WACI isn’t being donated as a snapshot or as a reference implementation of a finished protocol; it’s being donated as a starting point for an ongoing work item in C&amp;C WG that will round out the spec to be more robust and flexible, after the WACI-PEx profile has been finished and there is feedback to consider from implementers of it, and/or of other applications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[DIF focuses on three distinct] “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is [the Interop WG's] contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community-- and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all three.</p>

				 <p>KP4 to join the Board of aNewGovernance AISBL:</p>
<p>Because human-centric data infrastructure has to be the new global model across all sectors, moving away from platform-centric and state-centric current situations, we are delighted to announce Toulouse-based OKP4 is joining our Brussels-based International Association</p>
<p>As the Data Strategy and the Data Spaces are being put in place in Europe, the other main priority of the EU27 is the Green Deal, probably with even more impact. We are therefore delighted to welcome OKP4 which is bridging both priorities:</p>
<p>“In today’s data-driven society, the success of any organization relies on knowledge extracted from relevant data. Paradoxically, 70% of data produced by companies is not exploited. Worse, data is almost never shared between stakeholders due to lack of standards, trust and/or common interests.</p>
<p>Because data is the only asset whose value increases when it is shared, OKP4 (Open Knowledge Platform for) proposes an infrastructure where stakeholders can share their data without exchanging it with the others. Our infrastructure indexes heterogeneous data and services (AI) to produce on-demand knowledge without disclosing the data. Another particularity of OKP4 is to fairly reward knowledge contributors: it aligns interests between parties, within a framework of security and mutual consent allowing trustworthy collaboration. We believe the current data economy helped by data marketplaces is just a transition towards a more efficient and fairer knowledge economy helped by actors such as OKP4.</p>
<p>OKP4 focuses primarily on the field of agriculture, but is a toolbox that could and will be applied to any data-based usecase. Today, we help organisations extract value from their data and help them build multiparty data-sharing ecosystems for maximum mutual benefits.”</p>
<p>In recognition to its valuable contribution, OKP4 will be represented in the aNewGovernance Board by its President, Emmanuel Aldeguer.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has released Gordian Seed Tool, a new iOS app that allows for the creation, storage, backup, and transformation of cryptographic seeds is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Apple appstore</a>. It is an independent, private, and resilient vault, which can protect the most important underlying secret used by most cryptocurrencies: the cryptographic seed.</p>

 Read More 



<p>Though most wallets focus on the private keys used to unlock their cryptocurrency transactions, Gordian Seed Tool takes a step back and allows you to manage the fundamentals upon which private keys are built: entropy and seeds. You can use coin flips, die rolls, card draws, or iOS randomness as the entropy to generate your seeds, or you can import them from other applications. Using those seeds, Gordian Seed Tool can then derive unique, non-correlatable public and private keys as you need them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The focus of Gordian Seed Tool is to protect your seeds. It does so by supporting new approaches to security such as QR-based airgaps, where you store your secrets on a closely held device that isn’t fully networked, such as an offline device in airplane mode, or a strongly protected device like the secure enclave in Apple’s iPhone and more modern Macinotoshes. You then communicate with that device primarily through QR codes or text that can easily be transmitted across that gap of air. Your seeds are thus protected by modern mobile-device security such as data encryption, trusted hardware, and biometric access protection.</p>

<p>That data encryption comes about through Apple’s trusted encryption routines. Seed Tool then adds resilience through integration with iCloud. If your choose for your mobile iOS device to have a network connection, its seeds will be stored in iCloud using end-to-end encryption. If you lose your device, you can retrieve those seeds with a replacement device logged into the same Apple account. (If you prefer, you can also use a cellular networked device, such as an iPod Touch or wifi-only iPad, leveraging airplane mode, to entirely ensure that your seeds never leave your device.)</p>

<p>You’ll be able to easily identify your seeds using the Blockchain Commons <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-002-digest.md#object-identity-block">object identity block</a>, which includes a visual lifehash, a human-readable name, an icon, and an abbreviated digest. Put them together and you should be able to recognize each seed at a glance.</p>

<p>Besides generating seeds, storing them, and backing them up, Gordian Seed Tool can also transform your seeds. It can derive popular Bitcoin and Ethereum public and private keys from your seeds, answer requests for other derivations, encode seeds as bytewords, BIP39 words, or hex, or shard them into SSKR shares and save them to different locations or as social recovery with your family, friends and close colleagues. Your seed is the basis for a whole tree of secure data, and Gordian Seed Tool gives you access to all of it.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool is just one of several Blockchain Commons apps that demonstrate the Gordian principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> offers a way to store confidential QRs such as 2FA seeds, SSKR shares, and (for that matter) cryptoseeds. Our forthcoming Gordian Cosigner will demonstrate how to easily manage Bitcoin transactions across an Airgap.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">3Box Labs is sunsetting 3Box products</a> in favor of the new and more powerful combination of <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">Identity Index (IDX)</a> protocol. This post provides a short tutorial on how to update your application to load user profiles using the Self.ID SDK instead of the 3Box profiles API. Making this upgrade ensures your application will always be loading the most current profiles for your users.</p> Why use Self.ID instead of 3Box? <p>Migrating your application from using 3Box to Self.ID for fetching user profiles will ensure you are always querying up-to-date profiles for your users, whether a given user has migrated from 3Box to Ceramic/IDX or not.</p><p>As Ceramic mainnet goes live, existing 3Box users will have their profiles migrated over to IDX. Updating a user's IDX requires the user to be authenticated and sign the updates, so this will not happen all at once. Instead, the first time a user interacts with a Ceramic-enabled app that uses <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/authentication/3id-did/3id-connect/">3ID Connect</a> for authentication they will be prompted to migrate their account from 3Box to IDX and the data will be transferred in the background for them.</p><p>To make sure you are accurately pulling profiles for all users, we recommend upgrading to IDX ASAP. The 3Box API will keep working for the immediate future. However, if you do not upgrade you will only load outdated profiles from the 3Box API for users who have migrated. The Self.ID API solves this by returning an IDX profile for migrated users and falling back to 3Box profiles for users who have not yet migrated.</p>  How to query profiles with Self.ID <p>This tutorial will show you how to fetch profiles in order to display them in your application's UI. The code below allows your app to display an IDX profile if one exists, and if not, will fall back to displaying a legacy 3Box profile.</p><p>First, we need to install the following packages of the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/tools/self-id/overview/">Self.ID SDK</a>:</p> <code>npm install @self.id/core @self.id/3box-legacy</code> <p>Now let's import our dependencies:</p> <code>import { Core } from '@self.id/core'
import { getLegacy3BoxProfileAsBasicProfile } from '@self.id/3box-legacy'</code> <p>Now let's load a profile for a user. Notice below that we first try to load the profile using the <code>core.get</code> method. This attempts to retrieve the user's <code>basicProfile</code> from IDX, however if one is not present because the user has not yet migrated to Ceramic/IDX, then we can fallback to use the <code>getLegacy3BoxProfileAsBasicProfile</code> function to get the user's profile from the 3Box API.</p> <code>const core = new Core({ ceramic: 'https://gateway.ceramic.network' })

const ethAddress = '0xabc123...'
let profile = await core.get('basicProfile', ethAddress + '@eip155:1')

if (!profile) {
  profile = await getLegacy3BoxProfileAsBasicProfile(ethAddress)
}
console.log(profile)
</code> <p>You may have noticed that the Ethereum address is concatenated with <code>@eip155:1</code>. This is because the <code>core.get</code> method can be used to lookup data for accounts on any blockchain. <code>eip155:1</code> is simply the blockchain namespace for Ethereum mainnet. See the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md">CAIP-10 spec</a> for more details.</p> Questions or support? <p>We're always available to answer any questions and assist you through this transition period.

 Internal benefits, external benefits, training, and communication <p>In <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badges-for-digital-transformation-7e9e1a17e714">our last post</a>, we talked about some strategies for implementing badges. In this post, we’ll talk about specific benefits in using badges for digital transformation and related strategic work.</p><p>Open Recognition Pathways support strategic goals like staff development and retention, community outreach and engagement, as well as promotional or marketing initiatives.</p>The More You See by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;CC-BY-ND What are open recognition pathways? <p>Open Recognition Pathways are constructed from Open Badges. These badges are verifiable, digital artifacts that show a skill or achievement, and are shareable across the web. They appear as a digital image, which once clicked, presents data about the badge, including the criteria for earning it. They can be awarded, issued and earned by anyone and can be connected to form pathways that signpost additional opportunities.</p><a href="https://badge.wiki/wiki/IDB_Credentials_Workshop_Outputs#/media/File:Where_are_the_credential_sized_holes.png">Where are the credential sized holes</a> by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;CC-BY-ND How could pathways benefit an organisation?  1. Internal&nbsp;benefits   Train up your staff. Badges can package learning criteria up and show a staff members motivation to learn. They can be used to help validate promotions and show a staff member’s commitment to professional development.  Retention. Since badges provide recognition of an individual’s skills, they can help employees feel valued and seen, which promotes retention.  Skills search and skills gaps identification. Badge portfolios provide an easily searchable directory of organisational skills, making it easy to identify staff with relevant skills for new projects or skills gaps that should be&nbsp;plugged   2. External&nbsp;benefits The Four Stages of Engagement by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;CC-BY-ND  Open Engagement. Badges make it easy for the earner to demonstrate their skills and values. Contributor Badges earned from a particular organisation, for example, can help a contributor show the skills applied during their open contribution. They also highlight the social values and donation of time they have given to an organisation. These benefits can increase volunteerism and help motivate further engagement with the organisation  Outreach. Badges can be shared across the web and recipients are often proud to share their achievement. Badges issued can have branding and link back to the organisation. These activities can deliver meaningful marketing wins  Pipeline. Badges can form pathways towards additional badges and opportunities. Low level badges can be the start of routes towards more meaningful engagement, potentially providing a pipeline of interested and talented people who can contribute to, and further the work of an organisation  The Story of a Journey by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a> Let’s get more&nbsp;specific <p>Let’s explore in more detail how they impact three specific departments / initiatives:</p> 3. Badges for internal&nbsp;training   Provide recognition of learning — people who have taken a training can show that they have done so. They can also use a badge to share what they’ve learned and (humble) brag about their accomplishments amongst their colleagues.  Internal/External Marketing — People are generally proud to share their achievements. This can drum up support for your programme internally, and it can help position an organisation as a ‘learning organisation’ that invests in its&nbsp;staff   4. Amplifying communications   Ask for contributions — We know that <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/10-reasons-why-people-contribute-to-open-source-d13b86b1e9d3">people contribute as a way to learn new skills</a>, build reputation and to belong to a community with similar values. Contributors who are recognised are likely to share that recognition, and as an added bonus, they’ll link back to the organisation that recognised them.  Provide pathways to further engagement — Since badges can be connected to form pathways, you can send your audience on a journey that helps them get to know your community and become further engaged in the work that you&nbsp;do.   How do WAO approach this&nbsp;work? Disco (very) by Bryan Mathers is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>We generally see three phases of&nbsp;work:</p>  A discovery phase into how badges could support your strategic goals, leading to a badge strategy. We usually recommend having both internal badges to help staff development and retention, as well as more contributor focused badges to promote community outreach and engagement.  Next we explode that strategy into a project plan for badges. We figure out how to scaffold the development of the badges and the promotion of them with your organisation.  Implementation! Rolling out new badges is pretty easy once they exist. If learning opportunities already exist, we can add badges for those opportunities, and if they don’t, we’ll develop&nbsp;them.  <p>Interested? <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact">Get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p><p>Special thanks to WAO members past and present who worked on this&nbsp;summary.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/4-benefits-of-open-recognition-pathways-a51c10a37633">4 benefits of Open Recognition Pathways</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What is Digital Transformation and why it is essential to have a blockchain&nbsp; like Commercio.network&nbsp; to implement it. 
 What is digital transformation? 
<p>In 2014, the EU issued the eIDAS directives by regulating Trust Services to create electronic identities, sign and send electronic documents with legal value. This has made it possible to dematerialize all business processes in digital form. According to an EU estimate, digital transformation is expected to increase gross domestic product by 2.2 trillion euros over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why is it essential to be a blockchain ? 
<p>The blockchain is the technology made famous by Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s a network that allows you to exchange something that has value and must remain original to keep it. You can exchange copies of images on the internet, but you can’t transfer originals. If it were possible we could all send each other pictures of money via whatsapp and not exchange banknotes. The blockchain solves the problem of exchanging value by exchanging originals. That’s why the founders of Commerc.io thought of using it to exchange documents with legal value.</p>
<p>The Digital Transformation&nbsp; blockchain Commercio.network is an open-source PROJECT that gives companies the ability to sign and exchange documents using blockchain technology to guarantee:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Paternity: The document was created by the declared sender.&nbsp; 
  Non-repudiation: The sender cannot deny having&nbsp; signed the document&nbsp; 
  Integrity: The document has not been altered during transport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>There are two main groups of business documents:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Structured: Mostly XML (Invoices, orders, order confirmations, etc).&nbsp; 
  Unstructured: Mostly PDF (Contracts, forms, letters, etc).&nbsp; 
 
<p>The network is organized through an international network&nbsp; of 100 independent companies. Any company, especially yours, is welcome to join the consortium and take advantage of this next-generation technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commercio.network is called The Documents blockchain because it focuses on solving one core business problem: legally exchanging and signing business documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mission&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our mission is to spread blockchain technology to worldwide companies with a bold Go to market&nbsp; plan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  100 Node validators companies to onboard. 
  1000&nbsp; distributors companies to onboard. 
  10.000 IT companies to onboard…&nbsp; 
  100.000 end customers companies on the blockchain.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to provide every IT Company in the world a simple, fast, profitable way to create value for them and their end customers with:</p>
 
  the vision&nbsp; 
  the skills&nbsp; 
  the core technology&nbsp; 
  the network of validators&nbsp; 
  the developer tools&nbsp; 
 
<p>We have removed the underlying complexity of implementing a blockchain project by defining a three layer approach.&nbsp;</p>
 
  APPLICATION LAYER: where IT companies build apps for solving users’ problems.&nbsp; 
  NETWORKING LAYER: where the companies run the blockchain network nodes.&nbsp; 
  PROTOCOL LAYER: where the basic 8 Core Functions are implemented on the node.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 8 Core Functions Our blockchain core Node software has a group of “Smart Contracts” focused on the world of the document:&nbsp;</p>
 
 CommercioWallet (Done) : Enable users account and access&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioID (Done): Enable users self sovereign identity&nbsp; 
 CommercioDocs (Done): Enable users to exchange business documents&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioSign (Done): Enable users to sign business documents&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioMint (Done): Enable users to create blockchain Tokens&nbsp;

 Trojan mice, paved cow paths, and constellation-creation <p>As anyone familiar with the work of WAO’s members will be aware, we’re big fans of <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a>. We’ve been involved with the movement from the beginning and, in this post, want to reflect on our experience of how they can be used for the digital transformation of organisations.</p>Image CC BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>A quick note, as ever, on terminology. We’re going to use the shorthand ‘badges’ to refer to what people call variously Open Badges, digital credentials, digital badges, or microcredentials. The important thing is that there’s a standard behind what’s being issued so that the data hard-coded into the visual image can be recognised by different systems.</p> Credentials vs recognition <p>There are broadly two streams in the badges movement. The larger, and more obvious stream is focused on credentialing. In other words, issuing badges is about proving things like who you are, what you know, what you can do, or which group(s) you belong to. These badges tend to be issued by well-known, trusted authorities.</p><p>We’re all familiar with credentials. It could be a degree certificate, a driver’s license, or a gym membership card. To date, badges tend to have been used to demonstrate skill acquisition, but the recently-renamed <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/">W3C Verifiable Credentials working group</a> seeks to expand that in both human and machine-readable ways.</p><p>The other stream in the badges movement is around recognition. This is perhaps best explained by <a href="https://www.openrecognition.org/bord">The Bologna Open Recognition Declaration (BORD)</a> from the Open Recognition Alliance:</p><blockquote>Promoting the recognition of learning achievements to support identity construction, citizenship, career development, learning organisations and territories, trust and empowerment.</blockquote><p>As we explored in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-common-ground-8fadc99692cd?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------">previous post</a>, these are the kind of badges that might include those that are self-issued and then endorsed by others, or that are issued by peers are part of a Community of Practice.</p><p>Both credentialing and recognition are important parts of any organisational badge strategy. Perhaps the easiest way of thinking about them is that the former is a ‘top-down’ approach, while the latter is ‘bottom-up’.</p> 3 badge strategies for digital transformation <p>We’ve seen time and again badges be introduced to organisations like&nbsp;this:</p>  Management creates a badge as a&nbsp;pilot  The pilot is successful because the badge is issued by management  Someone new to badges is tasked to create a&nbsp;system  They create Gold / Silver / Bronze badges for XYZ&nbsp;skills  The programme fails through lack of engagement or confusion  <p>It really doesn’t have to be like this! Instead of imposing badges, they should be grown as part of an ecosystem of organisational development and transformation.</p><p>Here are three of our favourite ways to embed badges in organisations. Your mileage may vary, but using elements of one or more of these approaches is likely to be more successful than trying to mandate badges from on&nbsp;high.</p> 1. Trojan&nbsp;mice Illustration by <a href="https://artplusstory.com/blog/2016/5/19/trojan-mouse">Elizabeth Beier</a><p>Many people will know the story of the Trojan horse, a wooden horse used by the Greeks during the Trojan War. They tricked their way into the city of Troy by presenting a ‘gift’ which was actually full of an elite members of the Greek army. The ‘Trojan horse’ has come to serve as a metaphor for something that looks like one thing (i.e. harmless, innocuous) but is actually another underneath (i.e. threatens the status&nbsp;quo).</p><p>These days, people are savvy enough to see Trojan horses coming a mile off, which is why WAO recommends setting off Trojan mice instead. Instead of talking about implementing a badging system, you could try badging participation in a workshop, or issuing a badge along with a paper certificate in an existing awards ceremony.</p><p>There are many advantages of this experimental approach, including:</p>  Avoiding blockers — by seeing what works and what doesn’t, you can focus on what gains traction.  Moving faster — finding something that gains traction and then iterating on that is quicker than trying to design everything upfront.  Improving responsiveness — Trojan mice-size projects are nimble and can adapt to a changing landcape.  <p>This metaphor is an easy way to introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile development practices</a> to organisations which may be new to this approach. <a href="https://whatsthepont.blog/2013/11/10/trojan-horses-are-not-trojan-mice-5-questions-to-spot-the-difference/">This helpful post</a> outlines five different types of Trojan mice that you might want to try in your organisation, from the obvious to the&nbsp;oblique.</p> 2. Paved cow&nbsp;paths Image via <a href="http://www.grisanik.com/blog/control-by-design--examples/">Gris&nbsp;Anik</a><p>Anyone who has been walking in hills and fields where there are cows will be familiar with cow paths. As cows are creatures of habit, when one cow begins to walk across a field, a second one follows, and then the whole herd. After a while, the cows have created a well-worn route from point A to point B. This is often the path of least resistance.</p><p>As you can see in the above photos, humans do the same. It’s unrealistic to expect humans to walk in one direction, turn 90 degrees, and then walk in another direction. They just cut the corner. Of course they do. We all&nbsp;do.</p>Image via <a href="http://www.grisanik.com/blog/control-by-design--examples/">Gris&nbsp;Anik</a><p>So one solution is not to create any paths at all, but instead see where people actually walk. Then create a path over the top. In other words, paving the cow&nbsp;paths.</p><p>If we now apply this to learning design, and in particular, badge design, we can see how this can be beneficial. Rather than planning everything out in advance in a way that looks good on paper or on a presentation slide deck, set a direction and some design constraints, and then co-design badges with early adopters!</p> 3. Constellation-creation Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/a-constellation-of-pathways/">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>When we escape the light pollution of modern cities and look up at the night sky in places, we see countless stars in the sky. Some of these stars, however, are brighter than others, which led our ancestors to group them into the constellations that we know&nbsp;today.</p><p>All of those stars are entities in their own right. And, given the scale of the universe, how they’re grouped together is somewhat arbitrary. It depends on the observer. There’s nothing stopping you or I making up our own constellation tonight by connecting the dots in new and novel&nbsp;ways.</p>Skill tree from the game ‘Path of&nbsp;Exile’<p>In the world of gaming, there is an established notion of a ‘skill tree’. The above example is from a game called <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/game">Path of Exile</a>, and it looks very constellation-like. As you gain ‘skill points’ you can choose to level up your character in different ways. As you can see from the above screenshot, there are potentially hundreds, if not thousands, of different ways of doing&nbsp;this.</p>Skill tree from the game ‘Shadow of the Tomb&nbsp;Raider’<p>The above screenshot is from the game <a href="https://tombraider.square-enix-games.com/en-gb">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> and presents a visually-different way of doing something quite&nbsp;similar.</p> Next step… Negentropy! <p>Once you’ve got your badge system up and running, the key thing is to keep feeding it. What does this mean? Many people will know that the term ‘entropy’ means a system tending towards disorder. Your job is the opposite, the seldom used term ‘negentropy’ (yes that is a real word!) which means a system tending towards&nbsp;order.</p><p>If WAO can help you with any of these steps, please do get in touch so we can have a chat. We’re quite good at untangling people’s organisational spaghetti!</p><p>Drop us a note here: <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">https://weareopen.coop/contact</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/badges-for-digital-transformation-7e9e1a17e714">Badges for digital transformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a>3Box Labs</a> is about to open up a lot of new roles. As we grow into our next phase, we spent a lot of time last month digging into a critical question: how do we improve the diversity of our team?</p><p>Our current team is far from representative of the global population we aim to build for. Our team of 12 is 9 men and 3 women. 9 of us are white. We are geographically spread out - but only in North America and Europe. And our pipeline of incoming applicants is more homogenous than this.</p><p>Last month we had a series of full-team conversations about our approach to building a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable team. We had plenty of differing opinions and useful debates, and did not end with 100% agreement on everything. We did end with a deeper shared appreciation for how much this matters, an approach that we believe in, and some steps we are putting into action.</p><p>We'd love your support, input, and feedback as we put this into action and so are sharing thinking as well as our plans.</p> Why diversity is critical to us <p>Our team first dug into why it is important to us. There are many reasons building a diverse team matters. Bringing focus to those that hold the most meaning to our team helped us make sure we arrived at a plan of action that would resonate. It also let us get extremely specific about how this goal relates to our overall mission and the other goals — and other constraints — that we have as a team. This helped us ensure our plan of action would be practical.</p><p>After several iterations, we arrived at this summary of why this topic is so important to us, which now lives on our <a href="https://www.notion.so/About-3Box-Labs-7100eadf86624b1ba00793da29a08711">About Us page</a>.</p>  🤝🏽 Commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion <p>Building a diverse team is a top priority because nothing will impact our success more deeply. Our ambitions for change are global and our team must represent perspectives from across the world we aim to improve.</p>  The challenges we face are incredibly complex. We must tackle these with ideas and ingenuities from a wide variety of backgrounds and contexts.  Our technology impacts how information and identities are controlled online, with deeply personal and widespread effects. We each have blind spots and need many viewpoints to anticipate the consequences of our work.  We want to face the many unforeseen changes and challenges we have ahead with a balanced and robust team, drawing on a diversity of strengths to adapt and improve through adversity.  <p>We have work to do here, as a team and industry. It's our responsibility to model that only a diverse team working together can we succeed in building a more sustainable, fair and equitable web.</p> <p>One thing absent from this is anything about our role in helping close the opportunity gap for underrepresented groups in crypto, tech, and knowledge economy jobs. We debated this internally at length, as we do feel a responsibility to advance equity more generally in the greater ecosystem in which we operate. However, we feared diluting the messaging that building a diverse and inclusive team is central to our core mission. Aiming to impact social justice in tech felt like a big undertaking and adjacent to our core goals. We have a deep conviction that building a diverse team is critical to our success as an organization, so we decided to keep our statement focused on reinforcing that rather than adding additional diversity goals related to social justice more broadly.</p><p>We talked with several DEI advisors and heard mixed reactions. One felt it absurd to make a 'business case' for an equitable team; it's simply the right and necessary thing to do. Others felt that grounding our commitment to diversity deeply in our team's mission would help us feel the priority more concretely and urgently. We ended, for now, keeping our commitment tied explicitly to our mission. We do hope that through that commitment we will be able to model equity in a space where lack of representation is too much the norm.</p> Our approach to building a diverse team <p>To live up to our commitment, we need a principled approach to hiring that values and emphasizes diversity while still holding to other values, including evaluating every candidate as an individual. We established two particularly important principles:</p>  Invest heavily in proactively building a representative pipeline for every role  Out of that pipeline, hire the candidate who adds the most to our team's mission  <p>At the end of our hiring process, we always want to hire the person that will add the most value to our team. This is not purely about their ability to excel in the role; it also includes character that reinforces our values, and capacity to add new dimensions to our team. This step cannot function in isolation, though. If we hire the best candidates from a pipeline of white male candidates, we will always be hiring white males.</p><p>We must build a broad and representative pipeline of quality candidates for every role. As noted earlier, this does not happen organically right now. We have to put significant proactive effort towards it, then pair it with a thoughtful evaluation and offer process. &nbsp;This is an investment, and will take more time and will mean slower hires on some roles.</p><p>At a startup with limited resources and an urgent need to hire, this is hard. The two priorities of hiring fast and hiring deliberately - including to add diversity - are directly at odds. By explicitly tying our commitment to diversity and success in our mission together, and adding more concrete tactics, we hope to turn diversity into a top-of-mind priority for every hire.</p> Concrete changes we're making  Make it very clear that all candidates are welcomed on our team <p>Adapt our job descriptions, incorporating the knowledge that different candidates react differently to certain language and elements (e.g., men are more likely to apply to jobs where they don't meet all listed requirements). Three changes we've made:</p>  Replace "Requirements" with a section called "You're likely to succeed if," which focuses on capabilities and outcomes and avoids past experiences that would narrow the candidate pool  Explicitly encourage candidates from underrepresented groups to apply in every job description  Ensure inclusive language, using a tool to detect wording that may appeal more to men than women  <p>Share our commitment publicly. We added a commitment to diversity to our <a href="https://www.notion.so/About-3Box-Labs-7100eadf86624b1ba00793da29a08711">About Us</a> page. We will also begin sharing more from inside our team about this topic and related ones, starting with this post.</p> Invest in proactive sourcing <p>We will spend time, money and creativity to bring more candidates from a diverse set of backgrounds into our pipeline. A few actions we are taking towards this:</p><p>Tech talks: our team will start doing these far and wide in the tech world to build bridges in new communities (if you'd like to set one up, reach out!)</p><p>Be wary of opportunistic hires: these tend to be from similar backgrounds, and deprives us of an opportunity to build a more intentional pipeline. This is so hard because when a great candidate from our network emerges, it's likely a very high signal on a very strong candidate. We haven't ruled this out for certain specialized roles, but we cannot let it become a habit.</p> Refine our interview process to value difference and remove bias <p>A few changes we are making on this front: </p><p>Early rounds will focus on skills relevant to the role. Later rounds, with more of the team involved, will evaluate value alignment and teamwork so there are more perspectives to balance out potential biases.</p><p>Removed sources of bias from our scorecard. For example, we used to score candidates on if they "would bring energy to our team." The goal was to find people who would energize us to work with, but it ended up creating a tilt towards high-energy extroverts which was not the intent.</p><p>Add "Would bring a new dimension to the team" to our scorecard, to make sure we consider this for every candidate.</p> Ensure we operate as an inclusive team  <p>Most of our current efforts are focused on hiring. But equally essential is maintaining an inclusive team culture that is welcoming, inspiring, and comfortable to all. This is critical to retaining candidates and to make sure our outreach to new candidates is authentic. It also lets us all be happier and more productive, and comfortable being ourselves.</p> Seek help from groups and people doing great work in this arena <p>We have a lot to learn and a long way to go. There are great teams and individuals that we can learn from, support, and work with. We have a list of those we've already been inspired or educated by. Over time, we'll aim to partner with organizations driving diverse hiring in Web3, amplify the voices of those helping make Web3 a beacon of equity in tech, and make long-term commitments to support the most aligned communities.</p><p>We also continue to do more of this work in public. We hope this will allow others to learn from our experience and open opportunities to work together to improve the practices and norms throughout the ecosystem. We also hope it creates an opportunity for the community to provide feedback and advice back to us. We have a long ways to go and value any support, critiques, and help.</p> <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs Site</a> | <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord Community</a> </p><p></p>

 Creative workshop encourages hands-on experience to create questions about&nbsp;time Olivia Tai and Sarah Newman hosted the workshop.<p>by Grace&nbsp;McFadden</p><p>The philosophy of time can be introduced quite simply, according to Harvard Physicist Jacob Barandes: all it takes is a stack of pancakes.</p><p>Barandes was a guest speaker at “The Mysteries of Time in Physics and Philosophy,” the second in the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-05/2021-virtual-creative-spring-workshops">Creative Workshop series</a> that metaLAB is offering this summer designed and led by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/snewman">Sarah Newman</a>, Director of Art &amp; Education at <a href="https://metalabharvard.github.io/">metaLAB at Harvard</a>, and supported by Olivia Tai, a student at Harvard College and research assistant at metaLAB. The workshop brought together sixty attendees from seventeen different countries.</p><p>The event began with Barandes discussing presentism and eternalism, two different theories of how time works. This discussion formed the basis of a hands-on creative exercise led by Newman and Tai to explore the “mysteries of&nbsp;time.”</p><p>Barandes framed time as follows: “Think of each layer in the stack as a successive moment in time. Roughly speaking, if you’re standing still, you’re at the same place in each successive pancake. You’re at the same place in the bottom pancake, the next pancake, the next pancake.”</p><p>Presentism, explained Barandes, can be thought of as the idea that we all experience the same pancake at the same time. This universal present, which Barandes likened to a hot pancake, is the only one in which we exist. This also means that neither the future nor the past is&nbsp;real.</p><p>Barandes then explained how <a href="https://www.space.com/36273-theory-special-relativity.html">Einstein’s theory of special relativity</a> serves as a challenge to presentism, which he also referred to as the A Model of&nbsp;time.</p><p>“The special theory of relativity says we do not all experience pancakes the same way,” Barandes&nbsp;said.</p><p>As explained by Barandes, Einstein’s theory of special relativity says that because the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer, there are repercussions for how time happens to each person. He said that the familiar, everyday laws of physics dictate that if someone threw a baseball on an airplane, a person outside the airplane would perceive the baseball to be moving at the combined speed of the throw and the airplane.</p><p>“But if you shine a light with the flashlight on the airplane, what Einstein said was, you on the airplane will perceive light travelling at the speed of light. Someone on the ground looking up will also see light going at the same constant speed. Light doesn’t combine. This is a very weird thing, it means that somehow time and space have to change,” Barandes&nbsp;said.</p><p>Space and time being relative and interconnected serves as a challenge to the idea that the present is experienced universally.</p><p>“Maybe the most profound weirdness here is that if you’re moving relative to someone else, then your pancake slices are not horizontal. Your pancake slices are slightly diagonal. So you don’t slice the pancakes horizontally anymore. If you’re moving, you slice the pancakes a little bit diagonally,” Barandes said. “And if different observers in different states of motion slice the stack of pancakes differently, that’s a challenge to the notion that one pancake slice is the ‘hot’ one for everybody. So that’s a challenge to presentism.”</p><p>Eternalism, which, Barandes explained, is known as the B Model, holds that the past, present, and future are all equally&nbsp;real.</p><p>The talk by Barandes primed the audience to form questions about time. Newman then guided participants through exercises to explore their own questions about&nbsp;time.</p><p>Tai guided the audience through a short meditation. The object, explained Tai, was to experience time in a different way than we usually do in our busy&nbsp;lives.</p><p>“The experience of time can feel very different when you are turning your intention inwards rather than outwards,” Tai&nbsp;said.</p><p>As part of the pre-work to the event, participants were encouraged to spend 90 seconds creating a timeline of their lives, which they had the opportunity to share with others during the workshop. Newman then prompted the group to write down things they “knew”,“believed”, and “didn’t know”. Participants were then asked to do the same exercise, except focusing on their knowledge of&nbsp;time.</p><p>From there, participants used these thought experiments to generate two of their own questions about time, which formed the foundations of the final steps of the workshop: exploring these questions visually by drawing them, and then creating physical sculptures to represent their&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>In preparation for the event, participants had been asked to spend ten minutes gathering materials ranging from “something that changes in time” to “two things that rhyme with each other.” After choosing one of their questions about time, participants created a sculpture to represent their question using the objects they gathered prior to the&nbsp;event.</p>A sculpture created by participant <a href="https://twitter.com/dashiel_carrera/status/1403374002232610821">Dashiel&nbsp;Carrera</a>.<p>Sculptures created by participants sought to explore questions such as “Could we have a functioning society without a supposedly objective passage of time, measured by clocks?” and “What would it look like if we perceived space as time and vice versa?” The resulting prototypes from the event were made of materials including lichen, incense, dice, and a bedspring.</p><p>Newman’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/473445114">methodology</a> for her creative workshops emphasizes the importance of asking questions, the value of interdisciplinary perspectives on hard topics, and then using found materials to physically wrestle with these abstract ideas. This allows workshop attendees to free their thinking when it comes to concepts that can be difficult to conceptualize. The event received positive feedback from attendants, one of whom <a href="https://twitter.com/silviabauer/status/1403380086380892162">said</a> that “time passed at light-speed” during the workshop.</p><p>The final event in the Creative Workshop series, entitled “Telegrams to Telepathic Memos: The Future of Trust and Truth Online,” was held on June 25. The metaLAB team will be displaying the creations from this workshop series&nbsp;<a href="https://metaworkshops.cargo.site/">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/meditation-and-metaphorical-pancakes-exploring-the-philosophy-and-physics-of-time-with-metalab-4e24d7713062">Meditation and Metaphorical Pancakes: Exploring the philosophy and physics of time with metaLAB</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Updates from our June Co-op&nbsp;Day <p>As is our custom, we held another monthly Co-op half day last week — a block of time scheduled and set aside to dive into some of the stickier issues and ideas of running a cooperative.</p><p>These are things that we can’t get to in our regular catch up meeting, and Co-op days are days when we sit down together, tackle the topics that are more long winded and build solutions for ourselves. It’s also a time for us to hang out, bond and generally team-build.</p> 🦋 We are open to evolving… some of the folks we’ve worked&nbsp;with<p>We Are Open is ticking along in the slow summer months with a general can-do attitude and some work from some lovely repeat clients. We are, however, not at capacity for the rest of the year, and so we talked about how to drum up more business. We’re lucky that we have folks knocking on our door quite a bit, but maybe we’ve gotten too comfortable with waiting for work to come&nbsp;in.</p><p>Of course we want to continue working with the good clients we have, but we also want new and exciting projects. We’re eager to learn about all the people doing good in the world, and we want to support them in their endeavours. We don’t want to be comfortable, we want to be inspired. So we set ourselves a goal of having 5 completely new clients each&nbsp;year.</p><p>To achieve this, we scheduled ourselves an “Hour of Power” each month — we’ll use this hour to actively look for interesting projects and people. We’re also going to, like, try this thing called “marketing”.</p> 🚀 Speaking of marketing… image from the PDF version of our&nbsp;website<p>We worked on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pdCdBJ_Eg5UW3OTn_aWhKoo8WBSUTBj0s-ZOTi3ug_s/edit?usp=sharing">PDF ‘information pack’ version</a> of our <a href="https://weareopen.coop">website</a> and a “<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aDkZ8zMv_VxsfcFn9gDXIvjzHspgSOUbH9T80MECSM4/edit#slide=id.ge22416d19e_0_54">WAO in 3 Slides</a>” deck. This might seem like a strange thing to do for digital activists like us, but there are a lot of people who are more likely to spend most of the day in their email inbox. We also put the finishing touches on our new Collaborator Contract to make it easy for us to contract talented people to fill holes in projects, or because we’re eager to work with&nbsp;others.</p><p>The latter proves tricky because, while we committed to all things open, we also have to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (“NDAs”) with certain clients. So there’s a tension between the two which we have to spell out in the contract. On the one hand we want collaborators (a.k.a. sub-contractors) to be open, on the other we want them to abide by&nbsp;NDAs.</p><p>Excitingly, we’ve come to the end of our first season of the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/podcast/">Tao of WAO podcast</a>. We’ll be back for another season at the end of the summer, so we gave a brief update of how that went in preparation for a full Season 1 Retrospective, which we worked on this&nbsp;week.</p> 🧦 Co-op&nbsp;IRL… it has been a while since we saw each others socks (not featured: Doug’s&nbsp;socks)<p>Our last order of business for our Co-op half day was to discuss the fact that we haven’t been in the same place in a year and a half. Covid halted travel for everyone, but we know how important in-person bonding time is. So we’re eager to find a time to meet up. WAO members don’t want to fly (see why in <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/spirit-of-wao">the Spirit of Us</a>), so we’ll likely head to The Netherlands and head there by train and ferry. It’s still hard to commit to travel, but we need to start talking about it. We’re thinking the first week in October, all things being&nbsp;equal.</p> 🌞 Summer&nbsp;days <p>We’re privileged that we can use the summer lull to plan for the fall, and we’re excited that we have some interesting work coming up. If you have projects that you’d like to talk to us about, now is a good time to schedule a 30 minute&nbsp;chat!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/where-does-work-come-from-d0cdb6952875">Where does “work” come from?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Conformance Testing for Measurable Goals</p><p>[Written in consultation with the<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability"> Interoperability Working Group</a>&nbsp;chairs]</p><p>A recurring topic in the Interoperability Working Group is that of defining short-, medium- and long-term goals or “targets” for interoperability. The topic comes up again every few months, and each time it does, the chairs try to tackle it head-on for a full meeting or two, some emails, and various off-line discussions, but doing so never seems to arrive at a satisfactory or definitive answer. Each time, what feels a Herculean outlay of effort only gets us a tentative resolution, as if we’d deflected a debt collector with a minimum payment. Dear reader, we would like to refinance, or at least restructure, this debt to our community!</p><p>In this two-part overview of our goals for 2021, we would like to survey the landscape of “provable,” testable interoperability targets and give some guidance on what we would like to see happen next in the testable interop world. Then, in a companion article, we will lay out clear proposal for parallel, distributed work on multiple fronts, such that progress can be distributed across various subcommunities and hubs of open cooperation, each reasonably confident that they are helping the big picture by “zooming in” on one set of problems.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christopherphigh">Christopher Paul&nbsp;High</a> A seemingly uncontroversial target&nbsp;state <p>Interoperation is a deceptively transparent etymology: any two things that perform a function are inter-operating if they can perform their operation together and mutually. Two fax machines interoperate if one sends a fax and the other receives it, which is a far more impressive feat if the two machines in question were designed and built by different companies on different continents, fifteen years apart. This is the kind of target state people usually have in mind when they imagine interoperability for an emerging technology.</p><p>This everyday example glosses over a lot of complexity and history, however. Standards bodies had already specified exact definitions of how the “handshake” is established between two unfamiliar fax machines before either model of fax machine was a twinkle in a design team’s eye. In addition to all the plodding, iterative standardization, there has also been a lot of economic trial and error and dead-ends we never heard about. Even acceptable margins of error and variance from the standards have been prototyped, refined, socialized, and normalized, such that generations of fax machines have taken them to heart, while entire factories have been set up to produce standard components like white-label fax chips and fax boards that can be used by many competing brands. On a software level, both design teams probably recycled some of the same libraries and low-level code, whether open-source or licensed.</p><p>Decomposing this example into its requirements at various levels shows how many interdependent and complex subsystems have to achieve internal maturity and sustainable relationships. A time-honored strategy is to treat each of these subsystems in a distinct, parallel maturation process and combine them gradually over time. The goal, after all, is not a working whole, but a working ecosystem. Architectural alternatives, for example, have to be debated carefully, particularly for disruptive and emerging technologies that redistribute power within business processes or ecosystems. Sharing (or better yet, responsibly open-sourcing and governing) common software libraries and low-level hardware specifications is often a “stitch in time” that saves nine later stitches, since it gives coordinators a stable baseline to work from,&nbsp;sooner.</p><p>Naturally, from even fifty or a hundred organizations committed to this target state, a thousand different (mostly sensible) strategies can arise. “How to proceed?” becomes a far-from-trivial question, even when all parties share many common goals and incentives. For instance, almost everyone:</p>  Wants to grow the pie of adoption and market&nbsp;interest  Holds privacy and decentralization as paramount commitments  Strives to avoid repeating the mistakes and assumptions of previous generations of internet technology  <p>And yet, all the same… both strategic and tactical differences arise, threatening to entrench themselves into camps or even schools of thought. How to achieve the same functional consensus on strategy as we have on principles? Our thesis here is that our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.</p> Today’s test suites and interoperability profiles <p>Perhaps the biggest differences turn out not to be about target state or principles, but about what exactly “conformance” means relative to what has already been specified and standardized. Namely, the core specifications for DIDs and VCs are both data models written in the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), which put protocols out of scope. This stems partly from the decisions of the groups convened in the W3C, and partly from a classic division of labor in the internet standards world between W3C, which traditionally governs the data models of web browser and servers, and a distinct group, the Internet Engineering Task Force&nbsp;(IETF).</p><p>VCs were specified first, with a preference (but not a requirement) for DIDs, with exact parameters for DIDs and DID systems deferred to a separate data model. Then, to accommodate entrenched and seemingly irreconcilable ideas about how DIDs could best be expressed, the DID data model was made less representationally-explicit and turned into an abstract data model. This shift to a representation-agnostic definition of DIDs, combined with the still-tentative and somewhat representation-specific communication and signing protocols defined to date, makes truly agnostic and cross-community data model conformance somewhat difficult to test. This holds back interoperability (and objective claims to conformance)!</p> W3C: Testing the core specifications <p>The only test suite associated with the core W3C specifications is the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/tree/main/packages/vc-http-api-test-server">VC-HTTP-API test suite </a>for VC data model conformance and the fledgling <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">DID-core test suite</a>, both worked on in the W3C-CCG. The former tests implementations of VC-handling systems against some pre-established sample data and test scripts through a deliberately generalized API interface that strives to be minimally opinionated with respect to context- and implementation-specific questions like API authentication. The latter is still taking shape, given that the DID spec has been very unstable in the home stretch of its editorial process arriving at CR this last&nbsp;week.</p><p>The VC-HTTP-API interface, specified collectively by the first <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">SVIP</a> funding cycle cohort for use in real-world VC systems, has been used in some contexts as a de facto general-purpose architecture profile, even if it is very open-ended on many architectural details traditionally specified in government or compliance profiles. Its authors and editors did not intend it to be the general-purpose profile for the VC data model generally, but in the absence of comparable alternatives, it is sometimes taken as one; it has perhaps taken on more of a definitive role than originally intended.</p><p>Following the second iteration of the SVIP program and the expansion of the cohort, the API and its test suite are poised to accrue features and coverage to make it more useful outside of its original context. Core participants have established a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/">weekly public call</a> at the CCG and a lively re-scoping/documentation process is currently underway to match the documentation and rationale documents to the diversity of contexts deploying the&nbsp;API.</p> Aries: End-to-end conformance testing <p>Other profiles, like the Aries interoperability profile, serve an important role, but it would be misleading to call it a VC data model test suite — it is more like an end-to-end test harness for showing successful implementation of the Aries protocols and architecture. Here “interoperability” means interoperability with other Aries systems, and conformance with the shared Aries interpretation of the standard VC data model and the protocols this community has defined on the basis of that interpretation.</p><p>Many matters specified by the W3C data model are abstracted out or addressed by shared libraries in Ursa, so its scope is not exactly coterminous with the W3C data model. Instead, the Aries interoperability profile has its own infrastructural focus, which focuses on scaling the privacy guarantees of blockchain-based ZKP systems. In many ways, this focus complements rather than supplants that of the W3C test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Many of the trickiest questions on which SSI systems differ are rooted in what the Aries and Trust-over-IP communities conceptualize as “<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack">layer 2</a>,” the connective infrastructural building-blocks connecting end-users to VCs and DIDs. As more and more features get added to be testable across language implementations, and as feature-parity is achieved with other systems (such as <a href="https://youtu.be/LC0OXAir3Qw">support for LD VCs</a>), the case for productive complementarity and deep interoperability gets easier and easier to&nbsp;make.</p> The first wave of local profiles and guidelines <p>Other specifications for decentralized-identity APIs and wallets, modelled on that W3C CCG and/or extending the work of Aries-based infrastructures, are starting to crop up around the world. So far these have all arisen out of ambitious government-funded programs to build infrastructure, often with an eye to local governance or healthy competition. Canada and the European Commission are the most high-profile ones to date, building on earlier work in Spain, the UK, and elsewhere; Germany and other countries funding next-generation trust frameworks may soon follow&nbsp;suit.</p><p>It is important, however, to avoid framing these tentative, sometimes cautious attempts at bridging status quo and new models as universal standards. If anything, these frameworks tend to come with major caveats and maturity disclaimers, on top of having carefully narrowed scopes. After all, they are generally the work of experienced regulators, inheriting decades of work exploring identity and infrastructural technologies through a patchwork of requirements and local profiles that tend to align over time. If they are designed with enough circumspection and dialogue, conformance with one should never make conformance with another impossible. (The authors would here like to extend heartfelt sympathy to all DIF members currently trying to conform to multiple of these at&nbsp;once!)</p><p>These profiles test concrete and specific interpretations of a shared data model that provide a testing benchmark for regulatory “green lighting” of specific implementations and perhaps even whole frameworks. Particularly when they specify best practices or requirements for security and API design, they create testable standardization by making explicit their opinions and assumptions about:</p>  approved cryptography,  auditing capabilities,  privacy requirements, and  API access/authentication  <p>These will probably always differ and make a universal abstraction impossible; and that’s not a bad thing! These requirements are always going to be specific to each regulatory context, and without them, innovation (and large-scale investment) are endangered by regulatory uncertainty. Navigating these multiple profiles is going to be a challenge in the coming years, as more of them come online and their differences come into relief as a stumbling block for widely-interoperable protocols with potentially global&nbsp;reach.</p><p>The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/setting-interoperability-targets-part-1-of-2-c6cbeaf82e98">Setting Interoperability Targets Part 1 of 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Medium-term interoperability challenges</p><p>[Written in consultation with the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability">Interoperability Working Group</a> chairs]</p><p>In our <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets/">last essay</a>, we explored the means and ends of interoperability targets and roadmapping across stacks and markets. “Interoperability,” like “standardization,” can be a general-purpose tool or an umbrella of concepts, but rarely works from the top-down. &nbsp;Instead, specific use-cases, consortia, contexts, and industries have to take the lead and prototype something more humble and specific like an “interoperability profile”-- over time, these propagate, get extended, get generalized, and congeal into a more universal and stable standard. Now, we’ll move on to some technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across stacks.</p><blockquote>What makes sense to start aligning now? What are some sensible scopes for interoperating today, or yesterday, to get our fledgling market to maturity and stability as soon as safely possible?</blockquote>Ponte Vecchio, Fiorenze, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/GHoX7zFRMMU">Ray Harrington</a> From testable goals to discrete scopes <p>The last few months have seen a shift in terminology and approach, as many groups turn their attention from broad “interoperability testing” to more focused “profiles” that test one subset of the optionalities and capabilities in a larger test suite or protocol definition. This decoupling of test suites from multiple profiles each suite can test helps any one profile from ossifying into a “universal” definition of decentralized identity’s core featureset. </p><p>As with any other emerging software field, every use case and context has its own interoperability priorities and constraints that narrow down the technological solution space into a manageable set of tradeoffs and decisions. &nbsp;For instance, end-user identification at various levels of assurance is often the most important implementation detail for, say, a retail bank, and DID-interoperability (which is not always the same thing!) might be a hardware manufacturer’s primary concern in being able to secure hardware supply chains. </p><p>Every industry has its unique set of minimum security guarantees, and VC-interoperability is obviously front-of-mind for credentialing use-cases. For example, in the medical data space, “Semantics” (data interpretation and metadata) might be a harder problem (or a more political one) than the mechanics of identity assurance, since high standards of end-user privacy and identity assurance have already made for a relatively interoperable starting points. &nbsp; Which exact subset of the many possible interoperability roadmaps is safest or most mission-critical for a given organization depends on many factors: the regulatory context, the culture of the relevant sectors, its incentive-structures, and its <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">business models</a>. </p><p>Cross-cutting industry verticals, however, are structural issues with how decentralized identity stacks and architecture vary, which can already been seen today. &nbsp;By applying “first principles,” (or in our case, the “<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">functions</a>” of a decentralized identity system and its many moving parts) across use-cases and industrial contexts, certain shared problems arise. As is our default approach in DIF Interop WG, we applied DIF’s in-house <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/interop-mapping-version-by-Hakan-Yildiz(TUB).pdf">mental model</a> of the “5 layers” of decentralized identity systems, sometimes called “the 4+1 layers”. (See also the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/raw/master/assets/crosscommunity-architecture-survey-oct-2020.pdf">more detailed version</a>).</p><p>We call these the “4+1” layers because our group agreed that a strict layering was not possible, and that all the architectures we compared for using verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers had to make major architectural decisions with consequences across all four of the more properly “layered” categories. This fifth category we named “transversal considerations,” since they traverse the layers and often come from architectural constraints imposed by regulation, industrial context, etc. Foremost among these are storage and authorization, the two most vexing and cross-cutting problems in software generally; these would justify an entirely separate article.</p><p>In a sense, none of the topics from this transversal category are good candidates for specification in the medium-term across verticals and communities-- they are simply too big as problems, rarely specific to identity issues, and being addressed elsewhere. These include “storage” (subject of our newest <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working group</a>), “authorization” (debatably the core problem of all computer science!), “cryptographic primitives”, and “compliance.” (These last two are each the subject of a new working group, <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/crypto.html">Applied Cryptography</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallet Security</a>!). These interoperability scopes are quite difficult to tackle quickly, or without a strong standards background. Indeed, these kinds of foundational changes require <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">incremental advances</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">broad cooperation</a> with large community organizations. This is slow, foundation work that needs to connect parallel work across data governance, authentication/authorization, and storage in software more generally.</p><p>Similarly, the fourth layer, where ecosystem-, platform-, and industry-specific considerations constrain application design and business models, is unlikely to crystallize into a problem space calling out for a single specification or prototype in the medium-term future. Here, markets are splintered and it is unclear what can be repurposed or recycled outside of its original context. Even if there were cases where specification at this later would be timely, DIF members might well choose to discuss those kinds of governance issues at our sister-organizations in the space that more centrally address data governance at industry-, ecosystem-, or national- scale: <a href="http://trustoverip.org">Trust over IP</a> was chartered to design large-scale governance processes, and older organizations like <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData.org</a> and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> also have working groups and publications on vertical-specific and jurisdiction-specific best practices for picking interoperable protocols and data formats.</p><p>That still leaves three “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is our contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community-- and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all three.</p> Scope #1: Verifiable Credential Exchange <p>The most clear and consensus-building, even urgent way forward is to bring clarity to Verifiable Credential exchange across stacks. &nbsp;This has been the primary focus of our WG for the last year. Given that most of the early ecosystem-scale interest in SSI revolves around <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#vc-infrastructure-layer-3">credentialing</a> (educational credentials, employment credentials, health records), it is highly strategic to get translation and unified protocols into place soon for the interoperable verification and cross-issuance of credentials. </p><p>In fact, there has actually been a lot of good progress made since Daniel Hardman wrote an <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">essay</a> on the Evernym blog making a pragmatic case for sidestepping differences in architecture and approach to exchange VCs sooner. This aligned with much of our group’s work in recent months, which has included a <a href="https://hackmd.io/t1cotiReTXCnkpDG8k2tVA#THE-MAIN-EVENT">survey of VC formats</a> among organizations producing “wallets” for verifiable credentials (be they “edge” wallets or otherwise). Our group has also sought to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8j6niRuFWTjVMIXqmw3zX-4KkLt-sli8">assist educational efforts</a> at the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>, in the Claims and Credentials <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">working group</a>, and elsewhere to make wallet-producing organizations aware of the relevant <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/vc-spec-map">specifications</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/dif/be6763341a014d248f655aea187d7890?v=c9ac48a07f3d411c9a1bea32b55f7e76">other references</a> needed to make their wallets multi-format sooner and less painfully. Much of this work was crystalized into an <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">article</a> by co-chair Kaliya Young and crowd-edited by the whole group; this work was a major guiding structure for the Good Health Pass work that sought to make a common health record format (exported from FHIR systems) equally holdable and presentable across all of today’s VC systems.</p><p>One outgrowth of this effort and other alignments that have taken place since Hardman’s and Young’s article is the work of prototyping a multi-community exchange protocol that allow a subset of each stack’s capabilities and modes to interoperate. This tentative, “minimum viable profile” is called <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">WACI-PEx</a> and is currently a work item of the Claims and Credentials working group. Work is ongoing on v0.1, and an ambitious, more fully-featured v1 is planned for after that. This profile acts as an “extension” of the broader Presentation Exchange protocol, giving a handy “cheat sheet” for cross-stack wallet-to-issuer/verifier handshakes so that developers not familiar with all the stacks and protocols being spanned have a starting point for VC exchanges. &nbsp;Crucially, the results of this collaborative prototype will be taken as inputs to future versions of the DIDComm protocols and the WACI specification for Presentation Exchange. </p><p>Note: There has been some discussion of a OIDC-Presentation Exchange profile at some point in the future, but given that the alignment of DIDComm and Presentation Exchange started over a year ago, the most likely outcome is that work on this would not start until after v1 has been released of the “WACI-PEx” profile for DIDComm has been released.</p> Scope #2: Anchoring layer <p>Of course, other forms of alignment are possible as well in the “bottom 3” layers of the traditional stack, while we wait on the ambitious transversal alignment specifications and the ongoing work to align and simplify cross-format support for VCs (and perhaps even multi-format VCs, as Hardman points out in the essay above). </p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery</a> WG at DIF has long housed many work items to align on the lowest level of stack, including general-purpose <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-common-java">common libraries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">recovery mechanisms</a>. It has also received many donations that contribute to method-level alignment, including a recent <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/trinsic-donates-did-key-rs-to-i-d-wg-8a278f37bcd0?source=friends_link&amp;sk=dbd175f5db9107ed1e9d953a386441a4">DID-Key implementation</a> and a linked-data <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-document-loader">document loader</a> donated by Transmute. The group has also served as a friendly gathering point for discussing calls for input from the DID-core working group at W3C and for proposing W3C-CCG work items.</p><p>One particularly noteworthy initiative of the group has been the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540?source=friends_link&amp;sk=306a37f289dcf61a89d19cd11f5be04e">Universal Resolver</a> project, which offers a kind of “trusted middleware” approach to DID resolution across methods. This prototype of a general-use server allows any SSI system (or non-SSI system) to submit a DID and get back a trustworthy DID Document, without needing any knowledge of or access to (much less current knowledge of or authenticated access to) the “black box” of the participating DID methods. While this project only extends “passive interoperability” to DIDs, i.e., only allowing DID document querying, a more ambitious sister project, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, strives to bring a core set of CRUD capabilities to DID documents for DID methods willing to contribute drivers. Both projects have dedicated weekly calls on the DIF calendar, for people looking to submit drivers or get otherwise involved.</p> Scope #3: “Agent”/Infrastructure Layer <p>There is another layer, however, in between DIDs and VCs, about which we haven’t spoken yet: the crucial “agent layer” in the ToIP/Aries mental model, which encompasses trusted infrastructure whether in or outside of conventional clouds. The Aries Project has scaled up an impressively mature ecosystem of companies and experimenters, largely thanks to the robust infrastructure layer it built (and abstracting away from application-layer developers and experimenters).</p><p>Until now, differences of strategy with respect to conventional clouds and infrastructures have prevented large-scale cooperation and standardization at this layer outside of Aries and the DID-Comm project. Partly, this has been a natural outgrowth of the drastically different infrastructural needs and assumptions of non-human, enterprise, and consumer-facing/individual use cases, which differ more at this level than above or below. Partly, this is a function of the economics of our sector’s short history, largely influenced by the infrastructure strategies of cloud providers and telecommunication concerns.</p><p>This is starting to change, however, now that agent frameworks inspired by the precedent set by the Aries frameworks have come into maturity. Mattr’s <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/verifiable-credentials-with-auth0-and-mattr/">VIII Platform</a>, the Affinidi framework SDK (including open-source <a href="https://docs.affinidi.com/interop">components by</a> DIF members Bloom, Transmute, and Jolocom), ConsenSys’ own modular, highly <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/veramo_agent/plugins">extensible</a> and interoperable <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> platform, and most recently Spruce ID’s very <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">DID-method-agnostic</a> <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a>/<a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">Credible</a> SDK all offer open-source, extensible, and scalable infrastructure layers that are driving the space towards greater modularity and alignment at this layer. </p><p>As these platforms and “end-to-end stacks” evolve into frameworks extensible and capacious enough to house ecosystems, DIF expects alignment and harmonization to develop. This could mean standardization of specific components at this layer, for example:</p>  The DIDComm protocol could expand into new <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-looker-jwm-01.html">envelopes</a> and transports  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">Control recovery</a> mechanisms could be specified across implementations or even standardized on a technical and/or UX level  Auditing or historical-query requirements could be specified to form a cross-framework protocol or primitive  Common usages of foreign function interfaces, remote procedure calls like gRPC and JSON-RPC, or other forms of “glue” allowing elements to be reused or mixed and matched across languages and architectures could be specified as a community<br>  <p>We are very much in early days, but some see on the horizon a day when frameworks that don’t cooperate with one another can’t compete with the ones that join forces. After all, adoption brings growing pains, particularly for the labor market-- aligning on architectures and frameworks makes onboarding developers and transferring experience that much easier to do!</p> Next Steps <p>I would encourage anyone who has read this far to pick at least one of the three scopes mentioned above and ask themselves how they are helping along this alignment process in their day-to-day work, and if they truly understand what major players at that level are doing. Often large for-profit companies pay the most attention to what their competitors are doing, but here it is important to think outside of competition and look instead at non-profit organizations, regulators, and coalitions of various kinds to really see where the puck is heading. Sometimes consensus on one level is blocking compromise somewhere else. &nbsp;It can be pretty hard to follow!</p><p>In recent articles, DIF has encouraged its members to think about an open-source strategy as comparably important to a business plan, a living document and guiding philosophy. I would like to suggest that the subset of DIF companies working with VCs and DIDs should also think of interoperability strategy and conformance testing as the most crucial pillar of that strategy-- if you cannot demonstrate interoperability, you might be asking people to take that strategy on faith!</p>

This update will improve EWC performance and security, and keep the EWC aligned with the latest developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.  If you are running an EWC node, you must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update it to a Berlin-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+Berlin+Hardfork">update the chainspec</a> as soon as possible. EWC validators have already completed all the necessary updates.  If you are an EWC user or EWT holder, no action is required.  <p>In April 2021 the Ethereum mainnet implemented the Berlin upgrade, which introduced four improvement proposals (i.e., <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565">EIP-2565</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718">EIP-2718</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929">EIP-2929</a>, and <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930">EIP-2930</a>) that modified gas prices and created new transaction types. Combined, these updates improve the overall performance and security of EVM blockchains (including the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain).</p><p>In May 2021, after observing the successful Ethereum upgrade, <a href="https://validators.energyweb.org/">the EWC validators</a> voted to adopt Berlin on the EWC as well. Since then the EWC validators have successfully implemented the upgrade on the <a href="https://volta-explorer.energyweb.org/">Volta test network</a> and are now preparing for the upgrade to occur on the main&nbsp;EWC.</p><p>The EWC Berlin upgrade will occur at <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org">block 12,649,625</a>, which will occur on or around Tuesday, 6 July (the precise time will depend on block time variation). All full node operators must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update their node to a Berlin-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+Berlin+Hardfork">implement the Berlin chainspec</a> prior to the hard fork transition block. Due to subtle variations in the EWC block time, it is recommended to perform the update several days prior to the expected transition date.</p> FAQ <p>Who does this announcement impact?</p><blockquote>This announcement only impacts people or organizations that are operating a full node on the EWC. All EWC node operators should update the client and chainspec as soon as possible. As of the time of publication, all EWC validators have already completed the necessary updates to successfully implement the Berlin upgrades.</blockquote><p>If I’m an EWT holder but I’m not operating my own full node, is there anything I need to&nbsp;do?</p><blockquote>No, if you connect to the EWC via the public RPC and Metamask, an exchange (including Kucoin, Kraken, Liquid, Bitmart, or Hotbit), a web wallet (e.g., MyCrypto), or hardware wallet (e.g., Trezor, Ledger) then you do not need to take any&nbsp;action.</blockquote><p>Why is the Berlin upgrade happening on the&nbsp;EWC?</p><blockquote>The <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">EWC is a public, proof-of-authority EVM blockchain</a> and it benefits from adopting the latest upgrades and improvements from the wider Ethereum community. The EWC validators voted to adopt the upgrades contained in the Berlin fork in May&nbsp;2021.</blockquote><p>What will happen before, during, and after the&nbsp;upgrade?</p><p>As mentioned above, the decision to proceed with the upgrade is made by the EWC validators via the established governance process. After the decision is approved and before the upgrade occurs, all EWC validators and other node operators will update their node clients and chainspecs. During the upgrade (i.e., at the specified transition block), the new rules defined within the improvement proposals will take effect, creating a “new and improved” version of the EWC. There are no expected operational or performance impacts to the EWC during the upgrade. Following the upgrade, users and node operators can continue to interact with the EWC as&nbsp;normal.</p><p>If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please get in touch via our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/psraNwqGqp">Discord</a> channels.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/announcing-the-berlin-upgrade-on-the-energy-web-chain-98c8da76054b">Announcing the Berlin Upgrade on the Energy Web Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Still frame from The Intersection<p>By Julia Solano, Eshanthi Ranasinghe, and Nicole Allred, Exploration &amp; Future Sensing, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p> The Intersection, a short film in collaboration with Superflux, creates a hopeful future that reimagines extractive, hyperconnected technology to serve community, support nature, and value human relationships. Watch&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys4df32IvrA">here</a>. <p>My low balance of -$1.50 glows red above my wrist as I cross through the turnstile and enter the station. Options to top up via crypto or credit are greyed out on my digital wallet; those accounts are empty. Guess I’m watching the ads today, just like they’re watching&nbsp;me.</p><p>As I sit down on the train, images — shoes I’ve always wanted, modeled by my favorite influencers, with payment plans to shrug off my empty bank account — flash before my eyes. There’s no hiding from them — the algorithms track my eye-movement, my heartbeat, my temperature. They know what I want before I&nbsp;do…</p><p>Technology is causing our perception of reality — and of each other — to splinter. The same stories and facts can be twisted and contorted to fit a desired narrative depending on which slice of the web we are tuned into. Social media content is engineered for our reaction, “taking our hopes and fears, our pain and suffering and using it as content between ads” (The Intersection); pitting us against each other in a race to the bottom line. We live in fundamentally different worlds — each with its own set of facts — depending on the media we&nbsp;consume.</p><blockquote>The average person touches their phone 2,617 times every day, and cellphone addiction (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/nomophobia">nomophobia</a>: the fear of going without your phone) is rising. This begs the question: Are we driving technology, or is our technology driving&nbsp;us?</blockquote>Still frame from The Intersection What if this reality wasn’t limited to our&nbsp;screens? <p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/ingestibles-wearables-and-embeddables">Ingestibles, wearables, embeddables</a>; smart homes and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/02/ring-camera-fears/">peer-to-peer surveillance</a>; the Internet of Things (IoT) and <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/industrial-internet-of-things-iiot">Industrial IoT</a>; 5G; <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/smart-cities-digital-solutions-for-a-more-livable-future">smart cities</a>; facial recognition, temperature checking <a href="https://dronelife.com/2020/03/31/this-pandemic-drone-can-see-who-has-a-temperature-or-coughs/">pandemic drones</a>, and satellite imagery — a new layer of ambient (ever-present, always-on, hyper-connected) technology is seamlessly enveloping the world around us. Ambient data collection and algorithmic decision-making allow our physical environments, like our devices, to be infiltrated with information and metadata constantly gleaned from our search histories, our purchases, our locations, our sleep patterns, our menstrual cycles.</p><p>Our physical and digital worlds are developing to become almost indistinguishable. This web of ambient technology is shaping our new reality. Question is, is that what we&nbsp;want?</p><blockquote>With the encompassing and interconnected nature of ambient technology, we are barreling towards a society in which each interaction with the physical and digital world is fair game for extraction and exploitation.</blockquote><p>This world isn’t science fiction — its creation is in progress, atop a complex web of existing technologies and systems already leveraging the personal data of&nbsp;users.</p>Still frame from The Intersection<p>Omidyar Network’s Exploration and Future Sensing team has been tracking this evolving trend since 2018. Our initial investigations provoked many questions: What could this world look like with a new layer of ambient technology? What currently drives its development and the course it takes? What is the experience of those already commonly marginalized, excluded, and/or discriminated against in current tech and surveillance systems? What might be the experience of immigrants, minorities, elderly, special needs, rural, urban, etc in this world? How could our interaction with technology, government, companies, society, each other change? Will these technology developments only be extractive, or is there a world where they could be supportive, or even regenerative? Is it possible for this world to be designed from a place that acknowledges our interconnectedness and centers diverse perspectives?</p> Making of “The Intersection” <p>To provoke the possibilities of this hyper-connected world, we partnered with <a href="https://superflux.in/index.php/work/the-intersection/#">Superflux</a>, a speculative design and foresight agency. We hoped to provoke imagination about futures that could evolve what we, collectively, would like our relationship with technology to be, as we build the infrastructure, protocols, norms, social structures, and policies, for a technology ecosystem that can be empowering for us&nbsp;all.</p><blockquote>“I don’t want the tech we build to consume the world, but to augment and support it. We’re starting to build something new. A new way of networking and connecting. The tech was built from the ground up. To support people, instead of mining them.” — The Intersection</blockquote><p>Together we produced “<a href="http://the-intersection.io/">The Intersection</a>”, a short film that explores the future of ambient technology through the lens of four protagonists whose lives have been shaped by the dissonance of extractive technology norms, misinformation, surveillance capitalism, and context collapse:</p>  Ericka, a young activist whose movement for justice is derailed by a never-ending feed of misinformation and conspiracies concocted to extract&nbsp;data.  Jake, a journalist whose work is diluted and corrupted by AI systems that helped him prioritize clicks over the truth, taking news out of context and pandering to readers’ “intensely monitored, precisely categorized fears.”  Amp, a hardware engineer who set out to change the world using technology, only to have her utopian dream shattered by the realization that the only problem she was solving was finding new ways for technology companies to make&nbsp;money.  Tammi, a climate migrant who became a refugee in her own country because her family refused to evacuate in the face of an impending storm, citing “fake news”&nbsp;reports.  Still frame from The Intersection<p>As the film begins, the future of ambient tech is all-encompassing and ever present in every aspect of life. Individually, then together, the protagonists find ways to re-evaluate their relationships with technology — to repurpose and redesign ambient tech to serve their communities, support nature, and value human relationships. They come together to reconcile their differences — illustrating how people can be united by a common purpose, regardless of how different their backgrounds and world views may be. The film ends at a new beginning, open to audiences to shape — where could we head from here? What would we do today, if we knew this is where we were&nbsp;heading?</p><blockquote>“We wanted to show in an experiential way, the interconnected nature of the issues present in our world. Whether environmental, social or technological, these domains don’t reside within neat categories, they overlap and intermingle, giving birth to new hybrid forms that are as tricky to define as they are to address”– Anab Jain &amp; Jon Ardern, Superflux.</blockquote><p>We hope this film makes the future of ambient technology more tangible, prompts us to investigate our relationship with technology, and encourages us to build towards a more just, pluralistic world that centers the experiences of those most marginalized among&nbsp;us.</p><p>Watch the Intersection <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys4df32IvrA">here</a>.

 AKA Tao of WAO (but not the&nbsp;podcast) <p>As the state of the world has…evolved/deteriorated…<a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open</a> members have dealt with these changes and challenges in various ways. The co-op has grown up a lot over the last five years and with growing comes random conversations in which someone says “Do we need a policy on…?” This is adulting&nbsp;pure.</p><p>In April, we had a existential chat about the climate emergency, racial justice, lost traditions and more, and we decided that we wanted to write a page that summarises the points we agree&nbsp;on.</p>CC-BY-ND <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/hashtag/activism/">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>We’ve published our <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/spirit-of-wao">new page</a> on our wiki and are republishing here:</p> Spirit of&nbsp;WAO <p>In our April 2021 co-op day, we spoke about climate, justice, etc and would like to have a page that shows our&nbsp;spirit.</p><p>WAO is a collective of individuals who broadly agree on many things. Like any group of people, there are nuanced differences in our positions on the issues of the day, so instead of corporate pronouncements, this page exists to share what we believe in. It’s the product of discussion and debate during our monthly co-op&nbsp;days.</p><p>We believe in:<br> • Placing ourselves and our work in historical and social contexts so that we can make thoughtful decisions about our behaviours and mindsets.<br> • Seeing ourselves as part of nature not the rulers of it and acknowledging that there is a climate emergency. We are conscious of the lost lessons and spirit of the indigenous and strive for climate justice.<br> • Sharing resources to help combat prejudice wherever we see it (including, but not limited to: racism, sexism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and hostility relating to education or socio-economic status).</p><p>Instead of policies, we believe in dialogue that leads to action. Our members think carefully about charitable giving, and we have decided to make this an individual matter of conscience rather than a collective decision. As a cooperative, we consciously review the amount of travel we do for work, especially air&nbsp;travel.</p><p>One tool we’ve found useful in thinking about this is the Venn diagram (shown below) shared by the How to Save a Planet podcast. At the centre of what we’re good at, what needs doing, and what brings us joy is the work that makes a difference.</p><p>So to summarise, while you absolutely will see WAO members out on the street doing in-person activism, that’s not everyone’s style. Some of us run websites dedicated to informing people about important issues. Others are members of hyperlocal groups helping make the world a better&nbsp;place.</p><p>However we do it, WAO members do it intentionally and not because we have a policy for&nbsp;it.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/spirit-of-wao">See our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p> Instead of virtue signalling, get to&nbsp;work <p>Over the last year and a half, our members did courses (some of which the co-op paid for), went to demos, read a bunch of stuff and donated to various causes. They reflected on <a href="https://medium.com/@LauraHilliger/quietly-paying-attention-b4add24684df">their own</a> and together. We are not perfect, haven’t necessarily had an easy time of it, but at we keep doing the work we believe in, and we keep thinking about how our actions create&nbsp;impact.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/spirit-of-wao-e5cb23c8cdfb">Spirit of WAO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What is MiCA?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MiCA is the Acronym of Markets in Crypto Assets</p>
<p>The EU will create a SINGLE regulation &nbsp; for ALL 28 members Countries regarding Crypto</p>
<p>A Regulation..&nbsp; Basically&nbsp; is a LAW IMPOSED upon all countries immediately that supersedes any national regulations.</p>
<p>MiCA Regulation therefore is a single set of rules , Immediately applicable, Throughout the Single Market.</p>
<p>Is MiCA good or bad?</p>
<p>To Answer this question let’s focus on why they are doing it. The EU is drafting new strategy on digital finance for the EU financial sector. The EU with MiCA aims to ensure that the EU embraces the Blockchain revolution and become leader with innovative European firms in the lead, On one side they want&nbsp; to be innovation-Friendly to make digital finance available to European consumers and businesses. On the other side wants to&nbsp; mitigate the risk to consumers (and banks).</p>
<p>MiCA Objectives</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 First objective give LEGAL CERTAINTY to&nbsp; crypto-asset markets. The EU thinks there is a need for a sound legal framework, clearly defining the regulatory treatment of all crypto-assets that are not covered by existing EU legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Second objective is to SUPPORT INNOVATION.&nbsp; The EU wants to&nbsp; Promote crypto-assets development and new user cases while putting in place a safe and proportionate framework to support innovation and fair competition. 
 Third objective is CONSUMER PROTECTION. The EU thinks crypto-assets present many of the same risks as traditional&nbsp; financial instruments.&nbsp; 
 Fourth objective is to ensure FINANCIAL STABILITY. The EU is literally&nbsp; terrified by ‘stablecoins’, because&nbsp; unlike cryptocurrencies have the potential to become widely accepted and potentially systemic disruptive for the status quo.&nbsp;

<p>By CV Madhukar, Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>In a world where digitization ubiquitous, we now have an opportunity to shape digital ID programs and other components of the digital public infrastructure in a direction that serves the <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-unpacks-good-id-update-our-point-view-digital-identity/">public interest</a> and powers the digital economy, rather than only serving private corporate interests.</p><p>Back in 2015, the UN Sustainable Development goals called for “legal identity for all” by 2030. At the time, the World Bank released data which revealed that 1.5 billion people in the world lacked formal identification. Those working on financial inclusion challenges were among the first to articulate the societal cost of this gap; if a person is unable to identify themself, then they will be unable to engage in for the formal financial system and economic growth will&nbsp;stall.</p><p>Yet conversations about digital identity innovation were mostly treated as a developing country issue, with ardent advocates in the West unwilling to acknowledge that digital identity could add value to developed economies. Now, as the world <a href="https://omidyar.com/a-decade-of-digital-public-goods-holding-up-the-digital-economy-preventing-monopolies-and-safeguarding-freedoms-for-all/">emerges from the pandemic</a>, attitudes seem to have taken a 180-degree turn.</p><p>The recognition that digital identification is increasingly central to the digital public infrastructure (that is, digital spaces for the public good) is gaining currency worldwide. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposed the creation of trusted and secure “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">Digital Identity for all Europeans</a>”. This is expected to go into effect in late 2022. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also spoke in February about the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0023">need for Digital IDs</a>, saying, “The same digital ID technology that protects against money laundering can also help us reach more people with&nbsp;relief.”</p><p>Every country will need to reimagine its technology infrastructure and make it fit-or-purpose for a digital century. While developing countries suffer from lack of technology infrastructure, developed economies have legacy systems that need urgent reimagining. The Clinton era effort of “Reinventing Government” will need a whole new makeover right now in the US with regard to reimagining technology infrastructure. But to really reimagine this, key stakeholders will need to overcome a deep chasm caused by the compartmentalization in thinking about the role of public sector and the private&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In her important work on the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/final_the_entrepreneurial_state_and_public_options.pdf">Entrepreneurial State</a>, noted economist Mariana Mazzucato argues that the state as a fixer of market failures offers a limited view. The state as a market shaper and market maker is less recognized in the US, even though the state (through DARPA, NIH, etc.) has had a deep impact on the course of innovation in the private sector over several&nbsp;decades.</p><p>The very nature of infrastructure is such that it is an enabler for private sector economic activity. In the digital era, such infrastructure also has the ability to ”see” every transaction that takes place in these digital spaces. That is why when a website that requires some form of identification asks offers the option to login in with Facebook or Gmail credentials, the big tech platforms get to see much of the activity that the individual does on this third-party website. Similarly, when a payment platform uses the infrastructure provided by Visa or Mastercard, these companies gain insights on financial activity of the individuals that use such a provider.</p><p>At a time where data will be a “factor of production” in the new digital economy, those providing such infrastructure will naturally become massive monopolies or oligopolies. Using antitrust laws to remedy this without recognizing what caused data monopolies in the first place, is like trying to pick up water with a sieve. We need viable and scalable public alternatives for the existing digital infrastructure to truly curb such monopolies. This will provide a level playing field for all private market players, create the basis for interoperability, prevent data monopolies, and make services more accessible for individuals.</p><p>This is, according to a recent <a href="https://www.journalismliberty.org/publications/what-is-digital-public-infrastructure">paper</a> by Ethan Zuckerman, the strongest case for policymakers to take urgent and concrete measures for the development and adoption of digital public infrastructure as a way of shaping the trajectory of the future digital&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We need governments to own this agenda so that any new conception of digital public infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of safeguards. Even as we think about such large-scale deployment of technology, we must deliberately think about unintended consequences of such efforts and mitigate them. Safeguards in the form of technology, law, and institutions must drive the norms and behavior of both the designers of technology and its users, and the government must guarantee these protections. The financial sector or the pharmaceutical industry can offer valuable lessons in this&nbsp;regard.</p><p>Reimagining digital public infrastructure could have a positive, transformative impact on the global economy and global development. But it’s going to be important for the US and Europe to install safe and inclusive, digital public infrastructure (like federated digital ID and payment platforms) to see real change. If they make this kind of investment, we can begin to build a world where gaps in technology won’t limit the development programs governments can implement, the progress they can make, or support they can give people to improve their own&nbsp;lives.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-digital-public-infrastructure-is-no-longer-just-a-development-agenda-6c3915d20598">Reimagining digital public infrastructure is no longer just a development agenda</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>THE FUTURE OF EQUITY CROWDFUNDING RUNS ON BLOCKCHAIN</p>
<p>(Milan 28 June ) 2Meet2Biz.com, equity crowdfunding and debt platform, is the first among the platforms authorized by Consob to use blockchain technology to manage all internal document processes, thanks to its presence, as a validator node, on the Commercio.network blockchain.</p>
<p>With equity crowdfunding Startups and SMEs can collect risk capital to finance the birth or the development of their business project.&nbsp; Italy has been among the first countries to regulate this kind of investment creating a real ecosystem and an official registry by Consob. In recent years the sector has evolved in terms of the number of platforms and capital raised, as well as the number of transactions managed, but from a technological point of view few steps have been taken.</p>
<p>The desire to use blockchain technology in 2meet2biz stems from a precise need: to apply the potential of a blockchain to the processes that normally characterize equity crowdfunding campaigns and that, by type, are essentially replicable and procedurizable for all bidding companies.</p>
<p>That’s why 2meet2biz, developed and managed by Migliora Srl, has embarked on an absolutely innovative path: to ensure to its corporate clients, as well as to all investors who join the campaigns, transparency, security and immutability of all processes related to the collection of capital, from the receipt of the initial documentation until the conclusion of the campaign, this thanks to a blockchain technology compliant, moreover, to the eIDAS directives.</p>
<p>For the same reason – to integrate with third party technologies with the aim of improving efficiency and security in economic and financial transactions – 2meet2biz has chosen to use an open banking software system, fully integrated into 2meet2biz, which through APIs securely guarantees financial flows, automating all phases of bank reconciliations and transactions.</p>
<p>2Meet2Biz.com is now part of Commercio.network, a blockchain that since 2018 has enabled all companies around the world to manage the three indispensable fiduciary processes of digital transformation: Creating a digital identity with eID, signing a document with eSignature and certifying the exchange of documents with eDelivery. Thanks to this the customer experience of the platform is ZERO PAPER and the processes from onboarding to eKYC (electronic know your customer) are totally digital.</p>
<p>2Meet2Biz.com has become the 45th of the 100 validator nodes of commercio.network joining the most important European players already present, such as Namirial, Infocert, VAR Group Zucchetti. Being a Validator Node means to participate in the most innovative, sustainable and advanced European project in the Blockchain field, also proposed as a technology for the EBSI call for proposals financed through PCP by the European Commission.</p>
<p>This step from one side is part of a very precise strategy, that is to integrate 2meet2biz with</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commerce Network</p>
<p>third party technologies that allow it to progressively improve the customer experience of all its customers, and on the other hand it is the first step of a wider project to exploit all the potentialities</p>
<p>that this business model intends to offer, from a procedural point of view and not only, ensuring a degree of transparency never seen in its sector in full compliance with EU MICA directives.</p>
<p>2meet2biz intends to guide the processes of crowd campaigns through the digital transformation, with the development and use of SAAS technologies able to make even the investment process innovative, both for principals and investors, maximizing the value chain of the campaigns presented, from their origin to the access to the target market. A new international strategic approach, with a path that will soon be applicable to all investors, involving partners with platforms that comply with the standards required by the European regulatory bodies.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Alliance Staff</p>



<p>The digital security, privacy and authentication landscape is evolving quickly in the European Union with new regulations that could have a broad ranging impact for its citizens, as well as companies around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Focus on Europe, which was held on June 17, experts on the authentication market in Europe provided insight into the latest developments including PSD2 SCA (Payment Services Directive Strong Customer Authentication), delegated authentication, eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) and the EU Digital Wallet among other efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Kicking off the virtual summit, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance outlined how the FIDO specifications work and why strong authentication is essential for multiple use cases including ecommerce, Internet of Things (IoT) and identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“FIDO’s goal from day one was to certainly reduce reliance on passwords, but in some ways that was just a means to an end, really trying to address the data breach problem, as the vast majority of data breaches are caused by weak credentials,” Shikiar said.</p>



<p>As FIDO is moving forward, there has been a need to strengthen identity verification assurance to support better and safer account recovery. As part of that, Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance launched the Identity Verification &amp; Binding Working Group (IDWG) which is driving that work forward.</p>



<p>“We’re seeking to establish best practices for possession based identity verification,” Shikiar said. “That will not only enable safer, easier and stronger account recovery, but doing so will also stop hackers from using the account recovery process as an opening for social engineering account takeovers.”</p>



<p>Helping to Limit Cart Abandonment</p>



  



<p>There is a tangible connection between ecommerce success and strong authentication, according to Rolf Lindemann, VP products at NokNok.</p>



<p>Lindermann noted that during the pandemic, ecommerce grew faster than ever before. But with 13% of credit card online payments not being completed, it’s clear that cart abandonment is still impacting business in a significant manner.</p>



<p>“We learned that authentication friction in general is a major factor for card abandonment,” Lindermann said. “This becomes obvious given that online authentication is at the core of all online transactions. Authentication is the front door to digital services in general.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The path to reducing authentication friction involves the use of FIDO, which Lindermann said can help to enable strong customer authentication that can be implemented in a single convenient step.</p>



<p>Toward a Strongly Authenticated Digital Identity&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Europe and elsewhere around the world, there is a growing conversation about the need to enable and provide some form of digital identity. According to Steve Pannifer, COO of Consult Hyperion, digital identity consists of three things: identification, authentication and authorization.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Pannifer explained that identification is all about asking the question – is this person real, unique and identifiable? Authentication is the process of realizing that an identified person is coming in to use the service again, as the service provider wants to know if it is the same person that established the identity at some point in the past. Authorization ties it all together, which uses identity and authentication to access services.</p>



<p>“Digital identity is not a means in and of itself, it’s a means to an end,” Pannifer said. “The end that it is serving is all of those services that I’m trying to get access to.”</p>



<p>Fabian Eberle, co-founder and COO at <a href="https://keyless.io/">Keyless</a> is also a big believer in digital identity. In a session, Eberle outlined the need for a decentralized system for personal identity management. Such a system puts users in control of their own identity information, and lets them selectively disclose that identity data in a more private and secure way.</p>



<p>Eberle noted that at LUISS Guido Carli University, over 10,000 students are now benefiting from a digital identity system that helps to support remote education services. The Keyless approach benefits from FIDO standards that helps to authenticate a device and identify students in a frictionless approach.</p>



<p>Digital Identity in Europe: eIDAS</p>



<p>In the European Union, there is an effort known as <a href="https://www.eid.as/">eIDAS</a> which is a legal framework for mutual recognition of national digital identity schemes.</p>



<p>“The purpose of eIDAS is cross border access for citizens in any European country to gain access to any public service in the EU,”Sebastian Elfors, senior solutions architect at Yubico explained.</p>



  



  



<p>FIDO standards are being increasingly adopted by European governments to help support eIDAS efforts. Among those that Elfors highlighted is healthcare authentication in Norway, EduID for universities in Sweden and the National Health Service (NHS) in the U.K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO standards are also helping the Czech Republic with its CZ.NIC top level domain registry which also operates the mojedID (my ID in Czech) service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jaromi Talir, technical fellow at CZ.NIC and member of eIDAS Technical subgroup explained that the domain registry had a requirement to authenticate the identity of domain owners. That requirement led to the creation of mojeID, which has been using FIDO standards since 2019. Talir explained that CZ.NIC uses FIDO to support a multi-factor strong authentication based approach to help authentication user identity.</p>



<p>Using FIDO to Support Delegated Authentication</p>



<p>With the European Union’s Payment Services Directive Strong Customer Authentication (PSD2 SCA), that came into effect in 2021, there are very stringent requirements for merchants to authenticate consumers with payment providers.</p>



  



<p>In a panel discussion, Jonathan Grossar, VP, product development at Mastercard commented that within a few months of the introduction of PSD2 SCA there has been an increase in the number of transactions that have been abandoned by consumers.</p>



<p>“So a problem with PSD2 SCA is that consumers may have to authenticate twice,” Grossar siad. “First with the merchant to have access to the account or to the card that is stored on file and then a second time doing the transaction with the bank and potentially then with a different authentication mechanism.”</p>



<p>All those extra steps introduce additional friction and complexity for both merchants and consumers that can be alleviated with an approach known as delegated authentication. Grossar explained that with delegated authentication, the entire authentication piece is handled&nbsp; with a secure mechanism by merchants. Using FIDO standards in combination with EMVco’s <a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/">3-D Secure</a> standards to share authentication and risk data is the way forward in Grossar’s view.</p>



<p>“FIDO is interoperable across multiple devices and platforms,” Grossar said. “So in short, you have today billions of devices that are enabled with FIDO, and that potentially can be used for delegated authentication.”</p>



<p>Jason Muncey, principal, EU Payment Acceptance &amp; International Expansion, at Amazon is also optimistic about using FIDO for delegated authentication. Muncey commented that even before the PSD2 SCA requirements cart abandonment was just a pain that all merchants have had to live with. In his view, there is a real need to have some form of consistent approach.</p>



<p>Lee Goddard, product director, head of authentication at Worldpay also noted that – there will always be some amount of abandonment potential in that purchase process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the FIDO approach to delegated authentication will really take things a step further in removing evermore abandonment,” she said.</p>



<p>Remote Identity Verification in Europe</p>



<p>With the pandemic, the ability to do in-person identity verification became challenging, which led to a need for increased remote identity verification in Europe and other areas around the world.</p>



<p>In a panel discussion, Santosh Rajvaidya, senior director, product management at Jumio noted that to date, there is no consistent approach when it comes to remote ID verification in Europe. That situation could be changing with the new digital identity wallet approach from the European Commission that could be the first step in the right direction.</p>



  



<p>“What is happening with digital identity wallet is you do a one time verification of your ID and the identity is created in the digital identity wallet,” Rajvaidya said. “From there on the user can reuse it multiple times across different applications.”</p>



<p>There is now also an ID Verification and Binding Working Group IDWG within FIDO that is doing work that will also help with remote identity verification efforts. Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow, commented that when it comes to verification, user experience and convenience are key attributes.</p>



<p>“Most users aren’t concerned with their identity or the data privacy, they’ll tick the boxes and move on, they just want to get their service,” she said.</p>



<p>Wrapping up the virtual Authenticate Summit, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance emphasized that the FIDO Alliance is in a very good place today, in Europe and around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing more and more companies adopt FIDO authentication,” Shikiar said. “I personally firmly believe that virtually every consumer service online will be offering passwordless login options in the next few years and our hope is that the vast majority of these leverage FIDO.”</p>



<p>Looking forward to the next FIDO Authenticate virtual summits is in September with a focus on government services. Then in October, the FIDO Alliance will be hosting its first live event with the Authenticate Conference in Seattle.</p>

<p>The state of California recently <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">announced their Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record system</a>. It allows Californians to access a digital copy of their vaccine records, rather than having to depend entirely on their physical copy. The main entry point is a QR code containing a rudimentary Verifiable Claim (VC), which makes for great ease of use. However, Blockchain Commons has concerns over how the user experience (UX) design might negatively affect both privacy and security; we are working to address these with our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone, Blockchain Commons’ first Apple appstore release.</p>

<p>
For a while now, increasingly personal information has been getting encoded as QRs. During the pandemic, COVID tests were  often stored as QRs. There has also been extensive use of QR codes to transmit secure information across an airgap. Many people first saw this use of QRs when they read a QR code for a two-factor authentication seed into their phone’s Authenticator app. At Blockchain Commons, we similarly use QR codes as an encoding method to transmit seeds and keys.</p>

<p>Some possible architectural issues arise from using QR codes for confidential data, such as the fact that you’re actually transmitting the data (not a proof of the data), that the QRs tend to contain all of the data (not just a selection), and that there’s no way to rescind a QR or expire it. Those issues will have to be dealt with at a foundational level as we figure out what can safely be encoded as a QR — and more importantly how to offer restricted proofs rather than complete information.</p>

<p>However, there are also security &amp; privacy UX issues related to the storage of QR codes that need to be resolved no matter what is encoded. The state of California itself demonstrated the bad habits that we’re already developing when they said in <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">their official press release</a>: “individuals are encouraged to screenshot the information and save it to their phone files or camera roll”.</p>

<p>Now, storing QRs as photos on a phone does meet some minimal security requirements. Most phones are closely held and protected by a PIN, a thumbprint, or a faceprint. They’re often backed up to a cloud service and that cloud data is mostly secured as well. Still, there are numerous opportunities for problems.</p>

<p>That’s in large part due to the fact that photos are built to be shared. It’s very easy to send a photo to a friend or a social network, which is great for photos, but less so for your QR codes. In addition, photos are built to be synced. Though your data might be relatively safe if it’s synced to the cloud, it’s not that secure when synced to your desktop computer, which is vulnerable to malware and other attacks.</p>

<p>Photos also aren’t built to be searched and their categorization systems are usually rudimentary. Even if your QR code was safe, you might not be able to easily find it.</p>

<p>
That’s where Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone comes in. Though we can only make sure that our own uses of QR codes are architecturally secure, we can definitely provide better ways to store QR codes, and that’s what QR Tool does.</p>

<p>QR Tool lets you scan any QR code into an encrypted vault. It then protects your code with two-factor authentication: you initilally log in with your Apple login and password, and then anytime you want to view your codes, you additionally must use a biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint. Unlike your semi-porous camera roll, QR Tool was built to keep confidential information secure.</p>

<p>QR Tool also provides proof that your codes weren’t changed. Using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash">Lifehash</a> technology, QR Tool links each code to a unique, evocative, and unchanging graphical color representation. This will prove particularly useful when the Lifehash specification is adopted by other companies, so that you can transfer a QR code between applications and verify immediately that it’s the same — something that’s difficult with the QR code alone.</p>

<p>Finally, QR Tool resolves the problem of categorization by automatically recognizing a wide variety of QR codes and giving you the opportunity to change those categorizations as you see fit.</p>

<p>If the future we hope to see more fully featured <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, but there’s no doubt that QRs are with us for the moment, and we need to make sure that they remain secure and easy to use. This is why we released QR Tool. It’s a reference implementation for the Gordian Principles, demonstrating how to store confidential data in a way that’s independent, private, resilient, and open: QR Tool ensures that you hold your own QRs, that they’re safe, and that you can easily transmit them to other services.</p>

<p>If you’ve got QRs of your own to secure, you can purchase QR Tool from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple Store</a> or you can compile it directly from the source code found at the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and Chief Marketing Officer, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication has seen remarkable acceptance over the past few years, thanks in large part to standardization by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the subsequent adoption into leading device platforms and browsers. All told, we estimate over 4 billion devices (inclusive of Windows 10 PCs as well as every modern Apple and Android device) now support FIDO Authentication, as do over <a href="https://caniuse.com/webauthn">88% of web browsers</a>. Couple that addressable market with the ability for developers to write to the public FIDO2 WebAuthn API and you can see why so many enterprises are featuring FIDO support in request for proposals (RFPs) and accelerating related development plans.</p>



<p>However, while FIDO definitely does provide a simpler, stronger approach to user authentication, there is still a need to get users more accustomed to the user experience – and to optimize these flows as much as possible.&nbsp; In short, “if you build it they will come” isn’t always sufficient for paradigm-changing technologies. We’ve heard from more and more relying parties that they would benefit from tips on how to most effectively implement FIDO in a way that resonates with consumers and works across major browsers and platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past five years, the Alliance has conducted research that has consistently found consumers want to use FIDO authentication once they understand what it is and to have common “FIDO-enabled” signals to show where to obtain it. This illustrates the need for FIDO to be introduced to consumers in a user-friendly and consistent way in order for our protocols to be adopted at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this requirement, FIDO’s Board of Directors last year launched a User Experience (UX) Task Force (UXTF), drawing on world-class UX experts from many of our member companies, including Bank of America, eBay, Facebook, Google, HYPR, IBM, Intuit, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Microsoft, Trusona, Visa, and Wells Fargo. The UXTF was tasked with creating recommendations and best practices for how to deploy FIDO, factoring in utilization of FIDO messaging, logos and other visual cues. We partnered with consulting firm <a href="https://blinkux.com/">Blink UX</a> to conduct the first formal usability research of FIDO user journeys, including registration and authentication steps and various use cases – all feeding into our Desktop Authenticator UX Guidelines.</p>



<p>To complement this effort, we constructed a strawman banking user journey that could be used to test various assumptions and to better examine the authentication steps actually employed by users. With IBM’s assistance, a <a href="https://digitalbank-test.com/">website</a> was created to reflect this use case and was utilized during our testing and analyses.&nbsp; The site will remain live as a reference implementation of our UX Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We divided the typical FIDO journey into a series of four major steps:</p>



  Promote awareness of the availability of various biometric sign-ins, then perform the actual sign-in and determine if a user has a FIDO-eligible device that can be used in the authentication process.  Invite users to register via FIDO, especially if they are using Windows Hello or Apple TouchID.  The actual FIDO registration of the user’s desktop authenticator, along with messages showing success or failure.  Making FIDO the primary sign-in path, and issue appropriate confirmation messages.  



<p>The UX tests were done in three different rounds. First was a qualitative series where we walked participants through a mock-up of the site and test. This allowed us to get feedback on some of our initial messaging and visual assumptions, which fed into the final site design. Next, we ran 100 subjects through independent <a href="https://beachyspharmacy.com/lisinopril.aspx">https://beachyspharmacy.com</a> quantitative testing – where they were assigned and had to complete a mock banking task, which included a prompt to enroll for FIDO login. Our last round of testing were qualitative video interviews, which provided an invaluable human element and insights on the FIDO value proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collectively, these tests are what helped define and focus our messaging, logos and various other iconography and logic flows that were useful in developing UX guidelines and other best practices for FIDO implementations.</p>



<p>Our preliminary recommendations from these tests are:</p>



  Use a simple biometric image (such as a fingerprint icon) to trigger the initial user registration, then have FIDO logos at each touchpoint to confirm that a user is following the right sequence of steps.  Make sure developers optimize for each type of environment (operating system and device form factors such as laptop or phone) for each FIDO-capable device. For example, Windows and MacOS have different icons that are used to designate fingerprint usage, as shown in the below screencaps.  



  



  Use one of two suggested messaging styles: we tested and validated one style that is simple and one that is to “add an option.” For example, a simple message might say: “You’re eligible for a simpler sign-in! Learn how you can skip your password the next time you sign in. Register now.” And the optional message might say:&nbsp; “Add an easy and safe way to access your account. Register now.”  Take steps to educate consumers and customer support staff on FIDO. Promote FIDO awareness across multiple touch points and marketing channels such as email and direct postal mail campaigns and social media. This should include information about FIDO-capable device availability and <a href="https://loginwithfido.com/">how to use FIDO on Windows 10 Hello and Apple smartphones.</a>&nbsp; This also will help address potential user reluctance around using biometric sign-ins. Although many users view biometric sign-in as desirable, convenient, and secure, some users initially express hesitancy to share biometric or other computer sign-in information with their bank or with FIDO – and hence need to be educated that their biometrics stay safely on their device.  Have a special “problem resolution” path for those customers who run into problems.  



<p>FIDO Alliance’s ultimate goal is to see as many service providers moving their customers away from password-based authentication as soon as possible – and we hope that these UX guidelines can help accelerate this movement.&nbsp; As this is our first foray into usability guidance we’re also open to and appreciative of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/UX-Guidelines">feedback</a> from deploying organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By David Turner, Director of Standards Development, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Today we are announcing enhancements to two of the core FIDO protocols, the Client To Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) v2.1 and WebAuthn Level 2 – which collectively comprise FIDO2. Both are significant advances in extending FIDO’s capabilities specifically for enterprise users and supporting more complex application use cases. These enhancements come at an appropriate time, given the increased demand and rate of adoption for FIDO methods as the pandemic and remote work continues throughout the world.</p>



<p>The FIDO2 WebAuthn protocol is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that describe how to enable authentications inside browser sessions. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Level 2 is the latest version of the standard</a>, which is maintained by the W3C organization and was released in April. This standard makes it easier to write web applications that use FIDO Authentication, which is now supported across the five major endpoint operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, ChromeOS, and iOS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are six major improvements that we are announcing today:</p>



<p>Enterprise attestation</p>



<p>Today’s announcements increase support for enterprise management of devices and users. The CTAP and WebAuthn protocols have added features that make it easier for enterprises to add specific user identity data during the registration process, so corporate administrators can more easily track key distribution and usage. Because these features can reveal some private user information – information that they would have divulged anyway to their employer – this feature is not available directly to consumers’ authenticators. Instead, authenticators must be pre-programmed (before credential registration) with these enterprise attestations by the enterprises themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cross-origin iFrame support</p>



<p>This feature allows web-based ecommerce transactions to be completed within pop-up windows on a browser, something that was forbidden in earlier FIDO versions as a way to protect potential man-in-the-middle and man-in-the-browser attack scenarios. The new standards make a very safe, secure and encrypted way to <a href="https://transparentpharmacy.net/patient-handout.html">https://transparentpharmacy.net</a> accomplish these transactions, without revealing data pulled from multiple domains such as the originating vendor, the user’s bank account, a credit card issuer, and so forth. It also helps in situations when users are connecting via bandwidth-limited circumstances (such as via Bluetooth or poor Wifi signals) to keep the authentication workflow moving without a lot of back-and-forth network traffic and latency delays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support for Apple Attestations</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance has been pleased to have Apple as a contributing member for the past 18 months.&nbsp;This feature adds support for Apple’s method of doing attestation on their devices using the WebAuthn protocols.</p>



<p>Better biometric management</p>



<p>The CTAP v2.1 additions include better biometric enrollment and management features, so that users can register multiple fingerprints and other bio-markers. Additionally, enterprises can set minimum PIN lengths. As more mobile devices include facial and fingerprint recognition, this keeps FIDO current with the latest authentication technologies.</p>



<p>Large blob support</p>



<p>An alternative to running a centralized authentication service, this feature includes a way to store things like certificates that may be necessary for other authentication scenarios, such as using encrypted SSH connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Resident credential improvements&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now called discoverable credentials, this enables passwordless workflows to re-authenticate a user. The authentication dialog automatically finds and applies an existing credential and asks for user confirmation, thus making FIDO easier to use.</p>



<p>Always Require User Verification</p>



<p>This feature allows a user to protect the credentials on their authenticator with some form of user verification independent of the Relying Party. Platform authenticators and other authenticators with the feature enabled will always perform user verification. Some certification programs such as US FIPS 140-3 prohibit the authenticator performing signing operations without authentication.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent questions we get asked is about the technology choice of Cosmos. Why do you use Cosmos technology ? why didn’t you choose Bitcoin or Ethereum ?</p>
<blockquote><p>The answer is simple : Horizontal scalability.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of computing history there were only a few few computers called Mainframes. &nbsp; The first (Bitcoin) and second generation (Ethereum) blockchains are like Mainframes: a single large computer where everyone shares the same computing resources and writes code with Cobol-like languages. Vertical scalability on these blockchains is limited, and horizontal scalability is impossible.</p>
<p>Vertical Scalability:&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes methods to scale the blockchain itself. Moving away from Proof-of-Work and optimizing its components, Tendermint BFT can reach thousands of transactions per second. The bottleneck factor is the application itself. For example, an application such as a virtual machine (e.g., the Ethereum virtual machine) will impose a much lower limit on transaction throughput than an application where transaction types and state transition functions are directly embedded in it (e.g., standard Cosmos SDK application).</p>
<p>This is one reason why application-specific blockchains make sense.</p>
<p>Horizontal scalability:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if the consensus engine and application are highly optimized, at some point the transaction volume of a single blockchain inevitably hits a wall that it cannot cross. This is the limitation of vertical scaling. To overcome it, the solution is to move to multi-chain architectures. The idea is to have multiple parallel chains running the same application managed by a common set of validators, making blockchains theoretically infinitely scalable. The details of horizontal scalability are quite complex and beyond the scope of this introduction.</p>
<p>We need the Internet. A network of networks where everyone runs their own server. We need the Internet of blockchains.</p>
<p>Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by the same consensus mechanism: <a href="http://www.tendermint.com">Tendermint.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is a Cosmos blockchain?</p>
<p>A Cosmos blockchain is a digital ledger maintained by a set of validators that remains correct even if some validators (less than a third) are malicious. Each validator stores a copy of the ledger on their computer and updates it according to the rules defined by the protocol protocol when they receive transaction blocks.</p>
<p>Cosmos technology makes sure that the ledger is properly replicated, which means that every honest party sees the same version of the ledger at all times. A Cosmos-based blockchain has the ability for actors to share a ledger without having to rely on a central authority.</p>
<p>Achieving 15,000 transactions per second, was one of the goals of commerce.network and the only technology that can do this with 100 validator nodes is Cosmos.</p>
<p>For this reason in 2018 we chose <a href="http://www.cosmos.network">Cosmos.</a></p>

<p>The UK’s Department for International Trade (DIT) is seeking tech companies from Australia and New Zealand who are considering the UK for international expansion. The selected group will join the official hybrid mission to&nbsp;<a href="https://londontechweek.com/">London Tech Week</a>&nbsp;in September 2021.</p>



<p>LTW&nbsp;is Europe’s largest technology festival. The annual event brings together the world’s most inspirational founders, global leaders, senior investors and rising talent. In 2020 the festival was held as a virtual event for the first time, attracting over 20,000 attendees from across the globe. The festival hosted over 700 sessions across 11 days, featuring upwards of 750 leading speakers and innovators.</p>



<p>Australian and Kiwi scale-ups who are considering expansion to the UK can apply to one of the following streams:</p>



  creative technology (AR/VR/MR, gamification, adtech, media, eCommerce, sportstech, marketing tech)  digital health and wellness  edtech  future technology (AI, cyber, blockchain/distributed ledger, IoT, robotics, big data, space)  impact technology (companies making a positive social or environmental impact)  



<p>The successful applicants will be invited to join a pre-mission in-person networking event in early September. They will then participate in a series of virtual evening sessions from 20 to 29 September 2021.</p>



<p>Those selected will join a programme curated for&nbsp;ANZ&nbsp;scale-ups. This will include sessions from key players in the UK tech ecosystem, who will provide exclusive insights on market opportunities and guidance on capital raising, R&amp;D and support to set up.</p>



<p>British Consul General and Deputy Trade Commissioner Asia Pacific (Australia and New Zealand), Louise Cantillon said:</p>



<blockquote><p>The UK tech sector has reached new heights and is the first country in Europe to reach 100 unicorns [tech companies valued at US$1 billion]. This means the UK now has the largest number of tech unicorns in Europe. With a fantastic track record for supporting tech companies and innovation, the UK is the ideal location for Australian and Kiwi tech companies who are ready to expand internationally.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The UK’s Department for International Trade team is delighted to be running this mission again. Despite physical restrictions, this is a great platform for the tech community to come together and for Australian and&nbsp;NZ&nbsp;companies to explore the opportunities the UK market has on offer. Good luck to everyone applying.</p></blockquote>



<p>DIT’s delegation last year was the largest ever from Australia and New Zealand. 130 tech founders and industry representatives joined the mission.</p>



<p>LTW&nbsp;is part of a broader programme of initiatives to increase digital trade and investment opportunities between the UK and&nbsp;ANZ&nbsp;tech sectors. Earlier this year the UK launched the Digital Trade Network (DTN) for Asia Pacific. The network will support UK-ANZ&nbsp;tech collaboration and support UK tech scale-ups in the region.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;LTW&nbsp;application process is open to Australian and New Zealand companies only. Victorian companies need to apply via the Global Victoria application.</p>



<p>Applications to join the mission will close on Friday 30 July 2021.</p>

<p>The Agile Method is a particular project management approach that is used in software development. This method helps teams respond to the unpredictability of building software through the use of incremental and iterative work sequences, commonly known as sprints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The general principles of the Agile method</p>
<p>Our top priority is to satisfy the customer by releasing valuable software, right out of the box and continuously.<br>
We embrace changes in requirements, even at advanced stages of development.<br>
Agile processes leverage change for the customer’s competitive advantage.<br>
We frequently deliver working software, ranging from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, preferring short periods.<br>
Clients and developers must work together on a daily basis for the duration of the project.<br>
We base projects on motivated individuals.<br>
We give them the environment and support they need and trust in their ability to get the job done.<br>
A face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective way to communicate with and within the team.<br>
Working software is the primary measure of progress. – Agile processes promote sustainable development.<br>
Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to indefinitely maintain a steady pace.<br>
Continued focus on technical excellence and good design enhances agility.<br>
Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.<br>
The best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams.<br>
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, after which it adjusts and adapts its behavior accordingly.</p>
<p>History of the Agile Method&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the Agile ideas emerged in the 1970s. Studies and reviews were conducted on the Agile Method explaining its birth as a reaction against traditional approaches to project development. In 1970, Dr. William Royce published a paper discussing the management and development of large software systems. The paper outlined his specific ideas about sequential development. Specifically, his presentation stated that a project could be developed like a product on an assembly line: each phase of development had to be completed before the next phase could begin. The idea required that developers had to first put together all the requirements for a project. The next step was to complete its architecture. Code writing followed, and the development sequences continued in increments aimed at closing integral parts of the project. When these steps are completed, there is little or no contact between the specialized groups completing each phase of the project. The pioneers of the Agile Method believed that if developers studied the process, they would find the most logical and useful solution for software development.</p>
<p>Companies that use the Agile Method</p>
<p>Although there is no official list of companies that use the Agile Method for their projects, IBM is one of the companies that openly uses this method to develop software. In fact, many companies adopt it within their development structure, but they are not always open about their choice to use it. According to IBM, the use of the Agile Method generates significant organizational changes. IBM believes that many Agile software development teams will increase their chances of success by collaborating with reliable guidance. That company also helps clients implement their own Agile software development strategies for their projects and provides critical guidance that will help Agile software development teams avoid common pitfalls of adoption, expansion and implementation.</p>

  <p>According to a recent global study from McKinsey &amp; Company, Covid-19 has accelerated business’ digital initiatives by, on average, seven years.</p>
<p>In acknowledgement of this monumental leap forward, GLEIF has launched several strategic initiatives over the past year designed to broaden the value of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in the fields of digital identity, digitized counterparty verification and their related use-cases. </p>
<p>As Germany celebrates Digital Day on June 18, GLEIF looks back at these milestones and considers what the future holds for the LEI and the global digital economy.  </p>
<p>The Validation Agent: Opening the door to business ID services for legal entities</p>
<p>In September, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-defines-new-validation-agent-role-for-banks-financial-institutions-to-simplify-and-accelerate-client-lifecycle-management">GLEIF introduced a new role into the Global LEI System called the Validation Agent</a>. The role is designed to help financial institutions and other supervised organizations make immediate gains in client lifecycle management and begin to develop innovative business identity services for their clients.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agents</a> leverage their know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulated ‘business-as-usual’ onboarding processes to obtain LEIs for their customers. By equipping their business client base with LEIs, Validation Agents can promote financial inclusion and create new value by pioneering revenue generating digital services in corporate identity management and cross-border supply chain relationships. </p>
<p>Validation Agents can also utilize the LEI to accelerate their internal digital transformation, in areas such as customer onboarding, payments and other transactions, and contract signing.</p>
<p>Since its launch at the end of 2020, the Validation Agent framework has gained significant traction around the world. Two significant institutions, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-confirms-j-p-morgan-as-first-validation-agent-in-the-global-lei-system">J.P. Morgan</a> and the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">China Financial Certification Authority (CFCA)</a>, have already completed the qualification process, with many more to follow. </p>
<p>The vLEI: Enabling instant, automated verification of business identity</p>
<p>Until now, the absence of an independent governance authority capable of establishing universal digitized trust between legal entities has presented an industry-wide barrier to innovation. To overcome this obstacle, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-advances-digital-trust-and-identity-for-legal-entities-globally">GLEIF launched a cross-industry development program</a> in 2020 to create a digitally verifiable LEI (vLEI).  When complete, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">the vLEI</a> will extend the Global LEI System to create a fully digitized LEI service that can enable instant and automated identity verification between counterparties operating across all industry sectors, globally. </p>
<p>With GLEIF acting as the ‘root of trust’, the vLEI service creates a cryptographically secure chain of trust that can replace the manual processes required to access and confirm an entity’s LEI data. This will give organizations worldwide the capacity to use their LEI’s non-repudiable identification data relating to their legal status, ownership structure and authorized representatives in a huge number of digital activities, many of them automated, enabling them to participate in the global digital economy for years to come. </p>
<p>As a result, the vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world; it will be the hallmark of authenticity for all legal entities everywhere.</p>
<p>In February 2021, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-unveils-issuance-and-infrastructure-models-for-verifiable-lei">GLEIF unveiled the official issuance and technical infrastructure models</a> which will support the development of the vLEI and now invites software developers to engage with the program’s stakeholders to explore how the vLEI can be leveraged in future applications. </p>
<p>Digital Certificates: Embedding the LEI to uphold trust in the system</p>
<p>As legal entities’ use of digital certificates continues to grow in both number and use-case application, so too does the time and cost required to maintain them. The increasing complexity of this task is already <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/the-lei-the-missing-ingredient-in-digital-certificate-management">undermining the trust system that digital certificates were designed to create</a>. </p>
<p>To address this problem GLEIF has worked closely with the International Standards Organization (ISO) to <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/iso-standardizes-the-process-of-embedding-leis-in-digital-certificates">standardize the process of embedding LEIs into digital certificates</a> at the point of issuance, which will make certificates easier to manage, aggregate and maintain, as well as increasing transparency across the digital identity ecosystem. <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/the-lei-in-digital-certificates">By becoming the common link between digital certificates</a>, the LEI will provide certainty of identity in any online interaction, making it easier for everyone to participate with confidence in the global digital marketplace. </p>
<p>GLEIF is actively engaged with Certification Authorities (CAs) and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) to support and encourage LEI adoption in digital certificates as part of its new CA Stakeholder Group, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-launches-new-stakeholder-group-to-accelerate-the-integration-of-leis-in-digital-certificates">announced in March 2021</a>. This group aims to facilitate the transfer of mutually beneficial information between stakeholders in a joint effort to develop best practice guidelines and case studies for LEI integration. Following this, GLEIF <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">welcomed the first commercial demonstration of an LEI embedded within a digital certificate</a> with the launch of the China Financial Certification Authority’s (CFCA) TrustSign® software in March 2021. </p>
<p>LEI Search 2.0: Enriching and automating access to LEI data</p>
<p>GLEIF has also been hard at work to ensure the LEI’s own tools stay ahead of the digitalization curve. </p>
<p>In 2020, in line with its vision to enable broader, automated use of the LEI, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-answers-industry-demand-for-customized-automated-access-to-rich-lei-data-with-lei-search-2-0-and-companion-api">GLEIF completed its migration to LEI Search 2.0</a>, a new LEI search engine with rich data functionality, and published a companion API enabling third-parties to set up fast, customized and automated searches and retrieve open, higher quality LEI data from within their application environments.</p>
<p>By expanding the number of search parameters available, <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/search/">LEI Search 2.0</a> delivers a new level of transparency over how legal entities have evolved over time, enabling faster and more sophisticated counterparty due diligence, heightened granularity in regulatory oversight procedures and richer reporting potential for market data aggregators. </p>
<p>What’s next? </p>
<p>In the coming months GLEIF will continue working hard to advance these strategic initiatives. </p>
<p>The Validation Agent Framework is maturing and GLEIF’s focus is now on championing the roles benefits and encourage take-up from financial institutions and other supervised organizations around the world. </p>
<p>The vLEI continues to evolve at pace as stakeholders across healthcare, pharmaceutical, telecom, automotive and financial services begin to build out sector-specific applications. </p>
<p>In collaboration with members of the CA Stakeholder Group, GLEIF continues to combat complexity and advance trust and transparency across the digital certificate ecosystem around the world.</p>
<p>The LEI’s legacy is proudly rooted in financial services and regulation. Its future, however, undeniably points beyond to broader, digitized adoption and utilization across public and private sectors around the world. The Global LEI System is the only open, commercially neutral, and regulatory endorsed system capable of establishing digitized trust between all legal entities everywhere. It was established as a public good, and GLEIF remains committed to ensuring that every last drop of value is wrung from the system, and used to the benefit of all.</p>

 ENGIE Energy Access and Energy Web Announce DeFi Crowdfunding Platform to Help Scale Solar, Mini Grids in Sub-Saharan Africa <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/zf9_yiAekJs">Seth Doyle</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/zf9_yiAekJs">Unsplash</a><p>Zug, Switzerland and Berlin, Germany — 17 June 2021 — Today nonprofit Energy Web and<a href="https://www.engie-energyaccess.com/"> ENGIE Energy Access</a> — one of the leading off-grid, Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) solar and mini-grid solutions providers in Africa — announced a partnership to accelerate energy access in sub-Saharan Africa through a decentralized finance (DeFi) crowdfunding platform. The DeFi application will be built on the open-source Energy Web tech stack and enable investors to provide microloans that support clean energy deployment.</p><p>In 2019, an estimated <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity">580 million people</a> in sub-Saharan Africa remained off grid and in the dark, accounting for three-quarters of the global population without electricity access. After years of steady declines since 2013, that number has risen in 2020 due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Thus rapid deployment of solar home systems (SHSs) and clean energy mini-grids is a crucial humanitarian cause that supports health, quality of life, and economic growth in off-grid regions of the subcontinent.</p><p>ENGIE Energy Access integrates and unites ENGIE’s solar home system companies, Fenix International and ENGIE Mobisol, as well as its mini-grids provider, ENGIE PowerCorner, under one entity and one name. “To date, ENGIE Energy Access has served over 1 million customers and 6 million people in 9 countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The new DeFi platform in partnership with Energy Web will help ENGIE Energy Access deploy more solar faster, by directly tackling a key challenge: access to low-cost financing,” commented Gillian-Alexandre Huart, CEO of ENGIE Energy&nbsp;access.”</p><p>“We’re excited to bring crypto-based decentralized finance to rural electrification in Africa,” said Stefan Zelazny, Head of Software and IT at ENGIE Energy Access and previously CIO at ENGIE Mobisol. “We believe this can accelerate much-needed clean energy deployment throughout the region by connecting impact-oriented investors with unbanked rural customers. Combining the technology that remotely connects and controls our Solar-Home-Systems with the Energy Web Chain will result in the first smart asset-backed NFT where asset use can be controlled via the&nbsp;chain.”</p><p>The first phase of this initiative will focus on integrating the Energy Web software tech stack with ENGIE’s platform to further promote rural electrification in Africa. The crowdfunding platform to be developed by Energy Web will allow micro-investors to finance the installation of clean energy assets by staking Energy Web Tokens (EWT), the native token of the Energy Web Chain, in exchange for a fixed interest rate. This setup will unlock capital from the global cryptocurrency market, bringing a significant new source of capital to clean energy deployment in Africa. To help mitigate the risk for everybody involved, the Community Fund of Energy Web will back this first phase of the platform. Giving people in Africa access to new green electricity solutions utilizing the Energy Web DOS is a great first use case for the Community Fund.</p><p>In the second phase, Energy Web will work together with ENGIE Energy Access to give a unique decentralized identifier (DID) to each one of the home appliances and rooftop solar deployed by ENGIE. This way, one can directly add credits to the appliances owned by locals to support their access to electricity and its services.</p><p>“Creating positive impact in people’s lives is one of our core principles at Energy Web. But the global energy transition must also reach those who don’t yet have access to electricity,” explained Energy Web’s Walter Kok. “We are happy that ENGIE — one of the biggest energy players in the world and one of the founding members of the Energy Web Chain — has embraced the Energy Web technology stack to support such an important mission.”</p><p>About ENGIE Energy Access<br>ENGIE Energy Access is the leading Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGo) and mini-grids solutions provider in Africa, with a mission to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy solutions and life-changing services with exceptional customer experience. The company is a result of the integration of Fenix International, ENGIE Mobisol and ENGIE PowerCorner; and develops innovative, off-grid solar solutions for homes, public services and businesses, enabling customers and distribution partners access to clean, affordable energy. The PAYGo solar home systems are financed through affordable installments from $0.14 per day and the mini-grids foster economic development by enabling electrical productive use and triggering business opportunities for entrepreneurs in rural communities. With over 1,700 employees, operations in nine countries across Africa (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), over 1 million customers and 6 million lives impacted so far, ENGIE Energy Access aims to remain the leading clean energy company, serving millions of customers across Africa by&nbsp;2025.</p><p>For more, please visit<a href="https://engie-energyaccess.com/"> https://engie-energyaccess.com/</a></p><p>Contact&nbsp;: <a href="mailto:stefan.zelazny@engie.com">stefan.zelazny@engie.com</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

 Energy Web Names Chief Commercial Officer Jesse Morris as Energy Web CEO, Outgoing CEO Walter Kok will lead Lab.EnergyWeb <p>Zug, Switzerland — 16 June 2021 — Today we’re excited to introduce <a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">The Lab (Lab.EnergyWeb)</a>, a new R&amp;D initiative housed within Energy Web to build out cutting-edge functionality, services, SDKs, and other enhancements on the Energy Web stack. Initial projects under development within our new Lab unit include a DeFi application for crowdfunding energy-sector projects in emerging economies via Energy Web Tokens, additional staking models on the Energy Web stack, migrating non-energy crypto applications to the Energy Web Chain, and launching the development of Energy Web Chain 2.0. The announcement comes as we celebrate the second anniversary of the launch of the Energy Web Chain later this week. Walter Kok will lead this new initiative whilst he steps down as&nbsp;CEO.</p><p>In tandem, we’re pleased to announce that Jesse Morris, our longtime chief commercial officer, has been named Energy Web’s new CEO. Since our founding in 2017, Morris’ leadership has been fundamental to the growth of Energy Web into the world’s largest ecosystem of energy companies focused on accelerating the energy transition with open source digital technology.</p><p>“This is an exciting moment for Energy Web, as we move into the next phase of the organization’s evolution,” explained Jules Kortenhorst, EW Foundation Council member and CEO of Energy Web co-founder RMI. “Walter came to Energy Web to launch the world’s first public blockchain tailored to the energy sector. Under his leadership the Energy Web community experienced very rapid growth while adoption of the EW tech stack has scaled in a growing list of major projects around the world — especially impressive against the backdrop of a global pandemic. The next era of Energy Web with Jesse’s leadership promises to be just as revolutionary. Jesse has been instrumental to the success of Energy Web since its incubation and together with Walter leading the Lab we will continue to accelerate the energy transition through digital&nbsp;tech.”</p><p>In a similar move of promoting from within, Kok was Energy Web’s chief operating officer before being named its second CEO in August 2019. He came to Energy Web from a 30+ year career spanning ING Bank, Vodafone Global Enterprise, and NEC Corporation and several startups. Prior to joining the co-founding team of Energy Web, Morris was a principal in the electricity practice at RMI, where he partnered with utilities, technology providers, developers, and regulatory stakeholders to help distributed energy resources become an integral, widely-accessible part of the global electricity system.</p><p>“Walter and I have been working closely together for years now and we’re both excited about our new roles and responsibilities,” reflected Morris. “Me taking the reins as CEO will free up Walter to incubate a series of bleeding-edge crypto and digital projects under the new Lab. This move will make it easier for not just Energy Web as an organization but for our entire community to continue innovating well ahead of the energy&nbsp;market.”</p><p>“Coming from major enterprises like ING Bank and Vodafone, it’s been an incredible experience to lead the Energy Web team. There are so many talents at Energy Web and Jesse stepping into the CEO role is a great example of how we develop the new breed of leaders.” added Kok. “We are growing fast around the world, and I’m thrilled to continue informing our strategy as we forge ahead with The Lab. We will kick-off additional bleeding edge projects to demonstrate the level of innovation that is possible with our EW-DOS today. We are going to speed up the pace and will bring other sectors to our carbon-neutral Energy Web Chain too. Acting our way into new thinking”</p><p>Energy Web’s core team has grown rapidly under Kok’s watch — scaling alongside our ambition and work with the global energy and crypto sectors — almost tripling since the EW Chain’s one-year anniversary in 2020. In less than two years, the EW Chain’s validator network has grown to 44 companies spanning four continents. Some 45,000 wallet addresses have already generated 28 million transactions. Yet the biggest gains are&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Morris concluded by saying, “The two industries we straddle — crypto and grid digitization — are still in their infancy. For as much as we’ve collectively accomplished until now, we’re just getting started.”</p><p><a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">Learn more about The Lab at lab.energy.org</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>Over the last couple of weeks I’ve been thinking quite a lot about the concept of the Trust Economy.&nbsp; What is it? And why should we care about it?</p>



<p>My interest was first piqued when I came across two videos on YouTube from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vbPXbm8eTw">Rachel Botsman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNog-xrc_YA">Philipp Kristian Diekhöner.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trust has always been at the centre of society overall and commerce in particular.&nbsp; There’s a reason why during the first industrial revolution banks always built the most impressive, secure looking buildings in town – so you trusted them to deposit you money there!</p>



<p>Now with the 4th industrial (digital) revolution the old vertical, siloed trust models are breaking down and we are moving to a more horizontal, distributed environment.&nbsp; The decline in trust in the media (fake news) and the lack of trust we are all now feeling with the way big tech is monetising our personal data is creating ever increasing demands from people to significantly improve trust models for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have a strong sense that Aotearoa New Zealand has always projected a reasonably trusted persona globally;&nbsp; good people, good morals, good global citizens etc… and now our Covid-19 response would appear to have bolstered the level of trust people have in us across the planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example of this is the <a href="https://brandirectory.com/globalsoftpower/">Global Soft Power Index</a> which for its 2021 ranking had Aotearoa New Zealand as the fastest improving nation in the Index, claiming 16th place in the ranking (up from 22 last year), citing “perceptions of New Zealand have no doubt been bolstered as nations such as the UK and the US cede their usual place as leaders in public health, with both battling repeated waves of the COVID-19 virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There would now appear to be a real opportunity for us to focus on really enhancing our trust position globally.&nbsp; 100% Pure New Zealand was a really strong brand position.&nbsp; Might something like 100% Trusted New Zealand be a branding idea for our future?</p>



<p>And in the context of the digital economy, digital identity and trust go hand in hand as cornerstones of the Trust Economy.</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

   When Energy Web launched in early 2017, we did so with the support of two key cofounders: RMI, a leading global think-and-do tank focused on the energy transition, and Grid Singularity, an award-winning energy blockchain developer.  Two years later in June 2019 we launched the Energy Web Chain in partnership with a global community of energy companies, grid operators, and other enterprises that ha

<p>When Energy Web <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/press-release-energy-web-foundation-launch/">launched in early 2017</a>, we did so with the support of two key cofounders: RMI, a leading global think-and-do tank focused on the energy transition, and Grid Singularity, an award-winning energy blockchain developer.</p><p>Two years later in June 2019 we <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-launches-worlds-first-public-open-source-enterprise-grade-blockchain-3a67fc457341">launched the Energy Web Chain</a> in partnership with a global community of energy companies, grid operators, and other enterprises that had grown into the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-surpasses-100-affiliates-en-route-to-becoming-largest-energy-blockchain-4823616b1579">world’s largest energy blockchain ecosystem</a>. Within the first year of the EW Chain’s operation, solutions and transactions on the network grew quickly, while the validator network <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-chain-celebrates-tripling-of-validator-network-9cdfd830e044'">more than&nbsp;tripled</a>.</p><p>As we now look ahead to the third year of the Energy Web Chain’s growing prominence in the energy and crypto spaces, the cofounders remain as committed as ever to the Energy Web mission of accelerating the energy transition by unleashing the potential of blockchain and other digital technologies.</p><p>For example, RMI partnered with Energy Web and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) earlier this year to launch the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord</a>. Meanwhile, Grid Singularity has continued to focus on <a href="https://gridsingularity.com/d3a/">building energy market exchanges</a> on top of the Energy Web tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Thus on this EW Chain anniversary, we are pleased to share these statements from our cofounders, who are re-affirming their commitment to supporting the Energy Web Chain, the Energy Web Community, and the greater Energy Web ecosystem moving&nbsp;forward:</p> Statement from&nbsp;RMI <p>“RMI will continue to strongly support the value created by the Energy Web Foundation and the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. As a steward of EWF’s mission and a broader champion of the energy transition, RMI commits to employ its EWT only where necessary to build new business models, engage in bonding and chain-related activities, and more broadly stimulate the advance of critical decentralized digital markets that support a rapid transition to a zero-carbon economy. We recognize that building a successful utility token platform will take time and know that EWF is well on its way to creating a world-changing model that fuses decentralized, low carbon generation with distributed ledgers and computing.”</p> Statement from Grid Singularity <p>“Grid Singularity will continue to strongly support the value created by the Energy Web Foundation and the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. Grid Singularity intends to use held EWT to scale the development of the Grid Singularity energy exchange for peer-to-peer and community trading, to invest in community applications and to contribute to the next growth stage of EWF 2.0, leveraging Polkadot technology, such as by staking, bonding for parachains, and advancing on-chain governance.”</p><p>Their statements are a testament to their continued trust and investment in the potential of blockchain and other decentralized, digital technology—including the evolving Energy Web tech stack—to accelerate the energy transition.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-cofounders-rmi-and-grid-singularity-reaffirm-their-commitment-to-the-mission-81ef02df81bb">Energy Web Cofounders RMI and Grid Singularity Reaffirm Their Commitment to the Mission</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
