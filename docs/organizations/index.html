		<p>NEWARK, NJ, July 8, 2022  –To help Edge members ensure that the needs of differently abled members of their community are met on the web and in online or digitally-enabled learning environments, Edge recently introduced Accessibility Compliance Support Services for Digital Learning. With the new service offering, Edge also aims to assist institutions in preparing for or developing remediation plans to respond to Office of Civil Rights (OCR) compliance audits. Edge Accessibility Compliance Support Services for Digital Learning include Digital Accessibility Readiness Assessment and Accessibility Support Services.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		 “Digital accessibility allows every student to access content and information online, regardless of their ability or disability. Through universal design, schools can take steps forward to remove barriers for every student. Creating and managing accessible content is the responsibility of everyone involved with online learning–from faculty, to staff, to designers, and more.” 
 — Josh Gaul, Associate Vice President and Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge 
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				 
       
          
           
            
           
         
       
     
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>With the Digital Accessibility Readiness Assessment, Edge accessibility experts provide an expert third party review of&nbsp; an institution’s current compliance with digital accessibility standards, including:</p>
 
 One time scan of the institution’s digital properties on the web for accessibility compliance, including Section 508 Digital Accessibility standards. This can be a full site scan or a defined subset of pages. 
 An instructional design review of a random selection of online and digitally-enabled courses for accessibility compliance. 
 A detailed report on digital accessibility findings, including immediate suggestions for improvement and a long-term remediation roadmap. 
 
<p>With Accessibility Support Services, Edge accessibility experts provide institutions with direct support service to proactively improve accessibility and/or rapidly remediate the institution’s web and digital environments to meet accessibility standards. Services include:</p>
 
 Professional Development Training for Accessibility: Edge experts create custom accessibility trainings for content or website owners, faculty, and more, to proactively build the capacity to support accessibility efforts internally at the institution.&nbsp; 
 Accessibility Policy, Procedure, and Governance Development: Edge’s Chief Digital Learning Officer will work with the institution to create a model of accessibility management to strengthen the policies, procedures, and governance in place to proactively ensure that the needs of differently abled members of your institutional community are met.&nbsp; 
 
<p>“Edge is dedicated to helping our members not only abide by federal accessibility laws and respond to audits from the Office of Civil Rights, but to helping our members advance their awareness and culture. Through regular maintenance, professional development, and strategic partnerships, Edge can make sure your school not only builds an online learning environment that works for all students, but embraces the culture of inclusivity necessary to be the solution for all students, regardless of ability or disability,” noted Gaul.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 7 July 2022 — Large amounts of valuable data are available in energy systems. However, they are often underused, and their full potential is not being extracted. The smart energy system of the future can be more efficiently operated and designed through a holistic approach that considers its multiple energy vectors (electricity, gas, heat…). This means dealing with diverse data inputs, which is feasible if the interoperability between their corresponding data platforms is ensured. OMEGA-X, a European-funded project, aims to tackle this challenge and to implement an Energy Data&nbsp;Space.</p><p>Many challenges exist in this sense, as even for each of these energy sectors, a single data platform does not exist. For instance, there is not a single data platform connecting data from generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption domains in the electrical power sector. The barriers also imply the lack of proper mechanisms and policies that ensure secure, sovereign, and fair data sharing. Thus, interoperability inside each sector and between other sectors needs to be promoted and also achieved transnationally, across European countries.</p><p>The Data Space that OMEGA-X aims for, is one based on European common standards, including federated infrastructure, data marketplace, and service marketplace, involving data sharing between different stakeholders and demonstrating its value for real and concrete Energy use cases and needs, while guaranteeing scalability and interoperability with other Data Space initiatives, not just for energy but also cross-sector.</p><blockquote>“There will be no Green Energy Transition without full digitalization. There will be no EU data strategy without data sharing. Data Spaces can answer to both challenges at once, being Energy one of the flagship use cases.” Javier Valiño — Atos</blockquote><p>The OMEGA-X project includes setting up 4 use cases families that will showcase the value of having a common data space for a particular problem identified by energy stakeholders:</p>  Renewables: Having renewable plant owners and service providers to optimize operation and maintenance to increase renewable energy sources (RES) availability and reducing CO² footprint.  Local Energy Communities: exploiting data from different energy vectors to optimize the overall performance of a local community, instead of optimizing each vector individually.  Collaboration among Electromobility actors: demonstrating how data sharing can ease and scale-up services such as booking and building innovative services such as cross-border self-consumption of renewable energy. It will involve the electricity system from charging points to transmission system operators (TSOs) in different EU countries.  Flexibility: Aiming to demonstrate the performance upgrade that can be achieved for the flexibility identification and provision at local/municipality level when service providers can have access to extended data sets from multiple&nbsp;origins.  <p>The OMEGA-X project runs from May 1st, 2022 till April 30 2025, and was officially kicked off on May 11–12 in Bilbao. This three-year project is led by Atos in collaboration with a European consortium of 30 partners from 11 different countries, including universities, cities, and key players from the energy sector: Atos Research &amp; Innovation (SP, coordinator), Atos Worldgrid (FR), Tecnalia (SP), EDF (FR), ENGIE (FR), EDP (PT), Estabanell (SP), Elia (BE), Polytechnic University of Catalunya (SP), IDSA (GE), Intracom (GR), Odit-e (FR), Open &amp; Agile Smart Cities (BE), RINA Consulting (IT), Revolt (IT), Municipality of Maia (PT), Aarhus University (DK), IMT Transfert (FR), Maieutica Cooperativa de Ensino Superior (PT), Institut Mihajlo Pupin (SRB), SENER (SP), Estabanell y Pahisa MERCATOR (SP), Astea (IT), Universidade Catolica Portuguesa (PT), GIREVE (FR), Energy Web (GE), LichtBlick (GE), Power &amp; Mobility (IRL), Meteo for Energy (SP), NORCE Norwegian Research Centre&nbsp;(NO).</p><p>The architecture and recommendations of the Data Space Business Alliance (<a href="https://internationaldataspaces.org/bdva-fiware-gaia-x-and-idsa-launch-alliance-to-accelerate-business-transformation-in-the-data-economy">DSBA</a>, an alliance of <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">Gaia-X</a>, the Big Data Value Association (<a href="https://www.bdva.eu/">BDVA</a>/DAIRO), <a href="https://www.fiware.org/">FIWARE Foundation</a>, and the International Data Spaces Association (<a href="https://internationaldataspaces.org/">IDSA</a>)) will be used as baseline for the design of the OMEGA-X framework. The first communication activities linked to these initiatives have been initiated: during the Gaia-X Energy Data Space Steering Committee, on March 16th and the <a href="https://data-week-2022.b2match.io/components/20122?day=2022-06-01T00%3A00%3A00%2B02%3A00&amp;session=c2Vzc2lvbjoxMTkxODA%3D">BDVA Data Week</a>, on June 1st and during the OASC Annual Meeting on June&nbsp;7th.</p><p>This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe Framework Programme under grant agreement №101069287.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. Our Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) enables any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors the EW-DOS tech stack.

<p>Part of how we try to make sure we stay current and helpful to others is by being curious and thoughtful about our own internal practices here at The Engine Room. With this in mind, we are starting a three-year project to examine and strengthen our own digital resilience and, in doing so, increase our capacity to support others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through this work we hope to, among other things:&nbsp;</p>



  improve the ways we address complex digital resilience challenges in different contexts,  further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices,  learn strategies to further a values-based approach to our infrastructure, and&nbsp;  deepen our capacity to work with partners on their path to do so as well.&nbsp;  



<p>Support from the Ford Foundation has enabled us to carry out this work in the context of a broader structure, the Global Network for Social Justice and Digital Resilience, and we are very excited to be learning from, and collaborating with, nine organisations working at the intersection of social justice and technology: <a href="https://cis-india.org/">Centre for Internet &amp; Society</a> (India), <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/">Citizen Lab</a> (Canada), <a href="https://cchubnigeria.com/">Co-Creation Hub</a> (Nigeria), <a href="https://cipesa.org/">CIPESA</a> (Uganda), <a href="https://www.derechosdigitales.org/">Derechos Digitales</a> (Chile), <a href="https://www.acceso.or.cr/">Fundación Acceso</a> (Costa Rica), <a href="https://nupef.org.br/">Instituto Nupef</a> (Brazil), <a href="https://smex.org/">SMEX</a> (Lebanon), and <a href="https://socialtic.org/">SocialTIC</a> (Mexico).&nbsp;</p>



 Why digital resilience?&nbsp; 



<p>Since the pandemic began, many social justice organisations and activists <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/supporting-organisations-to-navigate-digital-transitions/">have increased their reliance on digital technologies</a>: developing new ways of working and re-shaping programs while supporting staff members’ and communities’ wellbeing. But while using technology and data can increase impact, it can also bring risks. For us, it is important that social justice movements are able to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TER-Strategy-2020-22-Full.pdf">use technology and data in safe, responsible and strategic ways</a>, while also actively mitigating the vulnerabilities created by digital systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this work (and this blog post), we’re using the term ‘digital resilience’ to refer to “a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from – and respond to – digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members.” (This is at this point still an incomplete definition that will likely evolve and change over time, as we work on this project and mature our own digital resilience practices)</p>



 Getting started: mapping out what digital resilience means for our team&nbsp; 



<p>For this project, we have created an internal, cross-team working group that meets monthly to discuss our digital resilience challenges and potential ways we can address them. In addition to deepening our technical expertise to strengthen our own infrastructure, we are also working on improving the ways in which we offer advice and support for partners on organisational security and technical infrastructure choices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The working group’s first step was defining what digital resilience means to us. Here’s some of what came up:&nbsp;</p>



  Ensuring that there is redundancy of knowledge and documentation of processes where possible. For example, making sure that information about infrastructure management is documented clearly, and not held by only one individual;&nbsp;  Striving for an evolving use of tech and data in response to our ever-changing contexts;  Being able to more proactively prepare for emergency scenarios that would impact our digital infrastructure, such as internet shutdowns, social revolts or crises, as well as for connectivity challenges;  Approaching the concept of digital resilience holistically, prioritising people’s wellbeing and ensuring staff’s experiences are reflected in the organisation’s tech choices and policies; and  Considering learning around tech and data, and its surrounding organisational practices, as an ongoing strategy that involves accessible ways of capacity building.&nbsp;  



<p>We will iterate upon these themes as our work in this area progresses: during the next few months, we will continue to strengthen our infrastructure and we plan on sharing our key findings in this space.</p>



 Strengthening our infrastructures&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, we’ve already started to make some changes to our tech infrastructure (led by our Resilient Infrastructure Manager).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first change has been to our video conferencing infrastructure. As a remote organisation, video conferencing is integral to our day to day operations, and we want to use tools that are privacy-respecting and strengthen our organisational security. To this end,&nbsp; we decided to set up our own instances of two tools: <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">Big Blue Button</a> and <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi Meet</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of these tools are encrypted, open source, and incorporate privacy by design. User data is not shared or sold to third parties, both tools have active communities of developers and users, and both have a good reputation among social justice organisations and peers we work with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After testing these tools for a few weeks, we are currently assessing how implementation went and figuring out what adjustments are needed going forward. Watch this space for updates!&nbsp;</p>



 Connect with us 



<p>We are interested in hearing about any digital resilience strengthening processes other social justice organisations are going through, so please don’t hesitate to reach out! And if you need help defining your digital resilience path, feel free <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a support call with us</a>. We look forward to hearing from you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>About half a year before we started Animo Solutions, my co-founders and I discovered Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript, an open source JavaScript/TypeScript framework designed to create interoperable self-sovereign identity solutions. At the time we were just getting acquainted with the concept of SSI. Just the idea that we could use TypeScript to build made our lives so much easier and the tech so much less daunting. It turned into one of the building blocks of our company, and I would end up becoming a maintainer and strong advocate of Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript. Now, after two years of hard work by the community, we’re excited to announce the 0.2.0 release of the framework. In this article, I’ll take you through what this newest release entails and why it will change the way self-sovereign solutions are built.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) is a framework written in TypeScript for creating interoperable self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions. The framework has two main focus points. It aims to be as accessible as possible for any developer whether new or experienced in the world of SSI. It is also designed specifically for multi-platform development, so both server-side and mobile solutions can be built with the framework.</p>



<p>The framework has gained a lot of momentum lately. The community has been growing quickly with various governments and organizations stepping in. Our current contributor count is 37, and the working group calls now have around 10 active participants (as opposed to the two we had two years ago). The potential of the framework has become clear to developers other than us (the fanatics). For example, at Animo we recently received funding from the EU NGI eSSIF-Lab initiative to lift the framework to the next level regarding mobile development options.</p>



<p>The new Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript release (0.2.0) contains some incredible steps forward. Especially in our goal to make the framework AIP 2.0 compliant. AIP 2.0 compliance will not only ensure the framework supports the latest standards and protocols, but it will also greatly increase interoperability and make it more useful outside of the Hyperledger Indy ecosystem. Specifically, this release contains:</p>



  Full support for the out of band and did-exchange protocols  Postgres wallet support  Previously the framework only supported SQLite. This addition ensures the framework is better suited for cloud infrastructure.    Wallet import/export support  This addition enables users to migrate their wallet data to and from other Hyperledger Indy-based wallets.    Pickup protocol v2 for better control over interactions with the mediator  Support for the issue-credential-v2 protocol  The issue credential and present proof v2 extend the framework with the ability to support multiple credential and proof formats. Instead of adding a separate API for the v2 protocols, we have put a lot of effort in designing a single, easy-to-use API that works with both versions and is extensible for later versions in the future. In the next release we’ll be adding support for the present proof v2 protocol.    Credential revocation and revocation notifications for holders and verifiers  This allows holders to prove that a credential hasn’t been revoked and verifiers to verify this. The revocation notifications allow the holders to be informed about the fact that one of their credentials has been revoked, rather than discovering this when trying to present proof.    Full did:peer support  A generic DID resolver that currently supports did:key, did:web, did:sov and did:peer.  An upgrade assistant to help users update their wallets to newer versions of the framework  As the framework evolves over time, some of the underlying data structures may change. With the upgrade assistant, we aim to make it as easy as possible for users to migrate.    



<p>We’re already working hard on version 0.3.0 that will, just like the 0.2.0 release, be packed with new features such as support for the W3C Verifiable Credential Format and BBS+ Signatures 2020, making the framework fully AIP 2.0 compliant.</p>



<p>Check out the 0.2.0 release <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/releases/tag/v0.2.0">here</a> and the update instructions <a href="https://aries.js.org/guides/updating">here</a>. For general documentation, please see<a href="https://aries.js.org/guides"> </a><a href="https://aries.js.org">aries.js.org</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript and its developments, we recommend you join the working group call (07:00 MT / 14:00 UTC on<a href="https://zoom.us/j/92215586249?pwd=Vm5ZTGV4T0cwVEl4blh3MjBzYjVYZz09"> zoom</a>) and check out the<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript"> GitHub repo</a>.

<p>When I found out that I was chosen to be one of the Kim Cameron Award winners from the OpenID foundation, I was truly humbled. While I did not know Kim Cameron personally, I knew of his work and his incredible impact as a visionary in the Identity space.</p>
<p>With that, I am grateful for my work and research in Identity to be recognized with this award and encouraged to continue further. In addition, I was granted the opportunity to be able to get to know many different people from all corners of the identity ecosystem at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022, in Berlin. As a researcher that focuses on Stakeholder and Socio-economic research in Identity, this was even more exciting to meet and learn from those participating directly in the ecosystem. For the rest of this blog, I wanted to share some of the highlights of this experience so far.</p>
<p>The EIC 2022 kicked off with the OpenID Workshop opened with presentations that reflected and showcased their key work these past few months. It was particularly exciting to see how the GAIN project has developed this past year since the White Paper was published at the last EIC 2021, where I co authored along with 150+ others in the field of Identity.</p>
<p>In addition, it was interesting to see what inspiring projects are going on around topics that are particularly important for my research in Verifiable Credentials and Trust Frameworks. At the conference, the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials white paper was released. This was very exciting to learn more about as it is related to my previous and current research regarding SSI, Verifiable Credentials, and digital wallets. Regarding Trust frameworks, I was able to reconnect with OIX and hope to continue and extend our work in the Inventory of Trust Frameworks, Schemes and Lists that we started in the LIGHTest, EU project.</p>
<p>One of the most rewarding experiences that I had was the opportunity to meet and enjoy many conversations with people the Identity Community. It was enlightening to explore outside of “my bubble” and to hear and share insights with other experts from the industry, academia, and non profit’s backgrounds. Another highlight was the Women in Identity networking event and presentations. I am looking to participate more in the German Speaking chapter (DACH) region of the Women in Identity. It is very inspiring to have this space in the Identity community for women.</p>
<p>In a matter of a few days, I heard many inspiring presentations, had many interesting conversations, and met many wonderful people in this field at the Conference. It has already led to multiple conversations of working together regarding future stakeholder research that will hopefully be useful and support the identity community.</p>

   Nearing the end of what was the original end-date of our strategy, we’ve made the decision to extend it for another year, to the end of 2023. More than ever, we need to continue building this strong, resilient and well-networked movement of social justice activists.

<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/the-engine-room-new-strategy-2020/">In 2020, we set out to update our organisational strategy</a>. When the pandemic hit, we were only partly through the process, and were hit by a wave of urgency (and confusion and uncertainty, and glimmers of hope and solidarity). The strategy we released is of its moment – guided by both our knowledge of how technology layers upon the deep roots of injustice, and by our rapidly changing reality as the pandemic unfolded.</p>



<p>In the two years since, the world has continued to change and yet also remain the same in so many ways, as it so often does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emerging technologies have been deployed without harm mitigation strategies, creating new forms of power asymmetries and accelerating existing structural injustices. Surveillance technologies have continued to proliferate – in some cases accelerated by Covid-19 tracing measures – and continue to be deployed against activists and movements around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Internet shutdowns and restrictions on freedom of expression are still commonplace, particularly as repressive tactics deployed in the face of progressive agitation for a more just world. Digital attacks and disinformation campaigns have continued to target rights defenders and activists across a variety of spheres of action. Under-resourced activists continue to fight for funding and capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And at the same time, civil society has continued to diversify and strengthen its approaches to using technology and data for organising, for movement-building, for <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/takeaways-from-our-community-call-on-intersections-between-data-digital-rights-and-social-justice/">creating networks of solidarity</a>, and for spreading messages of a more accessible, vibrant and just world. We’ve seen increasing attention paid to the importance of safeguarding our data responsibly, of understanding the power within technologies, and of interacting more safely in digital spaces (especially when these extend into physical ones, too).</p>



<p>Along the way, we’ve drawn inspiration from partners like <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/meet-our-new-matchbox-partners/">Albinism Umbrella</a>, a Matchbox partner who have approached the challenge of practising data responsibility with tenacity, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/invite-community-call-responsible-data-social-justice/">investing time and energy beyond their everyday responsibilities to safeguard the communities they work with</a>; organisations like the FRIDA Fund, who seek to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/bringing-political-values-into-practical-tech-decisions-learnings-from-our-partnership-with-frida/">thread their commitment to youth-led, feminist visions of justice through their internal technology practices</a>; allies like Uganda-based Pollicy, seeking to change tech regulations and data governance &amp; protection laws in ways that reflect lived realities; and funders like Numuun, who are exploring alternate approaches to funding, and those like Ford Foundation, who are building on legacies in new ways. We’ve been energised by conversations held in the Responsible Data listserv; by the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-toolkit-orgsec-practitioners/">organisational security</a> practitioners in our networks, who continue to make efforts towards strengthening their communities and their approaches to supporting social justice movements; by visions for <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-in-the-service-of-justice/">justice-focused technologies</a>; by the work of inspiring independent researchers like Timnit Gebru and her new <a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/about">DAIR Institute</a>; and by the efforts of countless organisations, activists and movements around the world who are seeking to develop a counter-narrative of technology and data that is rights-respecting and justice-oriented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, nearing the end of what was the original end-date of our strategy, we’ve made the decision to extend it for another year, to the end of 2023. More than ever, we need to continue building this strong, resilient and well-networked movement of social justice activists. More than ever, the roots of millenia of injustice are coming online and shaping our digital spaces.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TER-Strategy-July-2022-update.pdf" title="read our lightly updated strategy here">read our lightly updated strategy here</a>: we have revisited a few sections with more learnings from two years of pandemic, updated timelines, and adjusted language around the “end” of the pandemic and the major geopolitical shifts that have happened since then. We are also working on a strategy roadmap map that links together our updated strategy, our logic model, our targets and milestones, and our monitoring/evaluation and values-aligned budgeting processes. We look forward to sharing that deep-dive for folks who are on similar journeys.</p>



<p>If you want to have a more in-depth dive into our projects, get to know some of the <a href="https://2021.theengineroom.org/">work that has been guided by our strategy so far in our 2021 Retrospective</a>.

 On&nbsp;4th of July 2022 at 4039470 &nbsp;block number&nbsp;the&nbsp;Commercio Network chain&nbsp;has been &nbsp;be upgraded to the new version of software&nbsp;4.0.0. This upgrade marks &nbsp;exactly two years of activity since our chain officially lunched the first &nbsp;2.1 main-net on July 4 2020. 
<p></p>
 The 4.0 version will allow the Commercio Network blockchain to implement &nbsp;IBC protocol &nbsp;&nbsp;as well as align with the latest versions of Cosmos SDK&nbsp;and CosmWasm. 
<p></p>
 The IBC protocol &nbsp;is an interoperability protocol for communicating arbitrary data between arbitrary state machines.<br>
The Transport Layer (TAO) provides the infrastructure necessary to establish secure connections between chains and authenticate data packets, while the Application Layer defines exactly how these data packets should be packaged and interpreted by the sending and receiving chains.&nbsp;The IBC application layer can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications, like &nbsp;token transfer, inter-chain accounts (delegate calls between two chains), NFT &nbsp;token transfer, and oracle data feeds. 
<p></p>
 Cosmos SDK allows developers to easily spin up application-specific blockchains without having to code each bit of functionality of their application from scratch. Cosmos SDK custom modules can be used by any developer as they build their own application. &nbsp;We have upgraded to the latest Cosmos SDK Version and we &nbsp;are now on par with all other chains. 
<p></p>
 Finally Cosmwasm is an alternative route to native Cosmos SDK custom modules. &nbsp;CosmWasm is a smart contract platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. Simply put, it’s the Cosmos (Cosm) way of using WebAssembly (Wasm) This means that we can easily add CosmWasm smart contracting support to our commercio.network &nbsp;chain, without without &nbsp;doing an hard fork chain stopping event. CosmWasm will be used to mint Fungibile tokens, Non fungible Tokens and the CommercioDEX &nbsp;our Automatic Market Making &nbsp;Local decentralized exchange.

<p>Research by Digital Identity NZ, a member of the NZTech Alliance, has found two thirds of Kiwis are more likely to go online to do things than face to face, NZTech chief executive Graeme Muller says.</p>



<p>As people’s lives and work become more reliant on the digital environment so does the need for our ability to trust the digital environment, he says.</p>



<p>“This increasing use of digital platforms and services can easily be shaken if people lose trust in the digital environment.</p>



<p>“At the same time, if there is a high level of trust, people are making increasing use of digital tools and services, which leads to better competition, higher productivity and better outcomes for all.</p>



<p>“Interestingly, the research finds that digital trust in businesses comes from a mix of non-digital things such as the company’s reputation, how big the company is and what information they ask for.</p>



<p>“Building and maintaining digital trust is critical for Aotearoa’s economic future and it is a complex area bringing together privacy, cyber-security and digital identity, all of which will be analysed and discussed at the upcoming <a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata / summit</a> in Wellington later this month.</p>



<p>One of the speakers at the July 27 event is Kaye-Maree Dunn, a previous NZTech Board member and co-founder of&nbsp;Māori digital identity firm,&nbsp;Āhau.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She is a&nbsp;technology entrepreneur with Te Rarawa, Ngā Puhi, Ngāi Te Rangikoianaake, Ngāti Mahanga and Ngāi Tāmanuhiri roots and will discuss the importance of the community and end user as the key stakeholders in digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Global digital identity and trust expert David Birch is coming from the UK to discuss the challenges of identity in the growing metaverse and the emergence of a reputation economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another&nbsp;speaker is chief executive of Potatoes NZ, Chris Claridge. He is passionate about horticulture and the potential for tech to add value to New Zealand’s primary produce.</p>



<p>Digital trust is becoming increasingly important even in the physical world as customers seek evidence of sustainable production and the providence of our agricultural products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Few topics are as critical to Aotearoa’s future prosperity and the wellbeing of its people as trust. The summit brings world leading speakers on the subject to New Zealand. Establishing and maintaining trust in the digital world is relevant to everyone.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, DIF for short, is delighted to learn of the <a href="https://bit.ly/3OUFttK">W3C Director's final decision</a> to approve the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) V1.0 specification as an official W3C Recommendation. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. <a href="https://bit.ly/3OUFttK">Read the full text of the decision here on the W3C website.</a></p>
<p>Announcing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID) v1.0 specification</a> as an open web standard signals that it is technically sound, mature, and ready for widespread adoption. Having an established v1.0 specification allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus, not only at the many groups meeting at DIF, but across the digital identity community.</p>
<p>Three formal objections were registered and considered as part of the W3C approval process; these were ultimately overruled by the W3C director after careful analysis and consultation with all parties, leading to today's decision to approve the DIDCore specification as a W3C Recommendation. <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/03/did-fo-report.html">Read the content of the objections as well as the counter-arguments here.</a></p>
<p>This specification is the result of half a decade of sustained, broad-based, dedicated work on the part of W3C, DIF, and ToIP members. We acknowledge also the work done by numerous, forward-thinking organizations who have already built working implementations using the provisional specification, thereby laying the foundations of new infrastructures for "identity data''. Participants of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a> have contributed to such foundational DID infrastructure and tooling, for example the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a>. This community-maintained tool makes it possible to resolve many different DID methods, therefore supporting interoperability and data portability efforts.<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">Check out some more of the exciting potential use-cases for DIDs in the W3C documentation here.</a></p>
<p>Looking forward, a newly-chartered <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/did">W3C DID Working Group</a> is expected to deliver a selection of standard DID methods and further demonstrate interoperation between implementations. The community and Member review of such proposed methods is the natural place to evaluate the questions raised by the objectors and other Member reviewers regarding decentralization, fitness for purpose, and sustainable resource utilization.</p>
<p>We believe DIDs will change the course of digital identity by building-in better user controls, portability, and interoperability at the lowest possible level, while also offering increased security and simplicity for implementers and service providers. This advancement unlocks new opportunities for our digital lives, and we look forward to leveraging DIDs and other technologies developed in the community to champion a new class of user-first, self-owned digital identity systems.</p>
<p>Looking for a way to get involved in work involving DIDs? <a href="https://identity.foundation/join/">Joining DIF is a great way to start</a>; you are invited to contribute, learn and connect with our diverse community of members today!

 How the KBW community is convening systems <p>First published in 2021 by the Social Learning Lab, <a href="https://wenger-trayner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/21-08-31-Systems-Convening-Full-PDF-version-corrected.pdf">Systems Convening: A crucial form of leadership for the 21st century</a> by Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayner is an “evolution of [their] work on social learning theory and practice.”</p><p>The Keep Badges Weird (KBW) community is filled with what Wenger-Trayner call “system conveners”.</p>Systems Convening graphic cc-by Laura Hilliger with illustrations cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<blockquote>“A [system conveners] stance is both visionary and pragmatic. They look at the social landscape in which they operate — an organization, a city, a community, a country, the world — and they see unrealized potential that exists across traditional boundaries and silos. Many challenges today require learning that brings people together across different practices, different institutions, different goals, different cultures, different loyalties. Systems conveners seek to enable the conversations and learning across these boundaries that are needed to make a difference.”</blockquote><p>Systems Convening lays out 7 types of work that go into transitioning <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">from the first loop to the second loop</a>. This post highlights how KBW members are doing this work for learners around the&nbsp;world.</p> 1) Narrative work: crafting a convening call Narrative work: crafting a convening call<p>KBW helps people understand the badge landscape. The community is there to provide solidarity for badge champions and newbies. We do not assume prior knowledge of Open Badges or Verifiable Credentials. We recognise and celebrate those who can share their experience. Anyone interested in badges or integrating <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a> are welcome to&nbsp;join.</p> 2) Legitimacy work: Grow a sphere of influence Legitimacy work: Grow a sphere of influence<p>Badge champions started the community as a response to a disappearing communal spaces for people working on badges. This community includes the people who developed the concept of alternative, digital credentials. We designed and built tools, frameworks and experiments that have pushed technology over the last decade. The connective tissue of Keep Badges Weird is the relationships developed around all things badges. And we’re creating new relationships too.</p><p>Through our <a href="https://app.participate.com/conduct">Code of Conduct</a> and determination to make Keep Badges Weird a big tent for everyone, we provide a welcoming space for people wherever they are on their badge&nbsp;journey.</p> 3) Boundary work: Convene across&nbsp;silos Boundary work: Convene across&nbsp;silos<p>One of the key boundaries that we have to bridge is one that has always existed in the field of education. It’s a boundary between what education is really about and oppression. We work at this boundary by helping people understand that the bottom line should be about people. This often conflicts with what most bottom lines in our culture actually are (profit). Engaging across silos means closing the gulf between the old system and the new. We need to help the old system decline gracefully. We need to help corporate HR departments, professional development programmes, universities, school administrators and anyone else who creates learning programmes understand how Open Recognition can benefit their learners, as well as their business.</p> 4) Identity work: Support personal transformation Identity work: Support personal transformation<p>We understand certain things about society, work, culture and education. When we learn social or cultural norms from a young age, we tend not to question them all too much. These norms are just…normal. We often think “this is how it is”. But if anything should be clear at this moment in history, it’s that the norms are changing. We have opportunity to influence what the new normal should mean. In the context of education and accreditation, the new normal should recognise:</p><blockquote>“the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.”</blockquote><p>Participating in the Keep Badges Weird community means rethinking what teaching and learning “have” to look like. From an identity perspective, it is getting comfortable with the part inside you that wants to play, experiment and innovate.</p> 5) Agency work: Cultivate the power to&nbsp;act Agency work: Cultivate the power to&nbsp;act<p>The activities in the KBW community run using participatory methodologies and flat hierarchies. Our tools are open and we talk about our work. We invite you, any and everyone, to interact, respond, feedback and contribute. Everyone is welcome. We do our best to model contribution in a way that feels safe for whomever shows up. We commit to helping people feel their own agency, and we hope that people in the community feel celebrated.</p> 6) Power work: Deal with power structures Power work: Deal with power structures<p>Many of us in the community have worked inside organisations with established power hierarchies. We break down unhelpful power structures and show how distributed leadership and personal agency has impact. We work with people in power to help them understand the undeniable benefits to sharing power. We acknowledge the social and historical structures that benefit certain kinds of people, while excluding others. We challenge such structures with intentional work towards diversity and inclusion.</p> 7) Narrative work: Articulate the&nbsp;value Narrative work: Articulate the&nbsp;value<p>Look, pobody is nerfect, and we, like any community of practice, need to get better at articulating the value of Open Recognition. We need to provide resources and guides to help folks understand the power of marking learning journeys in a more holistic way. The difference we’re making is nothing short of democratising how learning is captured, so that anyone can show their knowledge and skills. The potential to create more equity in education and employment is&nbsp;massive.</p> Get involved <p>The future of education and employment is <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/advocating-for-learner-centric-badge-systems-21a65be4a725">learner-centric</a>. How we support people who believe that this is true is up to us. How can we get better at supporting YOU? <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">Join the community</a> and help&nbsp;us!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-is-about-breaking-boundaries-42afb0415826">Keep Badges Weird is about breaking boundaries</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The first, at the beginning of the session was What does open mean to&nbsp;you?</p>Start of first&nbsp;sessionStart of second&nbsp;session<p>As you can see, the focus of these initial thoughts were on things like sharing knowledge, being transparent, and collaborating.</p><p>At the end of our short time together, we asked What does open mean to you&nbsp;now?</p>End of first&nbsp;sessionEnd of second&nbsp;session<p>Even with a little bit of input and discussion, you can see the shift to words such as ‘inclusivity’ and phrases such as ‘being more accessible’ or ‘getting everyone involved’.</p> Next steps An overview of the programme<p>We’re currently delivering synchronous writing workshops as part of Module 1, and are working on a slimmed down / more tailored version of our email-based course <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">What We Talk About When We Talk About Open</a> for Module 2. This will be delivered asynchronously over the&nbsp;summer.</p><p>Modules 3 through to 6 involve hybrid synchronous and asynchronous elements on a range of topics and will run from September through to early 2023. We’re looking forward to getting to know participants even better over the next few&nbsp;months!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-does-open-mean-to-you-cec90dff6845">What does ‘open’ mean to you?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Light Touch Support programme</a>, we support social justice organisations to effectively (and responsibly) use tech and data. Since 2016, we have supported hundreds of groups on themes varying from human right defence to legal empowerment.</p>



<p>One clear trend we’ve seen over the years is a consistent interest in building online communities – whether establishing new communities or strengthening existing ones.</p>



<p>The partners we’ve worked with want to do this for various reasons: to share knowledge about the issues they work on, to make connections with the people they work with, to promote capacity building for their communities, to form alliances with other movements and organisations and more.</p>



<p>Building online communities, however, isn’t easy! Bringing together diverse individuals and organisations is already complex and doing this online can bring even more complexity. In this blog post, we share some things we like to keep in mind when supporting organisations who are interested in going down this path.</p>



 Know the goals driving your community-building 



<p>Often, the first thing organisations start with is, “What’s the right tool to build an online community?” More often than not, our answer is: it depends!&nbsp;</p>



<p>We always suggest that organisations first look closely at their work and context and organisational values, and dig into how these connect to the goals they want to achieve with an online community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing this is fundamental to deciding on tools and processes for bringing people together online: a social movement looking to build a public forum where hundreds of activists will gather to mobilise against a repressive government, for instance, will need to take a very different approach to&nbsp; a small group of co-workers who want to build a community inside of the organisation where they work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some questions that can support you in mapping out the intended purposes of the proposed community:&nbsp;</p>



  Why do you want to build this digital community? What do you want to achieve? Is the goal to connect, to build a movement or campaign, to exchange knowledge, or something else?  What might potential members want from this community? Where might their goals align (or not) with yours?  



<p>Reflecting on the questions above, and trying to answer them with as much specificity as you can, will guide your strategies for community-building as well as help potential members know what to expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Plan for the ongoing work of community management&nbsp; 



<p>Maintaining an online community is a lot of work, in both the short term and the long term. It requires setting aside time, human resources and tech infrastructure to keep things running smoothly. Here are some questions and ideas that can help you assess what it may take to maintain the online community you’re trying to build:</p>



  Maintenance: What technical infrastructure is required to build a community that meets your needs and goals? What will it take to foster user engagement? Will this be a public community or a curated/private community? Can you map the resources you’ll need to keep this community running?  Moderation: Moderating community groups is part of ensuring that the content and direction of the group reflects the community’s values and goals. One first step of moderation is creating community guidelines — a set of guidelines ensuring community members can engage meaningfully. Here are a few examples:  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cx2nO86gJBmg40TZdJLcT8e8hD3i3svUPb5gbMG1WQg/edit">Responsible Data community guidelines &amp; policy</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.elastic.co/community/codeofconduct">Elastic community code of conduct</a>  <a href="https://geekfeminismdotorg.wordpress.com/about/code-of-conduct/">Geek Feminism blog code of conduct</a>    



  Communication and interaction:&nbsp;  Keeping members engaged and interacting is one of the toughest parts of building an online community. Having someone who makes sure conversations are flowing, resources are available and strategies are being shared can help keep your community alive. Do you have someone like this in your organisation? Or is there someone in the community who would be interested?  Make sure community members know when and how to engage: inform the community about events and activities that are happening, and how they can participate in discussions.&nbsp;  Be clear about how community members can&nbsp; access the information they need and who they can reach out to if needed. One option is to publish tipsheets and guides about community issues, and send the community regular updates.&nbsp;    



 Deciding which tool or platform to use&nbsp; 



<p>Different tools and platforms will work best depending on the goals you have, who you’re engaging with, the uses you expect, and your capacity to manage the community. Each potential tool or approach comes with its own set of advantages and challenges.</p>



<p>When selecting a platform, factors to take into account include:&nbsp;</p>



  User needs and behaviours:&nbsp;  What tool functionalities are the most likely to respond to user needs? For example, do you need a chat function? Advanced privacy and security controls?  What characteristics of a tool or platform might be a good fit for your members’ current technology preferences and limitations? For example, do most potential members prefer using their phones for this kind of participation, rather than their computers? Is low internet connectivity a concern?&nbsp;&nbsp;    Alignment with your values:&nbsp;  Which of your organisational values need to be taken into account when selecting a tool?&nbsp;  Are security, privacy and data protection a priority for you and for community members?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    



<p>There are many different tools that we have seen organisations use when building their online communities, depending on their needs and capacities. For instance, the <a href="https://community.namati.org/">Namati Community</a> is a legal empowerment network that interacts via an online forum, while the organisers of the <a href="https://internetfreedomfestival.org/wiki/index.php/IFF_Mattermost">Internet Freedom Festival</a> maintain a Mattermost space where community members gather on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some types of tools you can use for your online community include:</p>



  Chat applications: Tools like Slack or Mattermost, for example, can have channels based on specific themes or topics. Through these, users can communicate and share resources.  Wikis: These are often used for knowledge sharing and/or sharing resources for&nbsp; community members to use and comment on.  Mailing Lists: Community users often subscribe to mailing lists with specific themes, where they can participate in threads and share announcements and resources. This platform favours long-form exchanges and it can be easier for people to use (since they sign up using just an email account and most are already familiar with how email works), and messages go straight into their inboxes (there’s no additional platform they need to log on to).&nbsp;  Web-based forum: This option is more easily organised (especially when compared to a mailing list), and it has more search functionality. Members can also build their user profiles and have group conversations.&nbsp;  



<p>Within each of these types of tools, there are many options, and each one will have budgetary, technical and human resource implications that might make them a fit (or not) for your needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may also find yourself navigating questions about open source vs. proprietary, self-hosted or cloud-based, and more. For help navigating these questions, you can give our tool <a href="https://alidade.tech/">Alidade</a> a try. (This is an interactive guide designed to help organisations figure out what kind of technology tool would fit their needs).&nbsp;</p>



 A final note: Building an online community is a learning process!&nbsp; 



<p>There is no single formula for building a successful online community: rather, it is an iterative learning process, and you may decide to change approaches along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each organisation or movement operates in their own context, works on different issues, interacts with different audiences and carries their own set of values. Any individual organisation’s decisions around whether and how to build an online community will be shaped by these factors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having worked for years in various corners of the decentralized identity sphere,
I have developed a pet peeve for "technosolutionism": the notion that a
sufficiently innovative technology can solve a social problem, or a business
problem, without complex and nuanced changes to social and business practice. No
less unnerving, perhaps, are the brute-force capitalists that chauvinistically
proclaim that with enough momentum, traction, and capital, any Betamax can be
relegated to the dustbin of history by a vastly inferior VHS. Both views are
based on facts, and yet both are also dangerously blindered. Real progress
cannot be attributed to TED-Talkers, to technologies that magically conquer
markets, or to market-makers that appear publicly as lone snake-charmers working
miracles. Real progress is made by rich, cross-disciplinary teams and
heterogeneous coalitions coming together to attack hard problems from every
angle at once.</p><p></p><p>Verite is one such coalition, in that it takes a truly cross-disciplinary
approach to industry-wide problems. It is rooted in a multi-stakeholder design
process, deeply informed by a complex regulatory strategy and the legal needs of
various industries. It proposes an end-to-end interoperability stack for
portable data, optimized for end-user control and data minimization. It supports
centrally-planned, "cathedral" architectures, but equally supports more
self-custodial and decentralized "bazaar" approaches, with various extension
points and governance possibilities baked into the core building blocks. It is a
scalable technology designed to be co-governed by the ecosystem that grows
around it, with a calculated resistance to platform plays and lock-in strategies
that would usher in platform economics.</p><p>But how does it work? That requires a bit of cross-discipinary understanding, so
bear with me while I explain things cross-wise.</p> Semantics for the non-technical business developer<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Cryptography makes getting data from one context to another fairly easy--
insofar as you can look up someone's current, valid public key, you can be
just as confident of any data they sign with the corresponding private key. If
that data includes a timestamp for the signature, an expiration date, and a way
to check it hasn't been revoked, you're dealing with some pretty trustworthy
data. This is the easy part of data portability.</p><p>The harder part is what software engineers colloquially call "Semantics": the
fine art of knowing what the heck any of those data actually meant in their
original context. The data passed around in signed, portable form is only as
useful and trustworthy as you are certain of what each "true", "false",
"null", "", "3/5" and "pending" meant to the signer at the time of signing.</p><p>If that sounds esoteric, it might help to put on your business developer hat and
think through a concrete example: what exactly might <code>"AML_check":"true"</code> mean?
It is easy to imagine situations where not all AML checks are created equal, or
doors which only more rigorous AML checks should open, perhaps at different
price-points or with different liability/insurance requirements. Who operated
the check, and what exact definition they checked against (on what data points,
against what jurisdiction's requirements, etc) are questions well beyond
<code>true|false</code>. At this point, it should be quite clear that "semantics" is not
just a required course in Computer Engineering programs: semantics is where the
rubber of software design meets the road of real-world law and business.</p> Semantics from the Verifer's POV<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>If semantics is how engineers scale up "reliance" (i.e., how one company can
safely rely on other company's data), we need to walk through the semantics not
from the issuer's POV, but from the Verifier's. They are, after all, betting
big on Other People's Properties.</p><p>So let's take a little tour of the properties encoded in the "schemas"
(sometimes called "schemata" or "credential definitions") that Verite authors
and manages over time. Each schema is something like a recipe for data points,
what engineers call the "data shape" of each credential or token. Take, for
example, the <a href="https://github.com/centrehq/verite/blob/main/packages/docs/static/definitions/schemas/0.0.1/KYCAMLAttestation">v0.0.1 schema for a
KYCAMLAttestation</a>
credential: what you see, in machine-readable script, is a list of the mandatory
and optional properties that each credential needs to have, and the "type" of
each (string, integer, etc.). Let's walk through some specific properties to
explain the options.</p> ApprovalDate<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>All verifiable credentials contain an issuance date, but crucially, this is the
time of signature, or to put it another way, the time of exporting the data and
putting it under the direct control of the user; the underlying decision about
considering a user "KYC'd" might have happened minutes, or days, or months
before. For this reason, a distinct date property is included, which is the date
of the decision; it is usually more accurate to require freshness of the KYC
decision than the data artifact.</p> Process<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>One of these properties, <code>process</code>, is not really a simple, singular property
like the others. It is a string, but that string actually contains a link to a
second schema; in the example above, taken from the tutorials and examples of
the current sample implementation, all the KYCAML credentials point to <a href="https://github.com/centrehq/verite/blob/main/packages/docs/static/definitions/processes/kycaml/0.0.1/usa">this
process
definition</a>.
As you can see, this second schema outlines at a high level the real-world
process used to arrive at the first schema's data points (in machine-readable
format, which can include links to additional machine-readable documents and/or
to human-readable contracts or legal terms). Or, to put it another way, this
defined what the issuer meant by "AML_check" in more or less detail; more
rigorous and production-ready process definitions could include links to which
authorities or registries were checked, maximum time between checks and
issuance/decision date, etc.</p><p>There is a 1-to-many relationship between credentials and processes; many
different processes can be used to arrive at the same bundle of distinct claims,
and issuers operating in multiple jurisdictions often juggle many different
processes for different customer bases. Not all processes should be assumed to
be equivalent; in fact, the whole point of schematizing them is to allow
precision in defining their difference and choosing which to accept in a given
situation. The closer this kind of system gets to production, the more likely
this process of refinement will involve getting into the weeds and talking to
lawyers!</p><p>We are assuming that over time, more and more processes will be added to the
system, as more and more issuers come on line and want to define precisely what
conclusions and liabilities they are comfortable with verifiers extracting from
their credentials. That said, as competition grows, many will simply conform to
existing credentials to simplify proof of "equivalence". I.e., even if their
credentials are checked to a more complex or detailed process, new issuers may
choose to issue credentials only containing what their competitors' credentials
already cover, to simplify the due diligence of those looking to accept both
interchangeably.</p> Issuer<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The mention of equivalence between competitors lays bare something often
implicit in the structure of Verite and in the design of verifiable credentials
more generally: even if the claims made by two issuers are equivalent and
interoperable. Identical credentials issued by different authorities are never
truly interchangeable, because the identity of those authorities matter, as does
reputation, history, marketing, jurisdiction, and licensing. Every verifier
decides whose credentials it wants to accept, according to its own due
diligence process and risk-management decisions; "signing on to Verite" does not
forfeit that right at all.</p><p>On the contrary, over time we hope Verite will build and iterate automated
mechanisms that reduce the complexity and work involved in manually onboarding
and vetting issuers. Once there are enough issuers for a given credential type,
anchored to process definitions and pegged to requirements for different
use-cases and/or jurisdictions, manually allow-listing issuers will not be a
scalable approach. When that day comes, we hope Verite can house some form of
collective-diligence mechanism for deciding which issuers to trust for which
credentials, something like a recommendation network or a vetting authority.
This might use token-curated registries or other on-chain artefacts, or their
auditing might be off-chain, depending on the use-case and parties involved.</p> Composability: Extension-points and Decision-points<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Having looked at the schema for individual credentials, we've discussed how this
kind of data can safely scale and be relied upon. But with the mention of
registries or other mechanisms to scale up equivalence (between issuers), we
start to see the big picture of scalable and composable reliance. Companies
need decision trees of whom to accept as a customer or how to onboard customers
based on portable data they bring from elsewhere. Automating that requires lots
of flexibility, composibility, and fine print. Engineering for real-world trust
across contexts is hard work. (And thanks for making it this far, I know it's a
long tour!)</p><p>Fundamentally, Verite is a system of composable data formats that let people
encode complex reliance and liability relationships in simple schemas, and thus
a forward-commitment to interoperability. Each data format can be thought of as
one link in a "reliance chain", regardless of whether the linkages are between
divisions or subsidiaries of one company or across company lines.</p><p>Putting aside a little the question of how many different entities are present
in the chain, you could also think of each linkage between different credentials
and processes and issuers as an "interface", allowing the end-to-end system to
be highly composible, mixing and matching credentials and data points as needed.</p><p>A third way of conceptualizing the whole is to take an inventory of all the
"decision points":</p>  Each issuer chooses which credentials to issue,  Each credential issued refers specifically to the process definitions it used
to arrive at those claims,  Each issuer can choose which kinds of wallets to issue these credentials into,
based on technical and/or business criteria  Each wallet-holder can inspect these credentials and, with a little effort,
understand them; nothing in them is opaque or proprietary  Each verifier can choose which issuers, which credentials, and which process
definitions are adequate for a given use-case  If that much choice is overwhelming, verifiers can choose to trust "bundles"
or sets of credentials, process, and issuers recommended by Verite (or other
authorities)    <p>Add to this that anyone can join and propose additional credential schemas,
process schemas, and digital or real-world trust mechanisms. The superpower</p> Conclusion: Anti-fragile Identity Solutions<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Over time, we are expecting more and more implementers to show up, allowing a
competitive ecosystem to emerge for multiple roles in this system. No one should
fear this kind of competition, though, at least, no one interested in
decentralization. If anything, building in equivalence, semantic flexibility,
and shared governance into an open-ended identity system is just common sense,
given how uncertain the future of that system's requirements looks today.</p><p>To name just one unpredictable factor, regulations on international capital
flows, digital asset liabilities, and reporting requirements are all coming fast
worldwide. These will fundamentally evolve and continue to iterate the
groundrules for what level of identity assurance, auditability, and sharing is
required for various kinds of economic activity; more crucially for Verite, it
will also iterate how directly or indirectly these requirements can be met, by
what kinds of reliance.</p><p>The more reliance is allowed, the more competition will arise in the cottage
industry of distributed identity-checking and verification; to stabilize and
regularize this reliance, full-blown "trust frameworks" (multilateral reliance
agreements) could emergy quite quickly as they have in other identity markets,
particularly if the regulators of major markets demand both auditability and
healthy competition outside of proprietary platforms.</p><p>To be ready for this development, we recommend everyone trying to pin identities
onto financial actors think hard about how flexible and composable their trust
system is. If it's not regulation-ready and winter-proof, if it won't survive a
sudden redrawing of allegiances and a reorientation around new networks and
flows, is it really fit-for-purpose? Identity problem necessitate
lawyer-friendly engineering... but also open-ended, antifragile engineering, if
it's going to survive the roller coaster of crypto.</p>

 Introduction<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) allow people and organizations to issue statements on behalf of others. These statements are then verifiable even if the original issuer is no longer around. We can see VCs in action in many KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) flows. For the entire flow to work, though, there needs to be a verifier. This can be a centralized service, or it can be managed through a blockchain with verifications happening on-chain. Today, we'll walk through how to build a VC Registry Smart Contract in Solidity.</p><p>Verite, a toolchain for working with VCs, has some clear patterns for verifying credentials. When using the <a>smart contract pattern</a> for verifications, you can use any blockchain you would like. For the sake of this guide, we will focus on <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/">Solidity</a>, which is the programming language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p> Setup<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>For this tutorial, we will use Hardhat. Hardhat provides tooling to set up your development environment, test contract code, deploy contracts, and more. <a href="https://hardhat.org/tutorial/setting-up-the-environment.html">Follow this guide to get started with Hardhat</a>.</p><p>Once your Hardhat project is set up, it's time to create our registry contract. In the contracts folder.</p> Creating The Contract<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In the <code>contracts</code> folder, create a new file called <code>VerificationRegistry.sol</code>. In that file, we want to specify the version of Solidity we're using. We're going to be using OpenZeppelin contracts soon, so we need to make sure our contract uses the same Solidity version as OpenZeppelin, which is currently <code>0.8.0</code>. A the top of your file add:</p>   <code>pragma solidity ^0.8.0;<br></code>      OpenZeppelin Library<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Now, before we move on, let's install <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin's library of contracts</a>. This will allow us to pull in dependent contracts that are safe and audited without us having to write them ourselves. To install, run the following:</p><p><code>npm install @openzeppelin/contracts</code></p><p>Once the dependencies are installed, we can import the appropriate libraries into our contract. Let's take a second to understand what those libraries are.</p><p>The first library we will import into our contract is the <code>Ownable</code> library. This one is designed to make it easier to lock function calls down to the owner of the contract.</p><p>The next library we will import is the <code>ECDSA</code> library. This library is used to help us decode signed and hashed data; in the core examples for Verite, ECDSA keys are used to sign portable attestations in off-chain token form (i.e. VCs).</p><p>Finally, we will import the <code>EIP712</code> library. This is the most important library in our contract since it is foundational to how we will verify credentials-- allowing a standard crypto wallet to sign over VCs at time of live presentation using their private key. For more on this, be sure to reference the <a>Smart Contract Patterns section</a>.</p><p>To import these libraries, add the following below the Solidity version in our contract:</p>   <code>pragma solidity ^0.8.0;<br><br>import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";<br>import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol";<br>import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/draft-EIP712.sol";<br></code>      Verite Library<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>There's one additional library we want to import. This one is an interface library that allows us to more easily map the types necessary in our contract variables and functions. For brevity, we're not going to write the interface itself. We'll just copy it from the existing example from Centre. You can <a href="https://github.com/centrehq/verite/blob/main/packages/contract/contracts/IVerificationRegistry.sol">grab a copy of the interface library contract here</a>.</p><p>Create a new contract file in your <code>contracts</code> folder and call it <code>IVerificationRegistry.sol</code>. Paste the contents of the example file linked above into that contract, then return to your <code>VerificationRegistry.sol</code> file.</p><p>Add one more import to the Verification Registry contract:</p>   <code>import "./IVerificationRegistry.sol";<br></code>     <p>Now, we're ready to write the contract!</p> State Variables<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Our Verification Registry requires some contract state. If you remember from the Smart Contract Patterns part of the documentation, this means either a verifier or a subject will have to pay gas to update the state of the contract when a new verification is added to the registry.</p><p>Let's go ahead and start creating the contract and add in some variables. First, we need to define the contract itself. We do that like so:</p>   <code>contract VerificationRegistry is Ownable, EIP712("VerificationRegistry", "1.0"), IVerificationRegistry {<br><br>}<br></code>     <p>There are a couple of interesting things going on already. First, we are using the EIP712 library to help us with signature validation and hashing. When we use that library, it requires two parameters: a name and a version.</p><p>Next, we are extending our contract to use the types defined in our interface contract.</p> Declaring the Structural Variables<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Ok, now let's define some variables. We'll drop them all below and then we'll talk through each.</p>   <code>// Verifier addresses mapped to metadata (VerifierInfo) about the Verifiers.<br>mapping(address =&gt; VerifierInfo) private _verifiers;<br><br>// Verifier signing keys mapped to verifier addresses<br>mapping(address =&gt; address) private _signers;<br><br>// Total number of active registered verifiers<br>uint256 _verifierCount;<br><br>// All verification records keyed by their uuids<br>mapping(bytes32 =&gt; VerificationRecord) private _verifications;<br><br>// Verifications mapped to subject addresses (those who receive verifications)<br>mapping(address =&gt; bytes32[]) private _verificationsForSubject;<br><br>// Verifications issued by a given trusted verifier (those who execute verifications)<br>mapping(address =&gt; bytes32[]) private _verificationsForVerifier;<br><br>// Total verifications registered (mapping keys not being enumerable, countable, etc)<br>uint256 private _verificationRecordCount;<br></code>     <p>The comments above each variable help explain what their purpose is, but we'll walk through it here as well.</p><p>The <code>_verifiers</code> variable is a mapping of information tied to verifiers. If we look at the <code>IVerificationRegistry.sol</code> file, we can see the <code>VerifierInfo</code> type looks like this:</p>   <code>struct VerifierInfo {<br>    bytes32 name;<br>    string did;<br>    string url;<br>    address signer;<br>}<br></code>     <p>We won't copy over every type into this tutorial, but this shows how you can see the shape of the expected data for various variables.</p><p>The next variable we have is <code>_signers</code>. This is a mapping of the keys verifiers use to sign the verification records. It's how the Verification Registry contract can validate the verifier is who they say they are.</p> Count methods<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Next, we have a simple count to help track the number of verifiers: <code>_verifierCount</code>.</p>   <code>uint256 _verifierCount;<br></code>     <p>We, of course, have to track the actual verifications as well. That is done in the mapping called <code>_verifications</code>.</p>   <code>mapping(bytes32 =&gt; VerificationRecord) private _verifications;<br></code>     <p>In this example, we are mapping the verification identifier (a UUID) to the verification record. You may want to customize this mapping to your specification, but UUIDs are relatively collision resistant and tend to be good unique identifiers for things like this.</p> Verification Mappings<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Next, we have the mapping of verifications for a specific subject:</p>   <code>mapping(address =&gt; bytes32[]) private _verificationsForSubject;<br></code>     <p>This mapping requires the subject's wallet address and then maps it to an array of UUIDs.</p><p>Similarly, we track the verifications for verifiers with:</p>   <code>mapping(address =&gt; bytes32[]) private _verificationsForVerifier;<br></code>     <p>And finally, we have a simple count for total verifications:</p>   <code>uint256 private _verificationRecordCount;<br></code>     <p>Of course, the contract is nothing if it's just a bunch of state variables. Let's dive into writing the functions that will define the contract.</p> Contract Functions Part 1: Plumbing<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a>  addVerifier()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The first function we'll define is to add a verifier. Without a verifier, the registry doesn't work. This function should look like this:</p>   <code>function addVerifier(address verifierAddress, VerifierInfo memory verifierInfo) external override onlyOwner {<br>    require(_verifiers[verifierAddress].name == 0, "VerificationRegistry: Verifier Address Exists");<br>    _verifiers[verifierAddress] = verifierInfo;<br>    _signers[verifierInfo.signer] = verifierAddress;<br>    _verifierCount++;<br>    emit VerifierAdded(verifierAddress, verifierInfo);<br>}<br></code>     <p>Many of the functions on this contract can only be called by the owner of the contract (the address that deployed it). This function is no exception. The <code>onlyOwner</code> modifier uses the OpenZeppelin Ownable library to add a check that ensures the function is being called by the contract owner.</p><p>The function takes a verifier's address and the verifier information structured as defined by the <code>VerifierInfo</code> type.</p><p>You'll notice the <code>emit</code> at the end of the function. We don't have any events defined on the <code>VerificationRegistry.sol</code> contract, but the example interface contract does. This is completely optional, but emitting events is a nice way to allow others to listen to those events and take some action.</p> isVerifier()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The next function is a simple one that is available to anyone to call. It takes a wallet address and returns a boolean indicating whether the address is a verifier or not.</p>   <code>function isVerifier(address account) external override view returns (bool) {<br>    return _verifiers[account].name != 0;<br>}<br></code>      getVerifierCount()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The next function is equally simple. It is also callable by anyone, not just the contract owner. It returns the total number of registered verifiers:</p>   <code>function getVerifierCount() external override view returns(uint) {<br>    return _verifierCount;<br>}<br></code>      getVerifier()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>We will also want to get information about specific verifiers—not just their wallet address, but their full <code>VerifierInfo</code> record. To do that, we can create the following function:</p>   <code>function getVerifier(address verifierAddress) external override view returns (VerifierInfo memory) {<br>    require(_verifiers[verifierAddress].name != 0, "VerificationRegistry: Unknown Verifier Address");<br>    return _verifiers[verifierAddress];<br>}<br></code>     <p>This function is another read-only function, and it can be called by anyone. It takes the verifier's wallet address and returns the full verifier info record.</p> updateVerifier()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Verifier info can change, so we need a function to update that information. This function can only be called by the contract owner, but it allows for such updates:</p>   <code>function updateVerifier(address verifierAddress, VerifierInfo memory verifierInfo) external override onlyOwner {<br>    require(_verifiers[verifierAddress].name != 0, "VerificationRegistry: Unknown Verifier Address");<br>    _verifiers[verifierAddress] = verifierInfo;<br>    _signers[verifierInfo.signer] = verifierAddress;<br>    emit VerifierUpdated(verifierAddress, verifierInfo);<br>}<br></code>     <p>This function is a complete replacement, so even if only part of the <code>VerifierInfo</code> record is being updated, a whole new record has to be passed into the function.</p><p>This function also emits an event called <code>VerifierUpdated</code> that anyone can listen for.</p> removeVerifier()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>As you might expect, we also need to be able to remove verifiers. Again, only the contract owner can call this function.</p>   <code>function removeVerifier(address verifierAddress) external override onlyOwner {<br>    require(_verifiers[verifierAddress].name != 0, "VerificationRegistry: Verifier Address Does Not Exist");<br>    delete _signers[_verifiers[verifierAddress].signer];<br>    delete _verifiers[verifierAddress];<br>    _verifierCount--;<br>    emit VerifierRemoved(verifierAddress);<br>}<br></code>     <p>This function takes the wallet address for the verifier and removes that verifier from the <code>_verifiers</code> mapping. It removes the signing address for the verifier and reduces the total <code>_verifierCount</code>.</p> onlyVerifier()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>We now move into some of the actual verification logic with our functions. The first function is a modifier that acts very much like the <code>onlyOwner</code> modifier mentioned before. This one is a modifier that checks if the function is called by a verifier.</p>   <code>modifier onlyVerifier() {<br>    require(<br>        _verifiers[msg.sender].name != 0,<br>        "VerificationRegistry: Caller is not a Verifier"<br>    );<br>    _;<br>}<br></code>      getVerifierCount()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Now, we want to allow people to call the smart contract to get the number of verification records created. We can do that with this function:</p>   <code>function getVerificationCount() external override view returns(uint256) {<br>    return _verificationRecordCount;<br>}<br></code>      isVerified()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Next up, we get to a very important function. This function checks if a particular address has a verification record.</p>   <code>function isVerified(address subject) external override view returns (bool) {<br>    require(subject != address(0), "VerificationRegistry: Invalid address");<br>    bytes32[] memory subjectRecords = _verificationsForSubject[subject];<br>    for (uint i=0; i&lt;subjectRecords.length; i++) {<br>        VerificationRecord memory record = _verifications[subjectRecords[i]];<br>        if (!record.revoked &amp;&amp; record.expirationTime &gt; block.timestamp) {<br>            return true;<br>        }<br>    }<br>    return false;<br>}<br></code>     <p>This is where the Verification Registry contract really shines. The verification is added to the registry, but that only has to happen once. Future checks can simply rely on this function or similar functions customized to your needs.</p> getVerification()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>When a single verification is needed, this next function will support that. It takes the UUID for the verification as an argument and then returns the full verification record:</p>   <code>function getVerification(bytes32 uuid) external override view returns (VerificationRecord memory) {<br>    return _verifications[uuid];<br>}<br></code>     <p>But what about when you need all the verifications for a particular subject? </p> getVerificationsForSubject()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Let's build a function that will return an array of verifications for a particular wallet address.</p>   <code>function getVerificationsForSubject(address subject) external override view returns (VerificationRecord[] memory) {<br>    require(subject != address(0), "VerificationRegistry: Invalid address");<br>    bytes32[] memory subjectRecords = _verificationsForSubject[subject];<br>    VerificationRecord[] memory records = new VerificationRecord[](subjectRecords.length);<br>    for (uint i=0; i&lt;subjectRecords.length; i++) {<br>        VerificationRecord memory record = _verifications[subjectRecords[i]];<br>        records[i] = record;<br>    }<br>    return records;<br>}<br></code>     <p>This function takes the wallet address for the subject, filters on the existing verifications for just that address, and returns the records.</p> getVerificationsForVerifier()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Similarly, we can get an array of verifications from a single verifier with this function:</p>   <code>function getVerificationsForVerifier(address verifier) external override view returns (VerificationRecord[] memory) {<br>    require(verifier != address(0), "VerificationRegistry: Invalid address");<br>    bytes32[] memory verifierRecords = _verificationsForVerifier[verifier];<br>    VerificationRecord[] memory records = new VerificationRecord[](verifierRecords.length);<br>    for (uint i=0; i&lt;verifierRecords.length; i++) {<br>        VerificationRecord memory record = _verifications[verifierRecords[i]];<br>        records[i] = record;<br>    }<br>    return records;<br>}<br></code>     <p>The function takes an argument of <code>verifier</code> and will return all of the verifications for that verifier. </p><p>This function is crucial to keeping verifiers honest and healthy checks and balances on collusion in any system. As this function can be used to detect collusive or dishonest behavior in verifiers, one may need to retroactively purge the verifications of a rogue verifier...</p> revokeVerifications()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>As you would imagine, verifications may be issued in mistake or become invalid for some other reason. So we need a way to revoke those in the registry. We can use a function with the <code>onlyVerifier</code> modifier to do so:</p>   <code>function revokeVerification(bytes32 uuid) external override onlyVerifier {<br>    require(_verifications[uuid].verifier == msg.sender, "VerificationRegistry: Caller is not the original verifier");<br>    _verifications[uuid].revoked = true;<br>    emit VerificationRevoked(uuid);<br>}<br></code>     <p>This function takes the UUID of the record as an argument, checks to make sure the record was created by the address making the call, and then updates the <code>revoked</code> status to true.</p><p>Note: the record in this case has not been removed; rather, it's <code>status</code> property has been updated. This is helpful when performing audits and tracking record history.</p><p>This function also emits an event so those interested in listening for revocations can be notified.</p> removeVerification()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Of course, there are times where a verification will need to be completely removed. For that, we can create a function to remove them:</p>   <code>function removeVerification(bytes32 uuid) external override onlyVerifier {<br>    require(_verifications[uuid].verifier == msg.sender,<br>        "VerificationRegistry: Caller is not the verifier of the referenced record");<br>    delete _verifications[uuid];<br>    emit VerificationRemoved(uuid);<br>}<br></code>     <p>Like the previous function, this one takes the UUID of the record as an argument. It verifies the record was created by the address making the call, and then it removes the record from the registry entirely.</p><p>This function emits a separate event indicating removal of a record.</p> Contract Functions Part 2: Advanced Topics<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a>  registerVerification()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The next function we will cover is a big one. All of these go hand-in-hand, but without this function, nothing else is possible. This is the function to add verifications to the registry. Let's look at the function and then walk through what's going on.</p>   <code>function registerVerification(<br>    VerificationResult memory verificationResult,<br>    bytes memory signature<br>) external override onlyVerifier returns (VerificationRecord memory) {<br>    VerificationRecord memory verificationRecord = _validateVerificationResult(verificationResult, signature);<br>    require(<br>        verificationRecord.verifier == msg.sender,<br>        "VerificationRegistry: Caller is not the verifier of the verification"<br>    );<br>    _persistVerificationRecord(verificationRecord);<br>    emit VerificationResultConfirmed(verificationRecord);<br>    return verificationRecord;<br>}<br></code>     <p>First, let's take a look at the arguments. The function takes a <code>verificationResult</code> argument. This is defined in the <code>VerificationResult</code> type. Second, the function takes a <code>signature</code>. Both of these arguments are hard to conceptualize unless you see them in action, so it is recommended that you take a look at the <a>Verification Registry in Solidity</a> tutorial.</p><p>The tutorial referenced above will walk you through how to create a signed message that can be sent through as an argument.</p><p>As you can see, this function uses the <code>onlyVerifier</code> modifier, which makes sense. A verifier has to be the one to add a verification record.</p><p>The function then takes the verification result and passes it through another function for validation called <code>_validateVerificationResult</code>. This is a pretty massive function and we'll cover it shortly. For now, we can just explain at a high level that the function uses the EIP712 "structured-data signing" standard rather than conventional transaction-signing. It first validates the format (i.e. shape and syntax) of the Verification record, then verifies the signature generated over that whole record by a verifier's signer, and only after both checks does it insert the record into the registry.</p> persistVerificationRecord<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Next, the function persists the record by calling the <code>_persistVerificationRecord</code> function. That's a pretty straightforward function, so we'll document it here. You can add this in your contract anywhere you'd like as it's a helper function more than anything else.</p>   <code>function _persistVerificationRecord(VerificationRecord memory verificationRecord) internal {<br>        // persist the record count and the record itself, and map the record to verifier and subject<br>        _verificationRecordCount++;<br>        _verifications[verificationRecord.uuid] = verificationRecord;<br>        _verificationsForSubject[verificationRecord.subject].push(verificationRecord.uuid);<br>        _verificationsForVerifier[verificationRecord.verifier].push(verificationRecord.uuid);<br>    }<br></code>     <p>As you can see, this function has an <code>internal</code> modifier, meaning it can only be called by another function on the contract. It takes the <code>verificationRecord</code> and it updates the <code>_verificationRecordCount</code>, sets the record to the <code>_verifications</code> mapping, adds the record as associated to the subject, and adds the record as associated to the verifier.</p><p>Finally, our original <code>registerVerification</code> function emits a message indicating that a new verification record was created.</p><p>Note: this function is that it must be called by the verifier. We mentioned this earlier, but you'll see in a second that a subject can also add their own record to the registry.</p> registerVerificationBySubject()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>This next function allows a subject to handle adding their signed verification record to the registry:</p>   <code>function _registerVerificationBySubject(<br>    VerificationResult memory verificationResult,<br>    bytes memory signature<br>) internal returns (VerificationRecord memory) {<br>    require(<br>        verificationResult.subject == msg.sender,<br>        "VerificationRegistry: Caller is not the verified subject"<br>    );<br>    VerificationRecord memory verificationRecord = _validateVerificationResult(verificationResult, signature);<br>    _persistVerificationRecord(verificationRecord);<br>    emit VerificationResultConfirmed(verificationRecord);<br>    return verificationRecord;<br>}<br></code>     <p>This function operates similarly to the previous one, but it expects the caller to be the subject of the verification record. Outside of that, the actions are the same.</p><p>The final note on both of the above two functions is that you may want to implement additional logic based on your specific use cases. Always remember, this contract serves as a guide, but you can extend and modify it however you'd like.</p> removeVerificationBySubject()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Moving on, let's create a function that allows a subject to remove a verification record about themself. We previously created a function that allowed a verifier to remove a record, so this will be similar but from the subject's perspective.</p>   <code>function _removeVerificationBySubject(bytes32 uuid) internal {<br>    require(_verifications[uuid].subject == msg.sender,<br>        "VerificationRegistry: Caller is not the subject of the referenced record");<br>    delete _verifications[uuid];<br>    emit VerificationRemoved(uuid);<br>}<br></code>     <p>The function takes the record's UUID as an argument, it checks if the caller is the record's subject, and then it deletes the record from the registry, emitting the <code>VerificationRemoved</code> event at the end.</p> validateVerificationResult()<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Ok, we covered the <code>_validateVerificationResult</code> function briefly earlier, but we didn't write out the function. Let's do that now. But remember, it's a doozy and it makes use of a lot of the internal workings we imported from the EIP712 library.</p>   <code>function _validateVerificationResult(<br>    VerificationResult memory verificationResult,<br>    bytes memory signature<br>) internal view returns(VerificationRecord memory) {<br><br>    bytes32 digest = _hashTypedDataV4(keccak256(abi.encode(<br>        keccak256("VerificationResult(string schema,address subject,uint256 expiration)"),<br>        keccak256(bytes(verificationResult.schema)),<br>        verificationResult.subject,<br>        verificationResult.expiration<br>    )));<br><br>    // recover the public address corresponding to the signature and regenerated hash<br>    address signerAddress = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);<br><br>    // retrieve a verifier address for the recovered address<br>    address verifierAddress = _signers[signerAddress];<br><br>    // ensure the verifier is registered and its signer is the recovered address<br>    require(<br>        _verifiers[verifierAddress].signer == signerAddress,<br>        "VerificationRegistry: Signed digest cannot be verified"<br>    );<br><br>    // ensure that the result has not expired<br>    require(<br>        verificationResult.expiration &gt; block.timestamp,<br>        "VerificationRegistry: Verification confirmation expired"<br>    );<br><br>    // create a VerificationRecord<br>    VerificationRecord memory verificationRecord = VerificationRecord({<br>        uuid: 0,<br>        verifier: verifierAddress,<br>        subject: verificationResult.subject,<br>        entryTime: block.timestamp,<br>        expirationTime: verificationResult.expiration,<br>        revoked: false<br>    });<br><br>    // generate a UUID for the record<br>    bytes32 uuid = _createVerificationRecordUUID(verificationRecord);<br>    verificationRecord.uuid = uuid;<br><br>    return verificationRecord;<br>}<br></code>     <p>The function has some comments to help you understand what's happening, but at the end of the day, think of this function as simply verifying a signature is actually valid before adding a record to the registry. The function updates the verification record passed to it with four new pieces of information:</p>  Verifier Address  Entry Time  Revoked  UUID  <p>The UUID is created by calling a helper function called <code>_createVerificationRecordUUID</code>. You may implement a different method for identifying records, but if you choose to use UUIDs generated on the contract, this function should help:</p>   <code>function _createVerificationRecordUUID(VerificationRecord memory verificationRecord) private view returns (bytes32) {<br>    return<br>        keccak256(<br>            abi.encodePacked(<br>                verificationRecord.verifier,<br>                verificationRecord.subject,<br>                verificationRecord.entryTime,<br>                verificationRecord.expirationTime,<br>                _verificationRecordCount<br>            )<br>        );<br>}<br></code>     <p>And that's it. That's the last function. Of course, there are many more you can add when building your own contract, but this is more than enough to get you started. In fact, this is based on the demo contract Verite uses.</p> Wrapping Up<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>A verification registry contract is designed to create an easily searchable, easily verifiable central repository for verifications. This makes things reusable and faster.</p><p>This implementation is in Solidity and designed for EVM-compatible blockchains, but a verification registry contract can be implemented on any blockchain.</p>

<p>We carry credentials with us everyday. Our drivers license or state ID, our library card, our insurance card, and more are all just a few examples of some of the credentials we carry. We present these credentials when requested, and the credentials are verified by the person or entity we are presenting them to. But as the world shifts to an increasingly digital native format, and as people take more ownership over their identity, how can the issuance of, presentation of, and verification of credentials be managed?</p><p>The answer is Verifiable Credentials (VCs). VCs are on a web standards track and provide an open data model for digital credentials. We won't go deep into the details of VCs here because the <a>Verite documentation</a> does a great job of that. Instead, we will focus on what Verite is, why it exists, and how it might be used.</p> What Is Verite?<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Verite is a collaborative and open source initiative spearheaded by the <a href="https://www.centre.io/">Centre Consortium</a>. Centre's focus is to "provide the governance and standards for the future digital financial ecosystem." Verite is one output of the collaborative effort of Centre.</p><p>While contributions to the VCs standards themselves is important, and Centre is an active participant alongside the W3C, tools that make it easy to implement and leverage VCs are just as important. As such, Centre began work last year on Verite, an open source library designed to make managing VCs easier.</p><p>Currently available in TypeScript and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/verite">published through NPM</a>, the Verite library seeks to make it easier to implement VCs in a variety of forms. The library is early and an additional goal of the library is to collect community feedback.</p><p>Verite's helper functions simplify VC flows such as requesting credentials, issuing credentials, presenting credentials, and verifying credentials. For the fastest possible start to using Verite, check out the <a>Quick Start guide</a> in the documentation.</p> Why Does Verite Exist?<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Despite the standards track for VCs, tooling around the implementation of VCs has historically been limited. There have been reference implementations, but a simple developer experience has largely been missing. This is what Verite sets out to solve.</p><p>We believe that adoption of VCs is not only about creating good standards. It's also about making the experience of implementation a great one. To this end, Verite has tried to abstract as much of the complexity away as possible. Our documentation dives deep into what's happening behind the scenes, but the Verite library itself feels simple. And that's the goal.</p><p>In a sense, Verite is also the canary in the coal mine. It's a test. An experiment. As mentioned above, the secondary goal of Verite's library is to collect community feedback on its implementation. Since the library's release, we've been fortunate enough to receive a number of issues and pull requests in the <a href="https://github.com/centrehq/verite">Github repository</a>. We encourage the community to continue provide feedback.</p> How Can Verite Be Used?<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/centrehq/verite/tree/main/packages/e2e-demo/pages/demos">number of demos available</a> in the Github repository that can serve both as reference points and as inspiration. Verite can be used for just about any VC need. In our demos, you'll find:</p>  Basic Credential Issuance  Basic Credential Verification  KYC Compliance and Revocation  Ethereum-based dApp With Credential Requirement  Lending Market dApp With KYC Requirement  Centralized App With Travel Rule Requirement  <p>By design, these demos offer both a mobile credential wallet experience or a credential simulation experience. Verite has no plans to dictate the way credentials are stored and presented. The Verite library can be included in existing cryptocurrency wallets, can be used to built a new digitial credentials wallet, can be used to build mobile apps, and more.</p><p>We expect to see some interesting use cases come up in the months ahead because Verite is designed with flexibility in mind. Between community collaboration and that flexibility, implementing and experimenting with VCs will become increasingly easier. We're excited for the future, and we hope you'll help us build that future.</p>

<p>Provide, Synadia, Polygon, Chainlink, BankUnited, DataBrains, and HaasOnline Collaborate on New Open Source Initiative</p> 


<p>28 June 2022 — <a href="https://oasis-open.org">OASIS Open</a>, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the formation of <a href="https://prvd-oasis.org">PRVD</a>, an OASIS Open Project, to advance a leading production-grade reference implementation of the <a href="https://baseline-protocol.org">Baseline Protocol</a>.</p>



<p>Baseline is the standard for synchronizing state across different systems of record over the internet, using a public blockchain as a common frame of reference. The Baseline Protocol preserves privacy of an organization’s sensitive data while allowing counterparties to verify state changes and maintain the synchronization of processes in real-time. As systems are interacted with by users, data is processed in real-time by an instance of the PRVD stack– or another implementation of the Baseline Protocol standard– running at each edge of the network; organizations issue verifiable credentials to counterparties, point-to-point messages are exchanged between instances and each organization’s integrated system is updated. The artifacts produced by this process are called zero-knowledge proofs; these proofs are broadcast to a Layer 3 network where they are included in a “zero-knowledge rollup” proof and eventually settled on a public blockchain.</p>



<p>The PRVD Open Project aims to promote the development and adoption of the application programming interfaces (APIs), data models and binary runtimes for the Baseline Protocol, based on the PRVD stack components being contributed to the project by Provide. Various components of the PRVD stack are referenced in the published draft standard specifications of the Baseline Protocol.</p>



<p>The PRVD architecture is enabled at its core by cloud-native infrastructure at the intersection of advanced cryptography and messaging, emphasizing privacy and security, to synchronize streaming data across otherwise disparate systems. Several other open-source technologies are used by the PRVD stack such as PostgreSQL, Redis and NATS. Synadia, the commercial sponsor of <a href="https://nats.io">NATS</a>, is a founding member of PRVD as a result of the alignment between the projects.</p>



<p>“The PRVD project aligns nicely with the open-source values on display within the NATS ecosystem and we look forward to contributing to the shared vision of a globally-connected and synchronized ecosystem of Tier2 high-speed and low cost chains, Web3 Apps, and DAOs,” said Derek Collison, Founder and CEO of Synadia.</p>



<p>“BankUnited sees real value in the PRVD project,” said Antonio Di Perna, ITSM at BankUnited. “With the PRVD stack, you don’t have to go to the system of record, or even to the client. Sensitive data stays where it belongs, in each participant’s internal system of record, whether it is ServiceNow, SAP, or something else. And in the case of a dispute, our auditors and other parties provided access, do not need to request information after the fact. We can just unpack the proof.”</p>



<p>“Given the current direction of distributed architectures and surging demand for Web3, organizations will seek to contribute and participate in the PRVD open project. DataBrains is committed to unlock the value and power of Web3 within the Salesforce and Snowflake customer communities. PRVD is Web3 for enterprise,” said Len Vitello, CEO of DataBrains.</p>



<p>PRVD will bring together an ecosystem of stakeholders including vendors, service providers, end users and thought-leaders, who use or have interest in contributing to the PRVD stack. Some of the largest names in the Web3 ecosystem have joined as founding members of the PRVD project.</p>



<p>“Supporting open-source projects like PRVD presents a great opportunity to accelerate Chainlink’s mission in helping enterprises become blockchain-enabled,” said William Herkelrath, Managing Director at Chainlink Labs. “With Chainlink, instances of the PRVD stack can greatly benefit from secure access to the real-world resources and trust-minimized services.”</p>



<p>“We immediately recognized the value and opportunity to make onboarding enterprise users easy and seamless. We knew it was a good fit for Polygon to join and contribute to PRVD to advance the Baseline Protocol standard by way of PRVD. Together, we will make the adoption of public blockchain and advanced privacy tools approachable for organizations, and we look forward to deepening the integrations across the Polygon ecosystem,” said Arjun Kalsy, VP Growth at Polygon.</p>



<p>“The PRVD project is an important contribution to zero-knowledge enterprise ecosystems. We know how important it is to support these types of open-source developments. HaasOnline is excited to support PRVD in spreading the adoption of this incredible project and technology,” said Jeff Vernon, Chief Marketing Officer at HaasOnline.</p>



<p>Provide Technologies contributed components of the PRVD stack to the PRVD project so that the work can be governed and maintained by the open source community for the public good. PRVD is the solution to the lack of synchronization between disparate enterprise systems, which has remained an unsolved problem at global scale until now.</p>



<p>“PRVD is the next logical step in the evolution of public blockchain and will enable widespread adoption of zero-knowledge cryptography by enterprise organizations, bringing private transactions to public networks to synchronize systems and make decentralized finance more inclusive. PRVD makes the technology stack we have been building at Provide much bigger and more important than Provide itself,” said Kyle Thomas, Founder and CEO of Provide. “We are excited for the opportunity to execute on our vision to implement the PRVD stack to settle business interactions, under zero-knowledge, on the public Ethereum mainnet, made possible in an openly-governed, open-source initiative within the familiar constructs of OASIS.”</p>



<p>The PRVD Open Project is governed and supported by the OASIS Open nonprofit consortium, home of STIX and TAXII, SAML, UBL, ebXML, and many other globally recognized standards. PRVD operates under the OASIS Open process, which ensures the transparency and operational integrity necessary for fostering adoption and a thriving community of innovators.</p>



<p>The founding sponsors of the PRVD open project include <a href="https://www.bankunited.com">BankUnited</a>, <a href="https://chain.link">Chainlink</a>, <a href="https://databrains.com">DataBrains</a>, and <a href="https://www.haasonline.com">HaasOnline</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://provide.services">Provide</a> and <a href="https://synadia.com">Synadia</a>.</p>



<p>About PRVD</p>



<p>PRVD advances a leading production-grade reference implementation of the Baseline Protocol, an open standard that helps synchronize multiparty workflows across a variety of sectors and permeate decentralized finance throughout global commerce. Organizations and developers can benefit by joining the PRVD community to establish new Web3 business models and build public goods for enterprise.

<p>Introducing new platforms and tools is a challenging process for many organisations, but there are steps you can take to make it smoother. Recently, we’ve been <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/creating-resilient-infrastructures-at-hrfn/">supporting the Human Rights Funders Network (HRFN)</a> on their organisational security tools, policies and practices – part of which has included guidance on how to support staff in adopting new tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From our past work in this area, we have seen that slow and steady wins the race: for new policies, practices, and technologies to become part of workflows, staff need to be able to learn how to use new tools and incorporate them into their daily work practices — and be supported in doing so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are some of the lessons we have gathered over the years. We hope that some of these might be useful to other organisations facing similar challenges.</p>



 1. Managing expectations can lead to greater staff buy-in 



<p>New platforms can be exciting! They hold the promise of potentially transforming workflows — helping to solve problems around efficiency and effectiveness. However, these changes might not occur straight away, and it is important to set reasonable and attainable expectations around the potential of new platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Setting reasonable expectations helps create buy-in, as the promised impact is more likely to be tangible and observable. This in turn encourages&nbsp; staff to continue to use the new tool, as well as further explore its potential. In our work we have noticed that when expectations are outsized, buy-in tends to fall, as the utility of the new tools appears to be less than expected.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Explaining why new tools will be useful supports their adoption 



<p>Similarly, it is easy for those who have been deeply involved in the process of deploying new tools to overlook the importance of sharing the utility and advantages of new tools to the rest of the organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Walking your staff through the benefits of a new platform can make the adoption of new technologies a more participatory process. When people have a clear sense of why it is beneficial to incorporate tools and are included in the implementation process, the process of learning about and adopting new tools can be much smoother.</p>



 3. Staff need time and space to integrate new tools slowly 



<p>The pace at which new tools are introduced is often a key factor in successful adoption of a new platform. Adopting too many new tools at once can feel overwhelming and make it difficult for tool usage to become institutionalised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pacing the rollout of new tools (for instance, by creating a road map that staggers tool implementation and follows realistic, spacious timelines), as well as considering the skill levels needed to engage with new tools (and perhaps focusing on introducing more user-friendly tools first) are strategies that can support successful integration of new tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The skills required for different tools and platforms can also build on each other, working to reduce uptake time as familiarity and comfort levels increase.&nbsp;</p>



 4. Listening to staff feedback &amp; creating opportunities to ‘learn by doing’ can build confidence 



<p>Soliciting feedback on the tool and adapting processes to staff preferences both play a strong role in the successful uptake of new platforms: involving staff in the uptake process can create an important feedback loop between skill levels and training and allow for a more hands-on approach, which can be strengthened if team members are able to interact with the new tool early on in the adoption process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When looking at the difference between successful and unsuccessful introduction of new technologies, we have seen how ‘learning by doing’ (in addition to being shown how to use a new platform) can be a great way for team members to get familiar with a new tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside these, having a designated support person on the team who can support other staff members in navigating new tools can help build confidence in the team, as everyone knows who to turn to for guidance, while also giving staff autonomy to explore a new platform for themselves.</p>

 Information about the candidate OASIS Standard and the OSLC Open Project 



<p>OSLC Architecture Management defines a RESTful web services interface for the management of architectural resources and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks, requirements or test cases. To support these scenarios, the specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>



<p>The specification is part of a broader set of OSLC specifications that are part of the OSLC-OP project. In particular, OSLC-Core (<a href="https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/core/v3.0/oslc-core.html">https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/core/v3.0/oslc-core.html</a>) provides the core services upon which the Architecture Management<br>specification is built.</p>

<p>At the end of our most recent coop day, we reflected that we hadn’t got around to making anything. Again.</p><p>We are usually pretty good at making sure we squeeze some creative time into our coop days but the last few have been much more all work and no&nbsp;play.</p><p>To try and remedy this, as one of our weekly calls drew to a close, Doug suggested we all undertake a bit of a challenge.</p><p>Buy a wao domain and then build something to show off to each other on a weekly call. Bonus points for things that were fun/educational/actually useful!</p><p>We gave ourselves a generous 2 week deadline as we had work and holidays to account for. We also capped the amount of time we thought was reasonable to spend at 5 hours total because even scrolling through the list of available domains would take a&nbsp;while…</p><p>We’d agreed not to give away any details of what we were up to before we reconvened so it was actually quite exciting when the time came for the big&nbsp;reveal.</p> wao.coffee <p>I went first and gave a quick tour of <a href="http://wao.coffee/">wao.coffee</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220624133549/http://wao.coffee/">saved for posterity</a>). Ever wondered what I do when I say I’m off to make a coffee during a break or between calls? Well wonder no more as this site outlines the (yes slightly fiddly) but satisfying process of pulling an espresso shot with a manual&nbsp;machine.</p>wao.coffee<p>Ideas to develop the site&nbsp;further…</p>  expand to show the okay but not really ever great ways of frothing milk without a steam&nbsp;wand?  add a catalogue/tasting notes for all the fabulous coop produced coffee I try&nbsp;out?  repurpose as a site to book a “fancy a coffee?” type call with&nbsp;us?  repurpose as a “buy us a coffee?” tip jar sort of thing (<a href="https://opencollective.com/weareopen">we already have one</a> so could just redirect)?   wao.lol <p>Laura went a different direction and purchased wao.lol for a bit of lighthearted tom foolery. As she couldn’t decide which domain would be the most enjoyable, she made a list of potentials and then used wao.lol to tell us the ideas she had for each of&nbsp;them.</p>wao.lol  wao.exposed — Laura dug up an old picture of all our feet and used Affinity (a photo editing software) to superimpose Anne’s feet&nbsp;in.  wao.fail — Laura ‘shopped in more than just Anne’s foot this time and used the&nbsp;.fail domain to show how quick and dirty photo editing can look absolutely ridiculous  wao.bike — Everyone at the co-op is relatively sporty, so Laura posted a picture of her and Anne’s gravel bikes along with the tagline “This is a truly useless URL, but some of us have pretty&nbsp;bikes”.  wao.blue — Another silly URL! Laura put the two WAO blues up from our Brand&nbsp;Guide.  wao.irish — Our only Irish member received special treatment with a delightful photo of&nbsp;Bryan.  wao.catering — Leaning in to some ongoing inside jokes about British cuisine, Laura found a photo of Scotch Eggs and put it together with the wao.catering URL.  wao.fish — A recent addition to our Learnwith library is a beautiful graphic you can use to run a Sailboat Retrospective (<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/sailboat-retro/">https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/sailboat-retro/</a> ). Doug’s delightful illustration style had us all in stitches with his perfectly triangular “shark”&nbsp;graphic.  wao.gift — Last year Laura (with Anne’s help!) had our first WAO swag made. We all received winter hats with the WAO logo as a holiday&nbsp;gift.  <p>The inside jokes might not be funny to anyone else, but we certainly enjoyed delving into the depths of Laura’s random&nbsp;ideas.</p> wao.land <p>Anne choose one of the same ideas as Laura (totally by accident!) and also remixed the image for our <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/sailboat-retro/">Sailboat Retrospective</a>.</p>wao.land<p>She brought the picture to life and turned it into a gif with a swimming triangle.</p><p>Anne used the opportunity of this little side project to teach herself how to set up a page with Github Pages and how to alter the DNS record to redirect the URL to the&nbsp;page.</p><p>As this was a secret project, Anne had to search for articles and videos to guide her through some of the process rather than asking in our slack channel which may have been her usual first port of&nbsp;call.</p><p>Right now the page is just a gif that links to the Learn with page with the Sailboat retro. In the future wao.land could develop into a pretty landing page of all the places that people can find WAO on the&nbsp;web.</p> wao.wtf <p>After spending way too long and overthinking things, Doug ended up installing <a href="https://nextcloud.com">Nextcloud</a> as an experiment. We’ve often talked at WAO about being pragmatic users of Open Source software and perhaps the time has come for us to switch several services we use (e.g. Trello, Toggl) over to a place that’s fully under our&nbsp;control?</p>wao.wtf<p>We’re still thinking through whether this is a good idea, but in the meantime, we’ve had fun exploring the features and functionality of Nextcloud, as well as rebooting the server when we got a bit too carried&nbsp;away…</p><p>👋 WAO makes sense of complex problems while spreading the benefits of open. We’re a collective of independent thinkers and makers helping charities, ethical companies, government departments and educational institutions with sensemaking and digital transformation.</p><p>Think we might be able to help you? <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wao-something-anything-82cddda539fb">wao.something/anything…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  💡  This guide was written based on Ceramic Version V2.0.0 of the js-ceramic packages.  <p>In this beginner-friendly guide, I'll give you all the tools and knowledge needed to integrate the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> into your Web 3 <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/">dapps</a>.</p>
<p>The Ceramic Network is a decentralized data network that aims to bring composable data to Web 3 dapps.  There are many types of data that Ceramic can work with, but for this guide we can treat Ceramic like a decentralized NOSQL document database.</p>
<p>This guide is meant for you to follow along, so expect diagrams and code examples as you continue reading.</p>
 Your Learning Experience 
<p>Along with this written guide, I have provided a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/tutorial-getting-started-with-ceramic">GitHub Repository</a> repository containing all code I will reference.</p>
<p>If you prefer a video guide, rather than a written guide, you can watch a video walkthrough on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgCLq5dx7sX-yUrrEbtYqVw">Ceramic Youtube Channel</a>.</p>
<p>Before you get started, it is implied that you have the general web development skills outlined below:</p>
<p>Skills used in this guide</p>

 Things We Need To Talk About 
<p>Before getting started, I will cover some key terms that will be used throughout this guide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a></p>
<p>Often referred to as a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a> is a unique identifier that contains metadata about you.  Things like your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public key</a>, some verification information, what<br>
service points you're allowed to access and a couple other things.</p>
<p>Simply put, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>s are used as Ceramic account identifiers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dependency packages used for this are:</p>
 
 <code>dids</code> 
 
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolvers">DID Resolver</a></p>
<p>DID resolvers take a DID as input and return a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID Document</a>.</p>
<p>This resolution process turn a DID from something generic into a document that accurately describes an identity and what methods and capabilities that identity is allow to perform.</p>
<p>Simply put, a resovler hydrates a DID with what actions it is capable of performing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dependency packages used for this are:</p>
 
 <code>key-did-resolver</code> 
 <code>@glazed/did-datastore</code> 
 
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.ethers.io/v4/api-providers.html#providers">Ethereum Providers</a></p>
<p>If you want your application to have access to a blockchain, you need to use a provider.</p>
<p>This guide connects to the Ethereum Blockchain, and therefore uses an Ethereum provider.</p>
<p>Providers are used in place of running blockchain nodes by yourself. Providers have two main tasks:</p>
 
 Tell your application what blockchain to connect to. 
 Once you are connected, run queries and send signed transactions that modify the blockchain's state. 
 
<p>Metamask is one of the most popular blockchain providers and it is the provider will use to connect our application to the Ethereum Blockchain.</p>
<p>Simply put, providers authenticate users to perform actions on the blockchain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dependency packages used for this are:</p>
 
 <code>key-did-provider-ed25519</code> 
 <code>@glazed/did-session</code> 
 <code>@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking</code> 
 
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/glossary/#streamtypes">Data StreamTypes</a></p>
<p>When I speak of data streams, I'm not talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_data">streaming data</a> from a consumption point of view.  Streams are what Ceramic calls its data structures.  Feel free to read more about <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/glossary/#streams">streams</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/glossary/#streamtypes">StreamType</a> is just one of the possible data structures for a stream.  In this guide we will be working indirectly with the <code>TileDocument</code> <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/glossary/#streamtypes">StreamType</a>, which you can think of like a <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON Object</a>.  These StreamTypes are what handles everyting related to the data and they run on <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/glossary/#nodes">Ceramic nodes</a>.</p>
<p>Simply put, StreamTypes define the data structure and how that data's state is allowed to change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dependency packages used for this are:</p>
 
 <code>@glazed/did-datastore</code> 
 
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/data-models/#data-models">Data models</a></p>
<p>Data models are typically used to represent an application feature.  Like Notes, user profiles, blog posts and even a social graph.</p>
<p>Data models are the heart of composable data.  It is common for a single application to use multiple data models, and it is common for a single data model to be used across multiple applications!</p>
<p>Composability done this way also makes the developer experience better. Building an application on Ceramic looks like browsing a marketplace of data models, plugging them into your app, and automatically gaining access to all data on the network that’s stored in these models.</p>
<p>Simply put, Data models are what enable data composability in an application.</p>
 About the Application 
<p>You will be building a simple web application that performs a simple read and write operation to data on the Ceramic Network.  For this application to work properly it will need to complete the following steps in the order they are listed.</p>
 
 Use an Ethereum Provider to authenticate to Ceramic with your blockchain wallet. 
 Once authenticated, resolve a DID to be used with Ceramic. 
 Use a Ceramic instance, with the supplied DID, to read and write to a <code>TileDocument</code> stream. 
 
<p>I mentioned a few of the dependencies above in the <a>Things We Need To Talk About</a> section, but there are a few other dependencies that are worth mentioning before you go any further.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/core-clients/ceramic-http/">Ceramic Client</a></p>
<p>This is the web client that allows your application to connect to <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/glossary/#nodes">Ceramic nodes</a> that are a part of the network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dependency packages used for this are:</p>
 
 <code>@ceramicnetwork/http-client</code> 
 
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a></p>
<p>The JavaScript you will be writing uses Node packages, making it server-side code.  However, web browsers require client-side code.</p>
<p>Webpack is a nice module that will convert the server-side JavaScript that you will be writing into client-side JavaScript that your browser can understand.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we need a few dependencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dependency packages used for this are:</p>
 
 <code>webpack</code> 
 <code>webpack-cli</code> 
 <code>buffer</code> 
 
</blockquote>
 Building the Frontend 
<p>I will walk you through the main steps of building the frontend of this application using simple HTML and CSS</p>
 
 
<p>Let's start by creating a new directory for this project.  This process will vary based on your operating system, so choose the solution that fits your environment best.</p>
<p>Windows</p>
 <code>md getting-started-with-ceramic
</code> 
<p>MacOS/Linux</p>
 <code>mkdir getting-started-with-ceramic
</code> 
 
 
<p>Now, create a file named <code>index.html</code> in the root of that directory.  The <code>index.html</code> file should contain the following content:</p>
 <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico"&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;Getting Started&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- create header with connect button --&gt;
    &lt;header class="SiteHeader"&gt;
        &lt;div class="HeaderContainer"&gt;
            &lt;h1 id="pageTitle"&gt;Getting Start With Ceramic&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="HeaderContainer"&gt;
            &lt;button id="walletBtn"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;div class="MainCont"&gt;
        &lt;div class="DataBlocks"&gt;
            &lt;div class="DataBlock"&gt;
                &lt;div id="basicProfile"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="BodyContainer"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;Basic Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;Read from Ceramic Datamodel&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;br&gt;
                        &lt;p class="ProfileData" id="profileName"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p class="ProfileData" id="profileGender"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p class="ProfileData" id="profileCountry"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="ProfileForm"&gt;
            &lt;div class="BodyContainer"&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Update Basic Profile on Ceramic&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;form id="profileForm"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="formfield"&gt;
                        &lt;label class="formLabel" for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
                        &lt;input class="forminput" type="text" id="name" placeholder="John Doe"&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="formfield"&gt;
                        &lt;label class="formLabel" for="country"&gt;Country:&lt;/label&gt;
                        &lt;input class="forminput" type="text" id="country" placeholder="USA"&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="formfield"&gt;
                        &lt;label class="formLabel" for="gender"&gt;Gender:&lt;/label&gt;
                        &lt;select class="forminput" id="gender"&gt;
                            &lt;option value="female"&gt;Female&lt;/option&gt;
                            &lt;option value="male"&gt;Male&lt;/option&gt;
                            &lt;option value="non-binary"&gt;Non-Binary&lt;/option&gt;
                            &lt;option value="other"&gt;Other&lt;/option&gt;
                        &lt;/select&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="formfield"&gt;
                        &lt;input class="forminput" type="submit" id="submitBtn" value="Submit"&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;!-- &lt;button id="setBasicProf"&gt;Set Profile&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button id="getBasicProf"&gt;Get Profile&lt;/button&gt; --&gt;
    &lt;script src="dist/bundle.js" type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code> 
 
 
<p>Next, create a file named <code>style.css</code> in the root of the <code>getting-started-with-ceramic</code> directory.  This file should contain the following content:</p>
 <code>* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

.SiteHeader {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: orange;
}

.HeaderContainer {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}


.MainCont {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    padding: 10px;
}

.DataBlock {

    margin-bottom: 10px;

}

.BodyContainer {
    background-color: lightsalmon;
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-radius: 30px;
    padding: 20px;
    min-width: 250px;
}

.ProfileForm {
    min-width: 400px;
}



.formfield {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.forminput {
    min-width: 150px;

}

#submitBtn {
    display: block;
    margin: auto;
    width: auto;
}

.ProfileData {
    font-weight: bold;
}
</code> 
 
 
<p>Great!  Now if you open up the <code>index.html</code> file in your browser, or using a utility like <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/">LiveShare</a>, you should see something like this:</p>
<p></p>
 Adding JavaScript and Ceramic 
<p>Right now your application is not capable of doing anything.  There is no logic built into it, it's just a static page with some content and some style.</p>
<p>In this step I will show you how to use providers, resolvers and Ceramic to transform this application from a static site to a web 3 dapp!</p>
 
 
<p>To start, initialize a new <a href="https://www.nodejs.org">NodeJS</a> project using either <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> or <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a>:</p>
<p>NPM</p>
 <code>npm init -y
</code> 
<p>Yarn</p>
 <code>yarn init -y
</code> 
 
 
<p>Next, install the above mentioned dependencies:</p>
<p>NPM</p>
<p>Dev dependencies</p>
 <code>npm install -D buffer dids key-did-provider-ed25519 key-did-resolver webpack webpack-cli
</code> 
<p>Regular dependencies</p>
 <code>npm install @ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking @ceramicnetwork/http-client @glazed/did-datastore @glazed/did-session
</code> 
<p>Yarn</p>
<p>Dev dependencies</p>
 <code>yarn add -D buffer dids key-did-provider-ed25519 key-did-resolver webpack webpack-cli
</code> 
<p>Regular dependencies</p>
 <code>yarn add @ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking @ceramicnetwork/http-client @glazed/did-datastore @glazed/did-session
</code> 
 
 
<p>Now, create a file named <code>main.js</code> in the root of the <code>getting-started-with-ceramic</code> directory.</p>
 
 
<p>Start by importing the regular depndencies into this file:</p>
 <code>//main.js 

import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { EthereumAuthProvider } from '@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking'
import { DIDDataStore } from '@glazed/did-datastore'
import { DIDSession } from '@glazed/did-session'
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>Did you notice that some packages come from <code>@ceramicnetwork</code> and others come from <code>@glazed</code>?</p>
<p>Packages that come from @ceramicnetwork are part of the core Ceramic protocol.  They help connect applications to Ceramic nodes.</p>
<p>Packges that come from @glazed are not part of the core Ceramic protocol, they are referred to as <code>middleware</code> and provide developers with some added functionality and convenience.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Following the dependency imports you should setup a series of DOM Element selectors.  This not only makes our code easier to read as it is written, but in larger applications this technique can add performance benefits.  Add the following to <code>main.js</code></p>
 <code>import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { EthereumAuthProvider } from '@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking'
import { DIDDataStore } from '@glazed/did-datastore'
import { DIDSession } from '@glazed/did-session'

const profileForm = document.getElementById('profileForm')
const walletBtn = document.getElementById('walletBtn')
const profileName = document.getElementById('profileName')
const profileGender = document.getElementById('profileGender')
const profileCountry = document.getElementById('profileCountry')
const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submitBtn')
</code> 
 
 
<p>Using the <code>CeramiClient</code> that was just imported, create a new Ceramic Client instance by adding the following code to the <code>main.js</code> file:</p>
 <code>//main.js

import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { EthereumAuthProvider } from '@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking'
import { DIDDataStore } from '@glazed/did-datastore'
import { DIDSession } from '@glazed/did-session'

const profileForm = document.getElementById('profileForm')
const walletBtn = document.getElementById('walletBtn')
const profileName = document.getElementById('profileName')
const profileGender = document.getElementById('profileGender')
const profileCountry = document.getElementById('profileCountry')
const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submitBtn')

const ceramic = new CeramicClient("https://ceramic-clay.3boxlabs.com")
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>There are currently 4 possible networks to connect the Ceramic HTTP client to.  You can click each link to learn more about the networks.</p>
 
 <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/networks/#mainnet">Mainnet</a> 
 <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/networks/#clay-testnet">Clay Testnet</a> (recommended and currently being used by our application) 
 <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/networks/#dev-unstable">Dev Unstable</a> 
 <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/networks/#local">Local</a> 
 
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Next, create a variable named <code>aliases</code> that will hold the reference information for the <code>BasicProfile</code> data model:</p>
 <code>//main.js

import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { EthereumAuthProvider } from '@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking'
import { DIDDataStore } from '@glazed/did-datastore'
import { DIDSession } from '@glazed/did-session'

const profileForm = document.getElementById('profileForm')
const walletBtn = document.getElementById('walletBtn')
const profileName = document.getElementById('profileName')
const profileGender = document.getElementById('profileGender')
const profileCountry = document.getElementById('profileCountry')
const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submitBtn')

const ceramic = new CeramicClient("https://ceramic-clay.3boxlabs.com")

const aliases = {
    schemas: {
        basicProfile: 'ceramic://k3y52l7qbv1frxt706gqfzmq6cbqdkptzk8uudaryhlkf6ly9vx21hqu4r6k1jqio',

    },
    definitions: {
        BasicProfile: 'kjzl6cwe1jw145cjbeko9kil8g9bxszjhyde21ob8epxuxkaon1izyqsu8wgcic',
    },
    tiles: {},
}
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>Parts of a datamodel</p>
<p><code>schemas</code>: Define the JSON schema for the data model.</p>
<p><code>definitions</code>: Link a user-friendly model name and description to a specific schema.</p>
<p><code>tiles</code>: Individual data records based on parameters set within the schema.</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>The <code>DIDDataStore</code> allows the applicaiton to write and read data from Ceramic.  The <code>DIDDataStore</code> is based on Data models.  Add the following code to <code>main.js</code> to configure the <code>DIDDataStore</code> to use the <code>aliases</code> and <code>ceramic instance</code> defined above:</p>
 <code>//main.js

import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
import { EthereumAuthProvider } from '@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking'
import { DIDDataStore } from '@glazed/did-datastore'
import { DIDSession } from '@glazed/did-session'

const profileForm = document.getElementById('profileForm')
const walletBtn = document.getElementById('walletBtn')
const profileName = document.getElementById('profileName')
const profileGender = document.getElementById('profileGender')
const profileCountry = document.getElementById('profileCountry')
const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submitBtn')

const ceramic = new CeramicClient("https://ceramic-clay.3boxlabs.com")

const aliases = {
    schemas: {
        basicProfile: 'ceramic://k3y52l7qbv1frxt706gqfzmq6cbqdkptzk8uudaryhlkf6ly9vx21hqu4r6k1jqio',

    },
    definitions: {
        BasicProfile: 'kjzl6cwe1jw145cjbeko9kil8g9bxszjhyde21ob8epxuxkaon1izyqsu8wgcic',
    },
    tiles: {},
}

const datastore = new DIDDataStore({ ceramic, model: aliases })
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>If your dapp required it, you could add more Data models to the <code>aliases</code> variable by adding the <code>schema</code>, <code>definition</code> and <code>tiles</code> necessary!</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Great job!  You now have the basic foundation needed to get this application up and running.  All the configuration for the Ceramic Client and the Data models is complete.</p>
 Authenticating With the Blockchain 
<p>This next section will guide you through using an Ethereum Provider, <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>, to authenticate a user with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>The authentication flow being used is called <a href="https://login.xyz/">Sign-In With Ethereum</a>, but I will refer to it as SIWE from here on out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Check out this awesome article to learn more: <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/">Why Sign-In With Ethereum Is A Game Changer</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's add SIWE to this application!</p>
 
 
<p>This application needs an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async function</a>, I will name it <code>authenticateWithEthereum</code>, that uses the Provider then uses the Resovler and finally assigns the DID to the Ceramic Client you created earlier.  Add this code to <code>main.js</code> to accomplish these tasks:</p>
 <code>//main.js

async function authenticateWithEthereum(ethereumProvider) {

    const accounts = await ethereumProvider.request({
    method: 'eth_requestAccounts',
    })

    const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(ethereumProvider, accounts[0])

    const session = new DIDSession({ authProvider })

    const did = await session.authorize()

    ceramic.did = did
}
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>DIDSession</code> is what it handling the SIWE authentication flow for you in this code snippet.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>There are usually some logic checks that our application needs to do before the authentication flow can be started.  When developing dapps a common check is to make sure that a provider is available.  In this case, <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> adds itself as the provider in our browsers <code>window</code> object.  It is referencable by <code>window.ethereum</code>.  If the end-user of the application has not installed <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>, or another provider, then our application will not be able to connect to the blockchain.  Let's take this knowledge and apply it to a new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async function</a> called <code>auth</code>.  Add the code below to <code>main.js</code>:</p>
 <code>//main.js

async function authenticateWithEthereum(ethereumProvider) {

    const accounts = await ethereumProvider.request({
    method: 'eth_requestAccounts',
    })

    const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(ethereumProvider, accounts[0])

    const session = new DIDSession({ authProvider })

    const did = await session.authorize()

    ceramic.did = did
}

// newly added auth function here:
async function auth() {
if (window.ethereum == null) {
    throw new Error('No injected Ethereum provider found')
}
await authenticateWithEthereum(window.ethereum)
}
</code> 
<p><code>auth()</code> first checks to see if <code>window.ethereum</code> exists before trying to call <code>authenticateWithEthereum()</code>.  This prevents the application from hanging if the user does not have an injected provider!</p>
 
 
<p>If you'd like to check your work, the complete <code>main.js</code> file should currently look like this:</p>
 <code>    //main.js

    // import all dependencies:
    import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
    import { EthereumAuthProvider } from '@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking'
    import { DIDDataStore } from '@glazed/did-datastore'
    import { DIDSession } from '@glazed/did-session'
    
    //cache a reference to the DOM Elements
    const profileForm = document.getElementById('profileForm')
    const walletBtn = document.getElementById('walletBtn')
    const profileName = document.getElementById('profileName')
    const profileGender = document.getElementById('profileGender')
    const profileCountry = document.getElementById('profileCountry')
    const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submitBtn')

    // create a new CeramicClient instance:
    const ceramic = new CeramicClient("https://ceramic-clay.3boxlabs.com")

    // reference the data models this application will use:
    const aliases = {
        schemas: {
            basicProfile: 'ceramic://k3y52l7qbv1frxt706gqfzmq6cbqdkptzk8uudaryhlkf6ly9vx21hqu4r6k1jqio',

        },
        definitions: {
            BasicProfile: 'kjzl6cwe1jw145cjbeko9kil8g9bxszjhyde21ob8epxuxkaon1izyqsu8wgcic',
        },
        tiles: {},
    }

    // configure the datastore to use the ceramic instance and data models referenced above:
    const datastore = new DIDDataStore({ ceramic, model: aliases })

    // this function authenticates the user using SIWE
    async function authenticateWithEthereum(ethereumProvider) {

        const accounts = await ethereumProvider.request({
        method: 'eth_requestAccounts',
        })

        const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(ethereumProvider, accounts[0])

        const session = new DIDSession({ authProvider })

        const did = await session.authorize()

        ceramic.did = did
    }
    
    // check for a provider, then authenticate if the user has one injected:
    async function auth() {
        if (window.ethereum == null) {
        throw new Error('No injected Ethereum provider found')
        }
        await authenticateWithEthereum(window.ethereum)
    }    
</code> 
 
 Reading Data Using Ceramic 
<p>The next function you write will use the <code>DIDDatastore</code> to retrieve data from the Ceramic network.  I will call it <code>getProfileFromCeramic</code> and it will be an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async function</a> like the ones before it.</p>
<p>This function will be declared in the <code>main.js</code> file.</p>
 
 
<p>Add the <code>getProfileFromCeramic</code> function to <code>main.js</code>:</p>
 <code>//main.js

async function getProfileFromCeramic() {
try {
    
    //use the DIDDatastore to get profile data from Ceramic
    const profile = await datastore.get('BasicProfile')
    
    //render profile data to the DOM (not written yet)
    renderProfileData(profile)
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    }
}
</code> 
<p>As you can see, by calling <code>datastore.get()</code> method, you can simply reference the <code>definition</code> of the data model you wish to read data from.</p>
<p>The DIDDatastore uses the DID assinged to the Ceramic client to make this call.  It returns the profile object white get's stored in the <code>profile</code> variable.</p>
 
 
<p>You will need to create the <code>renderProfileData</code> function to extract this profile data and show it in the browser window.  Since this is NOT a guide on web development I will not go into detail about what this function is doing.  Add the following to your <code>main.js</code> file:</p>
 <code>function renderProfileData(data) {
    if (!data) return
    data.name ? profileName.innerHTML = "Name:     " + data.name : profileName.innerHTML = "Name:     "
    data.gender ? profileGender.innerHTML = "Gender:     " + data.gender : profileGender.innerHTML = "Gender:     "
    data.country ? profileCountry.innerHTML = "Country:     " + data.country : profileCountry.innerHTML = "Country:     "
}
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to point out that <code>data</code> is the <code>profile</code> object that is returned from the <code>datastore.get()</code> call.  The properties of data are defined in the <code>BasicProfile</code> data model.  Check out the data model in the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels">Ceramic datamodels repo</a> for a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/models/identity-profile-basic">full list of properties</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>That's it!  That's all there is to reading data from the Ceramic Network using the <code>DIDDataStore</code>!</p>
<p>A complete version of what <code>main.js</code> should look like at this point can be found below:</p>
 <code>    //main.js

    // import all dependencies:
    import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'

    import { DIDSession } from '@glazed/did-session'
    
    //cache a reference to the DOM Elements
    const profileForm = document.getElementById('profileForm')

        data.country ? profileCountry.innerHTML = "Country:     " + data.country : profileCountry.innerHTML = "Country:     "
    }
</code> 
 Writing Data Using Ceramic 
<p>The next piece to implement is writing data to the Ceramic Network using the <code>DIDDatastore</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Like some of the other functions that have been written, the <code>updateProfileOnCeramic</code> function should by an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async function</a>.  Add the following to <code>main.js</code>:</p>
 <code>async function updateProfileOnCeramic() {
    try {
    const updatedProfile = getFormProfile()
    submitBtn.value = "Updating..."

    //use the DIDDatastore to merge profile data to Ceramic
    await datastore.merge('BasicProfile', updatedProfile)

    //use the DIDDatastore to get profile data from Ceramic
    const profile = await datastore.get('BasicProfile')

    renderProfileData(profile)

    submitBtn.value = "Submit"
    } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    }
}
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>There are two important things to talk about before moving on.</p>
<p>First: The <code>DIDDatastore</code> has two methods that allow writes to a data model:</p>
 
 <code>merge()</code>, which only writes to fields that have changed 
 <code>set()</code>, which overwrites ALL fields including those that have not changed.  This can lead to data be removed in an unwanted way.  It is recommended to use merge rather than set for that reason. 
 
<p>Second: Reading data from the DIDDatastore simply to render it to the DOM using <code>renderProfileData()</code> in this scenario is sub-optimal.  There is no real need to read the data from Ceramic at this stage.  This was included to show you how simple reading and writing can be, as each take one line when using the DIDDatastore.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>You probably noticed a call to <code>getFormProfile()</code> in the above code block.  That function does not currently exist.  Let's add it to <code>main.js</code> now.  Place the following code in <code>main.js</code>:</p>
 <code>function getFormProfile() {

    const name = document.getElementById('name').value
    const country = document.getElementById('country').value
    const gender = document.getElementById('gender').value

    return {
        name,
        country,
        gender
    }
}
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>If you are wondering how I came up with the object properties of <code>name</code>, <code>country</code> and <code>gender</code>, they are all found on the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/tree/main/models/identity-profile-basic">BasicProfile</a> datamodel.  There are additional properties for a BasicProfile which are not referenced in this project.  You should explore the use of these properties in you own projects!</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Wow!  You made it!  This is all you need to get started with Ceramic.  You now know enough to run out and create amazing dapps.</p>
<p>You're not quite done yet though.  There are some minor things that have to be built to get this application fully working.</p>
 Making The Buttons Work 
<p>This section as well as the next, <a>Configuring Webpack</a>, are not necessarliy Ceramic related.  These sections cover some necessary taks that must take place to tie in the buttons for the applicaiton and to conver the server-side to into something the browser can understand.</p>
<p>How buttons work</p>
<p>The button elements for this application are going to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">Event Listeners</a> to execute functions when they are clicked.</p>
<p>All of the following code will need to be placed in <code>main.js</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Let's start by creating a function that the event listener can call when a user clicks the "connect wallet" button.</p>
 <code>async function connectWallet(authFunction, callback) {
    try {
    walletBtn.innerHTML = "Connecting..."
    await authFunction()
    await callback()
    walletBtn.innerHTML = "Wallet Connected"

    } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    }

}
</code> 
 
 
<p>Currently the button element doesn't display any <code>innerHTML</code> so let's fix that before moving on.  Under the DOM caching that took place earlier in <code>main.js</code>, add the following line:</p>
 <code>walletBtn.innerHTML = "Connect Wallet"
</code> 
 
 
<p>Another thing that is missing are the text placeholders where the profile data should be rendered.  You can set that placeholder text by adding this code under the <code>walletBtn.innerHTML</code> line.</p>
 <code>walletBtn.innerHTML = "Connect Wallet"
profileName.innerHTML = "Name: "
profileGender.innerHTML = "Gender: "
profileCountry.innerHTML = "Country: "
</code> 
 
 
<p>The last thing is adding two event listeners.  One will go on the "connect wallet" button and it will call the <code>connectWallet</code> function defined above.  The other will go on the button that is a part of the <code>profileForm</code> element.  Add these to lines to <code>main.js</code>:</p>
 <code>walletBtn.addEventListener('click', async () =&gt; await connectWallet(auth, getProfileFromCeramic))

profileForm.addEventListener('submit', async (e) =&gt; {
e.preventDefault()
await updateProfileOnCeramic()

})
</code> 
 
 
<p>Alright!  That's all the JavaScript that the application needs!  Double check your work by referencing the full <code>main.js</code> file below:</p>
 <code>    //main.js

    // import all dependencies:
    import { CeramicClient } from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
    import { EthereumAuthProvider } from '@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking'
    import { DIDDataStore } from '@glazed/did-datastore'
    import { DIDSession } from '@glazed/did-session'
    
    //cache a reference to the DOM Elements
    const profileForm = document.getElementById('profileForm')
    const walletBtn = document.getElementById('walletBtn')
    const profileName = document.getElementById('profileName')
    const profileGender = document.getElementById('profileGender')
    const profileCountry = document.getElementById('profileCountry')
    const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submitBtn')

    // give the wallet button an initial value to display
    walletBtn.innerHTML = "Connect Wallet"
    // setup placeholder text where profile should render
    walletBtn.innerHTML = "Connect Wallet"
    profileName.innerHTML = "Name: "
    profileGender.innerHTML = "Gender: "
    profileCountry.innerHTML = "Country: "

</code> 
 Configuring Webpack 
<p>The following section will configure <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> for this application.</p>
 
 
<p>In the root of the <code>getting-started-with-ceramic</code> directory create a new file called <code>webpack.config.js</code> and place the following contents inside of it:</p>
 <code>const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
    entry: './main.js',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
        filename: 'bundle.js'
    },
    mode: 'development',
    resolve: {
        fallback: { buffer: require.resolve('buffer') }
    }
}
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure to check out <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> if you'd like to know what this code is doing.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>Next, you'll need to edit the <code>package.json</code> file that currently exists in the root directory.  You will only modify the <code>scripts</code> block of this file.  Make the following change to <code>package.json</code>:</p>
 <code>"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1",
    "build": "webpack"
}
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>Just to be clear, the change being made here is the addition of a script, named build, that calls webpack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complete <code>package.json</code> can be found below:</p>
 <code>{
    "name": "getting-started-ceramic",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "utils.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1",
        "build": "webpack"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "devDependencies": {
        "buffer": "^6.0.3",
        "dids": "^3.1.0",
        "key-did-provider-ed25519": "^2.0.0",
        "key-did-resolver": "^2.0.4",
        "webpack": "^5.72.1",
        "webpack-cli": "^4.9.2"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "@ceramicnetwork/blockchain-utils-linking": "^2.0.4",
        "@ceramicnetwork/http-client": "^2.0.4",
        "@glazed/did-datastore": "^0.3.1",
        "@glazed/did-session": "^0.0.1"
    }
}
</code> 
<blockquote>
<p>There may be small version differences in this file depending on when you completed this guide.  This is normal and should not be anything to worry about.</p>
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>The final step is to run this newly added script from the terminal or command line.  Running this script is what will package all the previous JavaScript into a version that your browser can interpret.  Regardless of operating system, the command will be the same:</p>
<p>NPM</p>
 <code>npm run build
</code> 
<p>Yarn</p>
 <code>yarn run build
</code> 
 
 
 Congratulations! 
<p>Congrats!  You can now re-open the <code>index.html</code> file in your browser or by using <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/">LiveShare</a>.</p>
<p>Using your <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> wallet you will be able to <a href="https://login.xyz/">Sign-In With Ethereum</a>, retrieve your <code>BasicProfile</code> from Ceramic and make changes to a limited set of properties for that profile!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have never configured a <code>BasicProfile</code> on the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> you will initially receive no data.  You'll need to create a profile using the wallet account of your choice using the <a href="https://clay.self.id">Self.id</a> app or by using the form included with this application!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure to come join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> for further help and to chat with the development team!</p>
<p>Good luck and happy building!</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, June 24, 2022  –To continue to meet the ever-increasing needs of Edge member institutions and ensure members have the connectivity and network infrastructure they need to leverage a variety of cloud providers, Edge introduced Cloud Connect – a powerful addition to its EdgeNet.</p>
<p>In addition to connectivity to Amazon Web Services (AWS), including dedicated access for AWS Direct Connect, Edge has partnered with Equinix to connect its members directly with a full complement of cloud providers via dedicated layer 2 connections in “Data Center Alley” in Ashburn, Virginia.</p>
<p>Explained Bruce Tyrrell, Associate Vice President Programs &amp; Services, Edge, “EdgeNet already provides layer 3 peering connections to leading cloud providers including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, as well as major esports platforms and other content providers. This peering capability moves the majority of traffic away from the commodity Internet, providing high speed, low latency connections to critical applications and infrastructure.” Further elaborated Tyrrell, “Cloud Connect takes peering connectivity to the next level by providing layer 2 connectivity directly to major cloud platforms.”</p>
<p>With Cloud Connect, EdgeNet enables the next level of cloud networking performance and security, including:</p>
 
 Members who have available existing circuit capacity or Dark Fiber connectivity via EdgeNet pay no additional last-mile costs to access Cloud Connect to Ashburn, VA. 
 Dedicated connection access to an expanding list of major cloud service providers, including Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud, Cisco Webex Voice, and more. 
 Enhanced connectivity and performance for critical Microsoft applications living in the Azure cloud. 
 Improved cloud application performance and cost via dedicated access. 
 Multiple, redundant connections via Cloud Connect, for enhanced reliability and performance. 
 Strategic multi-cloud connectivity, providing the infrastructure you need to create cost-effective, forward looking cloud migration plans. 
 A shared services model for multi-cloud connectivity, providing connected members with consortium rates. 
 
<p>Members who have available existing circuit capacity or Dark Fiber connectivity via EdgeNet pay no additional last-mile costs to access Cloud Connect to Ashburn, VA. For members seeking to expand their connectivity with Cloud Connect, please contact <a href="mailto:info@njedge.net">info@njedge.net</a>.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The mission of Digital Scotland is to help build a world leading Scottish digital nation, and of course technology skills and careers are central to that ambition. 
<p>As the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/20078582.scottish-government-unveils-45m-plan-build-tech-nation/">Herald reports</a>&nbsp;Kate Forbes has announced £45m in funding to “transform Scotland into one of Europe’s leading economies to start or grow a technology business.”</p>
<p>However there are significant challenges standing in the way.</p>
<p>Key startup sectors like FinTech are facing a&nbsp;<a href="https://scottishfinancialreview.com/2022/04/06/hot-scots-fintech-sector-facing-talent-shortage/">skills crunch challenge</a>, experiencing a talent shortage that could inhibit the growth of this booming industry and therefore limit the extent to which this overall goal can be achieved.</p>
<p>As far back as 2018 <a href="http://www.skillsdevelopmentscotland.co.uk/news-events/2018/november/shortage-of-digital-skills-a-danger-to-the-scottish-economy/">Digital Skills Scotland reported</a> that Scotland faces a skills shortage challenge that would hamper our ambitions to build a world leading digital economy, and Scotland’s Auditor General <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/auditor-general-calls-scottish-government-25997252">lambasted the government</a> for a lack of leadership with regards to workforce skills planning. Skills Development Scotland and the Scottish Funding Council have not been able to agree how integrated approaches to skills planning should work. Together, they spend over £2bn each year on training and post-school education.</p>
<p>Particularly concerning is Scotland’s general education performance, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-50642855">their PISA results</a> pointing to declining performance in key subjects like Maths and Science.&nbsp;Especially poignant is the <a href="https://twitter.com/DTECharter/status/1403397452196159488">collapse of Computer Science</a> adoption, the skill that is absolutely central to our ambitions to build a world leading digital nation.</p>
 A Vision for Transformation 
<p>There are of course many different technologies that have great potential for Scottish learning. The Cloud makes powerful new teaching tools more easily available, Virtual Reality provides an immersive experience, and so on, but these are at the level of individual teaching. To define the wholesale transformation of education we first need to craft a vision of what a future state transformed system might look like – Entirely new ideas, new models for how Education is delivered.</p>
<p>We can look to other countries for inspiration.</p>
<p>As described in a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/estonia-the-baltic-tiger/">previous blog</a> Estonia offers an exemplar of a small nation who has mastered technology to greatly advance their country. Education is one headline example of this, where they&nbsp;have leveraged technology to achieve <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-50590581">astounding levels of success</a> on the same rankings, the first in Europe. Indeed they describe it as a platform for enabling an ‘<a href="https://e-estonia.com/education-nation/">Education Nation</a>‘.</p>
<p>The Times analyzes what it takes to build <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/times-education-commission-how-estonia-does-it-lessons-from-europe-s-best-school-system-qm7xt7n9s">Europe’s best school system</a>.</p>
<p>“Despite relatively low spending on education <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/want-the-best-schools-in-europe-try-estonia-zv87fvn7h">Estonia is among the top countries</a> in the world in all three areas on which 15-year-olds are assessed: reading, mathematics and science. Its schools are also the best at promoting fairness and Estonian pupils are among the happiest in the OECD.”</p>
<p>Of course technology alone can’t transform a policy system, especially one that has been concretely set in it’s ways for decades if not hundreds of years.&nbsp;James McEnaney notes this in <a href="https://twitter.com/MrMcEnaney/status/1486707551680937985">his tweet</a>, highlighting that as well as technology mastery Estonia also have an entirely different different approach to Education. It’s both this different culture and technology Scotland needs to adopt.</p>
<p>Writing for TES James also sets the scene for the types of changes needed, describing <a href="https://www.tes.com/magazine/archived/4-ways-transform-scottish-education">4 Ways to Transform Scottish Education</a>, most notably a reformation of the exam system:</p>
<p>“Our current approach, the one that grinds students through a needless annual exam cycle and ties so much of their future to performance in just a few hours of a single day, has failed far too many people for far too long. The richest pupils are more likely to leave school with five Highers than the poorest are to leave with one. Those from the most deprived backgrounds are also more likely to fail their courses than achieve an A grade.”</p>
<p>This of course is the backbone of the education system, how grades are assessed and rewarded, and it is here therefore where the biggest levers for change are possible</p>
 Resistance to Change 
<p>This leads us to the central challenge – Policy systems that are set in their ways and highly resistant to change.</p>
<p>For example in&nbsp;<a href="https://myskills.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/My-Skills-Project-Generic-Model-Final.pdf">this white paper</a>&nbsp;the authors document the&nbsp;<a href="https://myskills.org.uk/">MySkills</a> project, a collaboration between the City of Glasgow College, The Scottish Qualifications Authority and APPII, to define a model for digital certification to be used and adapted by other awarding bodies throughout the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>This explores how academic certifications may be digitized, applying them to the Scottish Education and Employment market, demonstrating walk-throughs and process models for how it would work in practice and defining how the pilot project can be scaled to a nationwide roll-out.</p>
<p>Most notably it highlights the core challenge that really stands in the way of modernizing Scottish Education:</p>
<p>“Government policy can be driver. In Scotland, where this project is based, the adoption of digital certificates for vocational education qualifications is a good fit with the Scottish government ambitions for digital services and a digital economy.”</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>“Adopting digital certificates is not a very technically demanding challenge, it’s more an issue of cultural change. The challenge in going digital with certificates of learning is symptomatic of the wider challenge of adopting technology generally in education. We are dealing with a complex social, legal and economic system that is resistant to change – despite all the hype (and worse) about the ability of technology to transform education.”</p>
 EdTech – Embedding Innovation in Policy Design 
<p>Therefore exploring new ways to overcome inertia and resistance, and to encourage wholesale policy transformation are key to Scotland’s goals of creating a world class Education program, and building on that to populate the jobs market with highly skilled candidates.</p>
<p>One example of a highly effective policy is to stimulate and accelerate related startup sectors, ie in this case ‘EdTech’.</p>
<p>A keystone foundation for rejuvenating Scotland’s Education sector is the role of commercial startups. Another function of E-Estonia’s holistic digital nation approach is that it also results in high-growth tech businesses: A country 1/5 the size of Scotland has <a href="https://twitter.com/EstoniaInvest/status/1486601738551443456">produced nine ‘unicorns’</a>, startups valued at more than a $ billion.</p>
<p>Embedding startups at the heart of a policy framework embeds raw innovation there, the most important ingredient needed – An ambition and ability to envision new ways of doing things and a hunger to disrupt an established order. Exactly what Scotland needs, a shake up of the establishment.</p>
<p>An extremely powerful dynamic for Scotland to harness is to utilize local startups to advance these broader national goals. This would encourage a compounding benefit as the improvement of Scottish Education would simultaneously drive the commercial success of Scottish businesses, critically providing them with case study success stories that would support their international expansion, further boosting the economy.</p>

   Digital Identity conversations, concerns and discussion closely resemble those back home. On the one hand it’s comforting that no jurisdiction is immune or somehow different.

<p>I type this month’s newsletter from the UK where summer has finally arrived – just as winter has in Aotearoa! While this is primarily a personal visit, digital identity activity follows me unabated, so you may see me mentioned in connection with a couple of UK events.</p>



<p>Digital Identity conversations, concerns and discussion closely resemble those back home. On the one hand it’s comforting that no jurisdiction is immune or somehow different. Yet on the other hand it’s rather daunting to be reminded that there is no solution or quick fix that can be copy and pasted into Aotearoa. It’s all the same issues with fraud, awareness and education, equitable and inclusive access for all and gaps in the standards/conformance layer in the end-to-end user journey.</p>



<p>It is on this last point that I do see a slight gap between the UK and Aotearoa. In the UK and in Europe more generally there seems to be more awareness of, and a sense of urgency around, the vulnerability of mobile smartphones, given the expectation that they will be the device of choice for most people to download digital identity related wallet apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It may well be driven by the European Commission’s eIDAS2 which is envisioned to be delivered in a mobile device-like wallet, the imminent arrival of Apple iOS16 and wallet capable, and a range of European governments thinking about how their existing and planned smartphone-based digital identity apps will interoperate in this rapidly changing and uncertain future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In broad terms, the tech and the standards exist. The issue coming to light in Europe is in the fine-grained detail to create a trustworthy and predictable customer journey. Are the standards assessed and certified consistently to deliver trust? Is there convergence on a standard way to recover data in the event of theft or loss of the device? How is data on a device managed when several people are sharing it? And how do we as a global community of private and public sector stakeholders tackle the digital divide for the elderly, the disadvantaged, the digital naysayers? Aotearoa has made great progress but there is still such a long way to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On that note, we invite public and private stakeholders to come together and join the conversation on building a thriving and resilient trust economy for the benefit of all Kiwis. The&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;is a must-attend event for all those vested in the future of New Zealand’s digital ecosystem. I look forward to seeing many of you there next month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As many of you may know, starting April 1, 2022, CCI became an independent Linux Foundation (LF) project operated separately from Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH). We joined LFPH in December 2020 to fight against COVID together and became a Joint Development Foundation (JDF)-chartered project (JDF is a part of LF) in June 2021 in order to have the proper legal structure to conduct rapid standardization of COVID credentials. Now that the COVID situation is eased, it is time for CCI to explore our next steps as an independent entity by building on our conversations and work in the past two&nbsp;years.</p><p>As we kicked off this new journey, many things will remain uncertain for a while. However, one thing is certain — we are committed to keeping CCI as an open and global community that welcomes diverse perspectives and constructive feedback. To that end, today we are releasing the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eSrFxFldD6TBkfmOFTXBkBu2TYf3qFv2/view?usp=sharing">Digital Health Credential System Implementation Guide V1</a> for public review and consumption and launching our community <a href="https://discord.gg/UnwTqDv7Bd">Discord</a> to provide a forum for ongoing discussions and development of the&nbsp;Guide.</p><p>In 2021, CCI and our community members contributed significantly to the writing of the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/blueprint">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint</a>, which proposed a set of interoperability requirements and standards to verify travelers’ COVID-19 status in a way that ensures the protection of core principles, such as privacy, security, user-control, and equity. Inspired by the Blueprint, Erran Carmel, a business professor at the American University, reached out to Kaliya Young, CCI’s Ecosystems Director and the co-chair of the Good Health Pass Interoperability Working Group, and created the preliminary version of this Implementation Guide by summarizing the requirements in the Blueprint. At the invitation of Lucy Yang, CCI’s Community Director, Erran took this work into the CCI, and co-led it to fruition with Sankarshan Mukhopadhyay, a long-time CCI community leader, with the contributions and support of the broader CCI community.</p><p>The Implementation Guide V1 provides a set of baseline recommendations to the CCI community of application and services developers, implementers with which to evaluate product designs. We believe that with more participation from our community we can refine this guide to reflect the state of the art — enabling a documentation of the best practices. We encourage users of this Guide to apply a critical lens and reach out to us with any issues and improvements we need to address for further versions.</p><p>As a follow-on activity to the release of the Guide, our <a href="https://covidcreds.groups.io/g/global-implementation-forum/viewevent?eventid=1557811&amp;calstart=2022-06-28">Global Implementation Forum June event</a> will host a presentation by two experts from gematik GmbH, the leading German healthcare organization, to share their “Insights from a Prototypical Implementation of Vaccinate Certificate” and relate their approach to the requirements in the&nbsp;Guide.</p><p>We invite you to join this <a href="https://covidcreds.groups.io/g/global-implementation-forum/viewevent?eventid=1557811&amp;calstart=2022-06-28">upcoming event</a> and our <a href="https://discord.gg/UnwTqDv7Bd">Discord</a> to engage further on the Implementation Guide and discuss the future of&nbsp;CCI!</p>

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Dr. Yunxi Zhang, Tech Architecture Delivery Associate Manager at Accenture. </p>



<p>回到我们的开发者展示系列，让我们了解现实世界中的开发者如何使用超级账本技术。 这次为我们分享的是 来自埃森哲的技术架构师助理经理：张赟熹博士 (Dr. Yunxi Zhang)。</p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on and how you got into blockchain</p>



<p>I’ve been working on a number of blockchain projects across various blockchain platforms for diverse business cases since I joined Accenture. I am fascinated by the core blockchain technology, which was invented as a main technical product of bitcoin. I&nbsp;look&nbsp;forward to helping our clients better understand how blockchain could potentially shift their businesses to be more productive. My main motivation for working with blockchain is to help clients leverage this technology to achieve their&nbsp; goals.</p>



<p>问：您好，张博士！您可以介绍一下您的工作背景以及您是如何加入区块链领域的：</p>



<p>自加入埃森哲后，我已经参与了很多个和区块链相关的项目。基于每个项目有其独特的业务，我们会选用不同的区块链平台。 区块链作为比特币的一个主要的技术产品，我深深被其吸引。同时，我也期待使用区块链来帮助我们的客户更好地理解如何可以使用这项技术帮助转型他们现有的业务，使其更富有成效。达成这些愿景成为了我在区块链这个领域工作的主要动力。</p>



<p>What Hyperledger frameworks or tools are you using in your projects? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries is currently the main framework I’m working on in my project. I’ve used Hyperledger Fabric in earlier projects as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve successfully built up a demo by using Hyperledger Aries to demonstrate how Self-Sovereign Identity credentials could help simplify an entire process from credentials issuance, presentation and verification to make a business process more efficient and productive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, I’ve found the documentation of Hyperledger Aries to be always evolving to include the up-to-date key design principles as well as both technical and business benefits. For Aries, there are even online courses available that introduce the big picture first. If people would like to know more low-level details, there is abundant documentation available in the repo. It’s common for the documentation to be a bit behind the technology. To deal with this challenge, the open community is very responsive to new joiners, listening to us patiently and reacting to any questions and issues raised. This helped me delve into Aries in a short period of time. Once&nbsp; I have a very good understanding of how the technology works, I’m glad I can contribute back to Aries in different aspects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>问：您在项目中使用了哪些超级账本的框架或工具？ 有什么新进展可以跟大家分享吗？ 您能总结一下您使用超级账本技术的经验吗？</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries是我目前项目中主要使用的框架。除此之外， 我之前的项目中也曾使用过Fabric。 通过使用Aries，我们成功地搭建了一个演示用以验证如何通过使用用户自主身份凭证来简化凭证生成，凭证提交以及凭证验证，使得整个业务流程更富有成效。 总体来说，我发现Aries的文档始终保持持续更新的状态，及时发布最新的技术信息，关键设计原则以及业务效益。Aries甚至提供了网上课程，介绍了Aries的整体情况。同时，Aries的代码库中提供海量的细节信息。文档的滞后性是常态，为了解决这个问题，Aries的开放社区对于新加入成员提出的问题给予及时的回复，耐心聆听我们的意见。这使得我在很短的时间内理解Aries。当我对Aries有足够的理解后，我很高兴可以以各种方式回馈于Aries。</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>Hyperledger Foundation should focus on providing updates&nbsp;on how the more mature Hyperledger technologies are being leveraged in different production environments. Any technical architecture design examples could be shared in each repo to help boost the technical architects and developers to try them, so we can reuse these designs, help improve them and contribute back to them. This could facilitate the pace of the adoption for each Hyperledger technology even more.</p>



<p>问：您认为超级账本基金会今年重点应该聚焦在哪方面？</p>



<p>Hyperledger Foundation应该更关注于更新每个Hyperledger技术的成熟程度，它们如何应用于生产环境中。任何的的架构设计的案例可以共享于代码库中，这样，技术架构师和开发人员可以直接尝试并进行改进，并回馈于每个技术。这样也许可以更有效地加速Hyperledger技术的应用。</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hyperledger technologies are built upon the basic concept of how blockchain works, but they each implement it in its own ways to provision enough flexibility for different use cases. The nature of blockchain is very complex as it is comprised of different areas of technologies such as cryptography and distributed systems. It would always be beneficial to developers to grasp this foundational knowledge prior to starting to use Hyperledger technologies.</p>



<p>问：您会给其他有兴趣开始使用区块链的技术人员或开发人员提供什么建议？</p>



<p>Hyperledger的技术是构建在区块链的基础概念之上，但是它们各自有自己的实现方式，这样使得他们能更灵活地应用于不同的用户场景中。区块链是复杂的，因为它包含了很多不同的技术，比如加密学，分布式系统等等。对于程序员来说，理解和掌握这些底层的知识对于使用Hyperledger的技术是非常有益的。</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s projects continue to mature, what do you see as the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result?</p>



<p>I see use cases related to decentralized Identity and self-sovereign identity being some of the most interesting and popular business areas in the future. Hyperledger Aries and Hyperledger Indy are already contributing to making this happen more easily.</p>



<p>问：随着超级账本项目的不断成熟，您认为由此产生的最有趣的技术、应用程序或用例是什么？</p>



<p>我发现目前一些比较流行的商业领域，他们的用例已经关注了去中心化身份以及用户自主身份，并且会在今后变得越来越流行。Hyperledger Aries和Indy在这些领域里起到了关键的作用，使得应用变得越来越简便。</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>Due to blockchain’s innate intricacy, the application of it is not always straight forward. Even developers or architects with many years of experience find it a challenge to design and use blockchain within the underlying infrastructure and system architecture around them. So, to have a PaaS service of blockchain (not only including the underlying blockchain network, but common architecture on top of it) to quickly enable technicians to use them quickly could further boost its application in all aspects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>问：您希望区块链能解决的一个问题或者一件事情是什么？</p>



<p>由于区块链其先天的复杂性，对于即使有多年经验的程序员和工程师来说，搭建底层的基础设施和系统架构也不是那么容易的。所以，建设一个以平台为服务的区块链服务（不仅限于底层的区块链网络，包括上层的通用架构）使得技术人员迅速使用它们，也许会加速区块链在各个方面的应用。</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>Having achieved a much lower learning curve for technicians.</p>



<p>问：您希望看到超级账本和/或者区块链在五年后将呈现出什么发展情况？&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>进一步降低技术人员的学习和使用门槛。</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>Get your hands dirty with the technology. The more you play with it, the better you will be at using it.</p>



<p>问：您收到的最好的开发人员建议是什么？</p>



<p>动手使用技术，你玩得越多，你就会越擅长使用它。</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>



<p>Internet</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 16 June 2022 — With the rise in popularity of electric vehicles, the e-mobility experience has become a fragmented one, with EV charging between different charge points often being unpredictable and impractical for the end-user, as well as difficult to quantify for energy companies. This is due to the number of service providers and electricity companies operating across different regions, each with their own different, siloed platforms.</p><p>But what if power providers, mobility companies, and end-users could be united under a common platform to build a frictionless, unified charging experience?</p><p>In pursuit of this goal, Energy Web has partnered with <a href="https://www.eliagroup.eu/">Elia Group</a>, 50Hertz, and <a href="https://bloxmove.com/">bloXmove</a> to bring to market a new solution called&nbsp;ReBeam.</p><p>ReBeam integrates all the different parties typically involved in an EV charging session, including transmission system operators (TSOs), distribution system operators (DSOs), charge point operators (CPOs), and more under a common platform known as the <a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Elia-ReBeam_web.pdf">Open Charging Network (OCN)</a>. This enables data sharing, messaging, transactions, and verification between different parties, while securely handling the digital identities of each market actor. Bringing all of these functions under one roof enables pairing of any electricity used at any charge point with electricity supplied to the grid by any supplier, allowing CPOs to deliver any power company’s electricity to vehicles without an intermediary.</p><p>One outcome of cross-market interconnectivity is that end-users will be able to choose the electricity supplier of their choice at any participating public charging station, simplifying the EV charging process and maximizing choice for EV owners. All of this works without users having to sign multiple contracts or rely on different third-party service providers.</p><p>ReBeam leverages self-sovereign identities to secure interactions, which enables participants to prove their identities, validate claims, and sign messages between one another directly.</p><p>The protocol was designed with benefits for both users and companies in&nbsp;mind:</p>  Through the Open Charge Network, EV users are able to take their energy provider ‘on the go’, benefitting from preferential transactions no matter which charging point they&nbsp;use  By giving them the tools to trust and verify each other, ReBeam is able to directly connect EV owners to CPOs without requiring a third-party service provider, reducing unnecessary costs and difficulty  Electricity suppliers and grid operators are given transparency on charging demand, allowing them greater visibility for balancing their supply, rather than relying only on standard load&nbsp;profiles  <p>“EV ownership is growing rapidly, backed by national regulations and the Net Zero transition. In turn, we need to ensure that the technologies which support low-carbon e-mobility solutions are as efficient and convenient as possible”, said Kai Schmied, Innovation Manager at Elia Group. “Made possible by cutting-edge capabilities from Energy Web and bloXmove, ReBeam, once fully developed, will facilitate an EV charging process that streamlines interactions and reduces friction between EVs, and suppliers, giving EV users more choice than ever at the charging&nbsp;point.”</p><p>In a demonstration of ReBeam completed this month in collaboration with <a href="https://www.lichtblick.de/">Lichtblick</a>, Germany’s largest independent green energy provider, and <a href="https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/en/research/digital-business/the-lama-project-charging-points-at-the-workplace.html">LamA</a>, the German charging network led by Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, Energy Web and Elia Group successfully executed an energy supplier switch at a public charge point in Berlin, Germany. Lichtblick issued verified credentials to their customers, which then presented the corresponding credential to the participating CPO, in this case LamA. LamA then verified the validity of the credential, unlocking the charging point, with Elia Group leveraging their Virtual Balancing Area (VBA) in the background ensuring that all energy is billed to the chosen electricity supplier and respective customer.</p><p>While so far ReBeam has been demonstrated with Lichtblick and LamA, the technology can work with any participating providers. Elia Group and Energy Web share the goal to establish an operating area which extends grid-wide and across different countries.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. Our Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) enables any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors the EW-DOS tech stack.

<p>Two of the most influential global membership organisations in the digital ID space have aligned to forge a faster and more secure route to a shared and trusted digital future.</p>



<p>Both<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html"> The Open Identity Exchange (OIX)</a> and<a href="https://trustoverip.org/"> Trust over IP Foundation</a> (ToIP) have driven key development and made significant progress in their respective communities towards addressing the challenges around establishing ‘trust’ in users via digital means.</p>



<p>They have now committed to aligning their efforts, having realised the synergies in the work they were doing and the vast potential of working more closely together to drive their common agenda across the globe.</p>



<p>With a combined worldwide membership of over 400 organisations and individuals, including some of the world’s largest stakeholders in a digital ID future, this is a crucial development in the journey towards full digital ID adoption and a digital future that will work for everyone involved.</p>



<p>Born from the self-sovereign identity movement, ToIP’s widely recognised<a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/"> ToIP Stack</a> is defining a complete architecture for internet-scale digital trust that combines the technical requirements for cryptographic trust at the machine layer with the governance requirements for human trust at the business, legal, and social layers.</p>



<p>Equally, the OIX’s comprehensive work around the governance of digital ID has been highly influential and widely accepted. It complements the governance elements of the ToIP stack. A prime example is OIX’s recently launched<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/a-guide-to-trust-frameworks-for-smart-digital-id"> Guide to Trust Frameworks for Smart Digital ID</a> that encompasses over 10 years of research and in-depth evaluation of existing Trust Frameworks around the world.</p>



<p>The Guide outlines how a both a simple digital ID (i.e., digitised credentials within a wallet) and a smart digital ID (i.e., one that understands rules to “to selectively disclose, derivate a specific attribute and aggregate several single attributes” per the EU’s new<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/core/api/front/document/73759/download"> eIDAS2 ARF</a>) can meet the needs of all the parties involved in a digital relationship or transaction. With a specific focus on placing the needs of the end users at the forefront (also a key driver for ToIP), the Guide defines the roles, responsibilities, principles, policies, procedures and standards needed.While remaining technology agnostic, a particular feature of the Guide is its alignment with the self-sovereign paradigm of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials stored in individual digital wallets. The Guide includes a <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/a-guide-to-trust-frameworks-for-smart-digital-id?page=self-sovereign-models">mapping of OIX Trust Framework roles</a> to SSI Roles as illustrated in the infographics below.</p>







<p>While this first infographic illustrates the relatively straightforward mapping of the SSI issuer/holder/verifier “trust triangle”, the Guide also shows how to map more complex SSI scenarios such as the one below, in which a holder submits proofs of one set of credentials to a rules engine to obtain a new derived level-of-assurance credential.</p>







<p>John Jordan, Executive Director of ToIP, said: “The lack of globally interoperable digital trust infrastructure has presented an urgent and widely acknowledged need for both technical standards and governance that ensure trust can be established quickly and safely across all sectors and borders. Our two organisations have a common vision – building trust online, and simplifying and standardising how trust is established. Our collective knowledge, expertise and research will be a powerful force ensuring the benefits of digital ID are realised by everyone involved – the end consumers, governments, relying parties and ID providers.”</p>



<p>Nick Mothershaw, Chief Identity Strategist at OIX, said: “Various initiatives around the world are trying to address the same issue with differing approaches. It is a highly complex global challenge that needs a united global response, and one that ensures the needs of all parties are met. To achieve it, governance must be generic and technology agnostic, and smart digital ID will need to play a significant role. The goals and strategies of both organisations highly complement each other. We have both already made significant progress, which has been reflected in the growth of our memberships, and the Self-sovereign alignment of the new OIX trust framework. By further aligning our efforts, we can have a greater impact.”</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>A headline theme of our Digital Nation campaign&nbsp;is the inspiring story of E-Estonia, and how Scotland may emulate their success. 
 Lesley Riddoch and filmmaker Charlie Stuart traveled to Estonia in late February 2020 to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqLJA7sXD-c">a film about this story</a>, about one of the most recent small north European states to become independent. 
<p>Tiny Estonia (pop similar to Wales) sees itself as a forgotten Nordic nation, sharing its language, forest and bog-covered topography and Baltic location with Finland.</p>
<p>And it’s widely regarded as Europe’s Digital Tiger economy, performing an incredible transformation from terrible poverty in the wake of reestablishing independence just 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, Estonia became the latest small European nation to declare independence. Faced with terrible winters, they struggled to even find petrol for ambulances and the supermarket shelves were empty. But today, Estonia is one of the most successful small countries in the EU. How did they do it?</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence all their lives, and they actually planned a lot of this transformation ahead since they had a firm belief that they would become independent.</p>
<p>A wave of young people took over dismantling everything. So they said those people who have been working for the Soviet Union and have been supporting this kind of things have to leave now. They need to clean the entire state.</p>
<p>And by cleaning the state, it means everything. The first years were tough for this new Baltic nation. They literally had nothing on the shelves of grocery stores in Tallinn or elsewhere in Estonia. They were in a very difficult situation. But Estonia embraced the new digital world, and in just 20 years, its GDP has increased fivefold. It’s nothing short of extraordinary. This transition happened within a generation. The Estonians have adopted their independence day as the 24th of February. It’s a holiday, everyone gathers together on this day.</p>
<p>Estonia first proclaimed independence in 1918 after two centuries of Russian rule, but soon the country was occupied, first by the Soviets, then the Nazis, then the Soviets again, who ruled for almost 50 years. In March 1949, 20000 people were deported, most to Siberia by the KGB. Two thirds were women and children under the age of 16.</p>
<p>In 1986, there was a seismic shift at the Kremlin. President Gorbachev introduced Glasnost to modernize and refresh the communist bloc. But in the Baltic states, the newfound political freedom gave the chance for dreams of nationhood to be rekindled. The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence, all their lives through whole time in Soviet Union and then especially, intensely, during those three years they had the singing revolution, they were prepared.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of repression, huge singing events continued, the choirs were a symbol of Estonia’s unique culture. As freedom can’t be achieved by only movements, they not only were singing and shouting and streets, but they were undertaking hard legislative work too. In August 1989, the movements of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania combined to form a 400 mile chain of two million people demonstrating their unity for freedom. This was to catch media’s attention to pressurize Gorbachev. After all this, Estonia got its independence.</p>
<p>Estonia set up its own currency pegged to the Deutschmark, but the country had traded almost exclusively with Russia and so the economy collapsed. It was a government in crisis from the start. In 1993, in the midst of a Baltic winter with daytime temperatures below minus 10, the state coffers are empty, businesses face bankruptcy, pensions might not be paid.</p>
<p>There was a struggle to find petrol for ambulances and the shops were empty. Mart Laar became the first formally elected prime minister at the age of just 32. The unemployment rate was 40-50%. No countries were buying anything from Estonia as their production was really bad. The changes were really very, very harsh because they didn’t have money. People were patient, expecting that the country will grow up, will improve. And after this harsh time, there will be better times. The Estonians people had hope that Estonia will again flourish someday.</p>
<p>Very soon help and investment came from Nordic neighbors. There was were even food and clothing parcels from abroad. Very quickly, Estonia began to grow as Europe’s newest democracy. It was a society shaped by a new generation without baggage from the communist era, with new ideas and a blank canvas.</p>
 E-Estonia 
<p>Estonia’s main claim to fame today is the Digital Economy. Estonian education has fueled 20 years of digital innovation, 90 percent of schools deliver subjects using digital technology by choice, not compulsion, and 70 percent of kindergartens have access to robotics. Scottish education was once the envy of the world. Now a different small country is turning educational heads.</p>
<p>The education system has spawned a nation of digital entrepreneurs and innovators. Three Estonian engineers have built Skype with almost 700 million worldwide users.</p>
<p>In Estonia, everyone must have a digital ID. This is a compulsary document for absolutely every person who lives in Estonia. The citizens of Estonia use this smart electronical id card as their driving license also. They also get discounts from various shops by using this id card. This card is also essential for medical care because they need this card at hospitals and health care centre for their medical prescriptions.</p>
<p>This card is also used by the citizens for tax payment system. With the aid of this card it takes only one minute in order to declare citizens’ taxes. The citizens of Estonia have a great faith on their state law authority as they provide their all information of themselves to one institution. Only one percent of entire state budget is used in order to keep up the system. The citizens’ get back two percent of their GDP by using this one single solution.</p>
<p>It took three years after independence for the last Russian military to leave. Now, Estonia has an army of its own and an international peacekeeping role. It has 3000 full time soldiers with 20000 in reserve and the support of its Nato Family since it joined in 2004. Joining the NATO has cultural, economic, social and mostly political consequences on Estonia.</p>
<p>In Estonia 2/3 of the population live in the traditional country. They tried to keep alive their cultural heritage even when they were part of the Soviet Union. The country celebrates its traditions and identity big time.</p>
<p>The country has been criticized for a flat tax regime that leaves the well off paying the same as the lowest earners, just 20 percent. And corporations can skip tax altogether if they reinvest. One man well-placed to make international comparisons is the Estonian TV journalist Johannes Tralla, he is a former EU correspondent.</p>
<p>According to him oligarchy does not exist in the Estonia every taxi driver here is an entrepreneur and the low tax system is really beneficial for the citizens. In Estonia there is no dramatic class gap in society. The taxation framework in Estonia is really appreciable in the whole Europe.</p>
 Inspiration for Scotland 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPJ7IVFNEhI">Another video</a> shares a short case study of E-Estonia from Freethink, interviewing Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of Estonia from 2006 – 2016, telling the compelling story of the global success of Estonia as a digital nation leader, boasting the most advanced digital government in the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ilves recalls how Estonia faced massive economic challenges upon achieving the restoration of independence in 1991, a time that soon saw the emergence of the Internet.</p>
<p>Toomas realized the opportunity was that Estonia was no further behind than any other country in this field, and so began pioneering their adoption, with all schools being online by 1998 and the framework for E-Estonia in place by the early 2000’s.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and Estonia now enjoys an entirely digital society – Via a single digital identity everything except weddings and real estate can be transacted online, including voting.</p>
<p>Not only is it a convenience but it’s also the foundation for a prosperous and healthy society. Being entirely digital has meant Estonia has continued uninterrupted during Covid-19, and their ‘E-Residency’ program has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninaangelovska/2019/04/25/estonias-e-residency-contributed-e14m-to-its-economy-e-residency-2-0-will-be-a-true-forerunner/#5cef94179da5">contributed €14m to its economy</a>.</p>
<p>A keynote theme is that size and money isn’t the essential ingredient for success.</p>
<p>Toomas now lives in the heart of Silicon Valley in the USA, and despite their vast wealth and being surrounded by the behemoth tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook, American digital government is surprisingly poor. Processes are still paper-based, requiring photocopies be taken to government offices, whereas Estonians can file&nbsp;taxes in only six clicks in two or three minutes.</p>
<p>Scotland, a similarly sized small nation and with an unparalleled history of invention, absolutely could emulate Estonia and achieve and enjoy an equally advanced digital nation.</p>
<p>As SNP leaders like <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/18554995.scots-must-seize-future-build-strong-digital-nation/">Martin Docherty</a>, <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18515370.agenda-follow-estonias-lead-digital-revolution/">Doug Chapman</a> and <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/17353185.angus-robertson-we-should-introduce-a-scottish-digital-citizenship/">Angus Robertson</a> have written for The National, Scotland’s opportunity is to emulate the Baltic nation one fifth the size of Scotland but that has achieved the staggering accomplishment of becoming the world’s leading digital nation, following their own independence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18515370.agenda-follow-estonias-lead-digital-revolution/">Writing for The Herald</a> the SNP’s Spokesperson for SME and Innovation Douglas Chapman issues a rallying cry for Scotland to emulate the similarly sized digital nation exemplar, highlighting how their entirely online society has meant they could adapt easily to the challenges of Covid-19.</p>
<blockquote>
 “Estonia dared to dream and took that leap of faith; Scotland should be next.”

 Part 2: Why we need to transition <p>Read <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">Part 1: The Two Loops Model for Open Recognition advocacy</a></p><p>Whatever your beliefs and values may be, it is impossible to argue that we live in a just and equitable society. To heal ourselves and our world, we need lifelong learners who are curious about the world and actively try to make it&nbsp;better.</p><blockquote>“Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.” — John&nbsp;Dewey</blockquote><p>We need communities of people who are engaged with the idea that the way things are is not how they have always been nor how they always need to be. We need alternative systems that take diversity and sustainability into&nbsp;account.</p><p>It is important that we work together to address the key problems we’re facing as a&nbsp;society.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>There’s good news. Creating change within our system is possible! Inspiring change with alternatives is tried and true, the entire tech industry is built on the idea. To become a society that recognises learning in a way that includes everyone, we need to deal with 3 realities:</p> 1. Power dynamics and hierarchies <p>The old system puts the power of recognition in the hands of…the already powerful. Recognition from top-rated universities and employers is great, but it tends to exclude already marginalised people. Knowledge, skills, and understanding don’t have to be credentialed by ‘recognised bodies’ to be valuable. There is value to a learner in any case, and it propagates existing power dynamics if there are pre-established hierarchies between issuers (e.g. university vs corporate vs community).</p><p>In short, there are ways of recognising others that do not depend on competition or artificial scarcity. Doing so empowers and motivates learners, and recognising one another can help us define our (or our organisations’) values.</p> 2. The difference between credentialing and recognition cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Recently, we wrote about the difference between credentialing and recognition in the post <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">Open Recognition is for every type of learning: From cold hard credentialing to warm fuzzy recognition</a>.</p><blockquote>It’s our hope that individuals, groups, families, communities, organisations, and institutions come to realise that there is more to life than credentialing. Yes, we need credentials. But we can paint a much richer picture of ourselves and our communities by embracing recognition of all different forms of learning. As <a href="https://www.learningfutures.eu/2020/03/competency-badges-the-tail-wagging-the-dog/">Serge Ravet</a> has said, we need to be recognising practices as much as recognising competencies.</blockquote> 3. The spirit of innovation inherent in&nbsp;badges cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for City &amp;&nbsp;Guilds<blockquote>“Badges can represent our community values as social objects to be crafted, discussed, and gifted as artifacts of gratitude. Each aspect of this process can help celebrate what our community is all about, while at the same time offering public recognition to individuals.”</blockquote><p>It’s been <a href="https://decafbad.com/2010/07/badger-article/">12 years since Les Orchard wrote</a> about how a keynote slide at the 2010 Mozilla Summit inspired him to think about recognition for the Mozilla community. It’s been over a decade since the first Open Badges white paper hit the internet. We live in a world in which digital credentialing is ubiquitous. It’s part of corporate skills programmes. It’s baked into the way we interact online. We are still working towards finding ways to ensure that the “recognition” piece of this system doesn’t get overrun by the “credential” piece.</p><p>Open recognition is the original innovation of badges, and it’s the reason technology was pushed towards making decentralised recognition possible. The intention of the community to make learning accessible to marginalised groups also comes into this innovation.</p> The alternative system <p>In <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">Part 1: The Two Loops Model for Open Recognition advocacy</a>, we talked about how as one system begins to deteriorate, an alternative begins to emerge. We know the alternative system, one that integrates credentials with other forms of recognition, is better for everyone. Without that integration, cold-hard credentialing supports outdated power dynamics. A tool is only a tool, it’s the way we use it that makes a difference.</p>Outbreak of Hope by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>Interested in all this?

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The objective of our <a href="http://digitalnation.scot">Digital Nation Action Plan</a> is to identify the individual entrepreneurs visions for how to achieve a world leading Scottish digital nation, and aggregate these into one overall action plan. 
<p>On <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L5Nf6ipWAAID1hdwOVoc5">The Crypto Standard podcast</a> they interview Nick Jones of <a href="https://www.zumo.money/">Zumo</a>, exploring the details of their exciting venture pioneering a cryptocurrency payments app.</p>
<p>Concluding the interview Jordan highlights how Wyoming is becoming a crypto and blockchain global hub, and asks if Scotland could replicate a similar success.</p>
<p>Nick believes this is entirely doable, given how Scotland is a small, relatively cash rich country with highly educated people, and with many pressing social inequality issues to address could act as an incredible ‘sandbox’ for cultivating innovative applications of the technology that leverage Scotland’s <a href="https://www.zumo.money/blog/how-scotland-liberated-smart-money">deep legacy of financial expertise</a>.</p>
<p>To crystallize a strategy to unify Scotland’s many different initiatives and assets around a single vision of making Scotland the Blockchain Capital of Europe, Nick quantifies the end result through stating key metrics such as having 10 of the top 50 startups, three relevant university courses and a £500m venture fund for supporting the ecosystem.</p>
 “Weak on Blockchain” 
<p>The nature of the challenge is very succinctly captured by Andrew Noble of Par Equity in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/6-investors-and-founders-forecast-hockey-stick-growth-for-edinburghs-startup-scene/">this TechCrunch artlcle</a>. While reporting on the general success of Scotland’s startup scene in his analysis he comments that Scotland is “weak on Blockchain”.</p>
<p>He’s not wrong. Scotland has a handful of great Blockchain startups like Zumo, Siccar and Appii, but to Nick’s point we’re well short of how many there should be, there’s no real funding initiatives to address this and adoption in key ‘big lever’ sectors like Government is non existent.&nbsp;Therefore the essence of our Action Plan should be to address exactly this.</p>
<p>A keystone foundation is regulation and legislation, the right approach could either inhibit innovation or unlock an unparalleled scale of economic growth. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/proposed-legislation-in-germany-could-allow-425b-to-flow-into-crypto-report">Coindesk reports</a>&nbsp;a new German law could theoretically bring as much as €350 billion (~$425 billion) of institutional investment into their cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://billatnapier.medium.com/we-need-a-blockchain-act-for-every-country-7ae10f36b3c4">this blog</a> Bill Buchanan describes how countries should legislate a Blockchain Act, emulating pioneers like <a href="https://www.regierung.li/en/press-releases/212310">Liechtenstein</a>, providing the legal framework to truly achieve a wholly digital nation.</p>
 Scaling Scotland’s Blockchain Ecosystem 
<p>Nick offers an ideal starting point for a Digital Nation Action Plan – A big audacious ambition and clear metrics for quantifying when it is achieved.</p>
<p>By incorporating the equivalent views from other Scottish tech entrepreneurs we can refine a detailed strategy and set of steps for truly realizing the goal of building a world leading Scottish digital nation.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>Guest article from Don and Alex Tapscott 
<p>While the UK and the world grapple with the implications of Brexit, a technological revolution is quietly unfolding that offers a glimmer of hope to Scotland, regarding if it votes to stay in the UK or not.</p>
<p>We’re not talking about the social web, cloud computing, or artificial intelligence. We’re talking about the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin.</p>
<p>This technology represents nothing less than the second era of the Internet and it holds far-reaching opportunities for Europe.</p>
<p>If wielded correctly, it could provide the foundation for a more prosperous Europe. It is also the Scotland’s best hope at fulfilling the “Leavers” lofty promises of a more global and dynamic Britain.</p>
<p>The blockchain is a global distributed ledger or a vast database running on millions of devices, a third of them in Europe, where anyone can move, store, and manage anything of value—money, deeds, patents, clinical trials, academic degrees, and even votes—with unprecedented security, privacy, and inclusion. Trust derives not from powerful intermediaries like banks or governments, but from clever code and mass collaboration. For 40 years, Scotland has had the Internet of information. Now, it has the Internet of value within reach to transform the socioeconomic power grid for the better.</p>
<p>Specifically, there are three big opportunities for the Scotland. The first is to rewire the European economy for innovation. The blockchain will not simply disrupt every industry – it will dramatically lower the barriers to business creation. Anyone can build value in the global economy. The second is to reconfigure government for greater transparency and accountability. The European Union should do far more at less cost, and hand more autonomy to its members. The third is to design the preconditions for everyone to succeed. Rather than re-distributing wealth, we could pre-distribute wealth, democratizing the means by which citizens generate wealth in the first place.</p>
<p>Let’s fix the firm by replacing centralized models with open networked enterprises that leverage peer-to-peer payment mechanisms and reputation systems, global blockchain IPOs and digital smart contracts. The democratization of value creation (through entrepreneurship) and value participation (through distributed ownership) could kick-start growth across Europe.</p>
<p>London has already been bold. The Bank of England, the city’s biggest banks, and many entrepreneurs have shown global leadership on blockchain. Now, more than ever, they must innovate to ensure London’s preeminence as a global financial hub. Business leaders on the continent should also take note at the city’s success to date. But leadership is also anyone’s opportunity.</p>
<p>Let’s reinvent government for a new era of legitimacy. First, elected officials must rekindle the public’s trust in political institutions. With blockchain, voters could know with 100% certainty who contributed to a campaign or supported it. Second, everyone has a right to participate in government. With the blockchain, citizens could advocate for sealing government action in a public, unalterable and searchable record, using that data as a platform for greater engagement.</p>
<p>Third, everyone must have equal protection under the law, including refugees fleeing violence and persecution. Finally, a blockchain system could cost-effectively engage all residents and provide equal access to public services and social security. These four principles are already enshrined in the United Nation universal declaration of human rights. Blockchain provides the tools to make these aspirations reality. The survival of Scotland is at stake.</p>
<p>What better time to fix a broken monetary system than in the midst of currency crisis? Already the Bank of Canada, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England have begun experimentation with digital currencies. The benefits are numerous: killing cash would reduce crime and improve regulation, because digital money is more traceable and harder to forge than printed versions. Further, central bankers could manage monetary policy and monitor risk in the financial system. Imagine international commerce with less fraud, friction, and leakage. It’s time to stop the tinkering and start the transformation.</p>
<p>It’s time for Digital Sterling and Euro-COIN.</p>
<p>All Europeans ought to have an equal shot at prosperity. But how? First, European leaders must understand that prosperity requires universal financial inclusion. In Romania, over a third of the population lacks a bank account. Shockingly, 1.5 million people in Britain are unbanked today. Inaccurate and incomplete land titles similarly erode confidence and impede upward mobility. With blockchain technologies, we can register property rights and provide broad access to basic financial services.</p>
<p>Second, Europe should be a leader in reinventing digital rights management systems to ensure content creators get paid first, fast, and fairly. Imogen Heap’s London-based Mycelia is a good model. Artists post their music containing a smart contract on the blockchain and the software protects their rights and collects royalties, ensuring that everyone is fairly compensated. Finally, Europe can be a pioneer in enabling individuals, rather than corporations, to collect, control, and monetize their own personal data on the blockchain.</p>
<p>None of this will be easy. The European Union urgently needs a new social contract with its member states. The United Kingdom and Scotland must do the same with its citizens. Only then can they chart a new economic path for the digital age. As with the major paradigm shifts that preceded it, the blockchain will create winners and losers. But if we do this right, a more inclusive, peaceful, and prosperous Scotland, Europe and world are within reach.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>A guest blog from Douglas Drummond, CTO of the <a href="https://scotcoinproject.com/">ScotCoin Project</a>. 
 It has barely been a decade since the initial release of Bitcoin and the world’s premier cryptocurrency has gone from strength to strength. 
 Secured by the power of discrete mathematics, Bitcoin provided truly novel solutions to classical problems with digital money systems (such as the Double Spend) and managed to do so in an environment that is highly resistant to hostile actors that might seek to corrupt the system. 
<p>The blockchain is a ledger distributed in its entirety to every node on the network and Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm ensures that significant computing resources must be expended by a nodes to propose adding a block of transactions. Only when the majority of the participants on the network agree that the work performed by the node is valid is the block added to the chain and distributed amongst all other nodes.</p>
<p>This “mining” process emits new Bitcoins to the node that provides the first valid solution. This ensures a truly decentralised database of transactions with no single point of failure that is capable of having entries added to it without a central body (i.e. a Bank) directly updating that ledger. Bitcoin does all of this whilst being completely open to the public allowing anybody to participate in maintaining the ledger.</p>
 The History of ScotCoin 
<p>Around the time of 2013, Scotcoin was created as a potential answer to the currency problem posed by the impending Scottish Independence referendum of 2014. As a hard fork of Bitcoin codebase, a handful of engineers worked together modifying the code to create a new blockchain and distributed Scotcointo network participants.</p>
<p>Whilst the blockchain itself was secure, it would prove that the team trying to maintain the network would be unable to fight off hostile actors denying service to the crucial end-points exposed to the public. The team then sought to migrate to the Bitcoin blockchain using a suite of tools known as Counterparty which extended Bitcoin by “writing in the margin” of standard Bitcoin transactions.</p>
 The Evolution of Cryptocurrencies 
<p>Fast forwarding a couple of years since these developments, this nascent blockchain technology would see rapid development and evolve into other new crypocurrencies seeking to explore the possibilities of this new digital frontier. Ethereum emerged in 2015 as a Turing complete programmable blockchain upon which users could publish their own code in the form of smart contracts with Ether (ETH) being the “gas” fuelling the execution of the code.</p>
<p>This innovation would lead to the development of new types of crypto assets such as limited issue non-fungible tokens and artwork. It also led to the development of standards which would ultimately power stablecoins (see: Tether, DAI and others) and what would become known as ERC-20 tokens: deflationary, limited supply crypto assets running as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain that implement a specific set of functions (for example: balanceOf, transfer, approve amongst others).</p>
<p>This would truly open the floodgates for projects all over the world to issue their own tokens in a manner that could very easily be integrated with existing crypto exchanges since they all implemented that common ERC-20 interface.</p>
<p>Another couple of years would pass and the price of Bitcoin would prove to only be going in one direction: up. The average fee for a Counterparty transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain would approach $5 making it very expensive to transact with Scotcoin version 2.0. This led to the Scotcoin team looking for alternatives since it was always intended to be a practical crypto asset, usable for day-to-day purchases.</p>
<p>However, the team were very aware of the dangers of “switching out one blockchain for another”: what would happen if the price of ETH made it just as unusable? It was only relatively recently in 2019/2020 with the latest development of Ethereum that the team behind Scotcoin took the decision to move to the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. Moving away from a Proof of Work algorithm to a novel Proof of Stake model and other improvements such as sharding meant that Ethereum represented a mature, competent and arguably the best overall long-term platform whilst staying true to the decentralised nature of crypto.</p>
<p>This brings us up to date in late 2020 where the Counterparty verison of Scotcoin has now been deprecated in favour of the new ERC-20 solution and the Scotcoin Project team has been busy migrating holders to the new environment. At the same time research and development has already begun on sharded side-chains which may be verified and “rolled up” into the main chain.</p>
 Social Transformation 
<p>With further improvements to the fee structure required by the public blockchain means that previously impractical applications can now be fleshed out such as a Universal Basic Income whereby small quantities of Scotcoin can be airdropped to community members on a regular basis without having to spend thousands of ETH on the associated transaction fees. This represents a means of introducing a new money supply directly into the hands of the populace without the need for a large institution to oversee the process. A mere handful of adminstrators would be more than capable of verifying the correct operation of the smart contracts.</p>
<p>Another potential application of Scotcoin is to create a microcosm of useful spending. For example it is feasible that a network of charities and food banks could begin accepting Scotcoin for their goods. Those in direct receipt via UBI or even by donations such as promissory notes containing the private keys to a pre-funded wallet would be able to exchange their Scotcoin for food, clothing and other vital supplies.</p>
<p>Ideally, a government level agency would enable a “buyback” of this Scotcoin at 100% of market value from these authorised retailers. This ensures that Scotcoin can easily be spent and redeemed with these whitelisted retailers whilst simultaneously discouraging use for illegal or criminal purposes.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it may even be that the future of Scotcoin lies directly in the hands of the Scottish Government and the team still stand by to offer this IP for free. With Government level intervention it would be possible to create a nationwide blockchain that is maintained in a distributed manner using spare computing cycles in council offices across the land: the blockchain would be maintained for the benefit of the Scottish population.</p>
<p>Users of the network would have their identities shielded yet each would be able to prove their uniqueness and identity using zero knowledge proofs. Additionally, given that we know that all users and nodes participating in the network are honest, we entirely do away with the need for transaction fees, making the coin useful for everyday purchases.</p>
<p>All of these aspects combine to open up applications such as acccessing public services anywhere identity must be verified: Council Tax, the NHS, even voting.</p>
<p>With adequate support and investment, this author firmly believes blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionise our society, making it a fairer and more equitable place with value making its way directly into the hands of the people, especially those most in need.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>As we consider what steps could be taken to action the recommendations of the <a href="https://digitalscot.net/scotlands-technology-ecosystem-review-what-next/">Logan Review</a> we can look to other countries to learn from and emulate their approaches to accelerating economic innovation. 
 Canada in particular offers inspiring programs, notably their use of ‘Technology Roadmaps’ and the launch of ‘Superclusters’. 
 Technology Roadmaps 
<p>Canada has made extensive use of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cluster">Michael Porter’s cluster model</a>&nbsp;to underpin their economic development strategies, a focus on building industry sector collaborations that pool resources and encourage shared innovation that grows the success for all the participating members.</p>
<p>The backbone of these efforts are the creation of ‘Technology Roadmaps’, a common product innovation roadmap and business plan for the whole industry that each business contributes to and can benefit from.</p>
<p>Technology Roadmaps are introduced and explained in detail in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/trm-crt.nsf/vwapj/strategy_for_success-voie_de_la_reussite_eng.pdf/$FILE/strategy_for_success-voie_de_la_reussite_eng.pdf">this guide</a>, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/offices-labs/canmet/technology-roadmaps/5765">this page</a>&nbsp;providing a list of completed roadmap programs, for industries such as electric vehicles, intelligent buildings and smart grids among others.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PXA_AAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">whole book</a>&nbsp;is available that explores their usage in academic detail, and&nbsp;this document offers a guide on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/trm-crt.nsf/vwapj/development-developpement_eng.pdf/$file/development-developpement_eng.pdf">how to develop them</a>, where they describe:</p>
<p>“Technology roadmapping brings players together to work together in a far-reaching planning process and opens the door to collaborative research and development (R&amp;D).</p>
<p>Technology Roadmaps (TRM) can play a key role in enhancing innovation. It is a document outlining future market demand and the recommended means to meet this demand. A roadmap does not predict future breakthroughs in science or technology; rather, it forecasts and articulates the elements required to address future technological needs. A roadmap describes a given future, based on the shared vision of the people developing the roadmap and provides a framework for making that future happen technologically.”</p>
 Building a Digital Supercluster 
<p>Canada has built on and advanced this approach through the launch of a series of&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/093.nsf/eng/00008.html">Superclusters</a>“, concentrating large scale funding into keynote growth industries such as AI, Ocean Technology and Next Generation Manufacturing. Through an investment of up to $950 million, which will be matched dollar for dollar by the private sector, the initiative is expected to create more than 50,000 jobs over ten years and grow Canada’s GDP.</p>
<p>For Scotland’s ambition to build a world leading digital nation&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/">Digital Supercluster</a>&nbsp;is especially relevant.</p>
<p>Although Canada’s Superclusters program are regional in focus, the Digital Supercluster actually offers an R&amp;D agenda that is ideal for defining a Digital Economy strategy for the whole country, described in detail in their <a href="https://www.digitalsupercluster.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/C1-Capacity-Building-Program-Guide-v1.68.pdf">Capacity Building strategy</a>.</p>
<p>The Digital Supercluster identifies an R&amp;D framework ideal for chartering a network intended to develop Canada’s digital economy, including:</p>
 
 Leverage work-integrated learning platforms; 
 Develop diverse talent through relevant certification, work experience, education and training; 
 Develop industry-relevant secondary, post-secondary and/or post-graduate expertise in digital innovation; 
 Leverage access to Canada’s pool of scientific, technical, engineering expertise and capabilities; 
 Encourage and enable senior-level digital and business development talent to work and develop skills in Canada; 
 Support workforce transformation for industries facing digitization and automation, including re-skilling of Canadians; 
 Use online or technology-based methods to reach potential talent, both to encourage them to pursue a career in tech and to train relevant skills; and, 
 Develop best practices of diversity and inclusion that enable organizations to be more inclusive of participation by women and other under represented groups. 
 
<p>From Gaming to the Blockchain Scotland has a number of tech sub-sectors populated with very promising startups that offer global growth potential but aren’t yet working at the scale required to achieve that. These types of innovation programs offer the structure the government can employ to create a national platform for reaching that scale that the whole industry can benefit from.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The purpose of Digital Scotland is to support and help accelerate the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/realising-scotlands-full-potential-digital-world-digital-strategy-scotland/">Scottish Government’s ambition</a> for the country to become a world leading digital nation, and our ebook will provide a complete blueprint for achieving this. 
<p>The first step in this exercise is to define what a ‘Digital Nation’ actually is, a concept so deep and broad it would form an ongoing debate, that we can start through identifying some key component parts:</p>
 
 A technical infrastructure, for uniting all the disparate IT systems into a single environment, particularly that of Digital Identity – the core mechanism for commonality across multiple systems, as well as other key foundations notably the Blockchain and a national integration platform like Estonia’s X-Road system. 
 A digital learning nation – Online learning is ubiquitous, modernizing our schooling, empowering the disadvantaged with new skill sets and integrated with businesses to form route to work pathways. 
 A nation of digital entrepreneurs – These skills are married with support programs and technology accelerators to enable the fast-tracked launch of a myriad of new digital businesses. 
 Wholesale digital capability across all the nation – Key groups are lagging in their adoption of technology, such as small businesses and rural communities. Initiatives to address this will be implemented.

 The Research Project&nbsp; 
<p>Part of our work at Internet Safety Labs is to assess the practicalities of safer technology for the mutual benefit of people and businesses. We strive to find the sweet spot where safer tech for people delivers loyalty and efficiency gains for businesses. Thanks to a grant from the IEEE Technical Activities Board Committee on Standards (TAB CoS), we recently had the opportunity to explore such practical considerations regarding the novel ability for people to send legally binding Information Sharing Agreements to businesses through a personal software agent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if people had the ability to assert their own legally binding permissions for data collection, use, sharing, and retention by the technologies they use? The <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/">IEEE P7012</a> has been working on an interoperability specification for machine-readable personal privacy terms to support such an ability since 2018. The premise behind the work of IEEE P7012 is that people need technology that works on their behalf—i.e. software agents that assert the individual’s permissions and preferences in a machine-readable format.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our research explored the attitudes of people and one small business toward having the ability for people to send their own legally binding privacy terms to the business. The project entailed building a prototype “Relationship Manager” webservice called, “MyMe2BAgent”, and then performing validation testing with both types of users of the agent: individual users (“Me-s) and the business (“B”). The primary research questions for the validation research were:&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Me-s:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Do people want the ability to send their own legally binding Information Sharing Agreements (ISA) to service providers?<br>
&nbsp; 
 Do people want a data management dashboard for managing the personal information that gets shared with all service providers?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>For the business (B):&nbsp;</p>
 
 What was it like to integrate the ability to receive a personal privacy agreement? Is it scalable? Is it something you would want to continue supporting beyond the pilot project? 
 
 The Findings&nbsp; 
<p>The following summarizes the key findings from this research (full report can be found <a href="https://me2ba.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/spotlight-report-6-ieee-p7012-pilot-project-report.pdf">here</a>):&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the capability of sending a personal privacy policy/agreement important and valuable to people (Me-s)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the number of participants is too small to generalize, the study identified differing opinions. Of seven respondents, two said they wouldn’t use the ability if they had it available today. Participants rated the importance of the ISA-sending capability rather low. When asked to score their preferences on a 5-point scale (where “5” indicated “extremely important), the average scores were 2.7 and 3.6 across two participant groups. This is surprising as the participants in this study were all tech privacy afficianados. Clearly, additional research is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple respondents noted that enforcement of the Pilot Information Sharing Agreement (PISA, created specifically for the pilot project) is what is really needed to make this capability meaningful. Currently there is no way to know if an agreement is being upheld. What appears to be most important is ensuring and enforcing the terms of the agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest that reporting and enforcement of any agreement—including existing Terms of Service provided by B-s—is urgently needed, even before the ability to send personal privacy terms to a business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is a single dashboard to manage Me2B Relationships and the data being shared with vendors important and valuable to Me-s?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This capability appears to be somewhat more valued by our test population, with an average importance score of 4.3 across six respondents. It seems that Me-s may be experiencing a problem of scale relating to managing their Me2B Relationships, making and that a “one-stop shop” approach would be desirable. One respondent suggested that the Me2B Relationship Manager should also manage passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the B’s perspective, what is the greatest challenge?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the funds allocated for the grant, nearly 20% was used in a legal audit of the Pilot Information Sharing Agreement (PISA). Granted, the funding was modest ($10,000), legal fees were high, as this type of legal agreement is entirely novel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to arrive at an acceptable PISA, we had to assess current and future business and IT processes, to ensure it could sustainably uphold the stated terms. Me-participants said that the PISA felt like it was written for the B and not the Me. And it was, because it’s the B who bears the legal obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary value [for Me-s] of a machine readable privacy policy system is that it would allow for choice between pre-approved policies/agreements. But the allowable policies/agreements will always be highly vetted and amenable to the business and their legal advisors. They have to be in order for a B to sign them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generalized learnings for B-s:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Allowing multiple different privacy policies will be difficult and likely undesirable due to the highly integrated nature of a personal privacy agreement into the business’ legal processes, business processes, and IT systems’ behaviors. Vetting and allowing a particular privacy policy is a major undertaking.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Since businesses must scale their services to potentially millions of customers, supporting, tracking, and complying with several different policies is likely untenable for B-s. The pre-vetted and allowed Information Sharing Agreements will always be aligned to the capabilities, risk tolerances, security practices, and IT system behavior of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 While one “Me” respondent desired a real-time negotiated agreement, it seems clear that real-time negotiation of privacy terms is unlikely to be supportable by a business. Every aspect of a business and its IT systems would need to be captured in a machine-readable model to make this approach viable.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 From this pilot project, it’s unclear that the agreements must in fact be “machine readable”; they may merely need to be “machine identifiable.” Agreements may not need to be real-time parsed and may never need to be. Rather, the allowable personal privacy policies must have machine-readable unique identifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p>Given the small number of participants in this study, additional research is absolutely necessary. We hope that this project and the learnings derived from it will help the P7012 WG understand the kinds of changes that will be required in order to better empower people, resulting in better Me2B relationships. It will also help them better understand and prioritize key needs and challenges in creating healthier relationships between makers and users of technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PS01 is fully ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that OSLC Configuration Management Version 1.0 from the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project [1] has been approved as an OASIS Project Specification.</p>



<p>Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle is very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across a product’s entire application and product lifecycle.</p>



<p>OSLC Configuration Management defines an RDF vocabulary and a set of REST APIs for managing versions and configurations of linked data resources from multiple domains.</p>



<p>This Project Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the OP’s Project Governing Board and fully ready for testing and implementation. The applicable open source licenses can be found in the project’s administrative repository at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md">https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md</a>.</p>

  NFT allowlists are expensive. The gas involved in creating and updating allowlists on Ethereum can be prohibitive. Fortunately, verifiable Credentials and Verite makes it easy and secure to run allowlists off-chain.

<p>While Verite can help solve significantly more complex challenges than managing
an early access list (i.e., an "allowlist") for NFT projects, it seemed like a
fun experiment to see how well Verite could handle moving the costly process
off-chain while still maintaining data integrity. Before we dive in, let's talk
about what an NFT allowlist is, how it is normally managed, and what the
problems are.</p> What is an Allowlist?<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>For many NFT projects, rewarding early supporters is crucial to the business
model and community health. An allowlist helps give early supporters a distinct
experience with unique terms and timing. By putting supporters' wallet address
on a list that grants them early access to mint NFTs from the new collection,
these supporters can avoid what's commonly referred to as "<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-crypto-gas-wars/">gas
wars</a>". Gas wars
happen when a popular NFT project drops and people (and bots) spend exorbitant
amounts of gas on the Ethereum network to ensure their minting transactions go
through before anyone else's to avoid missing the narrow window of availability
in an oversubscribed market. Needless to say, this negatively impacts all
participants because it can price people out of the collection and force them to
buy the NFTs on secondary market at a higher premium. On the Ethereum mainnet,
gas fees have even spiked to higher than the mint prices of the NFTs! That's a
hefty surcharge.</p><p>The allowlist concept lets people on the list mint for a period of time
(normally 24 hours) before the public mint. This helps keep bots out of the
mint, guarantees adequate supply to everyone on that list (or at least,
guarantees each member on the list access to supply while it is adequate!), and
keeps gas prices relatively low. NFT projects generally frame allowlist spots as
a "reward" for community participation or various kinds of non-monetary
contributions.</p> How Are Allowlists Normally Managed?<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Historically, Ethereum-based NFT allowlists have been managed on-chain. This
means a mapping of wallets addresses must be added to on-chain storage, usually
via a function on the NFT project's smart contract that populates that
persistent mapping in storage accessible to other functions. The transaction to
add these wallet addresses can be incredibly expensive, since it is literally
buying and taking up additional blockspace with each additional address. It has
historically ranged from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars
depending on the price of ETH at the time, even if the allowlist is bundled into
a single transaction. This number goes much higher broken out into multiple
gas-inflicting updates.</p><p>Because of the cost, projects are incentivized to set the allowlist once and
never update it. Every update costs money. This can lead to errors in the list,
inequity, justifiably grouchy late-comers to the community, and other problems.
Additionally, allowlists can often become "static requirements": rigid patterns
that get over-applied by a one-size-fits-all approach. Services like
<a href="https://www.premint.xyz/">Premint</a> have begun to change this, which introduces
an economy of scale to save on gas and other features.  But further improvements
are possible! Projects should have the flexibility to implement dynamic
requirements on whom gets added to an allowlist and how.</p><p>That's where Verifiable Credentials come in.</p> How To Use Verite and Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>We're going to be working through an Ethereum ERC-721 NFT contract alongside a
mechanism that allows us to issue verifiable credentials to participants that we
want to allow on the allowlist. We'll use Hardhat to help us generate the
skeleton for our smart contract code and to make it easier to test and deploy.</p><p>We'll also use <a href="https://login.xyz/">Sign In With Ethereum</a> (SIWE) to handle our user sessions. We're using SIWE because <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/">it provides more protections and assurances</a> than the normal "Connect Wallet" flow does.</p><p>On the front-end side of the house, we'll build a simple page that allows potential allowlist recipients to request their verifiable credential, and we'll build the actual minting functionality.</p><p>Let's get started. You'll need Node.js version 12 or above for this. You'll also need a good text editor and some knowledge of the command line.</p><p>From your command line, change into the directory where you keep all your fancy NFT projects. Then, let's clone the example app I built ahead of this tutorial to make our lives easier.</p>   <code>git clone https://github.com/centrehq/verite-minter-allowlist<br></code>     <p>This is a repository that uses SIWE's base example app and extends it. So what you'll have is a folder for your frontend application, a folder for your backend express server, and a folder for your smart contract-related goodies.</p><p>Let's start by looking at the backend server. Open the <code>backend/src/index.js</code> file. There's a lot going on in here, but half of it is related to SIWE, which is very well documented. So, we're going to gloss over those routes and just trust that they work (they do).</p> Request Allowlist Endpoint<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Scroll down in the file until you see the route for <code>requestAllowlist</code>. Now, before we go any further, let me walk through a quick explanation of how this entire flow will work.</p>  Project runs a web app and a server  Web app handles both requesting/issuing verifiable credentials associated with the allowlist and minting  During the minting process, a verifiable credential must be sent back to the project's server.  Backend handles checking to see if a wallet should receive a credential, then generating the credential.  Backend handles verifying that a credential sent as part of the minting process is valid.  If credential is valid, backend signs an EIP712 message with a private key owned by the project.  Signature is returned to the frontend and includes it as part of the mint function on the smart contract.  <p>We'll dive into details on the smart contract in a moment, but that's the basic flow for the front and backends. For those who love a good diagram, we've got you covered:</p><p></p><p>Now, if we look at the route called <code>requestAllowlist</code>, we'll see:</p>   <code>if (!req.session.siwe) {<br>  res.status(401).json({ message: "You have to first sign_in" })<br>  return<br>}<br>const address = req.session.siwe.address<br>if (!validateAllowlistAccess(address)) {<br>  res.status(401).json({ message: "You are not eligible for the allowlist" })<br>  return<br>}<br><br>const { subject } = await getOrCreateDidKey(address)<br><br>const issuerDidKey = await getIssuerKey()<br>const application = await createApplication(issuerDidKey, subject)<br>const presentation = await getPresentation(issuerDidKey, application)<br><br>res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")<br>res.json(presentation)<br></code>     <p>We are using the SIWE library to make sure the user is signed in and has a valid session. This also gives us the user's wallet address. Remember, we're trusting that all the SIWE code above this route works (it does).</p><p>Next, we are checking to see if the project has determined that wallet to be eligible for the allowlist. This is a very low-tech process. Most projects ask participants to do something in order to get on the list and then they manage a spreadsheet of addresses. In this code example, we have a function called <code>validateAllowlistAccess()</code> that checks a hardcoded array of addresses from a config file:</p>   <code>const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("../config.json"))<br><br>const validateAllowlistAccess = (address) =&gt; {<br>  return config.addressesForAllowlist.includes(address)<br>}<br></code>     <p>Next, we need to create a DID (decentralized identifier) key for the associated wallet (or we need to look up an existing DID key). In a perfect world, we'd be using a built-in credential wallet integration with the user's Ethereum wallet, but since we don't have that, we're going to manage a delegated key system. The system works like this:</p>  Project checks to see if there is a DID key for the wallet in question in the database (note: the database here is just disk storage, but can be anything you'd like).  If there is a DID key, project uses that key for Verite functions.  If there is no DID key, project generates one and adds the mapping to the database.  <p>That's happening here:</p>   <code>const { subject } = await getOrCreateDidKey(address)<br></code>     <p>And the <code>getOrCreateDidKey()</code> function looks like this:</p>   <code>const getOrCreateDidKey = async (address) =&gt; {<br>  const db = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("db.json"))<br>  let keyInfo = db.find((entry) =&gt; entry.address === address)<br>  if (!keyInfo) {<br>    const subject = randomDidKey(randomBytes)<br>    subject.privateKey = toHexString(subject.privateKey)<br>    subject.publicKey = toHexString(subject.publicKey)<br>    keyInfo = {<br>      address,<br>      subject<br>    }<br>    db.push(keyInfo)<br>    fs.writeFileSync("db.json", JSON.stringify(db))<br>  }<br><br>  return keyInfo<br>}<br></code>     <p>As you can see, our database is making use of the always fashionable file system. We look up the key or we generate a new one using Verite's <code>randomDidKey</code> function. We then convert the public and private key portion of the payload to hex strings for easier storage.</p><p>Ok, moving on. Next, we grab the issuer key. This is a DID key that is associated with the project.</p>   <code>const issuerDidKey = await getIssuerKey()<br></code>     <p>Much like the function to get the user's DID key, the <code>getIssuerKey</code> function just does a look up in the DB and returns the key. Remember to always protect your keys, kids. Even though these keys are exclusively for signing and issuing credentials, you should protect them as if they could spend your ETH.</p>   <code>const getIssuerKey = async () =&gt; {<br>  let issuer = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("issuer.json"))<br>  if (!issuer.controller) {<br>    issuer = randomDidKey(randomBytes)<br>    issuer.privateKey = toHexString(issuer.privateKey)<br>    issuer.publicKey = toHexString(issuer.publicKey)<br>    if (!issuerDidKey.signingKey) {<br>      const randomWallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom()<br>      const privateKey = randomWallet._signingKey().privateKey<br>      issuerDidKey.signingKey = privateKey<br>    }<br>    fs.writeFileSync("issuer.json", JSON.stringify(issuer))<br>  }<br><br>  return issuer<br>}<br></code>     <p>As you can see, in addition to creating a DID key or fetching a DID key with this function, we are creating a signing key using an ETH wallet. This will be the same key we use to deploy the smart contract and sign a message later. Stand by for disclaimers!</p><p>Next, we call a function called <code>createApplication</code>.</p>   <code>const createApplication = async (issuerDidKey, subject) =&gt; {<br>  subject.privateKey = fromHexString(subject.privateKey)<br>  subject.publicKey = fromHexString(subject.publicKey)<br>  const manifest = buildKycAmlManifest({ id: issuerDidKey.controller })<br>  const application = await buildCredentialApplication(subject, manifest)<br>  return application<br>}<br></code>     <p>This function includes some helpers to convert the DID key private and public keys back from hex strings to buffers. The function then uses the <code>buildKycAmlManifest</code> function from the Verite library to build a manifest that will be used in the credential application. It should be noted that I'm using the <code>KycAmlManifest</code> but you could create your own manifest that more closely mirrors adding someone to an allowlist. The KycAmlManifest fit closely enough for me, though.</p><p>Finally, the manifest is used and passed into the Verite library function <code>buildCredentialApplication</code> and the application is returned.</p><p>When the application is built, we now call a function called <code>getPresentation</code>:</p>   <code>const getPresentation = async (issuerDidKey, application) =&gt; {<br>  issuerDidKey.privateKey = fromHexString(issuerDidKey.privateKey)<br>  issuerDidKey.publicKey = fromHexString(issuerDidKey.publicKey)<br><br>  const decodedApplication = await decodeCredentialApplication(application)<br><br>  const attestation = {<br>    type: "KYCAMLAttestation",<br>    process: "https://verite.id/definitions/processes/kycaml/0.0.1/usa",<br>    approvalDate: new Date().toISOString()<br>  }<br><br>  const issuer = buildIssuer(issuerDidKey.subject, issuerDidKey.privateKey)<br>  const presentation = await buildAndSignFulfillment(<br>    issuer,<br>    decodedApplication,<br>    attestation<br>  )<br><br>  return presentation<br>}<br></code>     <p>We're using the project's issuer DID key here. We decode the application using Verite's <code>decodeCredentialApplication</code> function. Then, we have to attest to the credential presentation.</p><p>Using the issuer private key and public key, we call the Verite library <code>buildIssuer</code> function. With the result, we can then create the verifiable presentation that will ultimately be passed back to the user by calling Verite's <code>buildAndSignFulfillment</code> function.</p><p>It is that presentation that is sent back to the user. We'll take a look at the frontend shortly, but just know that the presentation comes in the form of a JWT.</p> Verify Mint Access Endpoint<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Next, we'll take a look at the <code>verifyMintAccess</code> route. This route includes significantly more functionality. Let's dive in!</p>   <code>try {<br>  const { jwt } = req.body<br><br>  if (!req.session || !req.session.siwe) {<br>    return res.status(403).send("Unauthorized, please sign in")<br>  }<br>  const address = req.session.siwe.address<br><br>  const decoded = await decodeVerifiablePresentation(jwt)<br><br>  const vc = decoded.verifiableCredential[0]<br><br>  const decodedVc = await decodeVerifiableCredential(vc.proof.jwt)<br><br>  const issuerDidKey = await getIssuerKey()<br><br>  const { subject } = await getOrCreateDidKey(address)<br><br>  const offer = buildKycVerificationOffer(<br>    uuidv4(),<br>    issuerDidKey.subject,<br>    "https://test.host/verify"<br>  )<br>  const submission = await buildPresentationSubmission(<br>    subject,<br>    offer.body.presentation_definition,<br>    decodedVc<br>  )<br><br>  //  The verifier will take the submission and verify its authenticity. There is no response<br>  //  from this function, but if it throws, then the credential is invalid.<br>  try {<br>    await validateVerificationSubmission(<br>      submission,<br>      offer.body.presentation_definition<br>    )<br>  } catch (error) {<br>    console.log(error)<br>    return res.status(401).json({ message: "Could not verify credential" })<br>  }<br><br>  let privateKey = ""<br><br>  if (!issuerDidKey.signingKey) {<br>    throw new Error("No signing key found")<br>  } else {<br>    privateKey = issuerDidKey.signingKey<br>  }<br><br>  let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey)<br><br>  const domain = {<br>    name: "AllowList",<br>    version: "1.0",<br>    chainId: config.chainId,<br>    verifyingContract: config.contractAddress<br>  }<br>  const types = {<br>    AllowList: [{ name: "allow", type: "address" }]<br>  }<br>  const allowList = {<br>    allow: address<br>  }<br><br>  const signature = await wallet._signTypedData(domain, types, allowList)<br><br>  return res.send(signature)<br>} catch (error) {<br>  console.log(error)<br>  res.status(500).send(error.message)<br>}<br></code>     <p>Once again, the first thing we check is that the user has a valid SIWE session. This route takes a body that includes the verifiable presentation we had sent to the user previously. So, the next step is to call the Verite function <code>decodeVerifiablePresentation</code> to then be able to extract the verifiable credential and call the <code>decodeVerifiableCredential</code> function.</p><p>As with our <code>requestAllowlist</code> route, we now need to get the issuer DID key and look up the user's delegated DID key. From there, we can use the issuer key to call the Verite library function <code>buildKycVerificationOffer</code>. We use the results of that call and the user's DID key to call the Verite library function <code>buildPresentationSubmission</code>.</p><p>Now, we get on to the good stuff. We're going to make sure a valid credential was sent to us. We call the Verite library function <code>validateVerificationSubmission</code>. This function will throw if the credential is invalid. Otherwise, it does nothing. We're rooting for nothing!</p><p>Next, the code might get a little confusing, so I want to spend some time walking through this implementation and highlighting how you'd probably do this differently in production. Once the credential is verified, we need to sign a message with a private key owned by the project. For simplicity, I chose to use the same private key that would deploy the smart contract. This is not secure. Don't do this. Hopefully, this is enough to illustrate how to execute the next few steps, though.</p><p>We have the issuer DID key written to our database already (file system). We also included a signing key. We need that signing key to sign the message that will be sent back to the user. We use that key to build an Ethereum wallet that can be used for signing.</p>   <code>let privateKey = ""<br><br>if (!issuerDidKey.signingKey) {<br>  throw new Error("No signing key found")<br>} else {<br>  privateKey = issuerDidKey.signingKey<br>}<br><br>let wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey)<br></code>     <p>Finally, we build out the EIP-712 message and sign it. The resulting signature hash is what we send back to the browser so the user can use it in the smart contract's minting function.</p><p>That was a lot, but guess what? The frontend and the smart contract should be a lot quicker and easier to follow.</p> Frontend<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>If we back out of the <code>backend</code> folder in our project, we can then switch into the <code>frontend</code> folder. Take a look at <code>frontend/src/index.js</code>. The <code>requestAllowlist</code> function is the one the user will call to hit the project's server's endpoint to see if the user is even allowed to get an allowlist credential. If so, the credential is returned and stored in localstorage:</p>   <code>async function requestAllowlistAccess() {<br>  try {<br>    const res = await fetch(`${BACKEND_ADDR}/requestAllowlist`, {<br>      credentials: "include"<br>    })<br>    const message = await res.json()<br><br>    if (res.status === 401) {<br>      alert(message.message)<br>      return<br>    }<br>    localStorage.setItem("nft-vc", message)<br>    alert("Credential received and stored in browser")<br>  } catch (error) {<br>    console.log(error)<br>    alert(error.message)<br>  }<br>}<br></code>     <p>Again, this would look a lot nicer if there was a built-in credential wallet integration with Ethereum wallets, but for simplicity, the credential is being stored in localstorage. Safe, safe localstorage.</p><p>(narrator: localstorage is not safe).</p><p>When it's time to mint during the presale, the user clicks on the mint button and the <code>mintPresale</code> function is called:</p>   <code>async function mintPresale() {<br>  const jwt = localStorage.getItem("nft-vc")<br>  if (!jwt) {<br>    alert("No early access credential found")<br>    return<br>  }<br><br>  const res = await fetch(`${BACKEND_ADDR}/verifyMintAccess`, {<br>    method: "POST",<br>    headers: {<br>      "Content-Type": "application/json"<br>    },<br>    body: JSON.stringify({ jwt }),<br>    credentials: "include"<br>  })<br><br>  if (res.status === 401 || res.status === 403) {<br>    alert(<br>      "You're not authorized to mint or not signed in with the right wallet"<br>    )<br>    return<br>  }<br><br>  const sig = await res.text()<br><br>  const contract = new ethers.Contract(address, json(), signer)<br>  const allowList = {<br>    allow: address<br>  }<br>  let overrides = {<br>    value: ethers.utils.parseEther((0.06).toString())<br>  }<br>  const mint = await contract.mintAllowList(<br>    1,<br>    allowList,<br>    sig,<br>    address,<br>    overrides<br>  )<br>  console.log(mint)<br>  alert("Minted successfully")<br>}<br></code>     <p>This function grabs the credential from localstorage and sends it along to the project's backend server. Assuming the signature from the project is returned, the user is now able to mint. That signature is sent to the smart contract as well as how many tokens should be minted and the amount of ETH necessary to mint. Note, the allowlist object that we send as well. This helps the smart contract verify the signature. Simple!</p><p>But how does that work with the smart contract exactly?</p> Smart Contract<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>If you open up the <code>contract</code> folder, you'll see a sub-folder called <code>contracts</code>. In there, you'll see the smart contract we're using in this example, called <code>Base_ERC721.sol</code>.</p><p>This is a pretty standard NFT minting contract. It's not a full implementation. There would be project-specific functions and requirements to make it complete, but it highlights the allowlist minting functionality.</p><p>The first thing to note is we're using the EIP-712 standard via a contract imported from OpenZeppelin. You can see that with this line:</p>   <code>import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/draft-EIP712.sol";<br></code>     <p>Next, we are extending the ERC-721 contract and specifying use of EIP-712 here:</p>   <code>contract BASEERC721 is ERC721Enumerable, Ownable, EIP712("AllowList", "1.0") {<br>  ...<br></code>     <p>A little further down in the contract, we create a struct that defines the allowlist data model. It's simple because we are only looking at the wallet address that should be on the allowlist:</p>   <code>struct AllowList {<br>  address allow;<br>}<br></code>     <p>We're going to focus in now on the <code>mintAllowList</code> function and the <code>_verifySignature</code> function. Our <code>mintAllowList</code> function starts off similar to a normal NFT minting function except it includes the required <code>signature</code> argument and <code>dataToVerify</code> argument. We do a couple of normal checks before we get to a check that verifies the signature itself. This is where the magic happens.</p><p>The <code>_verifySignature</code> function is called. It takes in the data model and the signature.</p>   <code>function _verifySignature(<br>  AllowList memory dataToVerify,<br>  bytes memory signature<br>) internal view returns (bool) {<br>  bytes32 digest = _hashTypedDataV4(<br>      keccak256(<br>          abi.encode(<br>              keccak256("AllowList(address allow)"),<br>              dataToVerify.allow<br>          )<br>      )<br>  );<br><br>  require(keccak256(bytes(signature)) != keccak256(bytes(PREVIOUS_SIGNATURE)), "Invalid nonce");<br>  require(msg.sender == dataToVerify.allow, "Not on allow list");<br><br>  address signerAddress = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);<br><br>  require(CONTRACT_OWNER == signerAddress, "Invalid signature");<br><br>  return true;<br>}<br></code>     <p>Using the EIP-712 contract imported through the OpenZeppelin library, we're able to create a digest representing the data that was originally signed. We can then recover the signing address and compare it to the expected address. In our simplified example, we expect the signer to be the same address as the contract deployer, but you can, of course, extend this much further.</p><p>To help avoid replay attacks, we also compare the current signature to a variable called <code>PREVIOUS_SIGNATURE</code>. If the signature is the same, we reject the entire call because a signature can only be used once.</p><p>Back to our <code>mintAllowList</code> function, if the signature is verified, we allow the minting to happen. When that's complete, we update the <code>PREVIOUS_SIGNATURE</code> variable. This is, as with many things in this demo, a simplified replay attack prevention model. This can and probably should be extended to support your own use cases.</p> Caveats and Conclusion<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In a perfect world, we would not be issuing credentials to a delegated subject DID. In our example, we could have just as easily have issued to the user's wallet address, but we wanted to highlight the DID functionality as best as possible.</p><p>It is possible today for the user to manage their own DID and keys, but the tricky part comes, as mentioned earlier in this post, when interacting with crypto wallets. Signing a transaction is not the same as signing a JWT. The keys used are different, the signatures are different, and the flow is different. Until these things become unified and more seamless, this demo helps illustrate how Verite can be used today to enforce allowlist restrictions for an NFT minting project.</p><p>Hopefully, this sparks some creativity. Hopefully, it inspires some people to go and build even more creative solutions that leverage verifiable credentials and Verite.</p>

collaboration for user authentication between Gaia-X Federation Services, IDunion, eco association and&nbsp;Lissi Collaboration between Gaia-X Federation Services (GXFS) and&nbsp;IDunion <p>Gaia-X creates an open, federated digital ecosystem for data infrastructure for decentralized cloud and edge workloads and data sharing capabilities. As part of the core services, the so-called Gaia-X Federation Services (GXFS) are targeting the areas of Identity &amp; Trust, Federated Catalogue, Sovereign Data Exchange and Compliance as open-source reference implementations.</p><p>The project is funded by the governments of France and Germany to support the data-driven business models for the European economy. Part of every digital service solution is decentralized identity and access management, which enables participants of Gaia-X Federations to manage their participants in a self-sovereign manner.</p><p>The identity layer determines how GDPR-compliant interactions between stakeholders can be offered, established and trusted based on SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) principles without the need for a centralized controller. Such a decentralized implementation has been developed by IDunion. Despite the agnostic approach of Gaia-X, both projects collaborate to form a holistic solution and are aligned in regards to their principles of data sovereignty, openness and user&nbsp;control.</p> Easy authentication via&nbsp;Lissi <p>In this context authentication is the process of verifying the already known identity of a principal (user). Traditionally a centralized identity provider is used to identify and authenticate a user and you trust them by default. While there are single sign-on solutions by worldwide acting technology companies, these authentication mechanisms make users dependent on the provider while also introducing comprehensive surveillance risks.</p>Registration process for Gaia-X Federation Services with&nbsp;Lissi<p>Therefore, Gaia-X goes another way with personal wallets such as the Lissi Wallet to enable users to manage their identity by themselves as well as offering a passwordless authentication method, which doesn’t depend on a single centralized service. While this implementation is done via Lissi Connect to bridge newly evolving SSI technologies with existing standards like OpenID Connect, other vendors or open-source integrations can also be used simultaneously.</p>Login process for the Gaia-X Federation Services Portal with&nbsp;Lissi Demonstration at the Hannover&nbsp;Fair <p>The first draft of the integration was demonstrated at the Hannover Fair, an international industry trade exhibition. The final integration with any wallets is currently in progress and will be presented to the public at a later&nbsp;stage.</p> Benefits for&nbsp;users:   Convenience: self-managed and controlled identity and login without&nbsp;password  User-centric: use the same application for interacting with multiple stakeholders  Order: using a credential for authentication and authorization  Transparency: of interactions with GDPR conformity   Benefits for organizations:   Domain independent: shared trusted infrastructure with European values and regulatory conformance.  Streamlined UX: for authentication and authorization  Risk reduction: interacting with verified participants  no vendor lock-in: usage of open standards  Independence: decentralized user and access management   About Gaia-X Federation Services: <p>The Gaia-X Federation Services (GXFS) represent the minimum technical requirements needed to build and operate a cloud-based, self-determined data infrastructure ecosystem. On the basis of technical specifications, services are developed based on an open source code. These will be further developed into operational services by the Gaia-X community and continuously improved. Led by eco, the GXFS-DE project is also funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action and is in close exchange with the Gaia-X Association for Data and Cloud (AISBL) and the French funded project GXFS-FR.

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of PlainID?</p>



<p>Our mission: PlainID’s mission is to provide frictionless user experiences while maintaining security and the highest levels of data privacy and compliance. PlainID helps businesses advance and modernize by simply and securely connecting people with the digital assets they need to do their jobs, accomplish tasks at scale and conduct digital commerce. By making authorization decisions simple, smart, granular, and dynamic, PlainID helps enterprises control who can access what, when, and how on whose authority. Enterprises and organizations worldwide use PlainID to securely connect their employees, customers, and partners with the digital assets they continuously need, on-demand. Our vision: PlainID envisions a world where it’s easy to connect identity (employee, business partner, customer, machine account, system account) to any application, service, or data—with assurance. In the future, we believe that PlainID will be behind every connection between an identity and a digital service: monitoring, securing, and validating it. Authorization is the foundation of security: it’s the last mile that governs what people actually can do.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Digital identities managed through Identity Platforms have grown exponentially in size and relevance. The convergence of market dynamics (user experience, security, and data governance) coupled with the dynamic evolution of ever-increasing security risk vectors has caused the perfect storm of variables for breaches and attacks to occur. Traditional Identity providers provide authentication around the perimeter, but what is the perimeter today in a world of cloud computing? Security must cut through the enterprise and protect digital assets and data that malicious actors may be trying to access. As a result, a paradigm shift to “Identity-First Security” is becoming the de-facto security model for securing the enterprise organization, and Authorization management &amp; control is a centric and crucial part of that architecture.</p>
 



 
 <a href="https://www.plainid.com/"></a> 



<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity must ensure secure access to digital assets. It unlocks a range of essential services now available online, for use as an employee or a consumer. Organizations and individuals can now do business anywhere around the globe with a few clicks of a button. Our organization takes the security of connecting identities to digital assets to the next, critical level – authorization. Market adoption for authorization has been driven by the convergence of traditional identity and access management and cybersecurity requirements. In the future, we believe that PlainID will be behind every connection between an identity and a digital service: monitoring, securing, and validating it. Authorization is the foundation of security: it’s the last mile that governs what people actually can do.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>As in other countries, digital identity and its security are crucial to the growth of the Canadian economy. As Canadians continue to increase their use of digital services, regulations around trusted digital architecture need to be imposed to enable the right control of who can access what, when, and how on whose authority. And no more.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>PlainID’s mission is to provide frictionless user experiences while maintaining security and the highest levels of data privacy and compliance.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>PlainID is the global leader in Authorization as a Service. We provide an extensible authorization platform for securely connecting identities to digital assets across the enterprise, at scale. We make Authorization management plain and simple, across your technology stack and your business ecosystem. Powered by Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC), PlainID’s AuthZ Platform provides Centralized Policy Management with Distributed Enforcement dynamically across vital enterprise access points. Our customers use PlainID to strengthen traditional Identity &amp; Access Management AuthZ, deploy Identity-First Security initiatives (including Zero Trust), and meet Data Access / Governance AuthZ requirements. The PlainID Platform offers a SaaS-based management console and pre-built connectors (Authorizers), extending modern AuthZ to API gateways, microservices, SaaS applications, data brokers, and beyond.</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, June 6, 2022  – Edge, the region’s nonprofit research and education network and technology partner, has announced the expansion of its Data Warehouse / Business Intelligence offering on the <a href="https://njedge.net/solutions/edgemarket/">EdgeMarket Cooperative Pricing System</a> via its master contract vehicle with strategic partner, <a href="https://www.heliocampus.com/">HelioCampus</a>, an innovator in enterprise analytics, benchmarking, assessment, and data science services.</p>
<p>The new solution, HelioCampus Assessment &amp; Credentialing, is a unified platform for managing institutional assessment and accreditation, planning for continuous improvement, and connecting authentic lifelong learning to help improve learner success. The platform enables easy automation of evaluation, supports individual student assessment, facilitates curriculum mapping and review, streamlines campus-wide accreditation processes, and helps to achieve strategic and educational goals.</p>
<p>“We are so glad to have the HelioCampus Assessment and Credentialing platform now available through Edge. As accreditation standards are focusing more on institutional financial sustainability, not just their commitment to academic achievement, the ability to streamline the assessment process has become even more important. In combination with our analytics platform, institutions can utilize student learning outcomes data in concert with other institutional data to provide an unprecedented level of transparency. This unified view will directly support accreditation, financial sustainability and student success initiatives,” explained Jack Neill, VP Product, HelioCampus.</p>
<p>The expanded offering builds on recent momentum generated by the partnership between Edge and HelioCampus. A recent webinar hosted in conjunction with Villanova University and attended by over 100 members of the higher education community nationwide, titled Villanova University’s Data Journey: From Challenges Identified to Implementation, highlighted Villanova’s success with HelioCampus. By sharing their story, Villanova served as a model for institutions thinking about how to approach a data analytics program from scratch, including selecting a partner like HelioCampus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The best co-op master agreements are those where the awarded vendors exhibit a true partnership mindset and a relentless focus on the success of institutions participating in the co-op.

  Gitcoin launches Proof of Personhood Passport, built on Ceramic, for Gitcoin Grants Round 14

<p>At Ceramic, we’re passionate about creating easy-to-use building blocks for Web3 data. That’s why we’re excited to partner with Gitcoin, a team that shares a similar vision. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a> is on a mission to empower builder communities to build and fund public goods. Today, they launched Gitcoin Passport as a decentralized identity verification utility, using Ceramic to store personal credentials and make them portable across ecosystems.</p><p>Gitcoin adopts this new application as part of the active Grants Round 14 to verify the unique personhood of contributors in the Quadratic Funding matching program. If you're contributing to Gitcoin Grants, go to the Trust Bonus page in your profile or <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/#/dashboard">Gitcoin Passport</a> to verify your unique personhood and, in turn, increase your matching.</p> What is Gitcoin Grants? <p>Gitcoin Grants is the largest Quadratic Funding (QF) application in the Web3 space, processing over $1.5mm/quarter in funding for a variety of hackathons, bounties, and open source projects. Quadratic Funding is the <a href="https://wtfisqf.com/">mathematically optimal way</a> to fund public goods in a democratic community.</p><p>During every grants round, projects undergo a crowdfunding campaign that is matched with funds according to the QF algorithm, where the number of contributors matters more than amount funded. This pushes power to the edges and away from whales who may have simply donated a much higher amount. In public goods funding, this ultimately creates more democracy.</p> The Importance of Sybil Resistance and the Trust Bonus <p>While QF is the most optimal way to democratically allocate funds to projects that a community cares about, <a href="https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-policy/policy/understanding-potential-attack-vectors/sybil-attack">it is susceptible to Sybil attacks</a>. In Gitcoin Grants, the Sybil attack means that a user spreads their funds across multiple wallets and donates to the same project. Since QF weighs the number of donations over the total amount donated, attackers can game the system to receive a larger slice of the QF matching pool.</p><p>To build in Sybil resistance, the Gitcoin team asks users to verify their “proof of humanity” by proving ownership over various accounts and data. Gitcoin Grants integrates with a variety of identity providers (Proof of Humanity or BrightID), Web2 services (Google, Twitter, or Facebook), and Web3 accounts (ENS). Users who verify their identity through a number of these mechanisms are eligible for a ‘Trust Bonus,’ allowing their contributions to be assigned a larger weight in the matching calculations.</p> Introducing the Decentralized Proof of Personhood Passport <p>While the Trust Bonus helps to minimize the impact of Sybil attacks, it isn’t the end solution. Gitcoin has long subsidized these payouts (called a Fraud Tax) to ensure that no grant has received less than it was supposed to due to any detected Sybil attacker. <a href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/a-community-based-roadmap-for-sybil-detection-across-web-3">Since Grants Round 7</a>, identity verification has evolved to take several variables into consideration, including training a Machine Learning model to detect adversarial behavior. By introducing these mechanisms, between Grants Rounds 9 to 11, the Fraud Tax paid out by the Gitcoin team has decreased from <a href="https://medium.com/block-science/gitcoin-grants-round-11-anti-fraud-evaluation-results-50f4b0f15125">6.6% of the pool to about 0.6%.</a></p><p>Now, for Grants Round 14, Gitcoin is unveiling a new proof-of-identity system—the Proof of Personhood Passport (PoPP) built on Ceramic. PoPP aggregates the top identity providers across Web2 and Web3 into a single transportable identity that proves one’s personhood.</p><p>PoPP leverages Ceramic to link a user’s Ethereum address to a Decentralized Identifier (DID) which enables them to control streams of data on the network. As users verify their identity with various trusted third-parties, PoPP signs and issues “stamps” to the user’s Passport that publicly attest to the user’s claims. Behind the scenes, these are Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that are stored on the user’s Ceramic streams. These credentials are then used to calculate a weighted Personhood Score that secures the Quadratic Funding mechanism.</p><p>Gitcoin is launching PoPP as a decentralized utility and soon, as a public good, allowing any team to assign custom weights to issued credentials and calculate their own Personhood Score. For example, a decentralized exchange utilizing PoPP may weigh a KYC (Know Your Customer) credential higher than social media verification. On the other hand, an online community for developers may prefer to heavily weigh a Github verification stamp.</p><p>By aligning to open web standards (DIDs and VCs) and by building on a chain-agnostic network like Ceramic, Gitcoin’s PoPP scores are publicly available yet privacy-preserving, composable and programmable. Gitcoin recently transitioned to a DAO and open sourced much of its work, contributing to the team’s mission to fund the future of open source and evolve PoPP as a public good.</p> Go Hack the Proof of Personhood Hackathon <p><a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/">Gitcoin Grants Round 14</a> starts today, June 8th—be sure to verify your identity via Gitcoin PoPP and increase your “Trust Bonus” score. The higher your score, the more your contributions are eligible to be matched.</p><p>Starting June 14th, the Ceramic and Gitcoin teams will be co-hosting the Gitcoin Passport Hackathon, encouraging collaboration among identity owners, issuers, and field experts to find solutions to pressing identity verification issues using Gitcoin Passport.</p><p><a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr14">Sign up for the hackathon</a> to build the future of identity services with Gitcoin Proof of Personhood Passport. Be sure to <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network/">join our Discord</a> if you have any questions about integrating Ceramic into your application.</p>

In his comment, Alex shared inspiration for the lifespan of a Community of Practice (CoP) as well as the <a href="https://www.themoment.is/how-change-happens/">Two Loops&nbsp;Model</a>.</p><p>This model, first explained in <a href="https://margaretwheatley.com/articles/using-emergence.pdf">a paper</a> by Margaret Wheatley &amp; Deborah Frieze of the Berkana Institute (check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcyHKKc2LVg">video explanation</a>), shows how systems have a lifespan and what happens as that lifespan&nbsp;peaks.</p><p>As one system begins to deteriorate, a new system begins to emerge. This got us thinking about how this model applies to the world of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>.</p> Two Systems image cc-by&nbsp;WAO<p>It’s interesting to apply the Two Loops model to the context of badges and credentialing. The old system in this case is what we might call “old school credentials” — it’s the degrees, certifications and awards issued by “recognised bodies” like a university or a company. We still need those! That’s awesome! However, the alternative system is not simply about making those old school credentials digital.</p><p>The early spirit of the alternative system was about how important recognition itself is, not only in the context of skills or knowledge acquisition, but also for development and participation — personal, professional and social. The alternative system <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">combines credentialing and recognition</a> to give a more nuanced view of a persons learning landscapes and their place within various communities. The new system is about revealing connections.</p> Working within the system (the first&nbsp;loop) first part of the&nbsp;loop<p>The two loops model shows that we need to continue working within the current landscape and trends to help transform institutions. The Keep Badges Weird community can offer tools and approaches to help people integrate more Open Recognition in badging programs. We can offer guidance for change and clearly illustrate the “business case” for putting the learn in control of their own pathways. It is time to push harder for the innovation in recognition that we wish to&nbsp;see.</p> Supporting the alternative system (the second&nbsp;loop) second part of the&nbsp;loop<p>There is no one ‘correct’ way of doing recognition, rather everyone is welcome and encouraged to explore how combinations of badges might lead us into a future where your learning journey is valued for exactly what it is — a journey. We hope that Keep Badges Weird becomes a big tent for all kinds of initiatives. Perhaps we can increase the visibility of people connected to one another and help establish solidarity within the community.</p><p>The great thing about the landscape of Open Recognition is that you don’t need permission to get started. You can recognise someone in your community right now. Not sure how to start?

<p>TORONTO, JUNE 7, 2022 — The <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</a> is excited to announce its partnership with the <a href="https://www.human-technology-foundation.org/">Human Technology Foundation (HTF)</a> on a trusted, citizen-centric digital identity adoption. The purpose of the project is to develop a white paper for the fall of 2022 that will provide recommendations to Canadian and European policymakers on ongoing projects, with the common goal of unlocking secure, equitable access to the global digital economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a time when digital advancements are accelerating rapidly, policy modernization has the opportunity to enable people, businesses, and governments with access to digital ID verification solutions and services that are designed to empower people with security, privacy, and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although multiple Canadian provinces have either <a href="https://diacc.ca/2021/08/03/2022-pre-budget-submission/">launched or made investments</a> in digital ID products and services, federal funding and cohesive leadership remains the missing piece. Notably, in June of 2021, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2663">European Commission</a> proposed a trusted and secure digital ID framework for all European citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This highly anticipated project will begin with executive international insights from a DIACC Special Interest Group (SIG), alongside a renowned HTF Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both parties pride themselves on shared values for trusted, social, and people-centred benefits of digital ID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DIACC is known for their core values of privacy, security, and choice to empower all Canadians to participate in the global digital economy confidently and safely.</p>



<p>The HTF leverages expert thought leadership to identify technology solutions that will lead to a more respectful society. They pride themselves on placing a human intention at the core of all interdisciplinary research projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DIACC and the HTF are comprised of people – designing solutions for people. Both organizations are proud to declare their resulting white paper as a free, publicly available resource upon completion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Members of both the DIACC and HTF communities who wish to review and share insights about the draft SIG project charter may sign up here: <a href="https://forms.gle/EosuLJNobAv9nJqD8">https://forms.gle/EosuLJNobAv9nJqD8</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ABOUT DIACC</p>



<p>DIACC is a growing coalition of public and private sector organizations who are making a significant and sustained effort to ensure Canada’s full, secure, and beneficial participation in the global digital economy. By solving challenges and leveraging opportunities, Canada has the chance to secure at least three percent of <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=33&amp;pr.y=15&amp;sy=2016&amp;ey=2021&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=156&amp;s=NGDP_RPCH%2CNGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPPC%2CPCPIPCH&amp;grp=0&amp;a=">unrealized GDP</a> or $100 billion of potential growth by 2030. Seizing this opportunity is a must in a digital society as we work through the COVID pandemic challenges. Learn more about the <a href="https://diacc.ca/the-diacc/principles/">DIACC mandate</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ABOUT HTF</p>



<p>Human Technology Foundation, created in 2012, is a foundation but also a research and action network placing the human being at the heart of technology development. For them, these technologies are also part of the solutions for building a society that is more respectful of everyone. The Human Technology Foundation network has several thousand members and operates in Paris, Montreal and Geneva. Indeed, if most technologies are neither good nor bad in themselves, they are not neutral either: they carry intentionality and a vision of the human being that must be questioned. From this perspective, the Human Technology Foundation is striving to put technology back at the heart of social debates.</p>

<p>In our continued effort to educate people about the <a href="https://me2ba.org/what-the-heck-is-a-data-broker-john-oliver-breaks-it-down/">risks from data brokers</a> this blog post provides a list of authoritative news stories and research about a specific type of data broker that creates unique risks for people and communities: location data brokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Location data brokers have exploded in popularity over the last decade. There are currently hundreds of data brokers across the U.S. who are selling location data, and dozens of intermediaries providing “location data broker-broker services” where they connect buyers and sellers, with scarcely any protections or notice to the people whose data is being collected, shared, and sold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the widespread commercialization of location data, there have been multiple serious scandals concerning unscrupulous brokers making unsafe data available for sale. Read on below for our tips on protecting your data and (for app builders) ensuring that you are protecting user data.&nbsp;</p>
 Location Data Broker Scandals in the News&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data">“There’s a Multibillion-Dollar Market for Your Phone’s Location Data”</a> – The Markup provided one of the definitive deep-dives into location data brokers, helping to compile a list of several dozen niche data brokers, with details on each of them. Countless companies included in this September 2021 article have faced scandals both before and after this research was published . <a href="https://themarkup.org/about">The Markup </a>does a masterful job explaining the magnitude of this dystopian reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image from The Markup’s “<a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/09/30/theres-a-multibillion-dollar-market-for-your-phones-location-data">There’s a Multibillion-Dollar Market for Your Phone’s Location Data</a>” article.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html">“Twelve Million Phones, One Dataset, Zero Privacy”</a> – The New York Times conducted a groundbreaking investigation by purchasing data from location brokers and tracking people and their patterns across the U.S., including people who visited the White House, the Pentagon, the NY Stock Exchange, and other sensitive locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/21/top-catholic-priest-resigns-after-phone-data-tracked-to-grindr/">“Top Catholic Priest Resigns after Phone Data Tracked to Grindr”</a> – Data shared from the popular Grindr dating app was used to identify and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing">dox</a> a priest, with the NY Post accurately describing the scandal thusly: ”Thanks to data streams, the Lord is no longer the only omniscient one.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vzjb/location-data-abortion-clinics-safegraph-planned-parenthood">“Data Broker Is Selling Location Data of People Who Visit Abortion Clinics”</a> – Vice Motherboard broke news in May 2022 that location data broker SafeGraph was selling data about people who visit abortion clinics, which could be used to dox and identify individual patients. Vice also <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5qaq3/location-data-firm-heat-maps-planned-parenthood-abortion-clinics-placer-ai">broke news the same week that Placer.ai was selling similar location data</a> about people who visit abortion facilities, both sources stopped after the reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/the-texas-abortion-ban-could-force-tech-to-snitch-on-users">“The Texas Abortion Ban Could Force Tech to Snitch on Users”</a> – The Protocol took on the topic of tracking users who access healthcare services with some eye-opening details about what tech companies were doing to support employees, posing a complex question to readers “… what about Uber and Lyft? Would they pay for drivers’ legal fees if they’re sued for giving women a ride? For now at least, tech companies aren’t answering any of these questions.” The article went on to explain how many of the companies are trying to figure out the impacts of new laws while also potentially putting customers at risk due to the complexities of technical tracking and the relative ease of acquiring location data from the services through legal requests. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/tech-news-briefing/collecting-your-location-data-why-it-worth-so-much/435a5f06-33e4-45f6-80d7-fb1d25102beb">“Collecting Your Location Data: Why It’s Worth So Much”</a> – On this Wall Street Journal podcast, expert reporters dug into the details of X-Mode Social, a company selling location data to the U.S. government , including data from both Google and Apple phones to be used for intelligence purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<a href="http://xn--tim%20hortons%20coffee%20app%20broke%20law%20by%20constantly%20recording%20users%20movements-6f82ddl/">Tim Hortons coffee app broke law by constantly recording users’ movements”</a> – This Ars Technica piece came out the day we were planning to post this blog. This popular Canadian coffee app was tracking and recording people’s location “’every few minutes of every day,’ even when the app wasn’t open, in violation of the country’s privacy laws.” &nbsp;</p>
 What You Can Do as a User of Mobile Apps&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;The harm of sharing any type of data typically comes from correlating the data to you—a unique individual—and adding it to a vast, historical, living profile of information about you. This happens in many ways, most of which are neither understood by consumers nor readily apparent to them. Location information, by definition, means “person X is/was at location Y.” It is by its nature perhaps the most sensitive of all types of personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way to keep location information safe from unintended third parties is to break the correlation, to “de-identify” the location data so that it’s no longer correlated to any individual person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common way that location data is associated with a unique individual is by using the “Advertising ID” on mobile phones. The good news is that there are ways to disable that identifier on both iOS and Android phones. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) created a helpful resource for resetting your “Advertising ID” on both Android/Google + iOS/Apple phones, “<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/how-disable-ad-id-tracking-ios-and-android-and-why-you-should-do-it-now">How to Disable Ad ID Tracking on iOS and Android, and Why You Should Do It Now</a>”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, since a large portion of the data sold through location data brokers is acquired in mobile apps, we always urge people to be selective about what apps they download, limit the permissions you give those apps when asked, and delete apps after you are done using them. It’s very challenging to completely avoid being tracked by location data brokers, but small steps on your own personal devices can reduce some of your risks.&nbsp;</p>
 What You can do as a Maker of Mobile Apps&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;At ISL, we believe that the onus shouldn’t be on people to keep themselves safe online, and real change can more effectively happen at the app developer level. It’s even more impactful when change happens at the platform level. If you’re a maker of technology, this section is especially for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLATFORM CHANGE:&nbsp; One thing Android could do immediately which would mitigate an entire sector of data brokers is to eliminate the ability for SDKs within apps to “see other apps installed”. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As an app maker, first and foremost, be sure to practice location information minimization:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Do you really need location information? Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. <a href="https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-3-me2b-alliance-validation-research-consumer-sensitivity-to-location-tracking-by-websites-and-mobile-apps/">Our research shows</a> that premature location detection is a significant turn off to users.&nbsp; 
 If you really do need location information, use the least precise level of location that will satisfy your genuine needs to provide the expected service to the user. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kbnna/anonymous-social-media-app-yik-yak-exposed-users-precise-locations">Here’s</a> a report of an app (Yik Yak) shockingly using location accuracy within feet. Be honest about what level of data you really need.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Do you just need a country?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Do you just need a zip code?&nbsp; 
 
 
 Precise location should be the exception not the rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Remember that whatever level of location information your app has access to, so do all of your integrated SDK partners. Are you monitoring their use of your users’ location? If not, you should be.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Next, be sure to practice Identification Minimization (<a href="https://me2ba.org/library/recommendation-attributes-of-safe-respectful-me2b-commitments/">Safe Attribute #3</a>). In the Yik Yak story above, the service purported to be anonymous, but—in addition to tracking location down to a foot-level—it was also uniquely identifying users. See our <a href="https://me2ba.org/library/recommendation-attributes-of-safe-respectful-me2b-commitments/">Attributes of Safe and Respectful Commitments</a> for more information on appropriate and proportional identification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other things you should do:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Conduct a privacy assessment to ensure that users can’t identify the location of other users through simple features.&nbsp; 
 If your service provides “local content” always conduct extra tests to ensure that someone’s exact location can’t be determined through quickly changing their location or sending other types of spoofed location data. If users can see local content assume that an adversary will try to use this to track someone without their permission and dox the location of the person behind the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p> CALL FOR PARTICIPATION <br>OASIS Value Stream Management Interoperability (VSMI) Technical Committee Charter</p>



<p>The charter for this TC is as follows.</p>



<p>Section 1: TC Charter</p>



<p>(1)(a) TC Name</p>



<p>Value Stream Management Interoperability (VSMI)</p>



<p>(1)(b) Statement of Purpose</p>



<p>Currently, the value stream management (VSM) industry is fractured by having a lack of ubiquitous language and multiple data formats across tools. This TC sets out to create a value stream management standard for interoperability which will allow broader adoption of value stream management. This TC will seek to identify overlaps and understand differences between various value stream implementations and when possible use existing works as a basis of further development.</p>



<p>The purpose of the Value Stream Management Interoperability (VSMI) TC is to define a value stream management protocol for sharing data across enterprise platforms.</p>



<p>The work will focus on:</p>



  Defining key component parts of value stream data  Enabling interoperability of value streams  Establishing good practice for value stream data architecture  Creating open standards for value stream management metrics  



<p>Business Benefits</p>



<p>The business benefit of this TC is to bring increased interoperability to existing value stream standards, tools, and best practices. Other opportunities include enhanced observability and auditability of waste, quality, security, and risk.</p>



<p>Potential Stakeholders that would benefit from being represented in this TC include:</p>



  Organizations managing diverse/heterogeneous Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)/DevOps toolchains  Organizations building SDLC/DevOps tools  Organizations creating and/or consuming a VSM tool(s) or platform  Cybersecurity regulators &amp; professionals  Organizations building VSM software and wanting interoperability between systems  Software engineering and design companies  Quality Management roles  ISO standardized organizations  Users of value stream mapping and management tools and platforms  



<p>(1)(c) Scope</p>



<p>The VSMI TC work is the development of value stream management data interchange standards, based on the needs identified by the VSMI TC Members. The Standards Track Work Product efforts will be related to improving existing information representations for codifying, analyzing, and sharing of value stream data.</p>



<p>In addition to Standards Track Work Products, the VSMI TC work products may include supporting documentation, open source tooling, and any other materials deemed necessary to encourage the adoption of the TC’s specifications.</p>



<p>(1)(d) Deliverables</p>



<p>The first deliverables for this TC are likely to include:</p>



  Differential analysis with existing works  Existing data format interoperability  Existing standards survey  Gap analysis  Outline of key components  Definition and attributes of key components  Privacy and regulatory concerns for various data formats  Glossary &amp; supporting resources  



<p>(1)(e) IPR Mode</p>



<p>Non-Assertion</p>



<p>(1)(f) Audience</p>



<p>The target audience for this TC include those listed below. Representatives from all levels and in any role are welcome.</p>

<p>Section 2: Additional Information</p>



<p>(2)(a) Identification of Similar Work</p>



<p>Value Stream Management Consortium:</p>



<p>A member association for enterprises and individuals working with value stream management practices and platforms. The VSMC’s purpose is to advance value stream-centric ways of working in technology teams to lead to higher performing organizations. The TC will complement the work of the VSMC by providing standards and enhancements to benefit the value stream community. VSMC staff will participate in the TC and VSMC organizations are invited to join as representatives of their companies as voting members of the TC.<br>(https://www.vsmconsortium.org/)</p>



<p>ISO 22468:2020 – Value stream management (VSM):</p>



<p>Focuses on the physical structure and symbology of a standard map. The TC is focused more centered on the digital value stream.</p>



<p>ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007 – Resource-Event-Agent (REA):</p>



<p>The Resource-Event-Agent (REA) model is an approach to conceptualizing the semantics of economic exchanges such as accounting transactions. The REA model is an ISO standard. Further exploration of this standard will be required to see how it maps to this TC.</p>



<p>Explore for applicability:</p>



  TOSCA – Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications  OSLC – Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration  SARIF – Static Analysis Results Interchange Format  



<p>(2)(b) First TC Meeting</p>



<p>The first TC meeting will be a virtual meeting held on 11 July 2022 at 15:00 UTC / 11:00 AM EDT / 8:00 AM PDT. The meeting will be hosted by Copado.</p>



<p>(2)(c) Ongoing Meeting Schedule</p>

<p>What is Value Stream Management?</p>



<p>Value Stream Management is the practice that observes and controls all activities in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) – from planning, building, validating, to delivering – to determine where work flow and output is constrained. Originating in manufacturing to eliminate variations in quality that pose life-safety risks, it has grown in applicability as software projects become more complex and critical to global economies.</p>



<p>What is Value Stream Mapping?</p>



<p>Value Stream Mapping is a collaborative process for defining the process by which something of value is created and delivered in response to a customer demand. Value Stream Mapping identifies the processes involved in the work as well as metrics on speed, quality, and load at each stage of work as well as for the entire process. Value Stream Mapping is the second key activity in the five steps of Lean.</p>



<p>What data is Value Stream Management concerned with?</p>



  Timing granularity (active time, value-added time)  Quality (% of work Complete and Accurate)  Roles involved  Tools involved  Artifacts created or touched  SDLC events  Work profile (type of work performed)  Value realization

<p>Committee Note now available</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce publication of “Emerging Compute Models: Recommendations and Sample Profile Version 1.0,” a Committee Note from the members of the OASIS Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) TC [1].</p>



<p>This document discusses use-cases for TOSCA in the scope of emergent compute models such as function-as-a-service (FaaS) computing, internet-of-things/edge computing, and high-performance computing (HPC).</p>



  Emergent compute models reflect the adoption of one or more hybrid forms of cloud computing, thereby embedding at least two combinations of compute models such as (a) function-as-a-service (FaaS) computing; (b) internet-of-things/edge computing; (c) high-performance computing (HPC). In the scope of the Emergent Compute ad-Hoc (ECAH), we explored the aforementioned compute models with the key objectives of exploring and/or prototyping TOSCA-based constructs and patterns for (1) serverless and FaaS-computing orchestration; (2) edge-computing and edge-based data pipelines orchestration; (3) high-performance computing orchestration. In the scope of the aforementioned activities, this deliverable offers details over:  A series of use-cases for TOSCA usage in the scope of any of the aforementioned emergent compute models;  Best practices and tools for the use of TOSCA;  A working profile example to the TOSCA Language which supports Emergent Compute Paradigms (e.g., FaaS);  A set of recommended extensions w.r.t. features enrichment of the current TOSCA notation, e.g., policies or trusted data-sharing and orchestration in such an ambient.  



<p>The Committee Note is available here:</p>

 [Edinburgh, 25th May 2022] – Zumo, the Edinburgh-based crypto wallet and payments platform, has announced the launch of Zumo Enterprise, its new B2B ‘Crypto-as-a-Service’ solution that enables companies to offer crypto products and services to their customers. 
<p>The first of its kind in the UK, Zumo Enterprise is the market’s only full-stack, embedded crypto solution. Zumo Enterprise allows fintechs and financial institutions to effortlessly embed crypto within their existing infrastructure, offering a fast, flexible, low-barrier and compliant route to market while opening up new revenue streams, attracting new customers and supporting customer retention. It follows on from ZumoKit, a beta product released last year to test out the proposition.</p>
<p>Zumo Enterprise has been created amidst growing demand for crypto products and services, with worldwide adoption jumping by over 880% last year. Businesses realise the scale of this opportunity, with 80% of respondents to a recent global Deloitte survey agreeing their respective industry will see new revenue streams from blockchain, digital assets and crypto solutions, and 73% believing their organisation will lose competitive advantage if it doesn’t adopt such solutions.</p>
<p>Importantly, by being compliant in the UK, Zumo Enterprise enables fintechs and financial institutions to fulfil their duty of care to customers, harnessing crypto solutions in a safe and secure manner. Zumo Enterprise also features an embedded ESG and net zero strategy.</p>
<p>Nick Jones, Co-Founder and CEO, Zumo, said: “Consumer preferences are changing. Digitalisation is accelerating. Amidst an increasingly competitive and fast-evolving financial landscape, the demand for new, alternative solutions is booming.”</p>
<p>“Zumo’s embedded crypto technology plugs seamlessly into fintechs’ and banks’ existing tech stacks, helping them to tap into this surging demand for digital assets. Zumo Enterprise offers a compliant, flexible solution that removes the need to deploy specialist teams or incur huge development costs. It will help forward-thinking financial institutions to meet the needs of both present and future customers.”</p>
<p>Available via either API (Application Programming Interface) or SDK (Software Development Kit), Zumo Enterprise’s white-label solution gives businesses a blockchain-agnostic suite of tools through which to enable customers to securely hold, buy, sell and send digital currencies, complete with wallets, exchange service, and managed onboarding and compliance. Zumo Enterprise’s customers can choose modules as required and benefit from direct access to Zumo’s team of industry experts.</p>
<p>Zumo Enterprise has been developed following the success of the B2C Zumo App, which offers consumers a secure, easy-to-use cryptocurrency wallet that allows anyone to buy, sell, store, send and spend cryptocurrencies alongside traditional British Pounds. Zumo App’s customer base has grown 25% month-on-month since the platform launched in August 2020.</p>
<p>The Zumo team will be attending Money20/20 Europe on 7-9th June 2022 in Amsterdam, and The FTT DeFi Summit on 12th July 2022 in London and is inviting the Fintech community to discover its crypto infrastructure.</p>

<p>Most in the identity and open banking world aren’t paying attention or actively involved in the various GAIN initiatives since the <a href="https://openid.net/2021/09/20/global-assured-identity-network-white-paper/">white paper was published last fall</a>. They are right to be skeptical. Technical and governance change, like any culture, happens relatively slowly. Standards are established, roles are defined, systems are built.</p>
<p>The people on social media and at the podium get all the attention, but that’s a bug, not a feature. Working Groups and POC Participants aren’t the bottom, they are the roots, the foundation, the source of progress. Change happens horizontally. But the people who are consistently and actively building standards are not easily distracted; one more small improvement, one more implementers draft, one more standard established.</p>
<p>The internet would like us to focus on what happened five minutes ago. The industry understands that what happens in five years is what matters. Focused, persistent community action is how systems change. Building on what’s built concretizes and enforces both technical (tools) standards and governance (rules).</p>
<p>GAIN is marked by a cross sector, crowd sourced, open, global due diligence. GAIN’s self organized participants are actively seeking evidence that disconfirms the GAIN hypothesis. They are at the IIW in California, the European Identity Conference in Berlin, the Open Banking Work Congress in Spain, Money 2020 in Amsterdam, at Identiverse in Denver and at the Open Identity Exchange Conference in London,</p>
<p>GAIN’s growing participants will keep talking. We’ll stay focused. We won’t get bored, because we’ve a lot to GAIN.</p>

<div class='wrap'>





<p>EIC 2022, held May 10-13 at the the Berlin Conference Center, had a strong ToIP presence, including Director of Strategic Engagements Judith Fleenor and Steering Committee members André Kudra (esatus), Bryn Robinson-Morgan (Mastercard), Christine Leong (Accenture), Drummond Reed (Avast), Mike Vesey (IDRamp), and Scott Perry (Schellman). Other ToIP members in attendance included Trinsic, IDunion, and Sezoo.</p>



<p>Our first collective takeaway was that identity conferences are back! This was the first full-scale EIC since 2019, and although still in hybrid form, in-person attendance was very strong. Vendor booths and conference sessions were quite busy, and there were four full tracks on content from midday Tuesday through Friday. “EIC was a wonderful opportunity to connect with colleagues old and new, with a shared mission to advance digital trust.” remarked Bryn “I was impressed by the interest in the ToIP stack and the recognition that to achieve interoperability on a global scale we must address both technology and governance issues.”</p>



<p>Our second major takeaway was that decentralized identity is a very hot topic. One of the four conference session tracks was devoted entirely to this new branch of the industry, and references to SSI and verifiable credentials were sprinkled throughout the keynotes. André noted: “Federated identity solutions are broadly used globally today and it’s great that there’s now such huge interest to infuse SSI to it. To ultimately arrive at a truly decentralized online identity world, embracing what’s already out there is inevitable.”</p>



<p>On that note, Judith spotted numerous examples of SSI terminology being “co-opted” to describe products and services that did not in fact follow SSI and ToIP design principles. This is both a good thing (because the speakers wanted to be associated with SSI) and a bad thing (because they are mis-using the terms).</p>



<p>A third major takeaway was that the world of federation wants to join the world of decentralization. One of the major announcements from the conference was the OpenID Foundation white paper entitled <a href="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/05/OIDF-Whitepaper_OpenID-for-Verifiable-Credentials_FINAL_2022-05-12.pdf">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>. To quote from <a href="https://openid.net/2022/05/12/openid-for-verifiable-credentials-whitepaper/">the OpenID website</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>The goal of this whitepaper is to inform and educate the readers about the work on the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) specifications family. It addresses use-cases referred to as Self-Sovereign Identity, Decentralized Identity, or User-Centric Identity.</p></blockquote>



<p>This theme was further reinforced by a series of sessions on <a href="https://gainforum.org/">GAIN, the Global Assured Identity Network</a>, whose original white paper described it as an OpenID “federation of federations” that aims to bring “roaming” to existing bank ID networks around the world. At EIC, GAIN was working hard to “broaden the tent”, inviting Judith to join their <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-gain-future-internet?utm_content=buffer3ccb4&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">final panel</a> with 11 different speakers talking about the GAIN vision of a globally interoperable network for high-value digital identity credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judith did a wonderful job speaking to how that vision aligns with ToIP’s mission while advocating that, while federation technologies like OpenID are fine for enterprise usage, true global interoperability can best be achieved with a network of networks based on the ToIP protocol stack. She summarized the benefits of using standardized protocols rather than technical API specifications as: “OIDC for the enterprise, ToIP for the Internet”.From a ToIP perspective, the highlight was our 40-minute panel called “The Stack, the Stack, the Stack: How ToIP is Enabling Internet-Scale Digital Trust”. Judith moderated the panel consisting of André, Bryn, Christine, and Drummond sitting in front of a full-screen image of the ToIP stack.</p>







<p>The session drew a packed audience, and this panel format proved to be a very effective way to share the ToIP vision. At the close of the panel, we were swamped with many more questions than we had time for. We spent the next 45 minutes outside the room talking with attendees about the ToIP stack, the ToIP Foundation, and how our solution to interoperability can be applied to the European Digital Identity Wallets initiative.</p>



<p>This strong interest in ToIP reflects our final major takeaway from the conference: the European Digital Identity Wallets initiative is generating intense interest in interoperability. Many EIC sessions touched on different facets of the interoperability questions facing the “toolbox teams” from each of the 27 EU member states working to develop their own digital wallets. Furthermore, these questions are not limited to technical interoperability—governance is also a major concern.</p>



<p>“The privacy-preserving and citizen-empowering advantages of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials are clearly what is driving the EU initiative,” said Governance Stack Working Group co-chair Scott Perry. “However much of their thinking on governance is still rooted in federation technologies, so this is an area where ToIP’s work on governance frameworks can really help.”</p>



<p>As a final highlight, Italian digital identity company <a href="https://monokee.com/en/homepage/">Monokee</a>, whose Solutions Architect Dr. Mattia Zago presented on “Hybrid Central/Decentralized Identity: Deployment strategies for SSI”, was impressed enough by the ToIP presence at EIC that by the end of the conference Monokee had joined as our newest Steering Committee member.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Joining the ToIP SC represents a significant milestone for me as a researcher and us as an identity company,” said Dr. Zago. “Seeing that the community is aligned with our view of a hybrid integration between federated enterprises’ services and decentralized identities further increases our motivation to pursue it. Indeed, we will keep pushing forward our identity orchestrator to provide seamless (and codeless) integration experiences for security engineers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Welcome Monokee!</p>

 From cold hard credentialing to warm fuzzy recognition Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Bryan&nbsp;Mathers</a><p>In this post, we want to explain what we talk about when we talk about Open Recognition. It builds on this <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">previous post</a>, and aims to move from the abstract to practicalities.</p><p>So let’s introduce four scenarios and begin by defining&nbsp;terms.</p> Scenarios <p>🎓 The first scenario is a student in an educational institution learning in a structured way for the sake of validation or certification. This is what is known as formal learning. It’s objective — ‘cold’ and ‘hard’ rather than ‘warm’ and ‘fuzzy’ to reference the image at the top of this post. The relationship being strengthened is between the individual and the institution. The interesting thing about a credential is not that you’ve got it, but the conversations you have and the doors it opens afterwards.</p><p>🎽 The second scenario is an athlete improving as the result of planned activities by their coach. This happens outside of an educational institution but nevertheless involves objectives and support towards defined goals. This is usually referred to as non-formal learning. While this can also be objectively credentialed, what begins to creep in is the importance of recognition. The relationship between the coach and athlete is being strengthened through this recognition. The interesting thing about achieving a personal best is not the time attained but the conversations it leads to and the confidence it inspires.</p><p>🌱 A third scenario is someone learning to identify and care for plants in the context of a family out in their garden at the weekend. They don’t have any ‘objectives’ or desire to achieve something specific, but are anyway acquiring knowledge, skills, and understanding. This is often labelled informal learning. While it might feel weird to credential this kind of learning, we recognise it all of the time. For example, we might recognise a nascent interest or skill, buying a young person their own gardening gloves to encourage them. The relationship between the experienced and novice gardener is strengthened by the recognition of an interest. The interesting thing about the gift of gardening gloves is not the gift itself but the conversations it provokes and path it sets someone&nbsp;on.</p><p>🎵 The fourth scenario is someone joining a Community of Practice relating to their interest in music technology. They learn things which help broaden and deepen their existing understanding, and co-create knowledge with others. What they learn may be recognised through the use of badges. This is commonly described as open learning. Relationships between community members are being strengthened by the exchanging of badges, making them feel ‘warm’ and ‘fuzzy’. The interesting thing about a recognition badge is not the badge itself but the conversations that happen as a result, and the strengthening of community relationships.</p><p>Although we’ve separated out different types of learning above, this isn’t to say that these are the only kinds of learning possible, nor that they happen individually and exclusively. For example, many university courses have elements of open learning as well. Likewise, non-formal learning and informal learning often go hand-in-hand.</p> Conclusion <p>We need all to embrace all kinds of learning and develop ways of recognising it in others. We need to develop methods that allow us to embrace our whole self, reinforce positive behaviours in our communities, encourage lifelong learning, and which contribute to the good of&nbsp;society.</p><p>The Wikipedia community’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars">barnstars</a>, which they’ve been issuing for almost 20 years at this point, are a great example. So are the Fedora Project’s <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/about">badges</a>, which have been around almost a decade as well. These can be seen as credentials, but they’re better seen as recognition.</p><p>It’s our hope that individuals, groups, families, communities, organisations, and institutions come to realise that there is more to life than credentialing. Yes, we need credentials. But we can paint a much richer picture of ourselves and our communities by embracing recognition of all different forms of learning. As <a href="https://www.learningfutures.eu/2020/03/competency-badges-the-tail-wagging-the-dog/">Serge Ravet</a> has said, we need to be recognising practices as much as recognising competencies.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">Open Recognition is for every type of learning</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Contrast Security, JFrog, Sonar, Snyk, and Others Extend Functionality of Interoperability Standard for Software Analysis Tools</p> 


<p>1 June 2022 — Key cybersecurity companies from across the globe are joining OASIS Open to advance the newest version of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/sarif">Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)</a> interoperability standard for detecting software defects and vulnerabilities. In today’s announcement, Contrast Security, JFrog, Sonar, and Snyk became the newest Sponsors of the SARIF Technical Committee (TC) alongside Cryptsoft, GrammaTech, and Microsoft. Other members of the SARIF TC include Bank of America, CIRCL, ForAllSecure, Micro Focus, MITRE, Northrop Grumman, sFractal Consulting, Veracode, and WhiteSource.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Software developers use a variety of analysis tools to assess the quality of their programs. These tools report results which can indicate problems related to program qualities such as correctness, security, performance, compliance with contractual or legal requirements, compliance with stylistic standards, understandability, and maintainability. To form an overall picture of program quality, developers often need to aggregate the results produced by all of these tools. SARIF provides a common output format for software analysis tools that lets developers and teams understand, interact with, and manage the results produced by all their tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The next major version of SARIF will expand our ability to aggregate data and detect vulnerabilities in some exciting new ways. We look forward to the contributions of the companies that are joining now, and we welcome others,” said OASIS SARIF TC co-chairs, Luke Cartey of Microsoft and David Keaton.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SARIF TC brings together major software companies, cybersecurity providers, government, security orchestration specialists, programmers, and consultants. Participation in the TC is open to all companies, nonprofit groups, governments, academic institutions, and individuals through membership in OASIS. As with all OASIS projects, archives of the Committee’s work are accessible to both members and non-members alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support for SARIF&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contrast Security<br><br>“It is no surprise that SARIF has emerged as the industry standard for communicating vulnerabilities. The Contrast Security team is excited to join the SARIF Technical Committee and to share our experience and expertise in interactive testing, route intelligence, and software instrumentation to make SARIF an even more powerful way to enable communication and transparency around software security. While the Contrast Secure Code Platform natively supports SARIF, we’re looking forward to working with other leaders in the industry to find more innovative ways to help developers code more securely.”</p>



<p>– Jeff Williams, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Contrast Security</p>



<p>JFrog<br><br>“The recent rise in volume and sophistication of open-source software supply chain attacks has forced developers and DevOps teams to scramble for information sources and solutions they can trust. As a recognized CVE naming authority with a qualified security research team, JFrog welcomes the opportunity to share our expertise and best practices with SARIF to better enable developers with a single source of truth for software security concerns.”</p>



<p>– Stephen Chin, VP of Developer Relations, JFrog&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hyperledger Ursa&nbsp;is a shared cryptographic library used to avoid duplicating cryptographic related code. The library is an opt-in repository (for Hyperledger and non Hyperledger projects) to place and use crypto.</p>



<p>Broad deployment of digital identity will depend on strong security to deliver the high levels of assurance required in many consumer transactions with their governments, their financial institutions, and other trusted organisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leading advancements in decentralized identity, several originating in Canada, rely on the Hyperledger family of technologies. As such, Hyperledger Ursa is a central component depended upon to provide the security overlay for decentralized identity.</p>



<p>Rooted in a “trust but verify” mindset, several Canadian public sector entities and <a href="https://www.interac.ca/en/">Interac</a> (Canada’s interbank network) sponsored a project at the <a href="https://idlab.org">Digital Identity Laboratory of Canada</a> (IDLab) to perform a security and cryptography code review of Hyperledger Ursa&nbsp; (full report is available <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/URSA-IDLab-Code-Review.pdf">here</a>).</p>



<p>Those commissioning this project deemed it important to have an arms-length third party assessment of this foundational component of the Hyperledger family to understand the risks (if any) being assumed with the&nbsp; deployment and use of Hyperledger-base technology in the domain of decentralized identity.</p>



<p>Overview of Hyperledger Ursa&nbsp; library code review scope:</p>



<p>A code review that examined:&nbsp;</p>



  Entry points  Coding standards  Data storage and transfer  APIs and their security  Third party library usage  Programming language issue  Logic flaws  



<p>Cryptography best practices including examination of:</p>



  Cryptography and key management  Entropy  Best practice cryptography usage  



<p>The review did not include an assessment of the cryptographic algorithms foundation themselves, or their suitability. Examination was limited to assessment of sound implementation within Ursa.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/tree/v0.3.7">code</a> review and the findings documented, the IDLab team worked closely with key Ursa contributors and the Hyperledger Foundation community to review and assess results. As a result, a number of enhancements were identified to address report findings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the exercise concluded that Ursa provides a solid security footing for projects dependent on the Hyperledger family of technologies applicable to digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Review findings summary:</p>



<p>In general, the review noted a few relatively minor security defects, some implementation guidance, and some general observations for library improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These can be briefly described as follows:</p>



  Minor build issues  Cautions to consider when building, primarily with third party libraries or integrations  Minor issues related to lack of support for message augmentation  Minor issues related to subgroup validation  An issue related to public key validation

<p>Revue de code Hyperledger Ursa</p>



<p>Hyperledger Ursa est une librairie cryptographique partagée utilisée pour éviter la duplication du code lié à la cryptographie. La librairie est un répertoire opt-in (pour les projets Hyperledger et ceux qui ne le sont pas) pour placer et utiliser la cryptographie.</p>



<p>Le déploiement à grande échelle de l’identité numérique dépendra d’une forte sécurité afin de fournir les niveaux d’assurance élevés requis dans de nombreuses transactions des consommateurs avec leurs gouvernements, leurs institutions financières et d’autres organisations de confiance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Les principales avancées en matière d’identité décentralisée, dont plusieurs proviennent du Canada, reposent sur la famille de technologies Hyperledger. En tant que tel, Hyperledger Ursa est un composant central sur lequel on compte pour fournir la couche de sécurité pour l’identité décentralisée.</p>



<p>Dans un esprit «de confiance et de vérification» (en anglais, trust but verify), plusieurs entités du secteur public canadien et Interac (le réseau interbancaire du Canada) ont parrainé un projet au Laboratoire d’identité numérique du Canada (IDLab) pour effectuer une revue de code de sécurité et de cryptographie d’Hyperledger Ursa (le rapport complet est disponible ici, en anglais seulement).</p>



<p>Les initiateurs de ce projet ont estimé qu’il était important d’avoir une évaluation indépendante par un tiers de ce composant fondamental de la famille Hyperledger pour comprendre les risques (s’il y en a) assumés avec le déploiement et l’utilisation de la technologie basée sur Hyperledger dans le domaine de l’identité décentralisée.</p>



<p>Aperçu de la portée de la revue de code de la librairie Hyperledger Ursa :</p>



  Une revue de code qui a examiné :&nbsp;  Les points d’entrée  Les standards de programmation  Stockage et transfert de données  Les interfaces API et leur sécurité  Utilisation de librairies de tiers  Problèmes de langage de programmation  Défauts de logique    Les meilleures pratiques en matière de cryptographie, y compris l’examen :  De la cryptographie et la gestion des clés  De l’entropie  Des meilleures pratiques en matière d’utilisation de la cryptographie    



<p>L’examen n’a pas inclus une évaluation de la fondation des algorithmes cryptographiques eux-mêmes, ni de leur aptitude. L’examen s’est limité à l’évaluation de la bonne mise en place dans Ursa.</p>



<p>Après l’examen du <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/tree/v0.3.7">code</a> et la documentation des résultats, l’équipe d’IDLab a travaillé en étroite collaboration avec les principaux contributeurs d’Ursa et les membres de la communauté de l’Hyperledger Foundation pour examiner et évaluer les résultats. En conséquence, un certain nombre d’améliorations ont été identifiées pour répondre aux conclusions du rapport.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimement, l’exercice a conclu qu’Ursa fournit une base de sécurité solide pour les projets qui dépendent de la famille de technologies Hyperledger applicables à l’identité numérique.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Résumé des conclusions de l’examen :</p>



<p>En général, l’examen a relevé quelques défauts de sécurité relativement mineurs, quelques conseils de mise en place, et quelques observations générales pour l’amélioration de la librairie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celles-ci peuvent être brièvement décrites comme suit :</p>



  Problèmes mineurs de construction  Précautions à prendre lors de la construction, principalement avec des librairies ou des intégrations de tiers  Problèmes mineurs liés à l’absence de prise en charge de l’augmentation des messages  Problèmes mineurs liés à la validation des sous-groupes  Un problème lié à la validation des clés publiques

<p><a href="https://viaheadline.xyz">Headline</a> takes a Web3 approach to transform subscription-based content publishing, allowing authors to connect directly with their readers without the constraints of third-party platforms. The team at<a href="https://www.unlock-protocol.com"> Unlock</a>, an NFT-based access protocol, built with Ceramic to give creators control over both their content and who can access it. </p><p>If you're an author ready to move your publication to a fully decentralized stack, or a reader looking to find &amp; subscribe to Web3-native content, visit<a href="https://viaheadline.xyz"> viaheadline.xyz</a> to get started.</p> The Platform Problem <p>Creators rely on publishing platforms to manage and access their audience, but legacy online publishing platforms frequently <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/substacks-new-platform-play?s=r">act in their own self-interest</a>—subjecting creators to platform fees and other constraints that can significantly limit their profit and reach. These platforms also own the relationships between creators and their communities, allowing them to decide which authors and content are promoted, demoted or removed.</p><p>It’s in the financial interest of publishing platforms to bring as many creators and users onto their sites as possible and to keep them actively engaged. This leads to the attention economies we’ve seen emerge that use algorithmic promotion of content that’s often based on shock, outrage or conflict. Content platforms aim to extract as much rent from creators as possible, leaving creators with little option but to adapt their content to fit the algorithms’ parameters in order to grow their reach, audience and revenue. To reverse this trend toward increasingly reactionary content, the economic model has to be rewritten.</p> Decentralizing Publishing <p>With Headline, creators now have access to an easy-to-use publishing system that allows them to retain ownership of their content and audience. Headline decentralizes content publication and access, putting creators and their communities first as opposed to the platform’s profits. Creators are not subjected to arbitrary content platform fees on Headline and they can escape the economics that have made Web2 platforms havens for clickbait. This lets creators get back to publishing the content they want to make and that their communities are interested in reading.</p> Newsletters That Aren't "Substuck" <p>The team recently launched Unlock Protocol, allowing creators to monetize their content with a few lines of code. The Unlock team built an NFT-based system to fully decentralize control of memberships to creators, and the team is now taking the vision of a sovereign creator economy one step further by supporting creators in removing platform middlemen. Headline enables a creator economy business model that lets creators regain control over their work and connect directly to their audience without outside interference—such as monetizing their content flexibly through subscriptions.</p><p>Headline is focused on supporting newsletter-style publications. When authors publish, the user newsletters will be delivered to readers as normal, but the author's content will be their own. By enabling creators to have true ownership of their content, they'll have the flexibility to publish what they want on their own terms.</p><p>On the Web3 publishing platform, authors are able to escape the walled gardens of Web2 to become un-Substuck and instead produce rich content that their audiences are willing and eager to pay for. Headline gives creators direct control and ownership over their content, letting them monetize on their own terms. The Unlock team believes this new peer-to-peer model will open the door for a new wave of journalistic integrity, leading to stronger and more enriching communities over time.</p> Storing Content on Ceramic <p>Platforms such as Headline were not previously possible using traditional technologies. With the invention of decentralized solutions, such as Ceramic, it's now possible for users to create, own and store their own data rather than being forced to trust a third party on their behalf. Headline combines Unlock's decentralized access control system with Ceramic's decentralized data network to bring power back to creators and away from platforms. When a creator uploads content to Headline, it is encrypted via Lit Protocol and stored on IPFS, with all of the associated metadata and publication data live in a separate file corresponding to each content piece, all stored on Ceramic.</p><p>Creators can see all the content they're actively working on and have published, while readers have a separate feed of only published content. Headline pulls from the publication data and IPFS URI, stored on Ceramic, to locate and identify published and unpublished content. These are managed in two decentralized registries, the ArticleRegistry and PublishRegistry. Lit Protocol is used to access and decrypt the content for display in the feeds. Unlock’s NFT-gating ensures that only viewers who hold the related NFT in their wallet can see a creator’s content.</p><p>Decentralized file storage ensures that no third-party entity (see: publishing platform) has the ability to modify, censor, promote or demote creator content. Instead, creators have autonomy over their content, which is only accessible to the users who hold the respective Unlock NFTs in their wallets. This means that newsletters published with Headline go from author to reader, without a middleman taking a service fee or exerting control over what gets published.<br></p><p>Because the content is stored on Ceramic’s decentralized network, it can be accessed and built on by other applications and services without integration with or permission from Headline. This creates content composability for Web3 applications. Headline's code is open-source, guaranteeing that the interests of content creators and their communities are the only interests served.</p> What's next for Headline? <p>The first version of Headline enables creators to publish their content to the web and to subscribers via email. Readers can now go to the site and browse authors, subscribe to their content, and begin reading.</p><p>If you're an author ready to use this new standard for content publishing, visit<a href="https://viaheadline.xyz"> viaheadline.xyz</a> to get started!</p> <p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Documentation</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

<p></p>







<p>Understanding the decentralized identity (DCI) market can be challenging. Inspiring C-level decision makers and IT executives to adopt decentralized identity technology is even more difficult. Current research publications provide limited insight with inconsistent ideas and terminology. Anyone interested in DCI adoption can quickly get lost in an ocean of information that raises more questions than answers. What is the solution? Decentralized ID, Self-sovereign ID, Blockchain ID, Web 3.0 ID, Personal ID, Verifiable Credentials, DID or are they all the same thing? Is the technology production-ready or a next-generation innovation to be considered in the future?&nbsp;</p>



<p>After spending a great deal of time working with enterprise C-level teams on complex digital identity problems, one thing seems clear. When it comes to decentralized identity solutions, many business sponsors do not yet understand how DCI can provide practical answers to immediate frontline business problems. This climate creates the impression that decentralized identity is interesting but not ready for prime time adoption.</p>



 Business leaders want to know 



<p>Business leaders want to know:&nbsp;</p>



  How can I use decentralization to make identity management easy to deploy and operate?&nbsp;  Is it possible to add new features and business requirements without investing in long, expensive projects?&nbsp;  How do I adapt this new technology without re-platforming every few years?&nbsp;  Is it possible to enable decentralized identity with the systems I have to grow it at a speed and cost I can afford?  



<p>Prominent decentralized identity initiatives are often presented as pilots or innovation projects. Popular decentralized identity community discussions prioritize solving large social problems over business solutions that drive mass adoption. Understandable for a new bleeding edge technology, but the good news is DCI technology is ready for mainstream adoption now. With careful listening, collaboration and education, we can dispel misunderstanding and help business sponsors understand that decentralized identity is the best possible solution for problems they have today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most C-level executives do not understand the complexities of SAML or OIDC, but they do understand that solutions using these protocols help solve their business problems. We need decentralized identity to reach that same level of understanding in terms of reliability, comfort, and adoption.&nbsp;</p>



 Decentralized Identity needs to become ID 



<p>Shifting the conversation to the perspective of people who actually buy technology is an effective way to speed up adoption. Business leaders need proof of value, battle testing, and technical maturity. Decentralization will prevail based on measurable business results. DCI is not in battle with centralized systems; it is simply a better business solution for modern problems.</p>



<p>Focusing on familiar business performance indicators goes a long way in moving DCI out of the innovation lab and into mainstream adoption. Does decentralized identity help me save or make money? Is it more expensive than what I have today? When a business spends millions per year on centralized SSO and learns how decentralized identity based authentication can solve the same problem with stronger protection at less cost. That business will find value and interest in DCI adoption.</p>



<p>Ultimately, decentralized identity needs to become digital ID in the minds of business leaders. Trust architecture needs to be easy to understand and use. Businesses do not have time to navigate the ideology and technical complexities. They need education that speaks directly to their business problems today. Trust Over IP (TOIP) <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/our-work/deliverables/">models, guides,and specifications</a> are powerful business tools to help drive learning, transformation and adoption. You can use the growing list of free information published on the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/our-work/deliverables/">TOIP Deliverables page</a> to help educate and transform your organization through DCI.</p>



 Perception is reality 



<p>A few common misunderstandings that come up in our business adoption conversations include:</p>



  Decentralized identity is not just a solution for social issues, it is pain relief for front line business problems. Decentralized identity will provide superior results if you need Zero Trust, Password elimination or fraud prevention.  Decentralized identity does not equal loss of control. It is a more effective way to manage and protect digital business.  Decentralized identity adoption does not require re-platforming and heavy investment in line with past ID platforms. We can quickly deploy it with incremental adoption and easily combine it with all other ID services.  Decentralized identity governance complements existing IT operation models and standards. It does not require a total change to current procedures.  Decentralized identity service management does not require significant HR changes, custom development skills, or advanced technology resources. Existing IT teams can easily deploy and operate DCI systems with the people they have today.  



<p>That all sounds simple enough to explain, but how do you make it happen? Business sponsors need evidence to justify the investment. They need to see it in action. Our next post will focus on how we help overcome decentralized identity adoption through <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202203/time-to-rethink-your-identity-management-strategy">decentralized orchestration</a>.

  <p>One of the goals in our current <a href="https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/idunion/">FFG-funded project IDunion</a> was to develop a framework for managing different data models of Covid19 Credentials. In the course of our project we implemented this functionality through the Semantic Overlay Architecture (SOyA ) and this blogposts provides an introduction to this new technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today’s data exists in a plethora of encodings, syntax, and semantics, requiring stakeholders to spend tremendous resources to enable interoperability and exchange. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a W3C recommendation emerging as a robust framework to address these challenges. However, many consider RDF to have a high barrier of entry for developers, unlike mainstream data structures, e.g., JSON or YML. Further, the tool support is still relatively limited, hindering wider adoption. Alternative approaches for supporting data interoperability have been proposed, such as OCA, DLite, and Layered Schemas. However, these approaches do not fully utilize the available open standards, reducing such approaches’ effectiveness. To help address this issue, we propose the Semantic Overlay Architecture (SOyA), a lightweight RDF-based approach for data interoperability and exchange. SOyA facilitates core functionalities for data interoperability and exchange while reducing the barrier of RDF adoption to the minimum. We evaluated the feasibility of our approach for vaccination data exchange scenario with promising results.<br>
(The previous paragraph is the abstract of a paper submitted to the Semantics 2022 conference – <a href="https://2022-eu.semantics.cc/">https://2022-eu.semantics.cc/</a>. After the conference (13.-15.September in Vienna) we will link to the full paper here.)</p>
<p>The current implementation of SOyA compromises of the following building blocks and the picture below depicts typical tasks:</p>
 
 Command line tool: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/soya-cli">soya-cli</a> 
 Library to integrate SOyA in your project: <a href="https://github.com/OwnYourData/soya/tree/main/lib">soya-js</a> 
 Repository to host SOyA structures: <a href="https://soya.ownyourdata.eu">soya-repo</a> 
 
  
    
  <p>We have documented the functionality of SOyA in a W3C-conform Speciciation (https://ownyourdata.github.io/soya/) and the full source code is available under the MIT License on Github (https://github.com/OwnYourData/soya/). Examples and an introduction how to use SOyA is available in a dedicated Tutorial we are developing right now here: https://github.com/OwnYourData/soya/blob/main/tutorial/README.md</p>

  FTC’s new policy statement clarifies provisions in COPPA, ensuring children have access to educational tools without their data being used for other commercial purposes.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>On May 19, 2022, The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) revealed that they are “committed to ensuring that educational technology tools and their attendant benefits do not become an excuse to ignore critical privacy protections for children.” Specifically, the FTC will be more closely monitoring all companies covered by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), with particular attention to ed tech, to ensure that children have access to educational tools without being subject to surveillance capitalism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the meeting, many FTC Commissioners indicated that ensuring children’s online privacy is one of the FTC’s top priorities. FTC Commissioner Noah Joshua Phillips and Commissioner Christine Wilson encouraged the commission to prioritize further work on the COPPA rulemaking process that they <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/request-public-comment-federal-trade-commissions-implementation-childrens-online-privacy-protection-0">started three years ago</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Policy%20Statement%20of%20the%20Federal%20Trade%20Commission%20on%20Education%20Technology.pdf">Policy Statement on Education Technology and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act</a> passed by unanimous vote. &nbsp;</p>
 The FTC issued a new policy statement to clarify existing provisions in COPPA that often go overlooked. 
<p>FTC Chair Lina Khan emphasized that, while COPPA is known primarily for its notice and consent provisions, companies covered under COPPA should be on notice to comply with the provisions in COPPA that govern the collection, use, retention, and security of the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are the key points from the FTC’s Policy Statement:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mandatory Data Collection Practices are Prohibited for Children’s Data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>COPPA-covered companies, including ed tech, may not require data collection (from the child) as a condition of the child’s ability to participate in the ed tech activity. “For example, if an ed tech provider does not reasonably need to be able to email students, it cannot condition the student’s access to schoolwork on students providing their email addresses.” COPPA-covered companies cannot collect any more data than is “reasonably necessary,” which prohibits the overcollection of data and establishes the key principle of data minimization. Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter asserted that COPPA provides the strongest data minimization law in the US, but it has not been fully enforced… yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are Strict Limitations on the Use of Children’s Data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ed Tech Companies may only use children’s information for providing the education service(s). Children’s data may not be used for any commercial purposes, including advertising and marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children’s Data may not be retained for “longer than reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ed Tech Companies’ retention practices must be reasonable relative to the service being provided and the purpose for which the data was collected. Children’s data cannot be stored or retained for an indefinite duration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>COPPA-covered Companies must take reasonable security measures when maintaining Children’s data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, the FTC mentioned that, “even absent a breach, Ed Tech providers violate COPPA if they lack reasonable security.”</p>
<p>At the end of the policy statement, the FTC warns “going forward, the Commission will closely scrutinize the providers of these services and will not hesitate to act where providers fail to meet their legal obligations with respect to children’s privacy.”&nbsp;</p>
 A Step in the right direction&nbsp; 
<p>This policy is a welcome move from the FTC. Last year we published two in-depth K12 ed tech research papers that highlight how <a href="https://me2ba.org/school-mobile-apps-student-data-sharing-behavior/">ed tech routinely shares kids’ data with advertisers and advertising networks</a>. In <a href="https://me2ba.org/spotlight-report-4-me2b-alliance-product-testing-report-deeper-look-at-k-12-school-utility-apps-uncovers-global-advertising-company-from-cbs-viacom-unexpected-security-risks/">Spotlight Report #4</a>, we highlight one ad-supported platform in particular: MaxPreps (owned by ViacomCBS), which is included in several Blackboard school apps. MaxPreps continues to show behavioral (retargeting) ads to student users of these school apps as of the time of this writing (see this page from the MaxPreps site which includes retargeting ads: <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/athlete/emily-turpin/TqYpSxCoEeOZ5AAmVebBJg/default.htm">Emily Turpin | PCA, Christiansburg, VA | MaxPreps</a>), even though we flagged this problematic service for the FTC back in December of 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya noted in a tweet following the vote that the free apps that students are more likely to use <a href="https://twitter.com/BedoyaFTC/status/1527679868393213954">“collect much more data than paid apps”. </a> Which illustrates a key problem we’ve seen in our current US-wide benchmark: schools routinely endorse or mandate student use of off-the-shelf free apps or web services. These services don’t have contractual agreements with the schools regarding student data usage, nor are they properly audited for student data sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of MaxPreps, school athletic coaches can enter into relationships with the service on behalf of the school. This raises concerns about appropriate consent, in addition to the sharing of student data with countless advertising networks. Thus, it is crucial that these service providers comply with every aspect of COPPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 More work to be done&nbsp; 
<p>There is more work to be done on the COPPA front. There are currently two proposed revisions to COPPA, one in the Senate and one in the House. Both of these address much needed updates to COPPA, and we’ll be publishing more details about them in future posts.</p>

	<p></p>
<p>We are excited to announce the Me2B Alliance is now Internet Safety Labs. We’ve changed our name but not our core mission.</p>
<p>Here’s our new pitch.</p>
<p>We are Internet Safety Labs, and we’re on a mission to make technology safe for everyone.</p>
<p>We’re a nonprofit that creates safety standards for connected tech of all kinds and measures how safe it is.</p>
<p>Historically, almost every new technology and media sees the emergence of safety standards following soon after its commercialization. (E.g. telephones, automobiles, radio, TV.) Except the internet. Weird.</p>
<p>In fact, we don’t even have agreement about what&nbsp;safety&nbsp;is when using connected tech. The world’s early efforts have been focused on “privacy,” just one dimension of personal and societal safety. We need more. We can do better.</p>
<p>That’s where Internet Safety Labs comes in. For example, we’ve recently published our first <a href="https://me2ba.org/safetechspec/">Internet Safety Standard for websites and mobile apps</a>. It’s a “minimal viable product” (MVP) specification—safety table-stakes, so to speak. It focuses on unavoidable, programmatic harms that exist mainly in the data flow and in the UX (user experience) of connected tech. We’ve developed a practical throughline from ethical principles around harm and safety to objectively measurable tests. </p>
<p>We don’t measure the behavior of companies. We measure the behavior of technology.</p>
<p>Changing our name doesn’t change the work that we’re doing. We continue to:</p>
 
 Create open safety standards for the internet. 
 Perform public safety research, with a current focus on:
 
 K12 EdTech, 
 Data brokers, and 
 Dangling Domains 
 
 
 Provide auditing services for businesses’ websites and mobile apps. 
 
 Why did we change our name? 
<p>We wanted our name to more closely reflect our mission and our work: setting the standard for connected tech safety and performing independent testing &amp; research on connected technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you’re as excited as we are and find our new name more meaningful and straightforward. We remain unrelentingly on the side of Me-s in both our Safety Standard and our product testing and research. For those new to terminology like “Me-s” and other shorthand we use, see our glossary <a href="https://me2ba.org/library/glossary/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 Will you still be a member? 
<p>Our standards work will continue to be open to the public.&nbsp; In fact, we’re making it even easier for interested parties to participate in standards by removing the membership requirement. We’ll always be positioned at the nexus between Me-s and B-s, with continued focus on the nature and dynamics of the Me2B Relationship. Me-s and B-s are inseparably the yin and yang of the Me2B relationship. Our standards and testing are always grounded in the safety and sensibilities of Me-s, yet simultaneously designed to help B-s build safer, better technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the past year and half, we’ve been operating as a membership organization. Thanks to all who have joined in membership! Starting now, we’re removing the membership barrier for participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We currently have two Working Groups (WGs): the Respectful Tech Spec WG and the Policy and Legal WG. Going forward, there are a few structural changes:&nbsp;</p>
 
 We’re changing the name of WGs to “Panels”:&nbsp;
 
 The Respectful Tech Spec WG will be the first of several Safety Standard Panels (SSPs).&nbsp; 
 The PALs WG will be the Policy and Legal Advisory Panel (sadly, a less charming acronym: PLAP). 
 
 
 Participation will require application, approval, and agreeing to updated policies, like the previous membership process, but without a fee.&nbsp; 
 Panels will still be consensus-driven with voting, identical to current WG behavior.&nbsp; 
 Panels will be supported by Internet Safety Labs (ISL) staff, rather than by volunteer chairs. A minimum of two staff members will be assigned to each panel.  
 We’ll no longer have elected Me- and B- board members.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>You can read the revised Operating Procedures <a href="https://me2ba.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/operating-proceduresv2.0-20220525.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;We’ll be reaching out to all members when the new website is available to transition you to panel participant status.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 What’s happening with “Me2B”? 
<p>Me2B has always been—and will continue to be—shorthand for our overarching ethos. In contrast to “B2C”, Me2B conveys ideas of consumer empowerment and agency while in a Me2B Relationship. This agency must go beyond privacy concerns. The recognition and naming of the Me2B Relationship (especially digital Me2B relationships) remains a crucial lens for our ethical foundation, the <a href="https://me2ba.org/flash-guide-3-the-me2b-rules-of-engagement-our-ethical-foundation/">Me2B Rules of Engagement</a>. All of the tests in our safety standard map back to one or more Me2B Rule of Engagement, and it will always be our ethical north star.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the context of the Me2B relationship and changing lifecycle over time is a crucial (and previously missing) framework that allows us to more precisely measure consumer safety in connected technologies. It informs all of our work, from our safety standards to our product testing So Me2B isn’t going away and will always be a part of our vernacular.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Forging the path of internet safety 
<p>As California and the EU increasingly turn their focus to monitoring and enforcing their regulation of technology behavior, we’re ready to provide support. We’re excited about our future as Internet Safety Labs, and leading the way toward measuring safety in connected tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 The 5 W’s of Greenpeace International’s Web Communications <p>We’ve been working with the Greenpeace International (GPI) web strategist and Story and Communications department* on a strategic initiative to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/communicating-with-intention-b3017ca81f38">Communicate with Intention</a>.</p><blockquote>“We will be able to communicate with intention once we’ve used data and journey mapping to clarify what our intentions actually are. The final piece of this bit of work is to help guide stakeholders in developing a project plan for content development. We also want to empower Greenpeace Communication staff to be creative!”</blockquote><p>After loads of research over the past months, and the production of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">individual resources</a>, processes and guides, we’re now pulling everything together into the 5 W’s (which is actually 5 Ws and an H) of the Greenpeace International website.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Why: A Strategy to Educate &amp;&nbsp;Engage <p>It might seem simple, but being laser focused on what your web presence is trying to do is a result of careful thought and planning. You’ll need to interview multiple stakeholders including users or volunteers, staff in various departments, people who know the history of your organisation and experts in your industry. You will want to think carefully about your organisational mission and how that mission becomes actionable.</p><p>Talking to people will help you determine what the end goal of your communications need to be in order to build community and capacity for your organisation. A communication strategy needs to include all of these voices if it’s going to&nbsp;work!</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>The focus of the Greenpeace International website is to educate and engage so that people are empowered to take action on behalf of our planet. It should tell the global story of the organisation, provide and help website visitors find resources they need to facilitate change in their own lives and communities.</p><p>These terms are cyclical in nature meaning that the content should do both. Sometimes GPI is educating first and engaging second, other times it is engaging first and educating second. It all depends on the goals of the campaign and the specific piece of&nbsp;content.</p>Example from Greenpeace Africa on Instagram<p>After running some workshops and speaking with folks from the Story and Comms team, we put together <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BxTDldWyBPPlpVkc4OEGdLeSSJP2Ozht64Nu9dflWAA/edit#slide=id.gf0f6e4c98f_0_129">this “Educate and Engage” deck</a> to help campaigners, programme designers and everyone else understand exactly what these terms mean in the context of Greenpeace International.</p> Who: A Unique&nbsp;Audience <p>You’ve probably heard the phrase “Everyone is not a target audience”. Well, it’s true. You want to craft your communication to resonate with people it will resonate with. If people don’t care about your message, they won’t take action on behalf of&nbsp;it.</p>Audience Ikigai for GPI cc-by WAO (<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai/">make your&nbsp;own!</a>)<p>Greenpeace International is a multi-faceted organisation with millions of people it its diverse and widespread audience. After careful research and thinking around who exactly Greenpeace International should optimise for, we’ve pulled together some <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oYO8L9Rj-R40tOvUlk5IyC-3XnSR3LaLb10nXHE3aG4/edit#slide=id.g10866ddbf01_0_0">best practices for communicating with the desired audience</a>.</p><p>This audience is young, urban, women from the Global South, with English as the common language. Our best practices slide deck references the research as to why this is the desired audience, and you can read more about audience in our post on <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">the Audience&nbsp;Ikigai</a>.</p> How: A Bold, Positive &amp; Factual&nbsp;Tone <p>Personality of a brand comes through the words we use. A tone is essentially an extension of a brand personality. Some organisations are more funny or serious in their communications. Others are sarcastic or respectful. There are diplomatic tones, enthusiastic tones, matter-of-fact, outraged, sassy… We can create endless nuanced lists about the way communications are understood. For many organisations, there are cultural differences to be considered both amongst the audience as well as the staff. Hey, communicating is&nbsp;hard!</p><p>A great way to figure out the tone for your web presence is to ask stakeholders and community members what tones resonate the most for them. Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale">Likert scale</a> to separate binaries (e.g. more funny or more serious) can help you hit the right&nbsp;mix.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>The website tone should be bold, but seeped in positivity and factuality — a tone that aligns with advice from the GPI Story Team. Greenpeace International is an authority on environmental issues and the global community is full of bold stories. The soul of Greenpeace is its volunteers and activists, so serving as a voice that can empower them and highlight their stories is a north star to guide the website tone. The nuance of tone will be looked at in tandem across all the GPI communication channels. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oYO8L9Rj-R40tOvUlk5IyC-3XnSR3LaLb10nXHE3aG4/edit#slide=id.g110f0a24242_0_26">Our Promising Practices work</a> gives some insight into how audience and tone tie together.</p> What: A Key Info Template for&nbsp;Content <p><a href="https://medium.com/planet4/content-is-complicated-lets-try-to-simplify-4382b2c85cbb">Content is complicated</a>. There are a variety of pieces and parts that need to come together to tell an effective story. With the web, there are pieces and parts flying around on social media sites, websites, and other platforms. There are images, text, audio, video and animated gifs. Having a collection of bits that align with each other will help you tell stories across different platforms.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Again, Greenpeace International is a complex global community. We need stories to reach the GPI audience wherever they are. We need components for all the various communication channels, including the website. We worked with the communications professionals on “must haves” for each project or campaign. Then we made a template to help people collaboratively collect each piece. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D01woo9lmXV-wXuMho4tuoiycfNiNLJWzmpgOaWkDVU/edit#heading=h.je63mvxzw7qy">The Key Info Template</a> helps create consistency. It makes it easier to onboard new collaborators to an in-progress project.</p> Where: Resources &amp; Accountability to&nbsp;share <p>Finally, there is the question of how everything comes together. How can people collaborate on strategic content with the right tone for your target audience? This piece is about putting a process in place that allows people to do just that — Collaborate. It doesn’t matter what tool or method you use, as long as you have one that helps keep everyone&nbsp;aligned.</p>Screenshot of the Asana&nbsp;template<p>The Web Strategist is responsible for the GPI site and will guide the web editors who are responsible for content. In order to coordinate and provide transparency into the various communication projects going on at any one time, we created an Asana template. A project team can copy the template and shape it for their project needs. They can add people to tasks, comment, add deadlines and check things&nbsp;off.</p><p>Asana is a project management tool that GPI recently adopted, and we used the opportunity to pull together All The Things. The template has all the important how-tos and guides, and links out to the strategy and best practices work. It provides a one-stop-shop for teams to coordinate on new communication work. The Story and Comms team will be piloting and testing our new Asana template with new projects and campaigns in the coming&nbsp;months.</p> When: What’s&nbsp;next? <p>We have now wrapped up <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/communicating-with-intention-b3017ca81f38">Phases 0, 1 and 2 of our Website Implementation project</a>. However, there’s more to do! Over the next weeks, we’ll be working out a proposal for what “Phase 3: Change Management” might look like. The resources we’ve included above are great, but not if staff can’t use&nbsp;them!</p><p>We know we want to design a workshop series and run further staff development initiatives on this work. We want to continue building an encouraging culture of open and help people use the processes they’ve helped us design. We want to ensure organisational understanding of the how and why of the communications and engagement strategies, and we want to run some technical workshops like SEO Training or How to A/B&nbsp;Test.</p><p>The Website Strategy Implementation team is looking forward to hearing more feedback and testing, testing, testing our methods and processes. Do you have feedback? <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in touch</a> or leave a&nbsp;comment!</p><p>*Special thanks to Kelli Tolen, Mehdi Leman, Diego Gonzaga, the Managing Editors and the rest of the Story and Comms staff who have provided their ideas, feedback and input into this&nbsp;work!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/educate-engage-activate-6c6325e962d2">Educate + Engage = Activate!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 24 May 2022 — We’re pleased to share an update on Electraflex, our project with Electra Caldense to implement a demand flexibility market to increase grid flexibility.</p><p>‘Flexibility’, in this case, refers to the ability to balance power generation with energy consumption using distributed energy resources, with the goal of increasing efficiency and resilience across an increasingly decarbonized network.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/catalonian-grid-operator-electra-caldense-energy-web-and-bamboo-energy-announce-grid-flexibility-51c75e5bcc25">First announced in February 2021</a>, Electraflex is the world’s first decentralized flexibility platform tailored for the specific needs of a distribution system operator&nbsp;(DSO).</p><p>Working with Energy Web on the Electraflex project is Electra Caldense, a 100% renewable energy retailer which serves 12,800 in a region of Catalonia just north of Barcelona. Spain has excellent solar resources, and uptake of renewable energy in Catalonia is set to increase over the coming years. Electraflex has the goal of creating a demand flexibility market which incorporates multiple assets, customers, and industrial partners within Electra Caldense’s region, with the goal of balancing renewable energy generation as efficiently as possible across all participants in order to create a single low-carbon electricity system.</p><p>The pioneering project is the product of a collaboration between multiple partners, including Electra Caldense, Bamboo Energy, Vega Chargers, Top Cable, CAESA, and CEGASA. Energy Web’s technology stack is being used to assign digital identities to the different assets and market participants, allowing them to register in energy markets and offer flexibility services, while Bamboo Energy’s software solution for demand aggregation is being deployed to manage and optimize demand flexibility for companies enrolled in the&nbsp;project.</p> VEGA successfully completes EV charging with ElectraFlex <p>In the first breakthrough on the project with a real asset, electric vehicle (EV) charging company <a href="http://vegachargers.com/en/">VEGA Chargers</a> completed a test run, serving as a proof-of-concept for the integration of assets onto future flexibility markets, this month with the successful live charging of an EV. The VEGA EV charger also allowed the level of charge in the EV to be checked remotely and power to be purchased automatically.</p><p>This charging solution is planned to provide benefits to consumers, allowing any EV owner to participate in the flexibility market from their EV charger. Users will be able to set their car to charge during times of the day when generation is at a surplus and energy is at its cheapest, saving costs and getting the most from renewable power.</p><p>In the future, EVs participating in the market will even be able to charge bidirectionally, purchasing energy at midday, and then feeding energy back into the home at night or selling it back to the flexibility market at periods when total generation is&nbsp;lower.</p> Top Cable rolls out efficiency for production lines <p>Top Cable, the electric cable manufacturer, has now been successfully integrated into the ElectraFlex ecosystem to optimize its energy consumption.</p><p>Bamboo Energy’s demand aggregation software platform integrated into ElectraFlex allows Top Cable to adapt its energy consumption to take advantage of different hourly electricity prices, managing six different production lines. In addition, the facility can adapt its consumption when needed with the goal to achieve a perfect balance of energy production and consumption in the&nbsp;grid.</p><p>In an industrial setting, this Proof-of-Concept sets the stage for significant cost savings for companies whose operations depend on large amounts of electricity and could be rolled out across any industrial partner.</p> Future onboarding through SunSpec&nbsp;Alliance <p>As part of the ElectraFlex project, Energy Web is also developing and deploying the EW SunSpec Gateway, an open-source toolkit that allows any distributed energy resource compliant with the SunSpec Modbus Specification to have its own digital identity on the Energy Web&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Sunspec Alliance, a trade alliance of over 160 solar and storage companies across Asia, Europe and North America, is a member of Energy Web and in 2020 announced a strategic partnership with Energy Web to co-develop digital standards that support interoperability for solar PV and battery energy storage technologies.</p><p>This means that any solar panels with SunSpec compliant inverters, which is the majority of new panels, will be able to be on-boarded onto ElectraFlex easily and contribute on the generation side to the flexibility market. Our continued work with SunSpec is invaluable for the future goals of the ElectraFlex project, as we look to onboard as much solar PV as possible as we build the flexibility market ecosystem.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. Our Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) enables any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors the EW-DOS tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>ABOUT BAMBOO ENERGY <br>Bamboo Energy is a technological spin-off of the Catalan Energy Research Institute (IREC) created in 2020 in Barcelona that has developed an energy optimization platform based on artificial intelligence, with the purpose of decisively contributing to the promotion of a new energy model decentralized and based on renewable sources. It manages the consumption of all types of flexible assets for their participation in different electricity markets in an aggregate and coordinated way.</p><p>ABOUT VEGA CHARGERS<br>VEGA Chargers is a company specialized in the design and production of fast DC electric vehicle charging stations.</p><p>At VEGA Chargers we work every day to make possible a more sustainable present and future in terms of e-Mobility, for this we analyse the needs of our customers and provide flexible and scalable charging solutions for electric vehicles, starting with concept and going through design to manufacturing.</p><p>ABOUT ELECTRA CALDENSE (DSO)<br>Electra Caldense is a distribution system operator founded in 1917 and since then guaranteeing power supply to more than 12,400 users within 10 municipalities in the Vallès Oriental and Occidental regions (Barcelona), among other regions in Catalonia.

 Reputation Until Today <p>Web2 was a turning point for reputation systems in many ways. For the first time, reputation was no longer localized or limited by geography. Any credentials or accreditations that you receive are readily sharable to a broad audience on the Internet. Web2 introduced a paradigm where users could not only consume content but also create at a massive scale. It became seamless for creators to collect likes, views, retweets and replies, signaling to readers the quality of their work and their expertise on a subject.</p><p>Over time, data accrued to specific platforms and became trapped in application siloes. As you know, the reputation you build on Twitter doesn’t transfer over to your Instagram account. Every time a creator moves or adds a platform to their portfolio, they effectively start at zero, and must request their fans to do the same. Web2 platforms have also done a poor job of translating our real-world reputation. The credentials we collect and earn in Web2 are not natively digital and are mere proxies for the more complex and natural relationships they represent.</p><p>Enter Web3.</p> DIDs and VCs as the Future <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) is an international organization that develops and maintains standards for creating and interacting with web content, ensuring acceptance and interoperability across the Internet. The W3C introduces a standard for a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC), providing a mechanism to issue credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.</p><p>Simply speaking, a VC is a piece of contextual data that is generated and signed by a trusted party, creating an attestation for any piece of information.</p><p>Another W3C standard, a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID) is a uniquely generated identifier that is controlled by either single or multiple public keys. DIDs are a useful chain-agnostic abstraction to sign off-chain attestations such as VCs or to link to various on-chain assets. The specification outlines 90+ types of DID methods that can sign and manage contextual data. Since DIDs are chain-agnostic, they allow users to build a comprehensive view of their identity in a multi-chain world.</p><p>Ultimately, this paints a future where various credentials can be issued as VCs to a user’s DID, where the DID is a higher-level representation of all their wallet accounts and private keys. To learn more about DIDs and how Ceramic enables this user-centric reality, read : <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/user-centric-data-on-web3/">https://blog.ceramic.network/user-centric-data-on-web3/</a></p> Reputation in Web3 <p>While Web2 reputation was based on content creation for a digital platform, Web3 introduces a concept we’re familiar with in real life—reputation based on participation. Community members can not only invest in various cryptocurrency protocols but also become an active participant in DeFi and NFT communities, build dApps, contribute to a DAO, or even earn POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) to register event attendance. Online reputation and digitally-native credentials can finally resemble those of the real world.</p><p>Let’s dive into what makes Web3 reputation more powerful and expansive than Web2.</p><p>Totally, and wholly, owned by you</p><p>Unlike Web2 platforms that lock your credentials into the system, Web3 credentials are owned by you—controlled by your wallet and private keys. This means that your credentials can’t be altered, deleted, or suspended by a third party.</p><p>Comprehensiveness and Portability</p><p>Your private keys control access to the credentials you’ve earned, this means that they will follow you from community to community. Credentials that you’ve earned in one community can be seen by and used to reward you elsewhere. Since the data stored on Ceramic can be made publicly available, credentials can be composable—other communities and protocols can use credentials issued by others as inputs to issue new ones.</p><p>On-chain assets and credentials are easy to scan at scale. And now, with the rise of oracles and off-chain storage systems like Ceramic, it’s becoming easy to build reputation data pipelines for applications ranging from DeFi credentialing to tracking DAO contributions.</p><p>Verifiability</p><p>It’s easy to verify your educational credentials, mainly because they’re issued by a trusted third-party—an accredited university. In Web2, when you claim a course or skills credential, there are limited ways to digitally verify its accuracy. However, in Web3 systems, on-chain assets are inherently verifiable given the public and open nature of the blockchains they exist on. Off-chain assets can become verifiable when decentralized oracle systems can verify their accuracy or when an attestation is signed by a public key.</p> Ceramic Use-Cases <p>A topic as broad as credentials has, practically, an infinite number of use cases — but let us cover a few interesting ones that we’ve been tackling here at Ceramic. Notice how they all exhibit the key pillars of Web3 reputation: Portability, verifiability, user-controlled data.</p> Financial Credentialing <p>Traditional financial systems make it difficult to understand, view, or access one’s credit history or financial trustworthiness. Using next generation Web3 reputation systems, we could represent a person’s credit score as a digitally native primitive. Users would own their credit history, add context to it, and could share with whoever they wish, even across borders. dApps can easily run aggregate reports on credit scores to determine trustworthiness and use scores as composable data, building advanced DeFi protocols that allow under-collateralized loans or margin accounts.</p><p>A common use case we’ve seen a lot at Ceramic is universal KYC (know-your-customer) verification where a trusted agency can issue VCs for KYC validation so that users don’t have to perform a time-consuming validation process every time they onboard onto a new dApp.</p> Proof of Humanity <p>To protect against Sybil attacks, several Web3 dApps are reinforcing their security by implementing Proof of Humanity or Proof of Personhood systems, requiring users to prove that they are real human beings and not bots. Similar to a universal credential that can be carried across the Web3 metaverse, Proof of Humanity can be issued as a credential to the user’s Ceramic DIDs—enabling them to be portable, verifiable, and self-sovereign. Proof of Humanity can be a very comprehensive determination, integrating various on/off chain data sources (KYC, NFT ownership, Web2 authentication, etc). Moreover, once all the credentials are available on Ceramic, various services can implement proprietary scoring algorithms.</p><p>In the diagram below we see various third parties issuing credentials to the user’s Ceramic streams. Each credential is composable, meaning that one issuer can use a previously issued credential to issue another (Issuer 2 issuing a Proof of Humanity credential). Finally, various dApps can request the user to read one (or several) of the credentials that were previously issued.</p> Reputation in DAOs <p>To function effectively in an organization, DAO members must be able to signal a rich sense of their contributions in- and outside of the community. They need to share reputation that mirrors real-world interactions and contextual information about themselves and their peers—who they are, what they’ve done, and how they’ve contributed.</p><p>A very common problem for DAOs is that they have no idea who exactly a contributor is when they join the organization. Using Ceramic, users and DAOs can drastically reduce switching costs by being able to collect and share credentials across Web3 ecosystems. Contributors can seamlessly share their contribution history (skills, completed bounties, membership levels, org roles, participation, etc.) and be assigned meaningful tasks on Day 1, avoiding the need to prove themselves. Organizations are empowered to immediately onboard new contributors and start relationships on shared understanding, leading to better and faster collective decisions.</p> Application Architecture for Storing VCs on Ceramic <p>There are several ways to design your application to issue Verifiable Credentials, but let’s cover one of the more popular and simple architectures using Ceramic.</p>  Users submit a claim to the dApp (birth date, KYC, financial history) or perform a certain action on the dApp (votes on a proposal, logs in every day, moderates a Discord).  dApp forwards the claim for verification, either to the dApp’s own verification service or a third-party’s.  The claim is verified and a VC is created and signed using the application’s DID. For a VC to be considered valid, it must be signed by the issuing authority.  Finally, the claim is stored on the user’s Ceramic streams.   Who’s building reputation systems on Ceramic? <p>Ceramic is a solution that seamlessly integrates DIDs and VCs along with robust database-like features for users and applications to issue, store, and share their credentials. Accruing credentials in a multi-chain metaverse and associating them with a chain-agnostic DID allows users to fully create an accurate picture of their digital reputation and proudly carry that with them into any application they use.</p><p>Here’s just a sampling of the projects that are using Ceramic to build robust identity and reputation systems: <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/highlighted-projects/#reputation">https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/highlighted-projects/#reputation</a></p><p>If you’re working on a project on identity, credentials, and reputation, Ceramic might be a great fit in your tech stack—join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/6VRZpGP">Discord</a> and we’d love to chat!</p> <p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Documentation</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

<p>California is a major center of new privacy law and regulation, creating opportunities for internet safety advocates to help design policies that will ripple out well beyond the state’s borders. Their Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), passed by ballot proposition in 2020, created the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), which seems to be getting closer to initiating its first formal rulemaking process. We have monitored and involved ourselves in this new agency since its inception, and Lisa LeVasseur (our Executive Director) and Noreen Whysel (Director of Validation Research) shared their expertise on product audits and dark patterns, respectively, in a recent <a href="https://cppa.ca.gov/meetings/agendas/20220504_06.pdf">pre-rulemaking CPPA Stakeholder Session (May 5-6)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have included a summary of the CPPA’s rulemaking process to date at the end of this post. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Our Input During the Stakeholder Sessions 
<p>Our key recommendations included:</p>
<p>Dark Patterns&nbsp;</p>
 
 Focusing on the harmful outcomes of these interfaces by calling them what they are: “Harmful UI Patterns,” rather than “Dark Patterns.”&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Recognizing that Harmful UI Patterns exist along the spectrum of the entire technology relationship, beginning before an account or other user relationship is established until well after it is terminated.&nbsp; 
 Adopting a framework for identifying Harmful UI Patterns at each stage of a technology relationship. For example, regulation should include or reference additional examples of Harmful UI Patterns and develop a framework for when they are likely to occur.&nbsp; 
 Advocating for Opt-Out to be the default condition,&nbsp;rather than a choice. A respectful default state is one in which no data is collected unless and until a user explicitly allows for data collection.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Recommendations on clarifying the definitions of “Consent” and “Intentional Interaction.”&nbsp; 
 
<p>Audits&nbsp;</p>
 
 Providing clarity on two types of audits: (1) auditing organizations and their practices and (2) auditing the behavior of technology.&nbsp; 
 Addressing scaling issues and challenges. Auditing is too large a job for a single entity. &nbsp; 
 Advocating for authorized network of auditing entities to be completely independent and divorced from the industry. There must be transparency in qualifying criteria, selection, and ongoing performance of authorized auditors.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>Click <a>here</a> to read our full statements. &nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>Currently, we speculate that the preliminary rulemaking activities have concluded since no additional activities or meetings have been announced. We look forward to receiving notice of the CPPA’s initial draft of regulations soon and submitting our public comments within the 45-day comment period.&nbsp;</p>
 Summary of the CPPA’s Rulemaking Process To Date 
 
 In June of 2021, the CPPA board started meeting, addressing administrative issues, hiring personnel, and creating subcommittees.&nbsp; 
 In September of 2021, the CPPA initiated their pre-rulemaking activities soliciting preliminary written comments on their proposed rulemaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 <a href="https://me2ba.org/me2ba-provides-human-centered-recommendations-to-the-california-privacy-protection-agency/%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://me2ba.org/me2ba-provides-human-centered-recommendations-to-the-california-privacy-protection-agency/">We provided the CPPA with 14 pages of feedback.</a>&nbsp; 
 
 
 In January of 2022, the CPPA gave notice to the office of administrative law of their intended rulemaking calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 The initial timeline for adopting final regulations was set for July 1, 2022 by the CPRA but now the timeline for adopting final regulations has been pushed out to Q3 or Q4.&nbsp; 
 
 
 In February of 2022, Executive Director Ashkan Soltani acknowledged that the new rulemaking timeline puts the CPPA behind schedule, but it will allow the Agency to balance staffing needs and undertake substantial preliminary information gathering to support regulations. Mr. Soltani then expressed the possibility that the CPPA may introduce major regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 In March of 2022, the CPPA continued their preliminary information gathering activities by holding informational hearings. Academics and government officials were selected to speak at these Informational Hearings to provide the CPPA board and staff members with background information on various topics potentially relevant to rulemaking.&nbsp; 
 In May of 2022, the CPPA continued their preliminary information gathering activities by holding Stakeholder Sessions providing the public with the opportunity to speak on their experience and expertise in topics relevant to the upcoming rulemaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 We signed up to participate in these Stakeholder Sessions and provided our input on Audits and Dark Patterns. &nbsp;

<p>Today’s rapid technological development, changing humanitarian needs, and <a href="https://www.unocha.org/sites/unocha/files/Global%20challenges%20and%20their%20impact%20on%20international%20humanitarian%20action.pdf">new forms of emergency present new challenges to humanitarian organizations</a> responding to disasters. At the same time 1 billion people globally, some of whom need humanitarian assistance, do not have any form of an identity document (ID). Such vulnerable people around the world without a recognized form of ID are sometimes unable to access certain humanitarian services, such as cash and voucher assistance because they cannot meet know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.</p><p>People in need of assistance often have no choice but to use proxy services to access humanitarian services, exposing them and the organizations assisting them to additional data protection and privacy risks, in addition to fraud, further increasing their vulnerability. With the <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23347">adoption of digital tools</a>, such as internet connectivity and mobile phones, being relatively high around the world compared to a decade ago, new opportunities have arisen to innovate on existing approaches for planning, designing, and implementing humanitarian interventions with dignity and efficiency. However, key questions remain about how we might achieve efficiency in our operations and ensure the dignity of the people we serve. What are the opportunities and limitations learnt from the pilot implementation of digital ID in Kenya as part of the COVID-19 cash assistance response?</p><p>The <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">Dignified Identities in Cash Assistance (DIGID)</a> project was initiated by a consortium of humanitarian organizations. In 2021, a pilot project was carried out in Kenya implemented by the <a href="https://www.redcross.or.ke">Kenya Red Cross Society</a> to enable people without any form of ID to receive cash assistance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by means of a digital ID. The operations, from registration to cash collection, were notably more efficient for organizations and people being assisted alike. Also, the digital ID solution was well-received by users, who obtained control over their data and were able to carry them in a digital wallet, which cannot be lost or destroyed like a physical document.&nbsp; This made for a more dignified process in terms of the number, frequency, and length of interviews needed to enroll in various humanitarian programs. Another benefit was the <a href="https://cash-hub.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/DIGID-More-Lessons-Learnt-from-Kenya-Jan-2022.pdf">level of authority gained by participants to decide what data to share</a> with which organization or individual, and for how long. </p><p>“Zero-knowledge Proof” is being further tested in the second phase of DIGID, which aims to address the lack of official or recognized identity among displaced persons and host community members to access humanitarian assistance, such as continued health care, in the context of migration.</p><p>Consultations with stakeholders – members of affected communities, humanitarian actors, and government officials – were key to achieving a user-centric approach to designing and implementing a digital ID solution for humanitarian response. Stakeholders displayed a range of reactions, including overall acceptance but also concerns over data protection and privacy.&nbsp; The latter were addressed through engagement and communication with end-users – operators, subscribers, and regulators. The comments collected during the consultations improved the reliability and efficiency of the pilot project for reliability and efficiency.</p><p>Upon registration, users retained ownership and control of their data. Some participants did not appear to care much about this feature as long as they could receive their assistance without going through a proxy or waiting for long queues to be identified by both the Kenya Red Cross Society and the financial service providers. KYC requirements were efficiently fulfilled and regulatory compliance was ensured using the functional digital ID. The digital ID was functional in nature to enable the delivery of humanitarian cash assistance while remaining acceptable to be used for humanitarian purposes in Kenya.&nbsp;</p><p>However, since the project targeted people without any form of ID, some tended to confuse the functional digital ID to receive humanitarian assistance with a foundational, government-issued ID. On the other hand, some partners in the project expressed the hope that the integration of digital identification in their programming would enable them to achieve the complete digitization of their systems. Such aspirations underline the importance of precisely communicating the value proposition of digital ID to stakeholders. Each stakeholder had different expectations for what a digital ID would bring them, indicating that there are many opportunities such an ID could offer the humanitarian sector.</p><p>The DIGID technology was developed by a private company and ensured adaptability to contexts, scalability, interoperability, and decentralization. The technology functioned in lower-resource settings, where most humanitarian interventions take place, and met the needs of people with limited abilities in reading or using digital tools. The digital ID worked in environments with low connectivity and poor penetration of mobile phone devices, whether smartphones or feature phones. The flexibility and interoperability feature that the digital identity provided made it possible to replicate and adapt the solution to several other user cases, such as in the migration context. From January 2022, a second pilot project (DIGID 2) is testing digital credentials in the migration context for cash and voucher assistance with internally displaced people in Uganda and for continued health care with displaced persons and host community members in Kenya; the findings are expected for July 2022.</p><p>The DIGID 1 pilot in Kenya revealed that integrating digital identities in the humanitarian sector offers several opportunities to enhance operational, data protection and privacy, and user dignity. The benefits of digital ID may accrue further as more aid organizations adopt such solutions into their beneficiary management systems by taking advantage of interoperability between aid organizations and technology operators. Meaningful participation of stakeholders and continued advocacy efforts with regulatory bodies and humanitarian organizations are essential to ensuring adaptability to changing humanitarian needs.</p><p></p><p>The latest report on lessons learnt from Kenya is accessible <a href="https://cash-hub.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/DIGID-Lessons-Learnt-from-Kenya-Jan-2022.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>For more information visit <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">https://hiplatform.org/digid</a>.</p><p></p><p>A related webinar, Mobile for Identity Management &amp; Inclusive ID4D - Part 3 of 4, is accessible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=6427s&amp;v=3H-seajJE9Y">here</a> (from 1:44:00 to 2:12:00)</p>

 Going beyond credentialing and the formal/informal divide Image CC BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Members of WAO have spent over a decade working in an around digital credentials such as <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a>. We’ve spent even longer in our work with learning communities of all types —both inside and outside of organisations and institutions.</p><p>Over this time, we’ve become increasingly aware that there is a spectrum of approaches when it comes to the use of badges. There are badges as credentials and badges for recognition. Badges as credentials includes approaches that are well understood and largely replace or augment existing certification practices. Badges for recognition, however, include approaches that remain somewhat confusing to many&nbsp;people.</p><p>As shown in the images in this post, recognition is something much wider and deeper than credentialing. Recognition is the reason why badges that will only ever be seen by the issuer and recipient can make as much sense as those that are proudly and publicly displayed. Recognition is the subtext that gives meaning to credentials.</p>Image CC BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>While recognition may be easy to understand, it’s a concept that can be difficult to define. Recently, we’ve been working with <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a> and the <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/">Open Skills Network</a> specifically to address what we’ve been collectively calling ‘Open Recognition’. But what exactly is this? Are we all talking about the same thing, or is it an unhelpfully-ambiguous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeugma_and_syllepsis">zeugma</a>?</p><p>To help with our discussions around Open Recognition in the <a href="https://badges.community/">Keep Badges Weird community</a> and beyond, we’ve come up with this working definition, based on the work of the <a href="https://www.openrecognition.org/bord/">Open Recognition Alliance</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18RQBzZxNUCLYlbG_z3a4FdUco3T2FNf9/edit">Open Recognition Principles for&nbsp;OSN</a>:</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.</blockquote><p>As with any definition, it’s a work in progress. However, it fits with our mantra of “good enough for now, safe enough to try” so we’ll be using it to help frame our upcoming discussions. One of these is the OSN Showcase on <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/events">Open Recognition and Open Skills</a> at which WAO member Doug Belshaw will be speaking as part of a panel&nbsp;session.</p><p>Please do join us, get involved in the <a href="https://badges.community">KBW community</a>, and provide feedback on our working definition of Open Recognition!</p><p>WAO’s members are 11-year advocates of badges. If we can help you with your badge project, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition, anyway?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Isn’t it terrific to meet people in person again! DINZ wasted no time in taking advantage of orange settings to bring our members together in both Wellington and Auckland in the past fortnight. A big shout-out to our sponsor hosts – <a href="https://www.sss.co.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2d1a573484-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2d1a573484-">SSS</a> in Wellington and <a href="https://www.minterellison.co.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2d1a573484-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2d1a573484-">MinterEllisonRudd Watts</a> in Auckland. Both events were well attended and operated a similar cadence with the hosts’ welcome, the earliest registered start-up SME briefly commenting on an industry topic dear to them, followed by social mixing over drinks. Our next members’ Connect event will be in Wellington, following the<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2d1a573484-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2d1a573484-"> Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a> to reflect on the perspectives and discussions voiced there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Orange settings also allowed DINZ to undertake its live Techweek TV ‘fireside’ session physically at AUT, following the Minister’s address last Monday morning. I facilitated a chat with Co-Chairs&nbsp; PaymentsNZ’s Angela Gill and Datacom’s Ben Dakers about their aspirations for DINZ’s most recent initiative – the Inclusive and Ethical Uses of Digital Identity working group. Didn’t they do well! If you missed it live, it will be available on demand <a href="https://play.stuff.co.nz/details/_6306289722112?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2d1a573484-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2d1a573484-">here</a> in due course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IEUDI, together with DINZ’s Te Kāhui Te Tiriti O DINZ and Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) work groups, detail the scope of DINZ’s mahi this year and into 2023 in pursuit of its mission – to create a digital identity ecosystem that enhances privacy, trust and improves access for all people in New Zealand. You can see more detail on how to contribute to these working groups <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/working-groups/?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2d1a573484-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2d1a573484-">here on the website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DISTF WG met last week also, to discuss the <a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/whole.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=db3852423b-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-db3852423b-&amp;utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2d1a573484-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2d1a573484-#whole">Select Committee’s report</a> following the <a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/BILL_116015/tab/submissionsandadvice?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2d1a573484-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2d1a573484-">submissions</a>, containing its recommended changes to <a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/whole.html?utm_source=Digital+Identity+Communications&amp;utm_campaign=2d1a573484-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_02_19_01_16_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f65b648199-2d1a573484-#LMS459583">the Bill</a> prior to its Second Reading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were over 4500 submissions but as the Select Committee commented, misinformation regarding a link to vaccinations, centralised state control of identity and digitisation more generally may have played a significant role in many of those. Misinformation or otherwise, the fact remains that both Government and industry need to do better in taking all people of Aotearoa on this journey. DINZ has begun to address this challenge through its three Working Groups with different but nonetheless related scopes. All three are chartered to advance improved trust and confidence in the development of the digital identity ecosystem and the digital economy more generally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With your financial support and volunteered time we can progress this important mahi for the betterment of all Aotearoa.</p>

CC BY-SA Anne&nbsp;Hilliger<p>We are now two full weeks into May, quite a lot of things have changed around here and I didn’t have time to write about them yet. But sometimes all the things happen at once and as I’ve had covid, I could’t work much. Instead stared at the walls of my room and hoped the symptoms would end soon. I am feeling much better now and have charged my batteries for the new things ahead because &lt;drum roll&gt; since the end of April my internship at WAO is officially over! But we’ve all enjoyed working together so much that we just couldn’t stop doing it and I am now a collaborator with We Are Open&nbsp;🙌</p><p>I’ve made the decision to postpone some courses at university as well as my thesis which will give me the opportunity to continue working on projects with WAO, which makes me super happy. There is so much cool stuff happening and it would’ve been very sad to stop just because the internship is&nbsp;over.</p><p>And I thought it is always a good idea to recap things before starting new ones, so let’s do this&nbsp;now.</p> What was it like to be an intern at We Are&nbsp;Open? <p>I started working with WAO last year in August and since then have been involved in great projects. I’ve learned so much about myself, the way I want to work and the world of working openly. One big lesson was to understand that I can trust my own instincts and that the stuff I do and think about matters. This might sound a bit pathetic but I’ve never been in a working environment where collaborative working has been recognising and inspiring.Usually I’ve worked on my own, showed it to someone and got told that the stuff wasn’t good. Also in university you usually just submit your work, receive a grade and never get any feedback about what was especially good or what needs improvement. How are you supposed to feel self-efficacy if you never get any good feedback? Long story short, working with WAO has changed this a lot and I now feel confident (most of the time) about my work and the things I am creating.</p><p>In the first month I was mostly a fly on the wall. Laura and Doug were finishing off one of a number of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-common-ground-8fadc99692cd">Catalyst projects</a> that they’d been involved with during the pandemic. I joined them on the last few support calls with some of the charities they were helping. In addition to being a fly on the wall I fell down multiple rabbit holes while onboarding to catch up on all the things that WAO is working on, advocating for and talking about. I listened to episodes of the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">Tao of WAO podcast</a>, read the <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/">WAO Wiki</a> and got familiar with their <a href="https://medium.com/@anne.hilliger/creativity-and-working-openly-f5f059a22309">way of&nbsp;working</a>.</p><p>By the end of August I got more and more involved in the current projects and we developed a way of co-working that I thought was great. Each day of the week was kind of dedicated to one of the projects, we met in the morning over zoom to discuss the to-do list, everybody got a task to work on individually and then we reported back after a while. If you are working mostly home alone in front of your computer this is a great way to work together, get a lot of things done in a short time and also stay sane. This was one of the ways that my internship acted as a way for WAO members to reflect on, and improve, their working practices.</p> Introducing some of the projects I was involved&nbsp;in <p>A great project but also a challenging one has been the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/communicating-with-intention-b3017ca81f38">Web Strategy implementation project</a> for <a href="https://greenpeace.com">Greenpeace International</a>. We tried to wrap our head around strategies to communicate with certain audiences, how to develop resources that help them create stories and communicate with intention. We had a look at the very complex information landscape that is the Greenpeace global network and tried to make sense of it. We organised workshops and community calls for the Greenpeace Comms Team. Sometimes I felt I wasn’t accomplishing anything in this project because I just kept falling into research and didn’t get any “work” done. But in the end we came up <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/audience-ikigai-be0cebe4cea">with awesome ideas</a> and it worked out pretty&nbsp;well.</p><p>One of my favourite projects is the <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d">Keep Badges Weird community</a> and working with <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>. I learned what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice">Community of Practice</a> is, how to create one and what tools and methods you can use to sustain one. I was involved in my first community calls, did some community work like facilitation, posting things inside the community or on social media and learned a lot about <a href="https://openbadges.org">Open Badges</a> which members of WAO have been involved with for over a decade. I like to work on things that give me the feeling that the work matters. With Keep Badges Weird I get this feeling because there are so many people involved from all around the world, it is about changing things and it has the vision to create a better future. And it went from joking around with the client to having super meta and <a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/metaphors-for-open-recognition/b52eac57-6ace-4b0d-96b9-db2355e75835">philosophical discussion around taxonomies</a>.</p>CC BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>From the beginning of the internship I got <a href="https://medium.com/@anne.hilliger/all-i-am-thinking-about-are-open-badges-9c9760a60c49">hooked on Open Badges</a> and regularly fell into rabbit holes trying to understand all the things around them. I decided that they will be part of my bachelor thesis next year and I am currently writing my first email course about feminist pedagogy that also uses badges to recognise the participants.</p><p>Speaking of the course I am currently writing, it reminds me of another project that I enjoyed working on so much and really made me want to put all my energy into it. The <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/">“Learn with WAO” platform</a>. The opportunity to <a href="https://medium.com/@anne.hilliger/rethinking-we-are-opens-learning-platform-learnwith-wao-b6d2f4d022a3">redesign and rethink</a> this platform was so much fun, and I learned how to take over responsibility and manage my own projects. I am very thankful that WAO trusted me with this and supported the steps I took because now there is <a href="https://medium.com/weareopencoop/learn-with-we-are-open-co-op-8a4dd9f31874">something that I’ve created that I am very proud&nbsp;of</a>!</p> Open Badges and recognition during the internship <p>Before I began my internship, Laura and the other members of WAO created an outline for the whole internship programme, including Badges that I could earn and milestones that I can achieve every&nbsp;month.</p>CC BY-ND Laura&nbsp;Hilliger<p>In the end we didn’t stick completely to that plan but it was still a great way to keep a common theme and figure out what my next steps will be. We also realised that not all of the Badges in that document were necessary for me and we combined them or thought of new ones that serve my portfolio for university and also maybe future employment or other places where I want to reference certain skills. Laura reflected on this and wrote a wonderful <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/designing-badges-for-co-creation-and-recognition-62fd06fd5636">blogpost</a> about the benefits of co-creating badges.</p><p>In the image below you can see an overview of the Badges I earned but you can also visit my <a href="https://api.eu.badgr.io/public/collections/9aa7f82179d2bb829dc10f6594907c59">Badgr Collection</a> if you are interested in the reading the criteria and descriptions of&nbsp;them.</p> Big thank you to all the WAO&nbsp;members <p>As I said before but will say again and again: I am very happy that I can continue working with We Are Open because I feel so comfortable working with them. We found a great flow of working together and it is great we all had the capacities to keep doing&nbsp;it.</p><p>I am thankful for this great mentorship I received from every single member and hope it will go on because I am certainly not done learning. I enjoyed the very different conversations I had with them and every single one has influenced me in their own way. I am looking forward to all the things that we will work on together AND also looking forward to maybe meeting some of the members in real life soon at the <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">Badge Summit</a> in Colorado!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/some-surprising-things-i-learned-during-nine-months-of-interning-with-we-are-open-co-op-719845dba215">Some surprising things I learned during nine months of interning with We Are Open Co-op</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/featured-content/files/letter_of_support_for_alvaro_bedoya_-_cantwell.pdf">Me2B Alliance is thrilled to see a Privacy Expert and Advocate assume the role of FTC Commissioner.</a> Bedoya is well known for his work in facial recognition technology and privacy as a civil right, openly criticizing government agencies and big tech on their use of consumer data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bedoya’s research has shined a light on digital surveillance and its impact on people of color, immigrants, and the working class. He founded the <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/">Center on Privacy &amp; Technology</a> at Georgetown Law to focus on the importance of consumer privacy rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bedoya also served as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, where he focused on privacy issues dealing with biometrics and geolocation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bedoya was nominated to serve as the FTC Commissioner in September of 2021. His confirmation process was stalled by Republican opposition since Bedoya would give Democrats the majority in the FTC. On May 11, 2022, the Senate finally voted on Bedoya’s confirmation, and it resulted in a 50-50 vote. Vice President Harris broke the tie vote in favor of confirming Bedoya for FTC Commissioner (51-50).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bedoya will replace Rohit Chopra and serve as the third democratic commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me2BA is eager to see what privacy and tech issues the FTC will focus on in the future, and we look forward to being of service to the FTC in any way can. We will be on the lookout and keep you posted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we talk about blockchain and artificial intelligence, we are dealing with two technological topics that are still on the edge, which are widely discussed but about which the exact limits have not yet been determined.However, these are two so-called ‘disruptive’ technologies, which are likely to have a significant influence on economic and social systems globally and will be so important that they will impact business models in general.The levels of knowledge and application of these technologies by those working in manufacturing and service enterprises is still low, and not only among female employees.The goal of the Workshop is to divulge the two technologies while presenting application experiences aimed at both companies and freelancers.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to share its new whitepaper, “OpenID for Verifiable Credentials”. The goal of this whitepaper is to inform and educate the readers about the work on the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC) specifications family. It addresses use-cases referred to as Self-Sovereign Identity, Decentralized Identity, or User-Centric Identity.</p>
<p>The work is being conducted in the OpenID Foundation, in liaison with the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and with working groups in International Organization for Standardization (ISO), namely ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 Cards and security devices for personal identification. This has enabled working towards aligning ISO-compliant mobile driving licences with W3C verifiable credentials data model, which has been one area of particular interest for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The whitepaper targets private and public sector decision-makers, architects and implementers interested in the concepts, use-cases and architecture where the End-User directly receives credentials from the Issuer and directly presents them to the Verifier using verifiable credentials. It is important to note that verifiable credentials are not only limited to credentials expressed using W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model, but also identity credentials expressed using other data models.</p>
<p>We wish to thank all the contributors that reviewed and provided feedback, notably the contributors to the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials, which is part of the OpenID Connect Working Group.</p>
<p>The whitepaper can be downloaded <a href="http://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/06/OIDF-Whitepaper_OpenID-for-Verifiable-Credentials-V2_2022-06-23.pdf">here</a>. As this paper is an “ 2nd Editors Draft”, we encourage you to share it and welcome feedback directed to <a href="mailto:director@oidf.org">director@oidf.org</a> so that the lead editors can evolve the paper based on community feedback.</p>

<p>What if semiconductor manufacturers made chips especially intended for crypto-wallets? That’s the topic of Blockchain Commons’ first <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Silicon Salon</a>, which will feature two different chip manufacturers who are expanding into the crypto industry. The first is CrossBar, a leader in Resistive RAM (ReRAM) technology, which can implement high-performance physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Together, ReRAM memory and PUF solutions enable a new class of secure computing and storage with physical countermeasures — and CrossBar is interested in bringing that to digital-asset management. The second is Tropic Square, whose tropic01 secure element offers a fully transparent and auditable chip as a basis for better hardware security. They use transparency as a driver for innovation.</p>

<p>Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to bringing together a community of developers and manufacturers to jointly develop specifications that will empower the entire industry, we’ve seized upon our work with these two companies to produce our first salon since the pandemic: a virtual Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and other interested parties can come together to talk about the next generation of semiconductors, which for the first time ever will be specialized for our cryptographic needs.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon is scheduled for June 1st, running three hours beginning at 9am PT (noon ET, 6pm CET). Signups for the Salon are now available on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Eventbrite</a>, with tickets limited to the first 40 participants.</p>

 Read More 



<p>The first hour of the Salon will feature presentations from silicon manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and experts in the field about how semiconductor design can support cryptographic functionality. Companies CrossBar, Tropic Square, and Proxy and experts Bryan Bishop and Christopher Allen are all scheduled to talk.</p>

<p>The other two hours of the Salon will feature facilitated discussion of topics intended to determine the needs of the hardware-wallet community. Specific topics may include: the importance of MCU and secure enclave integration; the importance of secure and persistent storage; the need for physical countermeasures; the advantages of hardware and software cryptography; the use of open licenses for hardware; and discussions of how new semiconductor designs intended for cryptography can improve security and efficiency. We don’t have all the answers: one of the most important goals of the salon is to find out the needs and thoughts of the community!</p>

<p>We hope you’ll <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">join us</a> to learn a bit about what’s already going on and to share your ideas, requirements, and expertise!</p>

<p>We are limiting the number of attendees to allow for Q&amp;A from the community, thus we are charging US$25 to hold a space at this unique virtual event. So <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">sign up</a> soon! If you are already a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/sponsors.html">Patron</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">monthly sponsor on Github</a> of Blockchain Commons, please check your email: we will be sending you a free invite code automatically.

</h3>

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  We hear about data brokers, but who are they and why should I care? They’re pervasive, collect thousands of data points about us on an ongoing basis, and aren’t properly governed. John Oliver breaks it down beautifully in his recent piece.
   
  
  
  
  
  

</div>
<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>We frequently get asked questions about data brokers. We believe a meaningful discussion about them requires detail and nuance, in order to accurately explain the power and control these types of organizations can have over the public, especially for higher-risk communities. &nbsp;</p>
 It’s complicated 
<p>Data brokers create real privacy threats by systematically assembling thousands of data points for each and every man, woman, and child on the planet—or at least ones that use digital technology. There are hundreds of data brokers globally, most of whom you’ve never heard of. All of them need far greater scrutiny. However, we cannot let the scale of the problem distract from reforming these companies through new laws, better enforcement of existing laws, and/or changes made by large ad tech companies at the “top of the user data supply chain.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also don’t want to make data brokers out to be boogeymen. But the truth about the risks of data brokers is oftentimes scary, despite simultaneously being quite technical and unexciting to the untrained eye. To understand the harmful effects of data brokers, one must focus on their buying and selling of IP address/network data, which is exposed to websites and apps, and all the vendors who collect data within them. &nbsp;</p>
 John Oliver Explains the Harms 
<p>Any discussion about data brokers almost immediately veers into technical concepts and complex hidden partnership data flows and metadata fields that are hard to visualize if you don’t have a technical background. &nbsp;Fortunately, HBO’s John Oliver recently dedicated over 25 minutes of his show to a segment on data brokers. It’s a must-watch (and share!) piece of television for everyone who wants their friends and family to better understand data brokers and the risks they create for the public. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can watch the 25 minute clip on YouTube (plus an ironic reminder that, YouTube is owned by Google, the owner of the largest global advertising network), here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqn3gR1WTcA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqn3gR1WTcA</a> .&nbsp;</p>
 We Continue to Dive Deeply into Data Brokers&nbsp; 
<p>Over the coming months, we plan to dig deeper into data brokers and the ways that user data is shared in unexpected and risky ways. If you’ve got any specific questions you are hoping to have answered, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@me2ba.org">contact@me2ba.org</a>&nbsp;</p>

 Adapting and applying existing work to combine the best elements of&nbsp;each <p><a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> is doing some really interesting work with <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a> at the moment. As you can read in our previous posts about the emerging Keep Badges Weird community, we’re doing some <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/emergent-community-building-a35f9431d8a?source=collection_home---4------6-----------------------">emergent community building</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/catalysing-the-kbw-community-fa89db943418?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------">catalysing the community</a> towards sustainability.</p><p>As part of that work, we thinking about the maturity not only of the KBW community, but of online, networked communities in general. We have over a <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">decade of experience</a> in this area, and are thankful for the work and inspiration of collaborators past and present. In addition, we are grateful for Emily Webber’s <a href="https://emilywebber.co.uk/community-of-practice-maturity-model/">Community of Practice Maturity Model</a>, and the book <a href="https://gettogether.world/">Get Together</a> by Bailey Richardson, Kevin Huynh &amp; Kai Elmer&nbsp;Sotto.</p>CC BY-NC We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op<p>The above image consists of the phases identified in the book Get Together combined with Emily Webber’s graph of ‘Energy and visibility’ (Y axis) vs ‘Phases’ (X axis). We like the three-part approach focused as it meshes with our experience and provides a nice visual metaphor for the type of activities involved (‘sparking the flame’, ‘stoking the fire’, and ‘passing the&nbsp;torch’).</p><p>We’re currently in the second phase with the KBW community, and so thinking carefully about how to engage community members without overwhelming them. As a result, we’ve gone into more detail as represented in the graphic below. The text for this is also reproduced at the bottom of this post for those who might have difficult reading&nbsp;it.</p>CC BY-NC We Are Open&nbsp;Co-op<p>The three sub-categories under each heading (e.g. ‘Pinpoint your people’) are taken from the Get Together book, while the bullet points are a combination of Emily Webber’s work and our own. In particular, the results of some <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/community-canvas/">community canvas</a> work we’ve done previously.</p><p>We noticed that many Community of Practice models assume much more of an existing shared context than we’re often used to in Open Source communities. For example, some models imply that community members all work for the same organisation. Our starting point is that while online, networked Communities of Practice form around shared interests, it is unlikely that they all work in the same organisation, or even&nbsp;sector.</p><p>WAO has labelled this as version 0.1 of our thinking on the subject. The maturity model itself is likely to be more mature than some of our completely original thinking on the subject, because of the expertise upon which we’re drawing. We actively encourage feedback, in the comments section below, by joining the <a href="https://badges.community">KBW community</a>, or by emailing us: <a href="mailto:communities@weareopen.coop">communities@weareopen.coop</a></p><p>If you’re looking for help wany phase of Communities of Practice for online networked communities, please get in touch! We’ll probably be able to help and, if we can’t, we’ll probably know someone who can&nbsp;:)</p><p>The following is the text from the WAO Communities of Practice Maturity Model v0.1 (as seen in the second image&nbsp;above):</p> Sparking the&nbsp;flame <p>Getting together</p> Pinpoint your&nbsp;people   Members have a safe space to meet and communicate  There is an idea of who the community is&nbsp;for  Easy onboarding makes it simple to get&nbsp;started   Do something together   There are regular invitations to participate in the community  Members can get involved in different activities within the community  There are ways of working openly that allow new members to get involved / catch&nbsp;up   Get people&nbsp;talking   Community members meet regularly using agreed channels and&nbsp;tools  There are backchannels and watercoolers for varied conversations  Members are connecting with people they haven’t had the chance to&nbsp;before   Stoking the&nbsp;flame <p>Sticking together</p><p>Attract new&nbsp;folks</p>  New members feel welcomed into the community  Core members are motivating others to take part in the community  Members regularly share knowledge and experiences external to the community  <p>Cultivate your&nbsp;identity</p>  Members of the community have agreed on guidelines for how to interact with one another (e.g. a Code of&nbsp;Conduct)  The needs of community members have been identified  The community’s mission is clear and agreed&nbsp;upon  <p>Pay attention to who keeps showing&nbsp;up</p>  Members adopt common approaches, enabling them to do their work more effectively  Members talk about the community to other people in their wider&nbsp;network  The community is meeting members’ needs based on explicit&nbsp;feedback   Passing the&nbsp;torch <p>Growing together</p> Create more&nbsp;leaders   Moderation responsibilities are shared among a larger group of core&nbsp;members  The community has a momentum that is not reliant on one or two&nbsp;people  The community has goals that members collaborate on as a whole or in smaller working&nbsp;groups   Supercharge your&nbsp;leaders   Leadership responsibilities and decision-making are distributed throughout the community  Members explicitly influence community direction and activities  There are open-door activities with people outside of the community (e.g. show and tells, cross-community meetups)   Celebrate together   Milestones relating to the community and its members are celebrated  People outside the community advocate for&nbsp;it  The community regularly creates outputs used by the wider&nbsp;network   <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-maturity-model-for-online-networked-communities-v0-1-7c78c2bee8d5">🔥 Towards a maturity model for online, networked communities (v0.1)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Climate-safe crypto: Energy Web and RMI unveil decarbonization approach for electricity-intensive industries <p>Approach quantifies material emissions impact of renewable energy purchases by any buyer; initial focus is certification for bitcoin&nbsp;miners.</p><p>Zug, Switzerland, and Boulder CO, USA, 9 May 2022 — <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a>, a non-profit building operating systems for energy grids, and <a href="https://rmi.org/">RMI</a>, an independent, US-based non-profit organization focused on accelerating the energy transition, have <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-studies/GreenProofsforBTC/">released a draft</a> approach to evaluating the material impact of market-based renewable energy purchases. The approach is applicable to any sector and is currently being trialed with bitcoin miners as the foundation for an eventual certification program that will credential renewably-powered mining and hosting operations.</p><p>The newly-developed quantitative approach will evaluate the material impact of renewable energy purchases made by companies to mitigate emissions from electricity consumption. The approach aims to provide the information needed to create a more impactful market for energy attribute certificates, including RECs and Guarantees of Origin. Energy Web plans to use the approach as the foundation for a certification initiative enabling investors, regulators, and customers to assess the “green” credentials of bitcoin&nbsp;miners.</p><p>With the announcement, RMI and Energy Web have launched a broad stakeholder engagement consultation, with the goal of refining and improving the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-studies/GreenProofsforBTC/">draft</a> approach following public comment and feedback. Interested stakeholders, including bitcoin and other cryptocurrency miners, data center operators, and corporate actors who purchase RECs, are invited to provide input on the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-studies/GreenProofsforBTC/">draft</a> criteria during a 30-day comment window. Comments can be submitted, starting today until June 10th, via the form found&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=haXYjubYAEu5zNNweDVZ9vlgYtsRmCZPslyIyhmiRMNUN0daRUlFMURHRE1HTkRVVTg1SkY5RTIyWi4u">here</a>.</p><blockquote>“Environmental, social, and governance factors are top of mind for senior decision makers and corporate boards in every industry, including crypto,” said Jesse Morris, CEO of Energy Web. “While this approach is fit for use across any number of industries, bitcoin in particular stands to benefit. Numerous bitcoin miners advised our initial work shaping this approach, and the resulting certification initiative will support them and others in their desire to demonstrate sustainability credentials through a credible independent process. By pairing the draft criteria with our decentralized technology solution for certifying renewable energy-powered mining, we can help accelerate decarbonization of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in line with the goals of the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord</a>, an initiative inspired by the Paris Climate Agreement.”</blockquote><p>The draft approach uses a novel quantitative method to measure the net emissions impact of renewable energy procurement by companies. Today, many market participants use products like renewable energy certificates to reduce their carbon emissions. However, determining the real-world impact of RECs is extremely challenging for many sectors, including cryptocurrency. Energy Web’s certification initiative aims to solve this problem by assessing both the emissions that mining operations create and the emissions their REC purchases mitigate. This enables companies and the public to understand the true emissions impact of their operations, and paves the way for investors and others to engage exclusively with actors that are actively contributing to a cleaner&nbsp;grid.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-studies/GreenProofsforBTC/">draft</a> approach calculates the carbon intensity of the energy used for mining by taking into account the grid location of mining operations and the material impact of any renewable energy purchased. The eventual certification initiative will use this approach, once finalized, to assign each participating miner a score; miners whose scores meet a predetermined threshold will receive a verifiable credential synthesizing the key outcomes of their evaluation. By assigning a score to each miner or hosting facility, rather than assigning a value to individual assets, such as a bitcoin, the fungibility of the assets is maintained.</p><blockquote>Commenting on the initiative, Josh Henretig, Managing Director of the Climate Intelligence Program at RMI, said: “The approach we have developed has the potential to transform carbon disclosure and sustainability reporting in any sector that uses market-based mechanisms to procure renewable energy. As governments and regulators around the world seek to tackle false sustainability claims, this issue is set to remain top of mind for global decision makers. Picking up where REC markets fall short, this solution engenders greater transparency and verifiability of impact than anything that has come&nbsp;before.”</blockquote><p>Following the consultation period, the finalized approach will inform the development of certification criteria that will be used to issue verifiable credentials to eligible miners and hosting companies. The process of accreditation, data verification, and issuance of verifiable credentials for cryptocurrency will be conducted using an implementation of Energy Web’s open-source <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions/green-proofs/">Green Proofs</a> solution. This technology helps miners securely share data needed to apply for certification, including corporate identity, grid location, mining capacity based on forecasted mining activity, and the amount of renewable energy they have procured.</p><p>Energy Web is currently working to apply the certification criteria to an initial group of leading bitcoin miners, and is exploring different ways of using the accreditation to accelerate the decarbonization of&nbsp;bitcoin.</p><p>In addition to submitting comments and feedback, interested parties can review the draft approach and download a preliminary tool for scoring their own energy procurement practices <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-studies/GreenProofsforBTC/">here</a>, and register <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_IDxu5JZcSLmj0lILGUzUzA">here</a> for a live workshop with RMI and Energy Web on May 13 on the approach and the stakeholder feedback&nbsp;process.</p><p>For more information, please visit the initiative’s website&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-studies/GreenProofsforBTC/">here</a>.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

This article is also <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/vertrauen-im-digitalen-raum-cc22a9fcbd0a">available in&nbsp;German</a>.</p> The problem <p>Imagine you go to an event and just before the entrance you see a QR code with the heading “Check-in here” along with the organiser’s logo. As you scan the QR code with your Wallet, you are asked for your payment information, among other things. But should you present this information?</p><p>When we communicate with third parties over the internet, it is not always clear whether the other party is really who they say they are. This problem also exists with established communication channels such as websites and emails, among others. Phishing refers to the fraudulent tapping of data to gain access to bank accounts or similarly sensitive accounts or information. A permanent communication channel that allows users to identify the communication partner to enable a trustworthy exchange of information is essential to protect users from phishing.</p> Context is important <p>We often base our trust in an interaction on the context in which we are communicating. For example, we trust a link in an internal employee portal more than a link in a promotional email. The principle is the same when a contact wants to connect with users and the connection request is displayed in the wallet. Depending on the context in which the connection request is initiated, a different level of trust can be assigned. The context helps us to establish trust but is not sufficient on its own. Often the context is missing or attackers specifically try to exploit&nbsp;it.</p> Authentication of organisations <p>Wallet users must be able to check the authenticity of organisations they connect to. However, the organisation must first be identified and verified. Once the organisation has the required certificates it can be validated in the user’s&nbsp;wallet.</p>Highly simplified process description of how organisations can be authenticated.<p>Hence, before the wallet can verify the organisation, a trusted party must certify the organisation. Certification authorities are organisations that are entrusted with signing digital certificates. They verify the identity and legitimacy of the organisation and the person requesting a certificate. If the check is successful, a signed certificate is issued. This certificate can then be verified by the user’s application such as a browser or wallet to authenticate the organisation.</p> Trust on different levels Illustration showing that identification is independent of the communication channel.<p>An encrypted communication channel between individuals and organisations allows sensitive information to be exchanged without third parties being able to read it. However, this is not sufficient, as the identity of the other party must be verified beforehand. To ensure that the contact is really a public authority, for example, we use certificates to verify their identity. Consequently, there are two levels of trust. On the lower level, there is a cryptographically secured communication channel. This is supplemented by certificates issued by different certificate authorities or trust&nbsp;domains.</p> Certificates and trust&nbsp;domains <p>The basis for trustworthiness is that the certification authority implements organisational and technical measures at an appropriate security level and establishes rules for all participants in the trust domain. The specific requirements for the certificates depend on the use case and the legal framework in which a transaction takes place. Thus, the certificates used can differ depending on the level of trust required for each use&nbsp;case.</p><p>Regulated certificate authorities act as issuers of certificates that certify the legitimacy of the domain holder and the security properties of the certificate. The signatures of the certificate authorities essentially serve to confirm the legitimacy of the certificate holder’s identity and to create trust in online data transmissions. Generic requirements for certificate authorities acting as a certification authority with the security level “high” are described by the Federal Office for Information Security of Germany in the <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/Technische-Richtlinien/TR-nach-Thema-sortiert/tr03145/tr-03145.html;jsessionid=5B3A7476B66809091192C24778EEA65C.internet481">Technical Guideline TR-03145–1</a>.</p> Certificate verification in the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet <p>We would now like to transfer the approach of certificate verification, which we have known so far from web browsers, to the world of SSI wallets and have integrated a corresponding verification concept into our Lissi Wallet (Beta). The Lissi Wallet (Beta) checks the certificates sent by the contact or agent. If an extended validation certificate is sent, the Lissi Wallet checks that the name of the contact/agent matches the name in the certificate. Only if there is a valid extended validation certificate and the name of the contact/agent matches the name in the certificate, the contact is displayed as verified.</p> Display of trusted contacts for users in Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Display of unverified and verified contacts/organisations in Lissi&nbsp;Wallet<p>When a new contact request is made, users are asked whether they want to connect to the contact. In addition to the display of whether a contact could be verified, a recommendation for action is also given to the user. Further information on the contact’s certificate can also be displayed.</p>Display contact requests, new verifications and data requests from a verifiable organisation in Lissi&nbsp;Wallet.<p>When users receive a connection request (fig. 1), a new proof (fig. 2) or a information request (fig. 3) in the Lissi Wallet, it is displayed whether the contact is verified.</p><p>The function is currently only available in the Beta version of Lissi Wallet for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android</a> and <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a>. Before the function is made available to the main version, we would like to check whether the concept of organisation certificates can also be applied to SSI wallets. As with any beta version, bugs might occur. We welcome your feedback and constructive criticism or suggestions for improvement.</p> The trade-off between self-sovereignty or maximum&nbsp;security Illustration of the spectrum of self-determination and security in an ID ecosystem.<p>Would we rather have a high level of security or self-sovereignty? Unfortunately, the two aspects are at different ends of the spectrum. If we only allow pre-verified and approved parties to retrieve identity data, as currently envisaged by the <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/eidas-and-the-european-digital-identity-wallet-context-status-quo-and-why-it-will-change-the-2a7527f863b3">eIDAS regulation</a>, this severely restricts usage.

Vorschaubild von einer Person, welche ein QR-Code mit einem Smartphone einscannt.<p>Dieser Artikel beschreibt, warum und wie die für <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> und <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android</a> verfügbare Lissi Wallet Beta Zertifikate zur Authentifizierung von Organisationen verwendet. Dieser Artikel ist auch <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/trust-in-the-digital-space-7762471351cf">auf English verfügbar</a>.</p> Das Problem <p>Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie gehen auf eine Veranstaltung und sehen kurz vor dem Eingang ein QR-Code mit der Überschrift „Hier einchecken“ zusammen mit dem Logo des Veranstalters. Als Sie den QR-Code mit Ihrer Wallet einscannen werden Sie unter anderem nach Ihren Zahlungsinformationen gefragt. Aber sollten Sie diese wirklich präsentieren?</p><p>Wenn wir mit Dritten über das Internet kommunizieren, ist es nicht immer klar, ob die andere Partei wirklich die ist, für die sie sich ausgibt. Dieses Problem besteht unter anderem auch bei etablierten Kommunikationskanälen wie Webseiten und Emails. Phishing bezeichnet das betrügerische Abgreifen von Daten, um Zugang zu Bankkonten oder Informationen zu erhalten. Daher ist ein dauerhafter Kommunikationskanal, welcher es Nutzenden ermöglicht den Kommunikationspartner eindeutig zu identifizieren besonders wichtig. Einmal angelegt ermöglicht der Kommunikationskanal einen vertrauensvollen Informationsaustausch und ist essentiell um Nutzende vor Phishing zu schützen.</p> Der Kontext ist&nbsp;wichtig <p>Wir basieren unser Vertrauen in eine Interaktion häufig in abhängig davon, in welchem Kontext mit uns kommuniziert wird. So vertrauen wir z.B. einem Link in einem internen Mitarbeiterportal mehr als einem Link in einer Werbemail. Das Prinzip ist das gleiche, wenn Nutzende eines Wallets sich mit einem neuen Kontakt verbinden und die Verbindungsanfrage im Wallet angezeigt wird. Abhängig davon, in welchem Kontext die Verbindungsanfrage initiiert wird lässt sich ein unterschiedliches Maß an Vertrauen zuweisen. Der Kontext hilft uns Vertrauen zu etablieren, ist allein jedoch nicht ausreichend. Häufig fehlt der Kontext oder Angreifer versuchen gezielt diesen Umstand auszunutzen.</p> Authentifizierung von Organisationen <p>Wallet Nutzer müssen die Möglichkeit haben Organisationen, mit welchen sie sich verbinden auf deren Authentizität zu überprüfen. Allerdings muss die Organisation zunächst identifiziert und überprüft werden. Sobald die Organisation über die erforderlichen Zertifikate verfügt, kann diese im Wallet validiert werden.</p>Stark vereinfachte Prozessbeschreibung wie Organisationen authentifiziert werden&nbsp;können.<p>Bevor eine Wallet die Organisation überprüfen kann, muss eine vertrauenswürdige Partei die Organisation zertifizieren. Zertifizierungsstellen sind Organisationen, welche die Unterzeichnung digitaler Zertifikate anvertraut werden. Sie prüfen die Identität und Legitimität des Unternehmens und der Person, die ein Zertifikat beantragt hat. Bei erfolgreicher Prüfung wird ein signiertes Zertifikat ausgestellt. Dieses Zertifikat kann dann von der Anwendung der Nutzenden wie z.B. einem Browser oder einer Wallet überprüft werden.</p> Vertrauen auf verschiedenen Ebenen Illustration, welche veranschaulicht, dass die Identifizierung unabhängig von dem Kommunikationskanal ist.<p>Ein verschlüsselter Kommunikationskanal zwischen natürlichen Personen und Organisationen ermöglicht es sensible Informationen auszutauschen, ohne dass Dritte diese mitlesen können. Dies ist jedoch nicht ausreichend, da die Identität der anderen Partei vorher überprüft werden muss. Um sicher zu stellen, dass es sich bei dem Kontakt z.B. wirklich um eine öffentliche Behörde handelt, nutzen wir Zertifikate um deren Identität zu verifizieren. Folglich, ergeben sich zwei Ebenen des Vertrauens. Auf der unteren Ebene besteht ein kryptographisch abgesicherter Kommunikationskanal. Dieser wird ergänzt durch Zertifikate, welche von verschiedenen Zertifikatsstellen bzw. Vertrauensdomänen ausgestellt werden.</p> Zertifikate und Vertrauensdomänen <p>Die Basis für Vertrauenswürdigkeit ist, dass die Zertifizierungsstelle auf einem angemessenen Sicherheitsniveau organisatorische und technische Maßnahmen implementieren und Regeln für alle Teilnehmer der Vertrauensdomäne aufstellt. Die speziellen Anforderungen an die Zertifikate sind abhängig vom Anwendungsfall und dem juristischen Rechtsrahmen, in welchem eine Transaktion stattfindet. Somit können sich die verwendeten Zertifikate abhängig vom notwendigen Vertrauensniveau je nach Anwendungsfall stark unterscheiden.</p><p>Regulierte Zertifikatsstellen agieren als Aussteller von Zertifikaten, welche die Legitimität des Inhabers der Domäne und die Sicherheitseigenschaften des Zertifikates bescheinigen. Die Signaturen der Zertifikatsstellen, dienen im Wesentlichen dazu, die Legitimität der Identität des Zertifikatsinhabers zu bestätigen und Vertrauen in Online-Datenübertragungen zu schaffen. Generische Anforderungen für Zertifikatsstellen, die als Zertifizierungsstelle mit der Sicherheitsstufe “hoch” fungieren sind vom Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) in der <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/Technische-Richtlinien/TR-nach-Thema-sortiert/tr03145/tr-03145.html;jsessionid=5B3A7476B66809091192C24778EEA65C.internet481">Technischen Richtlinie TR-03145–1</a> beschrieben.</p> Überprüfung der Zertifikate im Lissi&nbsp;Wallet <p>Den Ansatz der Zertifikatsüberprüfung, die wir bisher aus den Webbrowser kennen, möchten wir nunmehr in die Welt der SSI-Wallets übertragen und haben ein entsprechendes Überprüfungskonzept in unsere Lissi Wallet (Beta) integriert. Die Lissi Wallet (Beta) überprüft die vom Kontakt bzw. Agent gesendeten Zertifikate. Falls ein Extended Validation Zertifikat übermittelt wird, überprüft die Wallet, dass der Name des Kontakts/Agenten mit dem Namen im Zertifikat übereinstimmt. Nur wenn ein gültiges Extended Validation Zertifikat vorliegt und der Name des Kontakts/Agenten mit dessen im Zertifikat übereinstimmt, wird der Kontakt als verifiziert eingestuft und angezeigt.</p> Anzeige für Nutzende im Lissi&nbsp;Wallet Darstellung von nicht verifizierten und verifizierten Kontakten / Organisationen im Lissi&nbsp;Wallet.<p>Bei einer neuen Kontaktanfrage werden Nutzende gefragt, ob sie die Verbindung mit dem Kontakt eingehen möchten. Neben der angezeigten Information, ob ein Kontakt verifiziert werden konnte, wird auch eine Handlungsempfehlung an Nutzenden gegeben. Es können auch weitere Informationen zu dem Zertifikat des Kontakts angezeigt werden.</p>Darstellung Kontaktanfragen, neuen Nachweisen und Datenabfragen von einer verifizierbaren Organisation im Lissi&nbsp;Wallet.<p>Wenn Nutzende eine Verbindungsanfrage (Abb. 1), einen neuen Nachweis (Abb. 2) oder eine Datenabfrage (Abb. 3) im Lissi Wallet erhalten, wird angezeigt, ob der Kontakt verifiziert ist.</p><p>Die Funktion ist aktuell ausschließlich in der Beta version der Lissi Wallet für <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android</a> und <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> verfügbar. Bevor die Funktion in die Hauptversion überführt wird, möchten wir überprüfen, ob das Konzept der Organisations-Zertifikate auch für SSI-Wallets angewendet werden kann. Wie bei jeder Beta Version sind Fehler nicht ausgeschlossen. Wir freuen uns über Euer Feedback und konstruktive Kritik bzw. Verbesserungsvorschläge.</p> Die Abwägung zwischen Selbstbestimmung oder maximaler Sicherheit Darstellung des Spektrums von Selbstbestimmung und Sicherheit in einen ID-Ökosystem.<p>Möchten wir lieber ein hohes Maß an Sicherheit oder Selbstbestimmung? Leider liegen die beiden Aspekte an verschieden Enden des Spektrums.

Erlauben wir Nutzenden ihre Daten in Eigenverantwortung zu teilen bietet dies mehr Flexibilität und Freiheit, aber auch Angriffspotenziale.</p> Über Lissi: <p>Lissi bietet einfache Anwendungen für Organisationen, um vertrauenswürdige Interaktionen und Kommunikation mit Nutzenden zu ermöglichen.

  Version 1.0 of the Me2B Safe Specification for Mobile Apps and Websites is now available. It was three years in the making, and this is how we got here.

<p></p>
 The History of the Me2B Safe Spec for Respectful Technology 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Building a Safe Spec – Turn 1: The Behavior of Technology 
<p>When the Me2B Alliance first began work on a specification in 2019, it was called a “Code of Practice” for Respectful Tech. It was intended for makers of technology, businesses (or “B-s” as we call them). Our specification working group was correspondingly called the Good CoPs WG. We commenced work on developing use cases and the code of practice, but it wasn’t long before we realized a couple of things: &nbsp;</p>
 
 We were more interested in testing the behavior of technology and not the processes by which it is developed, and&nbsp; 
 we needed a much more fine-grained instrument—or set of tests,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>Focusing strictly on the behavior of technology was an important reorientation for the specification working group and for the Me2B Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our premise has always been that people are in intimate “Me2B” [aka individuals to businesses] relationships with digital products and services. In many ways, these products/services are autonomous ambassadors or agents of the organizations that built them. Therefore, these products and services should treat us “like a good friend, or at the very least a polite stranger.” Thus, our safety criteria needed to focus strictly on the behavior of the product/service. We needed to turn away from a code of practice for businesses, and toward objectively measuring the behavior of technology.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 
 Building a Safe Spec – Turn 2: Creating Context&nbsp; 
<p>As we turned our sights on specifying the behavior of technology, we quickly encountered the importance of the contextual nature of the test cases we were composing. As we attempted to characterize passing and failing behavior, we often found ourselves saying, “It depends.” We needed adequate context to reflect the reality that acceptable/passing behavior changes over the arc of the lifecycle of the Me2B Relationship. Just as acceptable behavior organically evolves in our personal relationships, it evolves in our relationships with digital products and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We needed adequate context to reflect the reality that acceptable/passing behavior changes over the arc of the lifecycle of the Me2B Relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around this time, our Me2B Relationship lifecycle model and Me2B commitments came into full clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Building a Safe Spec – Turn 3: The Aha Moment – Safety not Privacy 
<p>In our third and most recent turn, we rearchitected the entire spec around key Me2B Relationship transactions we refer to as Me2B Commitments. These commitments are points in the user experience where we are asked things like if we accept cookies, if we’ll share our location, or if we’d like to create an account. After developing tests for each of the typical commitments encountered in most digital technology, we observed common themes in our identified tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We distilled the themes present in all commitments, resulting in our first formal recommendation, “<a href="https://me2ba.org/library/recommendation-attributes-of-safe-respectful-me2b-commitments/">10 Attributes for Safe and Respectful Me2B Commitments”</a>. Most of our Specification now consists of tests evaluating the safety and respectfulness of each Me2B commitment found in the user experience of the website or mobile app. It was also during this third turn of the wheel when we also became acutely aware that we were building a safety standard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since our founding, we have never been satisfied with “privacy” as the sole scope of concern. Abuse of privacy is not the only abuse humans experience when using connected technology. As our <a href="https://ooqc943yvdw4abzes1q1ezta-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/me2ba-digital-harms-dictionary-v2.0-iii.pdf">Digital Harms Dictionary</a> illustrates, we experience myriad other harms such as coercion, manipulation, algorithmic bias (racism, sexism, ageism, etc.). We suggest that privacy is just one category of harm, one aspect of human safety. And it is too narrow a focus of concern; our scope is safety in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we look back through history, the commercial launch of every innovative technology is followed by the development of safety standards and practices. For example, seatbelts, airbags, windshield wipers, and headlights were all developed after the first commercial automobiles were in use. This pattern makes sense, as widespread adoption and practical use of new technology are required to fully comprehend the scope and nature of all the potential harms and risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, safety standards for the internet are notably lagging —likely because the harms are not as immediately obvious as those of physical products such as cars. The long delay and elusive connections between cause and effect hamper the visibility and recognition of these harms. Also, ideas of “safety” on the internet quickly turn to questions of ethics, complicating the task due to the absence of a universal ethic..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;At the Me2B Alliance, we hold the view that connected technology is not just “tools we wield”, it is a collection of intimate and interactive relationships that we maintain—as alive and immediate as the relationships we maintain with the people and institutions in our lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Me2B Alliance, we hold the view that connected technology is not just “tools we wield”, it is a collection of intimate and interactive relationships that we maintain—as alive and immediate as the relationships we maintain with the people and institutions in our lives. Using this foundational perspective of the interactive Me2B Relationship, we can look to interpersonal/social norms to provide a universal ethic: technology should treat us safely and with respect. We can hold technology to the same standards we hold people (mostly).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Rules of Engagement for the Digital World&nbsp; 
<p>As social animals, we humans have social norms developed over millennia; collective, co-created agreements (“Social Contracts”) on how we agree to treat each other in community. The Me2BA has our own interpretation of a global social contract between Me-s and B-s called the <a href="https://me2ba.org/about/principles/">Me2B Rules of Engagement</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations like the UN have the Universal Declaration of Human Rights describing universal, inherent rights for all humans. But the internet sadly was not architected to support all these rights. The creators of the internet were world-building but didn’t fully realize they were world-building, building a new medium in which to live in community. The important thing is that we are here now, and we must, for the benefit of the health of humankind and our planet, come to a clear-eyed, inclusive, and collective view on the full spectrum of harms and potential risks that are inherent in our myriad and ever-increasing digital Me2B Relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A Baseline Safety Spec&nbsp; 
<p>And that’s where our current offering, the <a href="https://me2ba.org/safetechspec/">Me2B Safe Spec for Respectful Technology for for Websites and Mobile Apps</a> comes in.&nbsp; This spec is the first of several and provides a minimal viable product for baseline safe behavior of mobile apps and websites. This open spec is a living document and will continue to be updated by the Respectful Tech Spec Working Group to address ever more of the harms identified in the Digital Harms Dictionary. We will also be working to provide specs for all connected platforms, including routers, smart TVs, smart homes, wearables, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 In Conclusion &amp; Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Our primary thesis is that safer, more respectful technology isn’t just better for people (users of technology), it’s also better for the makers of technology, resulting in stronger, more meaningful Me2B Relationships. Because that is what they are, relationships. The days of treating customers as endless sources of extractive, exploitable (monetizable) data are quickly drawing to a close as the world wakes up to the harms and price of “free” services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our safety yardstick is unwaveringly on the side of keeping Me-s safe, but it is for naught if makers of technology do not embrace and value more meaningful Me2B relationships, through safe and respectful products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know there is much more work to do, more harms and platforms for which tests must be developed. We look forward to hearing from all makers of technology and welcome your comments as you apply this standard to your mobile apps and websites. Please tell us where you think we’ve got it wrong. The behavioral bar may feel uncomfortably high. And in some cases, perhaps it is too high—but we welcome the feedback and are willing to conduct validation testing to ensure that our passing behavior criteria accurately reflect the needs of everyday people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This baseline spec is the fruit of several years and countless volunteer hours working to establish the through-line from ethical principles to objectively measurable behavior. I would like to express heartfelt thanks to the Respectful Tech Spec Working Group (nee Good CoPs WG), and all the people who have generously contributed their time and wisdom so that we now have a solid foundation for what safety is in the digital world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. We’re fast at work at adding in GDPR and CPRA mapping against our test suite and will be launching version 1.1 as quickly as we can.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 ENGIE Energy Access has successfully launched the Crowdfund for Solar platform on the Energy Web Chain to expand solar energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa <p>Zug, Switzerland — 5 May 2022 — This week, ENGIE Energy Access launched the Crowdfund for Solar platform on the Energy Web Chain, a new staking platform that allows Energy Web Token holders to support the installation of solar energy infrastructure for communities in Sub-Saharan Africa needing affordable and clean energy&nbsp;access.</p><p>We are extremely proud of our community for participating in the Crowdfund for Solar platform. The platform was 100% filled within 7 hours! Staked $EWT will be providing energy access in countries with low electrification rates like Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia, which is one of the world’s first DeFi solution that ties real-world impact and DeFi cash&nbsp;flows!</p><p>After the pool was filled up in record time, an awesome community member pointed us to a discrepancy between the total SLT minted and EWT staked in the Crowdfund for Solar platform. Since the contract was already full and staking was no longer possible, we decided to pause the contract until further notice to investigate the root cause of the unexpected issue, which was not witnessed in any of the tests before and that has not been spotted in the <a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fenergywebfoundation%2Fengie-solar-crowdfunding%2Fblob%2F111b98dd47c171ce1333d1423e9b36174d259e14%2FAudit%2520-%2520Energy%2520Web%2520AG%2520-%2520Security%2520Assessment%2520of%2520Engie%2520Solar%2520Crowdfunding%2520v2.1%2520final.pdf">official smart contract audit and review</a>. We found a minor issue that only affects the last transaction in a very specific scenario. The best and most efficient way to counter this is to keep the contract paused, especially as the pool has already been filled and staking is no longer possible. Then, as planned, participants can withdraw their funds and rewards after May 17th, 2023 (Release rewards date). This provides sufficient time to fund new solar installations and focus especially on women-led households and small and medium enterprises in countries like Rwanda, Uganda, and&nbsp;Zambia.</p><p>However, as communicated by Engie Energy Access, participants still have the chance to withdraw their original contributions without rewards in EWT until 15:00 PM CET on May 17th, 2022. Whoever decides to opt-out, should send their SLTs held in their wallet (imported from the smart contract 0x8df330b8966ebE69Be996653e50252c6D44a527a) to the Crowdfund for Solar wallet:<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0xff0E9ddB12F1082833B13E144b60df6cf04aE116/transactions">0xff0E9ddB12F1082833B13E144b60df6cf04aE116</a>. They will receive corresponding EWTs within 1 working day. For any issues with the withdrawals, please contact meerim.ruslanova@energyweb.org before 15:00 PM CET on May 17th,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>We would like to thank our community once again for the unprecedented support and contributions towards accelerating affordable clean energy in Sub-Saharan Africa with the help of&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Special and wholehearted thanks to the community member for spotting the issue early on! We were able to act swiftly thanks to the diligence of this community member!</p><p>What’s next!<br>We will shortly make a decision on which countries exactly will receive the funds for solar installations. We will publish quarterly reports depicting the progress on our website under <a href="https://crowdfund4solar.com/wallet#lendingApp">“Progress Reporting”.</a> Upon the evaluation of the current campaign, we will also explore further ways of scaling this solution.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>World Password Day was created in 2013 to help people better secure their accounts by providing tips for better password hygiene: don’t reuse passwords; use a complex, random string of letters, numbers and characters; use a password manager. At the time of its inception the intentions of this day were positive and necessary as we didn’t have more secure consumer-friendly alternatives readily available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technology and best practices have changed over the years and many now use World Password Day to encourage users to level-up their account security by enabling multi-factor authentication. This is certainly a best practice for password-based logins, but falls short of addressing the evolving threat landscape which has commercialized the ability for hackers to bypass legacy forms of MFA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we ultimately need is widespread availability of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/charting-an-accelerated-path-forward-for-passwordless-authentication-adoption/">passwordless sign-in technology</a> that is more convenient and more secure – and we have that today with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/">FIDO Authentication</a>, which is already supported in over 90% of web browsers and virtually every modern handset and computing device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March of this year the FIDO Alliance <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-multi-device-fido-credentials/">shared its vision</a> to make FIDO Authentication even more widely available and consumer-ready through the advent of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/world-password-day-had-a-good-run-now-were-celebrating-a-future-with-less-passwords/">multi-device FIDO credentials</a> (referred to by some as “passkeys”).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, as an evolution of this announcement, FIDO Alliance is excited to share that Apple, Google and Microsoft are aligned with this vision and will be implementing multi-device FIDO credentials in their respective platforms. <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">Read the press release</a> for more details.</p>



<p>From a user experience standpoint, this will be very similar to how one interacts with a password manager today to help them securely enroll and sign into websites – only it will be far more secure as the process will issue a FIDO keypair instead of a password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a service provider perspective, the availability of multi-device FIDO credentials will join the ongoing and growing utilization of security keys to allow for a full range of options for deploying modern, phishing-resistant authentication.</p>



<p>In addition to facilitating a better user experience, the broad support of this standards-based approach will enable service providers to offer FIDO credentials without needing passwords as an alternative sign-in or account recovery method. This is a critical step in helping the industry at large break its dependence on the passwords and other knowledge-based credentials which to this day are the cause of <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2019/results-and-analysis/">over 80% of data breaches</a>.</p>



<p>I am often asked when the industry will be able to get rid of passwords – to which I respond that the path towards passwordless is a journey and not a sprint. That being said, the first step on the password-less journey is to use less passwords – which is embodied by the commitment made today by the world’s largest platform providers.&nbsp; While “Less Passwords Day” doesn’t roll off the tongue as well as “World Password Day,” it certainly is a day worth celebrating!</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 29 April 2022 — <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">The Energy Web Token powered, proof-of-stake based Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain (EW-CRC) is designed to greatly enhance the cybersecurity of every Energy Web solution and identity connected to it.</a> But this is only possible if the Energy Web community has access to a robust, secure staking mechanism on EW-CRC. This is the primary reason an initial staking pool was launched in December 2021: to demonstrate how using decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials can support staking on a public blockchain.</p><p>In March 2022, a second staking pool was launched to test another important concept: figuring out a way to measure average EWT staked over time by individual users. To do so, we use “snapshots” — random checks of Energy Web Token (EWT) balances staked by each user. Snapshots enable our community to understand exactly how consistent the economic security provided by EWT staking is. Testing this concept could not be more important: the upcoming EW-CRC will use a proof-of-stake system to secure dozens of enterprise-grade solutions from around the world and protect the integrity of every digital identity connected to them. Using snapshots to incentivize consistent, long-term staking is a powerful way to increase the security of the EW-CRC; the second staking pool is the proving ground for the concept. A stable electricity grid needs committed stakeholders.</p><p>The token economic model behind EWT snapshots is simple. For future EWT staking pools and block rewards distributed by the EW-CRC protocol, reward amounts will primarily be a function of two factors: how many tokens have been staked, and for how long. This means more tokens, staked consistently for longer periods of time, equals greater rewards. Incenting consistent staking will maximize the economic security of the EW-CRC and by extension every solution and identity connected to&nbsp;it.</p><p>The remainder of this post describes how snapshots will influence EWT stakers in the second pool, in new <a href="https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/">staking pools</a> on the Energy Web Chain, and when staking on the EW-CRC. Specifically, this post describes how snapshots will be used to calculate 1) additional variable awards for the second pool stakers and 2) an EWT staking multiplier for CRC&nbsp;staking</p> Additional Variable&nbsp;Awards <p>EWT staked in the second pool currently earns a fixed annual percentage yield (APY). In the future, on EW-CRC, rewards for Validators and Patrons who stake EWT will be variable. This is because the flow of awards is a result of real-world adoption of Energy Web solutions, not an inflationary token model (<a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">for more information, please see our high-level description of the design of the EW-CRC</a>). Snapshots on the second staking pool will enable us to test variable APY rewards in anticipation of the&nbsp;EW-CRC.</p><p>The second staking pool is currently ~70% full. This means that not all EWT inside the staking pool contract will be distributed. The remaining unallocated EWT awards dating back to the launch of the second pool will be redistributed to second pool stakers using a variable APY. As described above, the objective is to reward and incentivize identities that have consistently staked EWT for longer periods of time. The amount of variable APY awards per staked EWT account will be determined by the average stake of an account as measured by the snapshots. The more tokens held by an account consistently throughout the duration of the second staking pool, the more variable APY will be awarded. The six snapshots to be taken throughout the life of the second staking pool are the trusted, verifiable measurements for how many and how consistently EWT are&nbsp;staked.</p><p>The variable APY is impossible to predict, but at a high level, the design incentivizes users to maintain fully staked EWT wallets throughout the duration of the staking pool. An example is useful to demonstrate what variable APY could be. Let’s assume in this example there will be 200,000 EWT available for redistribution via variable APY in the second staking pool and there are 2,500 wallets&nbsp;staking.</p>  If only 10% of wallets have a single snapshot and 90% have no snapshots at all and stake on average 1 EWT, they will earn an APY of 106,666% (800 EWT profit on a 1 EWT stake over 9&nbsp;months)  If all wallets have the same number of snapshots and maximum average stake (3,000 EWT), they will each earn an APY of&nbsp;3.56%  In this example, depending on the behavior of the users, individual additional variable APY would be somewhere between 3.56% and&nbsp;106,666%  <p>Please note that variable APY is on top of the fixed APY of 10.36% paid out in the second staking pool. Also, note this is an example calculation, so the numbers will differ. Experimenting with the mechanism with a guaranteed staking APY and an additional variable APY will give us great insights into how we can deploy effective token-economics to increase the security of a decentralized Energy System based on real cash&nbsp;flows.</p> EWT Staking Multiplier <p>The second incentive for the Energy Web community is to stake more EWT consistently and for longer periods of time, snapshots are also planned to be used to calculate an EWT staking multiplier. This multiplier can then be applied to future staking pools on the Energy Web Chain and on&nbsp;EW-CRC.</p><p>The EWT staking multiplier works very similarly to the variable APY calculation above: we want to reward those that have staked for longer periods of time. When we bootstrap, the new CRC stakers will benefit from having as many snapshots as possible. The reward logic is this: if a user locks up EWT for a maximum term (for example, 3 years on EW-CRC) and has the maximum number (6) of snapshots from the second staking pool, they receive the highest EWT staking multiplier. A lower lockup period or a lower number of snapshots will result in a lower multiplier.</p><p>After the lockup ends, there will be restrictions on withdrawing the reward (cooldown period) to prevent all users from withdrawing rewards at&nbsp;once.</p><p>We encourage everyone to follow official Energy Web communications channels for more updates on staking and ways to participate in the launch of the&nbsp;EW-CRC.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>In 2021, our team worked on a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-research-community-call-intersectional-approaches-to-data-and-digital-rights-advocacy/">research project to explore how social justice communities and data and digital rights (DDR) communities could collaborate more</a> effectively. As we interviewed over 50 people organising for social justice in four regions, something we have seen on a daily basis in our support work was confirmed: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/">making tech and data issues a priority isn’t simple for social justice organisations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this isn’t because these organisations aren’t interested in thinking about these topics. The majority of people we spoke to are fully aware of the challenges brought by digital technologies and the harms related to data collection. However, they find it difficult to take on the extra work of rethinking their use of tech and data, since most are overworked and tending to pressing needs from the communities they serve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, rethinking an organisation’s use of tech and data does take quite a bit of time (and resources!). But, there are low(ish) hanging fruits that you can start tackling, and in this post I want to share some ideas to inspire you to start reflecting on these themes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: In this piece, I use the terms “tech and data” and “digital technologies” to mean the platforms, devices, tools, data and websites that you might use to carry out or enhance your work.</p>



 Tech and data should strengthen your core work instead of creating an extra burden&nbsp; 



<p>This may sound counter-intuitive when you think about investing less in technology, but if you want to think about tech and data in a sustainable way, the very first thing we recommend to our partners is that instead of focusing all of your energy on “innovative tech projects”, try to think more about how tech and data could be an integral part of your existing work and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few questions that can spark this conversation:&nbsp;</p>



  What are your most pressing current needs? How can your advocacy strategies, internal processes, communications, or community organising might improve if you adopted a particular tech tool? Is a tech tool the only way to make that improvement, or are there low-tech ways to achieve the same improvement?  What kind of digital platforms do you already use for your work as a team? How did you make those tech choices in the past?  What kind of data do you collect as an organisation and why? Are there ways you want to change the way you collect and store data? (See some suggestions below!)&nbsp;  Who on your team is interested in tech and data issues and could get the others excited as well? And who on your team is the best placed to keep an eye on the ways in which tech and data, emerging technologies, and the broader tech industry affects your communities and mission?&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Again, these are big topics for sure, but we have found that organisations of many sizes, resource levels and capacities find it fruitful to start with these lines of questioning! If you need support figuring out how to do this, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">get in touch with us</a>.</p>



 Aligning your political values with your use tech and data is an ongoing process 



<p>We believe that <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/bringing-political-values-into-practical-tech-decisions-learnings-from-our-partnership-with-frida/">decisions regarding technology can have political implications for your work</a>. For example, using tech that doesn’t prioritise accessibility might result in excluding some of the people or communities that you’re working with, or using tools that don’t have strong pro-privacy design might put activists at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rethinking your tech and data practices to better fit your values (and your goals) is an iterative process that takes time. It won’t be an individual, one-time activity. As you go on this journey, you’ll review internal processes, go back to the same questions a few times, and figure out how to rearrange your use of tech and data so that they fit you better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way you can start this process is by having a conversation with your team about your organisation’s core values that you’d like to see reflected in your technical choices. What would you prioritise if you had a chance to rethink your entire tech and data infrastructure? Would you focus on safety and privacy? Open source solutions? Platforms developed by traditionally oppressed groups? Non-surveillance capitalist options? If you have a clear sense of what you want to prioritise in your tech choices as a team, it will ultimately become easier (and more strategic!) to make decisions about your digital infrastructure in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more ideas on what it means to align your values with your tech decisions, check out this <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/bringing-political-values-into-practical-tech-decisions-learnings-from-our-partnership-with-frida/">interview we did with one of our partners</a> and this blog post on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-in-the-service-of-justice/">making technical choices with an explicit focus on justice and anti-oppression</a>.</p>



 Reflecting on your data management&nbsp; 



<p>Adopting responsible data practices is one of the processes that organisations can start that can generate most positive results in their work. <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">Responsible data</a> is a concept that refers to our collective duty to prioritise and respond to the ethical, legal, social and privacy-related challenges that come from using data in advocacy and social change work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can start reflecting on your data practises with the following questions:</p>



  What data is essential for your organisation to do your job well? Are you collecting it? If yes, are you collecting just what you need or more than necessary?&nbsp;  What are the potential unintended consequences of the data you’re collecting and using? What are possible mitigation strategies? For example, if you collect and store data about human rights violations, what could happen if this data got lost? What data management practices could prevent this from happening? Or, if you work closely with activists in sensitive contexts, what could happen if this data (such as meeting notes, recordings, or spreadsheets, to name a few) ends up in the wrong hands?  What data is missing in your context that would be crucial to your work and the people you’re working with? And can you generate some of that data yourself? For example, if data about certain rights abuses would be crucial to your work, but aren’t otherwise documented or archived (such as data on war crimes or corruption in your country), how can you generate that data in a responsible and sustainable manner, without jeopardising the safety and dignity of your target groups?&nbsp;  



<p>While shifting your data management practices might take sustained investment, some of the lower hanging fruits of responsible data handling don’t require too much time. Make sure to check our tips on <a href="https://www.im-portal.org/blogs/how-to-start-your-responsible-data-journey">how to start your responsible data journey</a> and our resource <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20becoming%20RAD,a%20life%20cycle%20of%20usefulness.">Becoming RAD!</a>, for guidance on how to create a responsible process for retaining, archiving and deleting data.</p>



 Learning about the ways tech and data impact the issues you work on 



<p>In the past few years, digital technologies have helped and harmed us more than ever before. We have witnessed the ways that digital technologies are increasingly used to reinforce injustices. For those fighting for social justice, investing time and resources on understanding how tech and data impact the issues you’re working on is likely to help you better serve the communities you work with.</p>



<p>Here are some of our team’s go-to resources:</p>



  <a href="https://www.digitalrights.community/weekly-newsletter">Digital Rights Weekly Newsletter</a> by Team Community;&nbsp;  Digital rights <a href="https://www.derechosdigitales.org/participa/">news roundup</a> by Derechos Digitales;  <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/">AccessNow’s newsletter</a>;  <a href="https://meedan.com/checklist">The Checklist</a> by Meedan;  <a href="https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/briefing-the-download/">The Download</a> by MIT Tech Review;  <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/ai-decoded/">AI: Decoded</a> by POLITICO;  <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/about/">CIGI’s newsletter</a>;  And you can also <a href="http://engn.it/newsletter">sign up to our very own newsletter here</a>.  



 Make building tech and data literacy a team-wide priority 



<p>It is likely that in your organisation there are already people who are interested in these topics and maybe already working on it, which is great. One thing we try to advise our partners is to slowly build tech and data literacy across their entire team, instead of appointing certain people to “take care of the tech issues”. Digital technologies evolve quickly, as do the debates and conversations about the potential benefits and harms of using these technologies. Being the only person carrying the responsibility to keep up with such a fast-paced environment can seem daunting. So, if you’re in a leadership position and your organisation has resources for professional development and/or trainings, consider directing at least part of them towards building tech intuition across your team as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



 Create spaces for learning with colleagues and building on each other’s knowledge 



<p>One small way you can kick off the process of reflecting about your tech and data practices is by creating spaces for informal discussions and/or exchange of information about these topics. It can be as light-weight as a Slack or Mattermost channel (or an email thread, or whatever works for you). Other than contributing to building internal tech and data literacy and intuition, this space can be helpful for:</p>



  Talking about the tech and data practices the team thinks could be re-designed or tweaked to better suit your organisational goals and values;  Sharing relevant resources, things people are learning and practises they’ve seen elsewhere and think could work well for your organisation too;&nbsp;  Keeping tabs of links and resources that your team could potentially learn from.  



 Connect with other organisations, you don’t have to go through this alone! 



<p>We encourage you to find other organisations or groups in your sector and/or your region who are also working on their tech and data practices and create a dialogue with them. For example, in our research on intersectional collaborations between social justice groups and data and digital rights groups, we talked to an organisation in Mexico who is convening a group of fellow organisations in their sector, who meet periodically to exchange knowledge about the tech and data issues they are facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At The Engine Room, we act as stewards for the <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">Responsible Data Community</a>: a community of people working on sectors such as social justice and international development, developing practical ways to deal with the unintended consequences of using data in social change work and sharing approaches between leading thinkers and doers from different sectors. <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">You can learn more about (and join!) the community here</a>. We also convene the <a href="https://orgsec.community/">Organisational Security Community</a>, a resource created by and for security practitioners from all backgrounds to share useful resources and document innovative approaches to long-term security work.</p>



 Get support from our team to navigate this process!&nbsp; 



<p>We provide <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">pro-bono support</a> to organisations or individuals with resource constraints–e.g. in terms of funding or internal capacity–and with challenges that we can tackle together. Organisations with stable funding are welcome to partner with us through our research or consulting work. We work with a wide array of organisations, usually within Latin America and Africa, and our partners vary in terms of technical backgrounds–some want specific, technical advice, while others are less familiar with digital strategies and data or technology processes but eager to learn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, with support from Sigrid Rausing Trust, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/supporting-organisations-to-navigate-digital-transitions/">we’re deepening our offer of support to activists, collectives and movements – particularly those who serve marginalised communities</a> – that are facing challenges incorporating technologies in their work.</p>

<p>In Web3 protocols cryptographic keys are used for encryption and signature verification. Typically a key is split into a public and a private key and because private keys are hard to keep secure, it is considered good practice to change keys over time. This is commonly referred to as key rotation or revocation. Building protocols for doing so securely can be a challenge. In this article you will learn about the nuances of key revocation and how we approach the problem with Ceramic.</p> Double Spending and Key Rotation <p>The challenge of safely performing key rotations in Web3 data protocols has similar characteristics as the classical double spending problem. Blockchains solve this problem for financial application using a strong consistency model. Can we loosen these constraints for non-financial applications while maintaining the safety of key rotations?</p><blockquote>Double-spending is a potential flaw in a digital cash scheme in which the same single digital token can be spent more than once.</blockquote><p>A quite similar problem also arises when you simply want to perform a key rotation. A critical aspect of any protocol that involves cryptographic key material is how to manage the lifecycle of these keys. For HTTPS, which is used to secure the web today, centralized certificate authorities <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/34071.pki-certificate-revocation-process-explained.aspx">verify</a> if a given key is valid or not. </p><p>In Web3, by definition, <a href="https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81">self-certifying protocols</a> can’t rely on third party centralized authorities since authority comes from the user directly. This presents new challenges when designing the lifecycle of a cryptographic key. How can you know if a key has been revoked and should no longer be considered valid without trusting a third party authority?</p><p>In order to understand this more deeply, let’s start with some basic definitions:</p><blockquote>Key revocation - a function in the lifecycle of a cryptographic key; the point in time where proofs generated from the key are no longer considered valid.<br><br>Key rotation - Changing the key, i.e., replacing it by a new key. Typically this means that the old key would be considered revoked when the new key becomes active.</blockquote><p>Based on this we can see that there are two main things we need to consider in the lifecycle of a cryptographic key. When proofs generated by a given key (e.g. a signature) starts being valid and when they stop being valid. Let’s suppose Alice wants to generate a cryptographic identifier that is not tied to a specific cryptographic key. Instead she wants to be able to update the key which is associated with her identifier over time, i.e. she wants to be able to perform key rotations. A simple scheme for this would be to sign the new key with the old key and dispose of the old key. However, this could present a problem if the old key is not properly disposed of. Consider the following diagram:</p><p>We know by definition Public key (pk) A is authoritative. Alice rotates from pk A to pk B by signing pk B using key A. Now, if Carol is able to steal key A at some point after the rotation happened, she could establish a rotation to pk C. An outside observer Bob who learns of both pk B and pk C has no way of knowing which key to trust. This is because there is no information about when the rotations happened.</p><p>As you can see this is very similar to the double-spending problem: pk A should only be allowed to be spent (i.e. rotated) once. Blockchains solve this problem by introducing a hash linked ledger where all events in the system are notarized in one universal ordering, which is economically infeasible to reverse. This is critical for financial applications. However, it means that all nodes in the network need to process all events in order to uphold invariants on account balances. The Ethereum community has discovered that this problem can be somewhat circumvented by leveraging <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09274">data availability sampling</a> and <a href="https://ethereum.org/nb/developers/docs/scaling/#rollups">rollups</a>, but these systems are still ultimately bottlenecked by the need of <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logical centralization</a>. If our goal is merely self-certified authority of data and not the security of financial transactions, could we loosen the constraints a bit to get around this bottleneck?</p> Blockchains as timestamp machines <p>Because blockchains deal with financial transactions they have to favor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_consistency">strong consistency</a> since rollback of transactions would be detrimental to the system. However, many large scale distributed system today rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a> in order to provide timely updates and processing of events. Consider our key rotation example from above. Our main goal is to establish that the key rotation that happened at the earliest point in time should be the valid rotation. If we rely on eventual consistency we could imagine Bob first seeing the rotation to pk C which happened at time N+2, and only later learning about the rotation to pk B which happened at time N+1.</p><p>This means that as long as Alice is able to prove that her key rotation happened before Carol’s key rotation, Bob will eventually learn about this (e.g. through some p2p gossip, network architecture is out of scope for this article). An interesting consideration here is that Alice herself could create two key rotations. The first one she keeps secret and the second one she makes public. At some later point in time she could reveal the secret rotation, invalidating all signatures created by the latter key. In a financial type application this would be very problematic since it would enable double spends. However, from the perspective of a self-certifying data protocol Alice would only be revoking her own data that was signed by the second key. In many cases this would only damage herself. For example, if she has built up a strong reputation over time and revokes this data her reputation would be lost. Note that care should be taken if there is a system that produces on-chain decisions based on Alice’s data. Protocols that do this might want to introduce data availability checks at the point of decision and potential cryptoeconomic penalties for cheating.</p><p>So how can we timestamp these events without putting them through the expensive logical centralization of a blockchain? First let’s consider why this logical centralization is expensive. In order to solve the double spend problem, a blockchain fulfills two properties to prevent double spends: data ordering and “proof of non-publication”. The latter is very expensive since it requires all nodes to agree on all data (e.g. transactions) included throughout the history of the blockchain. In an eventual consistent system we only need ordering, which is less expensive. It is fairly straight forward to timestamp data leveraging a blockchain without putting all of the data on-chain: (1) gather events (e.g. pieces of data, transactions) off-chain, (2) use these events to build a merkle tree (or any sort of vector commitment), and (3) make a transaction on-chain which includes the root of the tree. If Bob is now presented with an event and a merkle witness of on-chain inclusion he can trustlessly verify the timestamp of this event as long as he is at least running a light client of the given blockchain.</p> Key revocation in Ceramic <p>In Ceramic the timestamp proofs described above are called anchors, i.e. an anchor is a merkle witness that proves that a certain event existed at time N. Shown in the diagram below is a simplified example of a data structure on Ceramic where Alice produces data and rotates her key. Here, N+X refers to the wall clock time as observed in the block on which the anchor transaction was included (block number could also be used). If Bob first observes event A, B, E, and F, he would consider all of these valid. When he eventually learns of event C and D he would dismiss event E and F.</p><p>These anchors are also useful if a key has temporary authorization to write to some data structure. For example, when granting temporary write access to a session key, its authorization should automatically be revoked at some point in the future. By using an anchor we can prove that a particular event produced by a session key happened before this session keys authorization was expired. A concrete example of this is <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/">CACAO</a> which is an example of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">Object Capability</a>. CACAO can be used to grant a specific public key temporary access to some specified resources, which is useful if we want to build a granular access control system. Consider the example below, where a CACAO is issued from Alice (the controller) to Bob:</p><p>The CACAO has an expiry date equal to N+2. Any outside observer can easily verify that the signature for Event B was produced before time N+2 because the timestamp from the anchor proves this. However, after time N+2 has passed it would be impossible for Bob to produce an anchor of Event C earlier then time N+2. The CACAO has thus been effectively revoked.</p> <p>This article outlined how the strict ordering of blockchains can be paired with a more flexible approach to data availability, enabling eventually consistent protocols that are self-certifying. Ceramic utilizes this approach to create an ecosystem of composable data.</p><p>Thanks to everyone who provided feedback on this post: Christian Lundkvist, Brooklyn Zelenka, Carson Farmer, Irakli Gozalishvili, Oliver Terbu, Robert Drost, Adin Schmahmann, and Mircea Nistor.</p>

 How Energy Web and ENGIE Energy Access leverage crypto to expand solar energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa <p>New crowdfunding platform will provide low-cost finance for clean energy projects in Africa — and Energy Web Token holders can take&nbsp;part</p><p>Zug, Switzerland — 27 April 2022 — This month, Energy Web will launch Crowdfund for Solar alongside ENGIE Energy Access, a new staking platform that will allow Energy Web Token (EWT) holders to support the installation of solar energy infrastructure for energy-deficient communities in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p><a href="http://crowdfund4solar.com/">Get involved</a><br>The link to the staking platform is live <a href="http://crowdfund4solar.com/">here</a>! Find the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRmKdNjk_zQ">tutorial on how to stake your Energy Web Tokens</a> through the Crowdfund4Solar platform.</p><p>The energy challenge in Africa<br>Africa has an abundant solar resource — yet many regions of the continent, particularly remote and rural areas, lack adequate electrification. Around 621 million people in Africa, or two-thirds of the population, currently have no access to electricity.</p><p>While solar energy naturally forms a part of the solution here, given its nature as a distributed energy resource that can operate independently of a centralised power grid, there is a barrier to uptake in balancing the need for affordability with creating the most high-quality, durable and long-lasting solar solutions.</p><p>This partnership has the potential to open up access to clean energy to many more communities in Africa because it increases the affordability of top-quality solar devices. Through the decrease in financing costs that this crowdfunding will create, ENGIE Energy Access can increase the number of lives it impacts — supporting communities to sustainably move from dangerous and dirty energy sources such as kerosene to clean, reliable&nbsp;energy.</p><p>How is Energy Web helping?<br>We’re working with ENGIE Energy Access to launch Crowdfund for Solar, a new platform that will provide low-cost finance for the deployment of solar home systems (SHS) to communities across Africa. ENGIE Energy Access is the leading provider of solar and mini-grid solutions in Africa, and has already delivered renewable energy to 7 million people across 9 countries to date. It is also one of the founding members of the Energy Web Foundation, making ENGIE one of Energy Web’s longest-running partners.</p><p>Crowdfund for Solar, which Energy Web is building in partnership with ENGIE Energy Access and operating using Energy Web’s open-source technology stack, will allow participants to stake EWT in exchange for a fixed return. The crowdfunding will be launched on May 4th, 2022 for a two-week pilot period, with an investment target of USD $100,000. This target has been set to show proof-of-concept and will be scaled up if successful.</p><p>Investing the money raised from EWT stakers, ENGIE Energy Access will deploy its high-quality and expandable SHS to those in need of energy in countries across Sub-Saharan Africa. The initial stake funds the solar installation, which is then paid back under a lease-to-own model, paid for in affordable installments at a lower daily installment rate than would otherwise be possible.</p><p>Energy: an essential need<br>For energy-deficient households, schools, and small businesses in Africa, having access to accessible, low-cost energy solutions is transformative. It brings families out of the dark and into the light, with clean power to read and work in the evening and enjoy modern conveniences such as radios, TVs, and fans. It increases economic prosperity by providing productive use of appliances to start businesses. Solar energy is the clean and viable alternative to oil lamps and candles that damage health, pose a fire hazard, and are expensive to use in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>ENGIE Energy Access will utilize the Crowdfund for Solar investment to deploy SHS in countries like Rwanda and Zambia, which exhibit particularly low electrification rates (at around 40%). In addition to working with the energy-deficient communities, Crowdfund for Solar will aim to prioritize women among the recipients, with the target of at least 30% of the loans going to women-led households. Once the pilot period finishes, a full report will be published on the outcome of the financing, with verification provided for the demographic target for the&nbsp;loans.</p><p><a href="http://crowdfund4solar.com/">Get involved</a><br>The link to the staking platform is live <a href="http://crowdfund4solar.com/">here</a>! Find the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRmKdNjk_zQ">tutorial on how to stake your Energy Web Tokens</a> through the Crowdfund4Solar platform.</p><p>By staking EWT, you will receive Solar Loan Tokens (SLTs) in exchange, a proof token that can be exchanged or transferred separately. In one year’s time, stakers will have the opportunity to exchange their SLT back for a 10% return on their investment, with the knowledge that they made a positive contribution to expanding access to clean&nbsp;energy.</p><p>This new platform is an exciting way to harness the power of decentralized finance to create a crucial impact in the world. Following this pilot period, Crowdfund for Solar has the potential to scale up and support ENGIE Energy Access in its vital mission to provide clean power to millions of more people throughout Africa.</p><p>So let’s get ready to stake EWT and contribute to equitable energy&nbsp;access!</p><p>You can read more about ENGIE Energy Access’ mission&nbsp;<a href="https://engie-energyaccess.com/">here.</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>Bonifii and Entersekt Announce New Context-Aware Authentication Solution for Credit Unions</p>
<p>Provides context-aware biometric authentication technology to boost security and deliver seamless UX</p>
<p>Denver, CO and Atlanta, GA [April 21, 2022] – Bonifii and Entersekt today announced a new partnership bringing context-aware authentication technology to credit unions through MemberPass Express, powered by Entersekt. MemberPass is the first KYC-compliant member-controlled digital identity issued by credit union cooperatives. With the addition of Entersekt’s technology, members will be protected by best-of-breed authentication technology. The solution provides members with a superior user experience, enabling them to authenticate themselves on any channel in less than 10 seconds.</p>
<p>With MemberPass Express, credit union members will be able to seamlessly authenticate their identity using biometrics when doing an e-commerce transaction, visiting a branch, contacting a call center, or logging in to online or mobile banking – all with a consistent user experience. A pilot project with two initial credit unions is already in progress.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to work with Bonifii to bring Entersekt’s expertise in context-aware <a href="https://bit.ly/3L1VhsS">passwordless authentication</a> to credit unions. The joint new solution leverages artificial intelligence to protect members from fraud by analyzing the context (such as identity, behavior, location, device, and channel) of each user journey in real time. This informs the most appropriate member authentication method that will be used, and means that members will now benefit from industry-leading authentication, while enjoying a fast and smooth user experience,” says Schalk Nolte, CEO at Entersekt.</p>
<p>Entersekt’s solutions have long been characterized by a strong, secure platform that becomes a springboard for innovative user journeys. The company has a strong track record with over ten years’ experience in financial services: its technology is used by numerous banks, payment processors, insurance companies and other financial institutions worldwide, securing over 1 billion events every month.</p>
<p>“Leveraging Entersekt’s vast expertise in this space, MemberPass Express provides credit unions with a revolutionary solution for authenticating members’ identities. It will bring members peace of mind when transacting, and offer them a very quick and seamless user experience,” says John Ainsworth, president and CEO of Bonifii.</p>
<p>““We are committed to creating a world-class experience while protecting the nation’s credit union members from becoming victims of fraudulent activity, and we believe we’ve done just that in MemberPass Express. The partnership between Bonifii and Entersekt is a game changer in streamlining the member authentication experience,” adds Barbra Lowman, president of CUNA Strategic Services.</p>

<p>Bonifii Selects Mastercard as Preferred Open Banking Provider </p>
<p>Credit unions to access consumer-permissioned data for faster, more accurate underwriting </p>
<p>DENVER, April 25, 2022 – <a href="https://bonifii.com/">Bonifii</a> today announced that is has selected <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html">Mastercard</a>, through its wholly owned subsidiary <a href="http://www.finicity.com/">Finicity</a>, as the preferred open banking provider for its MemberPass® credit unions to access consumer-permissioned bank data, to inform underwriting for different loan types across mortgage, auto, personal and small business.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>MemberPass, powered by Bonifii, is a digital ID that uses distributed ledger technology and FIDO privacy principles, currently issued by credit unions. FIDO technical specifications state that a FIDO device must not have a global identifier visible across websites, which helps to prevent unwanted and unexpected re-identification of a FIDO user. With the help of Mastercard, Bonifii members can add consumer-permissioned data in addition to the MemberPass digital identity solution to help individuals access capital securely.</p>
<p>“MemberPass is the gold standard in the digital identity market, and as Bonifii’s preferred open banking provider, Mastercard will enable credit unions to step into the digital frontier through the use of consumer-permissioned data,” said Bonifii’s CEO John Ainsworth. “This will complement the current credit rating system by leveraging verification of income and assets for auto, personal and mortgage lending.”</p>
<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform can deliver verification of income, asset, and employment reports directly to credit unions during the underwriting process, all built with consumer-permissioned data from the borrower. This technology enables credit unions to offer a digital-first method through which their borrowers can instantly provide the required information that the credit union needs to make a lending decision and replaces manual processes historically associated with the underwriting process for both the borrower and the lender.</p>
<p>“Mastercard’s open banking technology provides a growth opportunity for credit unions to expand account opening, lending and loan servicing”, said Andy Sheehan, EVP, U.S. Open Banking at Mastercard. “Mastercard’s ability to immediately verify account information, via open banking technology and consumer-permissioned data, will be imperative for competitive financial institutions, and digitizing account verification to enhance and better inform underwriting methods will play a critical role in the future of loan processing.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard’s open banking technology also reduces the potential for fraud and other time-consuming inaccuracies that credit union underwriters face daily. Together, Bonifii and Mastercard will allow for a more safe, secure and private opportunity for consumers to permission their data to verify identity and account ownership during the lending process.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland, 22 April 2022 — Over the past several months our team has conducted a detailed design exercise to finalize the architecture of the upcoming <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/parity-technologies-and-energy-web-partner-to-launch-new-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-205e66529441">Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain</a> in close partnership with Parity technologies. As we move closer to bringing the network to life, our team is excited to share an update with the broader Energy Web community about this crucial evolution of Energy Web technology.</p><p>At the highest level, our vision is for the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain to become a decentralized global network that secures and validates a) hundreds of millions of identities representing people, organizations, and devices from across the globe and b) application-specific blockchains powering enterprise-grade software solutions.</p><p>This post describes the current design of the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain, how it works, its similarities to the Polkadot Relay Chain, and the token economic model behind the new blockchain.</p> Energy Web Solutions, Explained <p>The Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain, or EW-CRC for short, is focused on bringing to market three specific solutions that Energy Web, in partnership with energy companies around the world, has developed since our founding in 2017. These solutions represent areas where decentralized technology — in Energy Web’s case a mix of public blockchains, decentralized identifiers, Energy Web Tokens, and decentralized software architectures — can create significant business value for enterprises. We believe the decentralized multi-tenant environments required for these solutions are only possible with public blockchain technologies, and we see more and more enterprises ready to embrace&nbsp;them.</p> The three solutions are:   Switchboard, our enterprise-focused self-sovereign identity, and access management solution built on the W3C administered decentralized identifier standard. Examples of existing real-world implementations include <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/24/2409355/0/en/Stedin-the-Dutch-Distribution-System-Operator-Announces-Partnership-with-Energy-Web-to-Explore-the-Future-of-Asset-Management.html">Stedin’s identity and access management solution</a>, <a href="https://www.smart-energy.com/industry-sectors/energy-grid-management/california-iso-turns-to-blockchain-to-enhance-flexibility-alerting/">CAISO flex alert</a>, and our work with <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/mastercard-energy-web-partner-with-vodafones-new-iot-blockchain/">Vodafone</a>, <a href="https://kigen.com/resources/press-releases/kigen-kore-energyweb-esim-smartgrid/">Kigen, and KORE wireless</a>.  Decentralized data exchange hubs enable different combinations of energy companies, prosumers, and individual devices (e.g., electric vehicles, batteries) to exchange and process granular data in a secure, trustworthy, and decentralized way. Implementation examples include <a href="https://energyweb.org/aemo/">Project EDGE</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/australian-energy-market-operator-partners-with-energy-web-on-project-symphony-a-future-proofed-c3e48390d338">Project Symphony</a>, and all <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/01/27/2374168/0/en/Elia-Successfully-Demonstrates-TSO-visible-EV-Charging-in-Collaboration-With-Energy-Web-and-BMW-Group.html">e-mobility related work in Western Europe with Elia&nbsp;Group</a>.  Green proof platforms, our solution focused on enabling next-generation traceability for low, zero, or negative carbon supply chains. Our primary work in this area is focused on renewably mined cryptocurrency, 24/7 renewable energy matching, and sustainable aviation&nbsp;fuel.  <p>In our new architecture, each of these solutions — and the digital identities associated with them — are secured via the EW-CRC. The high-level architecture diagram below paints a&nbsp;picture.</p> Security layer: securing application-specific blockchains and digital identities <p>Similar to the Polkadot Relay chain, the EW-CRC will be a decentralized, proof-of-stake blockchain. EW-CRC validators are organizations and/or individuals who have staked a large number of Energy Web Tokens — the existing native utility token of the Energy Web Chain. Energy Web Token staking will also determine governance on&nbsp;EW-CRC.</p><p>Just like Polkadot, Validators on EW-CRC secure the state of every blockchain connected to it. These blockchains, called parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem, each have their own governance and token economic configurations. For EW-CRC, we won’t have parachains. Instead, we will have solutions, many of which will be powered by their own application-specific blockchains behind the scenes. These solutions will make it possible for individual enterprises or consortias to govern their own applications and, if they choose, deploy additional tokens on application-specific blockchains embedded within the solutions.</p><p>Importantly, validators on EW-CRC secure more than the blockchains underneath. EW-CRC validators will also be performing a crucial identity resolution service. This service ensures that the process of issuing verifiable credentials to or from any digital identity connected to the Energy Web stack is secure and can be trusted. Given the importance of identity, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable credentials in our work at Energy Web, securing these identities and the surrounding attributes is perhaps the single most important function of a public blockchain. This is the primary service delivered by validators on&nbsp;EW-CRC.</p><p>This architecture extends the shared security benefit of the Polkadot Relay Chain beyond blockchain by applying it to the identities underlying each solution in the Energy Web ecosystem. By doing so, we produce a major cybersecurity benefit — especially when combined with proof-of-stake and smart token economic&nbsp;design.</p> Solution layer: transitioning business processes onto the blockchain <p>Within each solution, the Energy Web team is configuring application-specific blockchains to perform useful work relevant to the business application of our global community of energy companies. Over the coming months, we will provide additional detail on how and why we embed crucial business functions within a decentralized blockchain protocol. This innovation — decentralizing a business function and making it possible for multiple market participants to verify that a specific piece of work is being accurately performed — is the bleeding edge of blockchain innovation in an enterprise setting; it is one of the key differentiators of Energy Web solutions from traditional centralized and siloed software architectures, and we look forward to sharing more detail on this topic with the community soon.</p><p>We intend to bring three initial solutions to market under the EW-CRC test network. They include a production version of the <a href="https://shareandcharge.com/open-charging-network/">Open Charge Network</a> via a decentralized data exchange hub, our work in <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/aemo/">Australia on Project EDGE</a>, and a green proof platform called, “Green Blocks” focused on helping cryptocurrency miners become 100% renewable. Additional detail on each of these solutions will be released later this&nbsp;year.</p> Enterprise user layer: combining as-a-service payments with good token economics <p>Energy Web solutions unlock business value for market participants in a variety of different ways. And since open-source decentralized software requires a number of services in order to run in a production environment, businesses need a simple way to pay for these services, similarly to any (centralized) software offered “as-a- service”.</p><p>We aim to make it easy and simple for enterprises to pay and access any solution connected to the EW-CRC. Furthermore, we intend to do so using a novel token model that combines an easy enterprise experience with good token economics.</p><p>The new model uses two tokens. One is a new stable coin-like native utility token called the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain token (CRT); the other is the existing Energy Web Token — the staking and governance token of&nbsp;EW-CRC.</p><p>Here’s how it works: enterprise users pay in fiat (government-issued currencies like USD, EUR, CHF, etc.) to access solutions. Our aim is to mimic how enterprises pay for access to traditional software-as-a-service solutions today. Fiat revenues from enterprises will be converted to the native token of the EW-CRC, CRT, a stable coin-like token pegged to a fiat currency.</p><p>CRT payments from enterprises are then automatically distributed in two ways. First, a percentage is paid directly to EW-CRC validators for the services they provide. Second, the remainder is used to further enhance the integrity and economic security of the EW-CRC by automatically acquiring and staking Energy Web Tokens — the staking and security token of the EW-CRC — against EW-CRC validators.</p><p>In addition to being simple to administer and explain, this model has the effect of further securing enterprise solutions with each as-a-service payment made, unlocking even more business value along the way. With such a design, more solutions with more economic activity taking place on them translates directly to an increase in security for all solutions connected to&nbsp;EW-CRC.</p><p>Over the coming weeks and months, our team will continue to provide updates to the Energy Web community about EW-CRC, ways to get involved with the launch of the test Consortia Relay Chain, application-specific blockchains, and eventually the production network.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. Our Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) enables any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors the EW-DOS tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">Securing the Energy Transition with the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome back from the holiday break. I hope that you and your whanau were able to relax, re-energise and share good times.&nbsp; Last week saw the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/dmsdocument/229~towards-a-digital-strategy-for-aotearoa-summary-of-public-engagement/html">Summary of Public Engagement of the Digital Strategy for Aotearoa discussion document</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/dmsdocument/193~towards-a-digital-strategy-for-aotearoa/html">original document itself was released in Q4 2021</a>&nbsp;to invite kōrero and submissions, despite the challenges that COVID-19 presented for public engagement of this nature.<br><br>Kudos to Digital Identity NZ (DINZ)&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-members/">members</a>&nbsp;DIA and MBIE forming part of the cross agency team managing the process, and DINZ members&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bnz.co.nz/">BNZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://internetnz.nz/">InternetNZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/">Microsoft</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.education.govt.nz/">Ministry of Education</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/">PaymentsNZ</a>&nbsp;as well as others who supported submissions. Naturally we are grateful to our national coordinator&nbsp;<a href="https://nztech.org.nz/">NZTech</a>, and fellow associations&nbsp;<a href="https://aiforum.org.nz/">AIForum</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://fintechnz.org.nz/">FinTechNZ</a>&nbsp;for their submissions. The fact that these organisations were able to make a submission at all, bears testament to their dedication, since there were multiple calls for submissions in force simultaneously. One large private sector member with a broad scope of interest and operations remarked to me that it was dealing with six submissions in the last quarter of 2021, and I was aware that several other members in Financial Services were working on four.</p>



<p>Development of the Strategy itself is an essential baseline from which we can measure our progress over time towards those well considered goals. Of course, in order to deliver on the strategy and build a trusted digital economy more generally, digital identity is a critical dependency. And yet, digital identity was mentioned less than a handful of times, symptomatic of both the challenge and the opportunity for DINZ members to raise the level of understanding in society of the critical role that digital identity plays.</p>



<p>The draft Digital Strategy calls out the need for additional mahi on several fronts and I’m privileged to say that DINZ members are embarking on courageous and challenging work to answer that call.</p>



<p>April 2022 heralds the opening of DINZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Uses of Digital Identity working group</a>&nbsp;(IEUDI) – a broadly scoped initiative focussed on developing a code of conduct that designers and developers of digital services can use to help ensure they meet the needs of a wide spectrum of society in Aotearoa. DINZ expects to also engage non profit organisations and subject matter experts with deep familiarity on these challenges. Please<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">&nbsp;apply</a>&nbsp;to join now!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In closing let me add that, after a Covid-impacted 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2020/07/DINZ-Scrolling-Infographic-July-2020-FINAL.pdf">DINZ’s annual Consumer Research</a>&nbsp;that tracks consumer attitudes to digital identity over time, is seeking sponsors in order for it to commence in 2022.

<p></p>
 In <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18810385.scottish-schools-must-crack-code-digital-learning/">an interview</a> with The Herald Kraig Brown of the Digital Xtra Fund explains why it is essential to begin learning computing from primary school age. 
<p>Written shortly after the publishing of the <a href="https://codethefuture.scot/mark-logan-cs-emergency/">Logan Review report</a> Kraig positively supports its’ recommendations but believes it needs to go further.</p>
<p>“Logan talks about treating computing science like maths and formally teaching it from first year at secondary school”, he says. “I’m particularly interested in how we approach digital skills at the primary school level.</p>
<p>“The report should have included another recommendation stating that a focused and coordinated campaign to upskill all primary school teachers in Scotland in digital skills needs to be undertaken, starting at P5-P7.”</p>
<p>He also believes it is very important to establish linkages between teachers and industry, but also that this is a significant challenge, and so the key is to involve them in extra-curricular activities such as coding clubs.</p>
 Coding Clubs – Inspiring Scotland’s Future Digital Makers 
<p>The <a href="https://www.digitalxtrafund.scot/">Digital Xtra Fund</a> is a Scottish charity with a mission to inspire young people about technology and computing science through the positive promotion of the opportunity it offers.</p>
<p>Due to the generous support of their <a href="https://www.digitalxtrafund.scot/industry/">industry partners</a> such as AWS, Baillie Gifford, CGI, Chroma Ventures and JP Morgan as well as many more, Digital Xtra Fund has awarded £725,000 to 102 initiatives across Scotland and helped over 35,000 young people have meaningful engagements with tech to date. The Edinburgh Reporter <a href="https://theedinburghreporter.co.uk/2017/11/digital-xtra-fund-continues-to-inspire-scotlands-future-digital-makers-2/">describes</a> that they are inspiring Scotland’s future digital makers.</p>
<p>The key infrastructure required to engage kids into programming are coding clubs, and the Digital Xtra Fund plays a critical role in enabling them.</p>
<p>For example with their support West College Scotland set up the <a href="https://www.digitalxtrafund.scot/wcs-rcc/">Renfrewshire Coding Clubs</a>, to inspire young people to become the next generation of coders and technologist, through a programme of extracurricular activities, a network of college STEM Ambassadors, and a CPD programme to engage teachers in the local community.</p>
<p>Brendan Dick, BT Scotland director, said: “BT is right behind Digital Xtra Fund because we believe every young Scot needs to learn digital skills as a basic along with reading and writing.”</p>
 Coding Clubs Blueprint 
<p>Renfrewshire and other schools supported by Digital Xtra form a blueprint for others to emulate.</p>
<p>Senior staff from the College’s computing faculty work with a team of West College Scotland STEM Ambassadors to run the weekly clubs, recruited from the College’s HNC and HND students. This provides the students with a unique opportunity to share their knowledge and enthusiasm for computing science with school pupils, while giving the college students valuable work experience that supports their current studies and their future careers in STEM.</p>

		 
			 
				
 
 CPD sessions delivered in association with Microsoft Education. <a href="https://codethefuture.scot/minecraft-next-generation/">Minecraft is a key tool</a> for engaging children into new learning models. 
 Support from <a href="https://microbit.org/">The Micro:bit Foundation</a>, who donated 500 micro:bits to this project, which allows them to learn to code using a block programming-type language and create games, graphics, and sounds, giving each teacher their own classroom set to help make coding in the classroom fun and easy. 
 Sessions on virtual reality tools held at West College Scotland’s Virtual Reality Lab on their Paisley Campus. Vendors like <a href="https://codethefuture.scot/avantis-world/">Avantis</a> are pioneering a ‘Metaverse’ approach to digital learning. 
 <a href="https://www.digitalxtrafund.scot/southmuir-1/">Southmuir Primary School</a> is building a STEM workforce of the future thanks to its coding club for girls. 
 <a href="https://www.digitalxtrafund.scot/youthlink-1/">Digital makerspaces</a> provide a way for youth workers to engage with young people, supporting them to learn key skills around coding and computer science.

<p>The Energy Web Chain Validator code of conduct defines operational, governance, and token economic responsibilities of Validator organizations</p><p>Zug, Switzerland, 14 April 2022 — Energy Web’s Validators are proud to announce the first phase of the <a href="https://validator-dashboard.sandbox.energyweb.org/index.html">EWC Validator Dashboard</a>, a first-of-its-kind tool that significantly enhances transparency into the Validators’ operational and governance activities. The dashboard not only helps the Energy Web community better understand the roles and responsibilities of Validator organizations, but also enables Validators to hold themselves and their peers accountable for adhering to the EWC <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/technology/the-stack/trust-layer-energy-web-chain/energy-web-chain-governance">Validator Code of&nbsp;Conduct</a>.</p><p>Summary<br>The EWC Validators voted to adopt a formal Code of Conduct in 2020 in order to establish clear standards for behavior across all three domains and strengthen community trust in the Energy Web Chain’s Proof of Authority consensus model, which relies on the reputation of Validators to maintain credibility.</p><p>To further improve transparency and enforcement of the Code, the EWC Validator community began developing a prototype dashboard in late 2021. Following months of iterative design and development, EWC Validator Dashboard is now in a public beta release. The dashboard is intended to highlight the contributions of Validator organizations to the EWC community, as well as automatically and objectively monitor Validators’ performance against Node Health, Governance &amp; Community Participation, and EWT Block Reward Requirements of the&nbsp;Code.</p><p>Using data from the <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/">EWC block explorer</a>, the Dashboard currently provides a detailed view into real-time and historical performance of each node, as well as an overview of validators’ EWT block reward stewardship as outlined in the Code. In the coming weeks, the dashboard will be enriched with new sources of data and additional visualizations to paint a more complete picture of validator performance and its broader impact on the EWC community.</p><p>Background &amp; Initial Release<br>In December 2021 the EWC validators voted to amend the Code with more specific requirements related to Node Health, Governance &amp; Community Participation, and EWT Block Reward stewardship in order to establish a more objective monitoring and enforcement mechanism. Since then, a validator subcommittee has worked to gather requirements and launch the initial version of the dashboard using publicly-available data from the EWC block explorer.</p><p>Due to the structure of the block explorer database, some metrics were not possible to derive and display for the initial version of the dashboard. Most notably, metrics related to the Minimum Balance Requirement of the Code are currently excluded because of data quality anomalies (persistent empty or missing records for certain addresses and dates in daily account balance tables), and metrics related to Governance and Community Participation are currently excluded due to challenges collecting and structuring relevant data from multiple externals sources into the dashboard backend. Validators and Energy Web are currently working together to address these limitations and expect to resolve the challenges in subsequent releases of the dashboard throughout Q2.</p><p>All users should note that in the beta release, there are two known issues that may impact user experience:</p>  Some browsers may throw an error when loading data or fail to load the page; the most common resolution is to clear the cache and reload the page. Based on testing, the most reliable browsers are Chrome, Firefox, and Brave. Issues occur more frequently in Safari and&nbsp;Edge.  The dashboard metrics and visuals are derived from the EWC explorer database, and for performance, reasons are updated either hourly or daily; users may encounter brief periods of data gaps if accessing the dashboard while data is refreshing.  <p>Energy Web Chain Validator Node Dashboard<br>The metrics and visualizations in the dashboard align with the operational, governance, and Energy Web Token stewardship requirements outlined in the Code. In the current beta release, the dashboard displays metrics related to the Node Health and EWT Block Reward requirements as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The Validator Node Health Status canvas provides a near-real-time (hourly look back) view of each node’s operational status (i.e. whether it is validating blocks consistently or not). Based on the current number of validators in the PoA consensus round and the EWC network's 5-second block time, each node is expected to validate at least 14 blocks per hour. Nodes that have validated at least 14 blocks in the last hour are considered healthy. If a node fails to achieve that threshold, the Validator receives a series of automated alerts; prolonged unplanned node outages are counted towards the Node Health requirement of the&nbsp;Code.    The Reliability Score canvas provides a longer-term (30-day look back) view of each node’s operational performance and benchmarks it against the top-performing nodes in the network. There is natural variation in the number of blocks validated due to regular maintenance and minor issues, but assuming all nodes are performing well, then they should be within a relatively narrow range. “Best-in-class” performance is defined as the average number of blocks validated by the 5 top-performing nodes in the last month. All other nodes are assigned a reliability score of “Excellent” if their number of blocks validated is at least 90% of best-in-class, “Good” if the number is between 80–90%, and “Poor” if it is less than&nbsp;80%.    The Historical Block Production canvas shows the total number of blocks ever validated by each node. This metric isn’t relevant for EWC operations, but it’s a useful tool for demonstrating how long each validator has been an active participant in the community. The greater the number of blocks validated, the longer the Validator has been&nbsp;active.    The Time Requirement canvas tracks eligibility of validators to liquidate EWT as described in the code (i.e. whether or not validators have been active for at least six months). Eligibility is calculated by querying the first block ever validated by each node and comparing that block number to the most recent block validated. If the difference is greater than ~3 million (roughly the number of blocks that occur in six months), then the Validator has met this requirement.    The Rent-Seeking Requirement canvas tracks transfers from validator addresses (node or payout) to known exchanges and aligns with the Rent-Seeking Requirement of the Code (i.e. eligible validators may transfer a maximum of 10% of their total reward balance in any given 30-day&nbsp;period).  <p>Next Steps<br>This month the validators will be launching a quarterly Governance &amp; Community Participation (i.e. Developing Projects &amp; Applications, Contribution to open-source EW-DOS source code, Contributing to Governance Proposals, Contributing to Community Fund Proposals, Community Building) survey that collects qualitative information related to activities in the EWC community beyond node operations in a standardized format that can be easily imported into the dashboard. The EWC Validator Technical Committee is also developing a solution to address the data quality gaps related to the Minimum Balance Requirement. These metrics, along with continued improvements in design, will be incorporated into subsequent releases of the dashboard in Q2 of this&nbsp;year.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

 Growing the Community 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/2022-Q1-community.png">
    
</a></p>

<p>The first goal of Blockchain Commons is to create a community: an actual commons. We saw notable advancement on that objective this quarter, a positive sign that the commons is truly gelling.</p>

<p>New Patrons. We want to offer a welcome to our newest sustaining patrons, <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> and <a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a>. Each of them brings exciting new opportunities to the commons: CrossBar with silicon solutions and Proxy with a long-time focus on identity. Continued thanks also to our existing sustaining sponsors such as <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blockchainbird/bird">Blockchainbird</a>, <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a>, and <a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained Capital</a> and to our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">other supporters on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>New Possibilities. The variety of expertises within the commons is creating synergy for all of our patrons and other participants, as Blockchain Commons is able to introduce members to each other and work with everyone to develop use cases and specifications that meet all of their needs. In particular, as a result of CrossBar joining our community we’ve been hosting dialogues about the future of secure silicon: what features it can support, and what other possibilities the future holds. We’ll be expanding on that in the near future with a virtual salon.</p>

<p>New Contributions. Q1 also saw an entirely independent software contribution. <a href="https://github.com/Sjlver">Jonas Wagner</a> created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool.info">seedtool.info</a>, a version of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli">seedtool-cli</a> that is accessible <a href="http://seedtool.info/">via the web</a> and built using WebAssembly (as opposed to less secure JavaScript implementations). We appreciate the contribution and how it improves the accessibility of seed usage, but even more we appreciate Jonas’ interest in becoming part of our open-source community. (Thanks Jonas!) We look forward to more contributions of this sort.</p>

 Developing Specifications 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/2022-Q1-vectors.png">
    
</a></p>

<p>By working with the commons community, we’re able to not just discover the needs of our members, but also develop specifications that both serve those needs and help our members to interoperate.</p>

<p>New Specifications. We have begun work on two new specifications. <code>crypto-msg</code> is a simple encoding of ciphertext that we’ve specced out in a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2022-001-secure-message.md">first draft</a>. We’ll be seeking CBOR registration via IANA for it once we’ve finalized. <code>crypto-envelope</code> is a more complex specification that can contain <code>crypto-msgs</code>, decryption methodologies, and more; it’s still being sketched out based on community needs.</p>

<p>Test Vectors. Of course creating specification is just the first step. We also create reference libraries and reference apps that demonstrate their use — and ultimately test vectors, so that our community can test their own code. Our <code>crypto-request</code>/<code>crypto-responses</code> communication specification is now mature enough that the community needs test vectors, so we created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-request-test-vectors.md">more than a dozen</a>, allowing for easy testing of requests and responses.</p>

 Progressing on Reference Apps 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-listing.jpeg">
    
</a></p>

<p>Reference apps are where specifications interface with the real-world, as we demonstrate their actual usage.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool v1.4. Gordian Seed Tool, our iOS and MacOS seed vault, continues to be our prime reference app for demonstrating the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">Gordian Principles</a> and for exemplifying best practices of seed management. Our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/releases/tag/releases%2Funiversal%2F1.4">v1.4</a> features usability and data display improvements, but its biggest advancements were in I/O.</p>

<p>Seed Tool can now write to MicroSD cards, supporting a safe and secure way of exporting seeds without going to a network. This release also supports the <code>ur:</code> scheme for the native camera app and for reading NFCs cards. Our open test-flight beta also includes proof of concept of writing URs to NFCs if you want to experiment. (Beware: this functionality might change!)</p>

<p>Altough you can compile Gordian Seed Tool from code, it’s also available through the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Apple App Store</a>.</p>

<p>Spotbit. <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">Spotbit</a>, our tor-gapped currency pricing lookup tool, was one of our biggest successes from our 2020 intern program, but we’ve long wanted to improve its stability to make it usable not just as a reference but also as a real service. Work on refactoring has just begun, courtesy of one of our former interns (which also demonstrates another of our goals: increasing the number of designers and developers in our industry).</p>

 Releasing Services 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/2022-Q1-esplora.png">
    
</a></p>

<p>Though one of the largest goals of Blockchain Commons is working with developers to craft the open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate digital infrastructure of the future, we’ve also constructed a bit of that infrastructure ourself by providing public services.</p>

<p>Esplora. We now have our own copy of Esplora, the blockchain explorer, available at <a href="http://esplora.blockchaincommons.com/">esplora.blockchaincommons.com</a> or <a href="http://pf4awrbzt3ohrtukpq6xx6y73gxqlnon4zh35ik7ald3kwfb5iedogad.onion/">http://pf4awrbzt3ohrtukpq6xx6y73gxqlnon4zh35ik7ald3kwfb5iedogad.onion/ on Tor</a>. This is meant to be a stable, publicly accessible blockchain explorer, so that Blockstream’s <a href="https://blockstream.info/">original esplora</a> isn’t a single-point-of-failure for blockchain explorations of that sort. We’d love for more people to run their own Esplora services as well, to offer distributed sources of blockchain truth.</p>

 Advocating for Smart Custody 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/master/Images/smartcustody-overview.jpg">
    
</a></p>

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ first projects was advocating for the Smart Custody of digital assets by outlining best practices that could equally be adopted by individuals or incorporated by developers into their works. This quarter has seen some large advances in our smart custody work.</p>

<p>Smart Custody for Multisigs. When we designed our original <a href="https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101">Smart Custody scenario</a>, we were already thinking about multisigs, but the technology wasn’t yet accessible to anyone but the most sophisticated user. So, our original scenario focused on cold storage. Fortunately, three years later, multisig is much more easily available through a number of transaction coordinators, some of them self-sovereign, such as <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a>. We’ve thus been thrilled to put together a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">raw draft</a> of a complete scenario focused on using a multisig to protect your digital assets. It allows for control of digital assets that’s less prone to failure, less prone to compromise, and easier to use: everything that a SmartCustody scenario requires. The draft is still undergoing review, so this is just a preview. We expect to release it fully in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>Smart Custody Case Studies. We’ve also been thrilled to see an increasing number of hardware and software releases that embody Smart Custody best practices. To discuss them, we’ve begun producing case studies that talk about how each fulfills the Gordian Principles and battles against Smart Custody adversaries; in the process, we’re also coming to better understand the needs of our community members. Our initial case studies cover <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Passport.md">the Foundation Devices Passport</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Sparrow.md">Sparrow Wallet</a>. We also published discussions of how our own <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-SeedTool.md">Gordian Seed Tool</a> acts as a reference for Gordian principles. We’ve got  one more case study in process for the Keystone Pro wallet. If you’d like us to consider other products, or even better if you want to draft a case study yourself, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">team@blockchaincommons.com</a>.</p>

<p>Proof of Personhood Support. Smart Custody, and its adversaries, goes beyond just the ownership of cryptocurrency. We recently hosted a discussion with the proof-of-personhood community, who we’ve long worked with at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, and came up with one new adversary, a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md#identity-adversaries">boundary breaker</a>, which can likely be applied to #SmartCustody proper. There are no easy answers to the problem of proving whether an entity is a real person, but we think the problem is solvable, and we look forward to working more with this community.</p>

 Looking Forward 

<p>Looking torward the future, there’s lots more on the horizon.</p>

<p>Rebooting the Web of Trust. We are thrilled to see the return of the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web Design Workshops</a> this Fall, after a break of three years due to the COVID pandemic! They’ve recently announced a <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/next-event-page.html">save-the-date for September 26-30</a>, when the next workshop is planned for The Hague in Netherlands. RWOT was in many ways the foundation of Blockchain Commons, so we’re looking forward to returning this year to learn more about everyone’s current interests and needs.</p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity. Working with governments to support self-sovereign identity has long been a goal at Blockchain Commons, with much of our focus on Wyoming. However, the ideas are spreading far and wide. Recently we talked with the <a href="https://twitter.com/christophera/status/1510123736342491138?s=21&amp;t=tGStayJVFkXc-NkOEo6Esg">Buenos Aires Mayor’s office</a> about creating identities that benefit the people, not corporations. This is part of a real effort, as they’ve already produced a <a href="https://github.com/gcba/Identidad-digital/blob/main/Whitepaper%20Tango.md">white paper</a> on the topic, which is available <a href="https://github-com.translate.goog/gcba/Identidad-digital/blob/main/Whitepaper%20Tango.md?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp#whitepaper-tango1">in translation</a>.</p>

<p>Ethereum &amp; NFTs. At this point we’ve written three different unpublished documents on creating Smart Custody for Ethereum, for NFTs, and for treasuries. We’re still deciding how to advance this work, as it’s a big job that would require serious support, but if any our patrons want to see our initial notes, please contact us.</p>

<p>2022 Interns. Blockchain Commons has announced its <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/74">2022 intern program</a>, to run this summer from May 23, 2022 to August 15, 2022. We’ve also produced a list of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/76">potential projects</a> that includes many of our own ideas. If you’re interested in dedicating 40 hours of work this summer as an intern, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/74">please apply</a>! The deadline is April 22nd. Even if you don’t want to become an intern, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/76">projects list</a>, as we’d be happy to work with independent open-source developers on anything there.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon. This May we’ll be working with <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> to host The Silicon Salon, a 90-minute virtual discussion on the future of secure silicon. We’ll be talking about the possibility for support of <code>secp256k1</code> and other curves as well as what other features could be included in silicon designs, from hashes and key derivations to ideas about more advanced functionality. Watch <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainComns">@BlockchainComns</a> for our official announcement.</p>

<p>What’s Coming Up? We’ve got lots of big plans for things that we’d love to advance in the new year, but which will ultimately depend on the needs of the community (and our own resources).</p>

<p>Our future educational work includes expansion of our two biggest projects in that category. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a> should be updated for <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-taproot-explainer">Taproot and Schnorr</a>, and we’re looking even more forward with <a href="https://github.com/jonasnick/bips/blob/musig2/bip-musig2.mediawiki">MuSig</a> and both the benefits and challenges it’ll bring. We’d similarly like to bring our Smart Custody work to the next level, not just incorporating our last year’s work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">multisigs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">timelocks</a> (as well as our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">new scenario</a>), but also expanding Smart Custody to support Ethereum, Tezos, and other blockchains.</p>

<p>Beyond our educational work, we’ve also been considering the design of a Gordian Recovery reference app and need to finalize our work on new specifications such as <code>crypto-msg</code> and <code>crypto-envelope</code>. Of course, we expect the year to be further defined by the needs of the blockchain community! So, there’s plenty to look forward to!</p>

<p>As always, if you are interested in the work of Blockchain Commons and want to see it continue forward, the three best things you can do are <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">become a community member</a>, and offer your own contributions as Issues, PRs, or even entirely new projects.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support!</p>

<p>Using web 3 technology to solve real business problems.</p> Update from Jesse Morris, Chief Executive Officer of Energy&nbsp;Web <p>The first quarter of the year is already behind us, and I could not be more excited about what we’ve accomplished and what’s to come in the Energy Web ecosystem.</p><p>In this update, leads from our three primary geographies have assembled a brief update on our impact in each region and important energy market developments. But first I’d like to share a brief update on a significant evolution of the Energy Web stack&nbsp;itself.</p><p>After years of deploying applications with dozens of companies, our organization and ecosystem have a much clearer understanding of exactly where and how web 3 technologies applied to the energy sector can create business value. More specifically, our community and technology have evolved to a point where three solutions are now being rolled out with customers around the world. They&nbsp;are:</p>  Switchboards, our enterprise-grade self sovereign identity and access management solution built on the W3C administered decentralized identifier standard. Examples include <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/stedin-the-dutch-distribution-system-operator-announces-partnership-with-energy-web-to-explore-cd278623809b">Stedin’s identity and access management solution</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/california-grid-operator-launches-new-demand-flexibility-platform-enhancements-to-flex-alert-system-e01ae8030da0">CAISO flex alert</a>,<a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-announces-development-of-renewable-energy-ev-charging-with-vodafone-and-mastercard-94e1ac4c4aa1"> and our work with Vodafone</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/kore-collaborates-with-kigen-and-energy-web-to-provide-integrated-esim-based-trusted-identity-b22854958851">Kigen, and KORE wireless</a>.  Decentralized data exchange hubs, which enable different combinations of energy companies, prosumers, and individual devices to exchange and process granular data in a decentralized way. Examples include <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/canary-in-the-sunshine-australia-is-showing-the-rest-of-the-world-what-a-modern-grid-looks-like-ce95832cc017">Project EDGE</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/australian-energy-market-operator-partners-with-energy-web-on-project-symphony-a-future-proofed-c3e48390d338">Project Symphony</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/elia-successfully-demonstrates-tso-visible-ev-charging-in-collaboration-with-energy-web-and-bmw-35c80f4eab1d">and all e-mobility related work in our ecosystem</a>.  Green proof platforms, our solution focused on enabling next-generation traceability for low, zero, or negative carbon supply chains. We are currently applying green proof platforms to two supply chains, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewably-produced cryptocurrency.  <p>At the end of 2021, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/parity-technologies-and-energy-web-partner-to-launch-new-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-205e66529441">we announced a major partnership with Parity Technologies to bring a new piece of technology to market, the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain</a>. This quarter, we have conducted a detailed design exercise with Parity to fine-tune the design of this critical new addition to the Energy Web stack. We are nearly ready to begin announcing the details of our work in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>Here’s a high-level preview for how the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain will work: each solution described above — switchboards, decentralized data exchange hubs, and green proof platforms — will soon be able to be deployed as individual instances of Energy Web technology with local blockchains powering each solution, all connected together and secured by the global Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain. This architecture will be powered by a novel token economic model that we believe will be the first instance of real-world economic activity translating to the fundamental value of a cryptocurrency.</p><p>There is an immense amount of detail to unpack regarding the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain and its implications for the Energy Web ecosystem and our mission to decarbonize the global economy. But for now, I can confidently say it’s the most exciting technology development I’ve been a part of since co-founding Energy Web in 2017, and I can’t wait to share the full story in the coming weeks. Stay&nbsp;tuned!</p> Europe &amp; Middle East / North&nbsp;Africa <p>Impact<br>Over the past several months, we have successfully completed a number of flagship projects in Europe. These projects demonstrate accelerating adoption of Energy Web solutions by key industry players, energy market participants, and original equipment manufacturers.</p><p>Energy Web, KORE, and Kigen developed a highly secure, efficient, <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/case-studies/open-sourcesim-technology-kore-and-kigen/">SIM-based open-source solution for internet-of-things device communication</a>. Leveraging SIM cards as a secure, scalable, and standardized hardware solution improves device communication and interoperability. This collaboration between KORE and Kigen leverages the features of eSIM and OPEN IoT SAFE to act as a hardware wallet anchored to an open-source, publicly accessible blockchain-powered by Energy Web. Using Energy Web’s technology, organizations can build their own applications via the world’s first open-source technology stack focused directly on the transition to renewable energy. As part of the collaboration between KORE and Kigen to deploy OPEN IoT SAFE, a purpose-built SDK designed by Energy Web was used as part of the development process.</p><p>In February, we announced the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-announces-development-of-renewable-energy-ev-charging-with-vodafone-and-mastercard-94e1ac4c4aa1">development of renewable energy electric vehicle (EV) charging in partnership with Vodafone and Mastercard</a>. The platform will allow verified connected devices on Vodafone’s Digital Asset Broker (DAB) to transact seamlessly and securely with full owner control. This includes EVs transacting directly with charging points, as well as interactions between other vehicles, machines, and IoT assets, unlocking value from billions of devices. The service went live in a trial of a connected EV communicating autonomously and securely with a charging point in Newbury, UK. This trial marks the first-ever showcase of a 100% clean energy charging solution for EVs. The solution, which can be adapted to work with any charging infrastructure and any EV worldwide, including on-street chargers connected to the grid, will allow users to verify and prove that the energy used to charge their EV comes from renewable sources.</p><p>Finally, we have been awarded with our first project funded under the Horizon Europe framework program of the EC. The OMEGA-X project brings together top European TSOs/DSOs, industry, and research institutions to establish the grounds for an EU data space in the energy sector. Energy Web will work together with a group of 30 different EU partners to integrate its decentralized products, such as EW Switchboard and Decentralized Data Hub, into the project architecture to allow trusted and secure data exchange between energy market participants. The project has an implementation horizon of 4 years and a budget of approximately EUR&nbsp;8M.</p><p>What’s Next<br>We are actively working together with top TSOs/DSOs, research institutions, and industrial players to establish large demonstrators across Europe to deploy our products in the context of commercial agreements or state-of-the-art research and innovation funding opportunities. Finally, our commercial and tech teams are focusing on the implementation phase of our <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/google-backs-energy-web-to-harmonize-low-carbon-electricity-markets-across-europe-204c18cd2f12">Google Impact Challenge grant</a>.</p><p>Market Updates<br>The European Commission (EC) is moving forward with the EU action plan for digitalizing the energy sector. The roadmap of the action plan has been open to public consultation, and the adoption of the action plan by the EC is scheduled for the second quarter of 2022. The action plan focuses on the way digital technologies can unleash the full potential of flexible energy generation and consumption in different sectors and increase penetration and use of renewable energy. The goal of the EC through this action plan is to foster and promote the development of a competitive market for digital energy services and digital energy infrastructure that are cyber-secure, efficient, and sustainable. Moreover, the action plan will support energy system integration, as well as the participation of “prosumers” in the energy transition, while ensuring interoperability of energy data, platforms, and services. Blockchain technology is highlighted as one of the enablers of digitalization in the energy sector, with a focus on enhancing the uptake of digital technologies. These are all outstanding developments for us at Energy Web, who are neck-deep in the process of helping major European energy market participants move digital solutions from minimum viable products into production-grade solutions running on public blockchain-based infrastructure.</p><p>Furthermore, the European Technology and Innovation Platform for Smart Networks for Energy Transition (ETIP SNET) released the Research and Innovation Implementation Plan for 2022–2025 which highlights the most urgent research and innovation needs for the next four years. The research and innovation budget requirements for this period are estimated to be on the order of 1 B EUR. Every single one of the nine high-level use cases considered can benefit from the Energy Web technology stack:</p>  optimal cross-sector integration and grid-scale storage,  market-driven TSO–DSO and system user interactions,  pan-European wholesale markets, regional and local&nbsp;markets,  massive penetration of renewable energy sources into the transmission and distribution grid,  one-stop-shop and digital technologies for market participation of consumers (citizens) at the&nbsp;center,  secure operation of widespread use of power electronics at all systems&nbsp;levels,  enhanced system supervision and control, including cybersecurity,  transportation integration and storage,&nbsp;and  flexibility provision by buildings, districts, and industrial processes.  <p>As with other proceedings across Europe, Blockchain technology has been identified as a key component for various projects to enable new services, such as development of robust and low-cost applications of digital technology for peer-to-peer interactions, as well as the design of internet-of-things architectures for mass data communication and processing. Moreover, the implementation plan highlighted the need for standardization of encrypted and authenticated market processes at different timescales for improved reliability to enhance DSO and TSO information exchange with DER, enabled for third party owned PV and storage from different manufacturers and using different technologies. This is exactly what we have designed the Energy Web stack to be able to support; it is incredibly encouraging to see language from energy market participants and regulators in Europe mirror our language almost 1:1 in documentation and funding announcements such as&nbsp;these.</p> Asia Pacific <p>Impact<br><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/australian-energy-market-operator-partners-with-energy-web-on-project-symphony-a-future-proofed-c3e48390d338">Energy Web is actively bringing to life decentralized data exchange hubs for projects EDGE and Symphony in Australia.</a> <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/canary-in-the-sunshine-australia-is-showing-the-rest-of-the-world-what-a-modern-grid-looks-like-ce95832cc017">Project EDGE</a> — Energy Generation and Demand Exchange — is trialing the development of “future market infrastructure” including the ability for Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to procure energy services from aggregated portfolios of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). The EDGE project covers Australia’s East Coast market, the National Electricity Market (NEM). An MVP for EDGE was completed in October 2021, and the full production solution will launch in the next two months, and operate through at least March&nbsp;2023.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/australian-energy-market-operator-partners-with-energy-web-on-project-symphony-a-future-proofed-c3e48390d338">Project Symphony</a> relates to the West Coast market (covering Western Australia), aka the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM). Symphony will see hundreds of distributed energy resources aggregated into a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) which can generate and store electricity at a local level. This VPP will enable DER owners to sell excess energy back to the grid via an aggregator. Project Symphony will run for a period of two years in Southern River in Perth, with the learnings informing future implementation of DER orchestration projects in Western Australia.</p><p>Energy Web’s solution for EDGE and Symphony includes Switchboard (our Identity and Access Management solution), Decentralized Data Exchange Hubs, together with a registry of organizations and devices to create a single source of truth for all registration data.</p><p>Much of our attention since arriving in Australia has been on delivering for Projects EDGE and Symphony. However, over the past few months, we have engaged a range of local regulators and market participants. We have signed our first new local member — <a href="https://www.quinbrook.com/">Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners</a> — and will soon begin a 24 / 7 renewable energy tracking project with them using our Green Proof solution to match their retail customers’ energy consumption with generation sourced from renewables.</p><p>Market Update</p><p>Research suggests the Asia-Pacific region will be a key area of focus for renewable energy development and investment during the coming decade. Many nations are seeking to deliver post-pandemic recovery programs that will target emissions reductions and growth in renewable energy capacity.</p><p>Solar and wind energy technologies are forecast to be the main focus for governments across APAC, with offshore wind playing a significant role given potential investment returns and the geography of many Asian countries. The decarbonization push is likely also to see a substantial expansion of emerging technologies such as green hydrogen (which helps fuel heavy industry located across the region) as well as utility-scale batteries.</p><p>As APAC energy markets mature in their incorporation of renewables, we see growing demand for Energy Web’s technologies, specifically:</p>  Decentralized and digital IDs (DIDs): assisting the registration (and thus coordination) of many new generation projects and distributed energy resources, across all jurisdictions, some of which lack a strong (or efficient) administrative center and thus require the support that verifiable credentials facilitate to drive trusted interactions;  Decentralized Data Exchange Hub(DDHub): the pace of technological change across the energy sector means many governments, both developed and developing, are challenged to keep abreast of and streamline various standards and protocols embedded within clean-tech energy resources. By enabling communication and data exchange between the many “data silos” being created by new technologies, EW’s decentralized DDHub provides a key support pillar for energy markets and exchanges;  <p>Organization and resource registry: maintaining a tamper-proof single source of registration data for devices, people and organizations are critical to facilitating trusted energy transactions and services.</p> Market Update — United&nbsp;States <p>In the United States, interest among utilities in scalable, digital solutions to integrate distributed energy resources remains strong. As we approach summertime in the US — when peak load is typically highest — we’ll also see CAISO’s <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/california-grid-operator-launches-new-demand-flexibility-platform-enhancements-to-flex-alert-system-e01ae8030da0">Flex Alert</a> (launched with Energy Web last fall) playing a critical role coordinating customer flexibility during wildfire or weather-induced grid emergencies in California. We continue exploring opportunities with members for the open-source Flex Alert toolkit to support emergency response and other flexibility programs elsewhere — including demand response, managed charging, and “transactive” energy market programs.</p><p>In Q1, we also saw a flurry of activity around climate disclosure and ESG standards. In March, the SEC proposed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46">rules</a> requiring major companies to disclose climate-related risks, amplifying discussions about the need for more robust, granular solutions to track, trade, and report emissions associated with renewable electricity and other “green” commodities. 24/7 matching <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-markets/a-deeper-dive-into-24-7-carbon-free-energy?utm_campaign=canary&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=208896322&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_wbazg3G2fwiY8Gwv6c-7-7azX3XVw0yzuqLO2yTJGt10zvneqBlJv-WNg1RmfeukAhXIz48Mr4eQOJ9rbTfaFMOvGMsJnUH5_Zb8sJivdrnYtwoE&amp;utm_source=newsletter">continues to attract</a> attention as an emerging paradigm for impactful renewables’ procurement — including from the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2921646/dod-gsa-announce-rfi-to-gather-information-for-supplying-247-carbon-pollution-f/">US government.</a> And rebounding bitcoin prices, as well as President Biden’s recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-innovation-in-digital-assets/">executive order on cryptocurrencies</a>, have re-energized conversations around blockchain’s energy use.

<p>This review period is now closed. </p>



<p>Notice of Intent: DIACC is collaborating to develop and publish the Digital Wallet component of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) to set a baseline of public and private sector interoperability of identity services and solutions. During this public review period, DIACC is looking for community feedback to ensure that the conformance criteria is clear and auditable.</p>



<p>Document Status: These review documents have been developed by members of the DIACC’s<a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/"> Trust Framework Expert Committee</a> (TFEC) who operate under the DIACC controlling policies and consist of representatives from both the private and public sectors. These documents have been approved by the TFEC as Draft Recommendations V1.0.</p>



<p>Summary:</p>



<p>The intent of the PCTF Digital Wallet component is to provide a framework that Digital Identity Ecosystem Participants can use to assess the degree to which the digital wallets that are part of their respective ecosystems accomplish the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Provide Citizens and Consumers with a Digital Identity Wallet that complies with the human rights principles of preserving people’s privacy and control over their information.  Introduces a consistent identity metaphor and consent-driven automated experience across all Ecosystem Participants to reduce impact on users caused by Digital Transformation.&nbsp;  Contribute to a stable infrastructure with longevity and world-wide interoperability by adopting and supporting relevant standards as appropriate (e.g., W3C Standards for Verifiable Credentials and DIDs).&nbsp;  Counter cyber vulnerability and extortion by enabling Service Providers to incrementally replace existing login mechanisms, some of which may be exploitable, without suffering negative impact to business.  Establish an environment of trust within which the wallet’s owner can interact with other Ecosystem Participants such as Issuers, Verifiers, and other Relying Parties.

 Canada’s trusted digital ID leader, the DIACC, welcomes Budget 2022 investments for digital transformation and Canadian innovation 



<p>TORONTO, APRIL 7, 2022 — Joni Brennan, President of the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) released a statement following the tabling of the federal budget today:</p>



<p>The DIACC welcomes the federal government’s investments for digital transformation and Canadian innovation to enable a thriving digital economy announced in today’s budget.</p>



<p>We have seen throughout the pandemic the heightened role digital services have played in supporting Canadians; however, the disruptive events here in Canada and abroad, including the misinformation and cyber attacks surrounding it, underscore the need to protect our citizens and businesses. Core to that safety is privacy, security and choice in how citizens and businesses across Canada share personal information online. That’s why a safe and secure digital ID ecosystem is essential for the post-pandemic economic recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital ID allows people and organizations to verify themselves online securely and protect personal information while allowing them to control how their information is used and shared. Like a physical ID card, digital ID credentials typically include documents and cards such as driver’s licences and passports. Digital ID is a choice. It is a supplemental tool for people and organizations to access online services.</p>



<p>A digital identity is a highly personal yet critical component to both serve and protect Canadians. We must have a clear path forward on how Canada’s public and private sectors can work together to build a trusted platform that protects our digital identities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that an effective, safe and secure digital ID ecosystem will save manual operation costs and reduce fraud, saving an estimated $482 million for provincial and federal governments, and $4.5 billion for private sector organizations.</p>



<p>Today’s budget announcement keeps the importance of secure and privacy protecting digital ID in our windows and more work needs to be done to develop this path based on citizen consent, control, and trust. We look forward to collaborating with the government on consultations to support these imperative next steps while finding ways to combat misinformation that surrounds it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also pleased to see the Government of Canada maintaining the momentum on its commitment to work “towards a common and secure approach for a trusted digital identity platform to support seamless service delivery to Canadians across the country.”</p>



<p>Trusted, interoperability platforms that secure Canadian identities are more critical now than ever before.</p>



<p>About Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC)</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) is a non-profit coalition of public and private sector organizations committed to developing research and tools to enable secure, robust, and scalable Canadian digital ID solutions and services. With privacy, security, and choice at the forefront of all DIACC initiatives, we aim to enable all Canadians to participate safely and confidently in the global digital economy.</p>

				 <p>The “Go Aries!” project focuses on enabling CL signatures and -credentials within the Aries Framework Go to make it compatible with Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) agents and the Indy-SDK. Therefore, the benefits of the Aries Framework Go are accessible to ACA-Py and Indy.</p>
<p>Background and Goals<br>Hyperledger Aries is the dominant protocol to enable SSI applications. The most popular framework is the ACA-Py which enables cloud-based SSI agents based on Python and is closely entangled with Hyperledger Indy, a purpose-built blockchain as trust anchor. The dominant signature scheme are Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) Signatures to sign and verify DIDs and Anoncreds.<br>The Aries Framework Go (AfGo) comes more from a ledger-independent approach, which is based on Golang and natively supports JSON-LD credentials and standard support for ec cryptography and BBS+ signatures. Due to its language wrappers, it can be deployed directly on machines which gives it a crucial advantage over the ACA-Py and its corresponding mobile frameworks.<br>To make machine interaction available to ACA-Py Agents, AfGo agents need to support CL signatures. We want to add support of these signatures to make the Aries Framework Go more complete and allow for new use cases in the ACA-Py ecosystem.</p>
<p>Problem Statement<br>There are currently two distinct universes within the Hyperledger Aries Framework. The ACA-Py in connection with Hyperledger Indy is already a quite mature agent and trust anchor framework and is the mostly used framework for SSI projects to date. However, it has its limitations as is aimed to be a cloud agent and does not support mobile or other kind of edge agents. Even though the compatible Aries Framework .NET provides a framework for mobile devices it cannot be implemented on standalone devices like car internal computers. This limits the use of the ACA-Py primarily on cloud agent and mobile devices.<br>The Aries Framework Go comes from a more independent approach and is not tied to a specific ledger. It can be connected to Hyperledger Indy, but comes with a different form of signature schemes which limits today’s interoperability between these universes.<br>In order to have strong interfaces between these frameworks, the Aries Framework Go requires support for CL-signatures.</p>
<p>Solution approach<br>The project will use the Aries Framework Go as the starting point as this approach ensures high compatibility with existing projects based on the Aries Framework Go and it later allows us to easily provide merge requests. We will rewrite existing components and include CL-Signatures that are required for a well performing Aries Framework Go agent. We will also focus on the new modules Aries Askar, that acts as a new wallet to store key material and credentials, Indy CredX for credential handling, and Indy VDR to store public DIDs. Therefore, our new CL-compatible Go agents would be able to create connections by establishing CL-signed communication channels, anchor public DIDs on Indy, issue, store and verify CL-credentials, and creating and reading revocation registries. Furthermore, this makes the ACA-Py also independent from Hyperledger Indy, as it is possible to connect any ledger as a Verifiable Data Registry. This is a major leap towards completing the SSI framework as it unifies the AfGo with ACA-Py and Indy.</p>
<p>Results<br>The results will be shown in a demonstrator where an Aries Framework Go agent will create and issue Anoncreds and send it to an Aries Cloud Agent. The repository containing the framework solution itself will be open-sourced.</p>

<p>Want to jump start a career in blockchain development? Ready to build hands-on skills developing leading-edge open source technologies? Looking to work directly with mentors who are invested in you and your work? Then the Hyperledger Mentorship Program is for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now in its sixth year, the Hyperledger Mentorship Program provides a structured and guided learning opportunity for anyone, at any career stage, looking to get started in the open source movement. With full and part time options, fully remote work and a stipend, the projects are designed to be a pathway to becoming a contributor to the Hyperledger community that work for students, people in career transition and anyone else who wants to develop or sharpen their knowledge of cutting-edge blockchain technologies. <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/How+to+Apply">Applications</a> are now open. </p>



<p>This year, the Hyperledger Mentorship Program has grown to <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/2022+Projects">30 planned part and full-time projects</a> covering a range of technologies, challenges and technical difficulty levels and includes non-development projects such as <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Ecosystem+Analyst">Ecosystem Analysis</a> and <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Developer+Marketing">Developer Marketing</a>. Each project is designed and proposed by active members of the Hyperledger community. Those who propose the projects serve as the mentors and work closely with their mentees on developing a project plan, setting milestones and solving problems. Mentees can expect regular evaluations and feedback. For more about the program, including the schedule and stipend details, go <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Hyperledger+Mentorship+Program#HyperledgerMentorshipProgram-2020ProgramTimeline*">here</a>.</p>



<p>Over the last five years, more than 70 mentees have completed Hyperledger Mentorship projects. Each of these mentees have made concrete contributions to Hyperledger projects and built important connections in the community. Some, like Bertrand Rioux, have gone on to become mentors themselves:</p>



<p>“I was accepted into the Hyperledger mentorship program last year after seeking a community to help advance my professional goals of developing software for climate action. I was fortunate to find a diverse group of mentors that helped me build the knowledge and skills I needed to effectively contribute to the Hyperledger open source community and to have the opportunity to develop technical expertise in a field I was actively working in. In addition to delivering a secure identity management solution for a Hyperledger Fabric Network, I started contributing my own ideas to the open source operating system for climate action. As a result, I am now taking a leadership role in the community. In addition to serving as mentor in this year’s program, I proposed a project on reducing waste emission in the oil &amp; gas industry that was accepted.” – Bertrand Rioux, Independent Energy Consultant and Mentor for the <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Multiple+Data+Integration+to+Fabric+Climate+Accounting+Network">Multiple Data Integration to Hyperledger Fabric Climate Accounting Network</a> project</p>

<p>Read on for descriptions of some of the projects planned for this year:</p>



 <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Multiple+Data+Integration+to+Fabric+Climate+Accounting+Network">Multiple Data Integration to Hyperledger Fabric Climate Accounting Network</a> 



<p>The <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-carbon-accounting">Hyperledger Labs blockchain-carbon-accounting project</a> includes a Hyperledger Fabric network for recording the carbon and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions that cause climate change.&nbsp; Since there are many activities that cause such emissions, the network is designed to accept data from multiple sources of measurements.&nbsp; In this project, we will demonstrate integrations from measurement sources with blockchain networks by integrating the ThoughtWorks cloud computing emissions calculator, the NREL OpenPath mobile application, and other web- and mobile-based API’s sources to turn instrumented readings into emissions measurements. It will leverage previous projects involving Hyperledger Cactus, Vault security engines, and client security for Hyperledger Fabric.</p>



<p>The expected outcomes of this project are</p>



  Successful integration of the mobile apps and API’s with Hyperledger Fabric  Benchmark comparison of Hyperledger Fabric and alternatives  Documentation and tutorials for integrating future data sources  



 <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Demonstrate+Interoperability+using+Hyperledger+Bevel+and+Cactus">Demonstrate Interoperability using Hyperledger Bevel and Cactus</a> 



<p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus">Hyperledger Cactus</a> support ledger Interoperability but use a local deployment for testing;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel"> Hyperledger Bevel</a> supports production-worthy deployments. This project aims to support Cactus deployment using Bevel to demonstrate production-like usage of Hyperledger Cactus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The steps will be following:</p>



  Deploy a Hyperledger Fabric network using Bevel on a Managed Kubernetes cluster  Deploy a GoQuorum network using Bevel on a Managed Kubernetes cluster (can be the same cluster for simplicity).  Make changes in Hyperledger Bevel code to deploy the Cactus connectors in both the above networks.  Run Cactus test cases.  



<p>The expected outcomes of this project are</p>



  Successful Interoperability testing using Cactus on&nbsp; production like DLT networks.  Update to Hyperledger Bevel code to automatically deploy the Cactus plugins.

<p>One of the key use cases of blockchain integration is asset bridging: in essence, “locking” an asset (typically, a native coin or token) in a smart contract on its authoritative ledger and making available corresponding, newly minted (wrapped/shadow/…) assets on another. By now, bridging is supported by quite mature solutions in the cryptoworld; however, the same is not true for “consortial” distributed ledger technologies. At the same time, such functionality can be expected to become an important requirement in the not too distant future: for instance, a central bank may choose to create a high performance, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a>-based Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) ledger with a strongly controlled set of “smart contracts,” but allow controlled “bridging out” of the currency to dedicated distributed ledgers of industrial/enterprise cooperations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, a CBDC prototype with such functionality was created at the Dept. of Measurement and Information Systems of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), in a research project supported by the central bank of Hungary (MNB); our initial experience with a custom Hyperledger Cactus and TokenBridge based solution showed that this is a problem worth more targeted experimentation and systematic R&amp;D.</p>



<p>The expected outcomes of this project are</p>



  Report on asset representation in Hyperledger Fabric and mapping approaches to standard Ethereum tokens  Report on bridging approaches and technologies and their applicability for bridging from/to Fabric  Requirement specification  Design specification  Prototype implementation and small demo of bridging at least ERC-20 or ERC-721 to Ethereum – and back  



 <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Client+Connector+for+Hyperledger+Besu">Client Connector for Hyperledger Besu</a> 



<p>Develop a connector that provides both synchronous and asynchronous modes of interacting with a running <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu">Hyperledger Besu</a> node. The connector would act as an interface between an enterprise application and the Hyperledger Besu node for data ingestions and it could provide event subscription options.</p>



<p>The scope of the project would also include an end-to-end test on a sample network.</p>



<p>The expected outcomes of this project are</p>



  Design and implement the connector.  A new Hyperledger Labs project is proposed with a documentation.  



 <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62242656">GVCR: Secure Verifiable Credential Registries (VCR) for GitHub &amp; GitLab</a> 



<p>As conceptualized and standardized by the W3C, the Verifiable Credentials protocol is one of the three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity, together with the Decentralized Identifiers protocol (DIDs) and Distributed Ledger Technology (or Blockchain). The project aims to design and build a verifiable credential registry (VCR) on GitHub repository, namely GitHub-based Verifiable Credential Registry (GVCR), by leveraging existing GitHub APIs, and other open-source tools provided by other Hyperledger projects, such as <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>, and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>. The basic architecture is already built. For more details about the conceptional design and workflows, please refer to the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/DIDman/github-vcr">GitHub-VCR</a>.</p>



<p>The expected outcomes of this project are</p>



  A verifiable credential registry based on one or more GitHub repositories.  Command-Line utility to automate the process of verification of a credential.  Proper test cases and documentation.  Codebase maintained with proper read me document.

<p>In 2018 we worked with Oxfam to publish a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Engine-Room-Oxfam-Biometrics-Review.pdf">landmark report</a> on the use of biometric data – fingerprints, iris scans, voiceprints and so on – in the humanitarian sector. Our report looked at how these types of data were being collected and used, and raised critical questions around potential risks and harms.</p>



<p>This year, with the support of Open Society Foundations’ Migration Initiative, we are excited to be starting new research that will build on this foundation by taking stock of developments in the sector and looking into new and emerging evidence of harms and benefits. Through this new research, we hope to support a more justice – and evidence – based approach to using biometrics in humanitarian work.&nbsp;</p>



 Join our first community call on 19 April, 10 AM EST/ 4 PM CET 



<p>If you’re a humanitarian practitioner or just interested in biometrics and responsible data, please join our upcoming Community Call, where we’ll be introducing the project and hearing from practitioners on the theme. <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEtf-mhrT4iH9JtwHCe-5UG25QeQZnhRigd" title="Register for the call">Register for the call</a>.</p>



 Background 



<p>In 2021, the humanitarian and development sector saw several worst-case scenarios related to the management of biometric data come to pass. In Bangladesh, biometric data collected by the UNHCR from Rohingya refugees <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2021/6/21/rohingya-data-protection-and-UN-betrayal">was shared with the Myanmar government</a> – the same government that was responsible for their displacement in the first place. In Afghanistan, on the eve of Taliban taking over the country following the withdrawal of US forces, organisations scrambled to destroy information collected on those served by US programmes. We know that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/30/1033941/afghanistan-biometric-databases-us-military-40-data-points/">the Taliban took charge of biometric databases left behind by the US forces</a>, possibly <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/30/new-evidence-biometric-data-systems-imperil-afghans" title="endangering thousands of people">endangering thousands of people</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have also seen cases such as the hacking <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/cyber-attack-icrc-what-we-know">attack on the International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC), which compromised the personal data of over 500,000 people. While there was no biometric data in the compromised database, this case showed that <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/video/2022/1/24/comment-red-cross-data-hack">even responsible actors</a> are vulnerable to breaches and attacks – and that humanitarian organisations are a target for malicious actors.</p>



<p>While the above cases have done much to raise awareness of responsible data issues related to the misuse of biometric data, far less attention has been paid thus far to the structures that make such misuse possible in the first place – like biometrics use policies or lack thereof – while unscrutinised claims by the private sector and funding organisations about the ability of emerging technologies to address social issues threaten to continue entrenching structures of harm within humanitarian responses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that building knowledge on these issues is fundamental to ongoing efforts to foster better practices in the humanitarian sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With all this in mind, here are some of the key questions that will guide our work:</p>



  How is biometric data that is gathered by humanitarian organisations governed? (ie. how the data is used, transferred, and shared; and who has access to it?)&nbsp;  What are humanitarian organisations’ policies on biometrics use? How have they been developed, and how are they applied in practice?  What kinds of evidence exist on the benefits, harms and risks of biometric data use in the humanitarian context?  How might existing regulatory frameworks support more responsible use of biometrics in the humanitarian sector?  



 We would love to hear from you! 



<p>As mentioned above, our first community call is on April 19 – it’s open to anyone who is interested in the topic, so feel free to attend even if you’d just like to come and listen.<br><br>And if you’re a humanitarian practitioner working with data and biometrics, or part of a community impacted by such schemes, our research team would love to hear from you. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with Teresa at teresa[at]theengineroom.org.</p>

 Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada Research Finds Canadians Want Digital ID that is user-centric and aligns with their values

<p>Toronto, April 4, 2022 – Canadians need to feel safe and in control when they engage in the digital economy. Core to that safety are privacy, security and choice in how they share personal information online. According to the third annual national survey undertaken by the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC), a staggering 91 per cent of Canadian respondents are calling for control over their personal data collected by provincial and federal governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, 86 per cent of respondents want control over personal data collected by private organizations, and 80 per cent want a secure and unified digital ID ecosystem.</p>



<p>“A trusted pan-Canadian digital identity framework is essential to digital economic prosperity,” said DIACC president Joni Brennan. “While there is some progress on recognizing the importance of digital ID, Canada is still at a stage where more work must be done on the policy side to ensure a truly digital economy.”</p>



<p>Unlocking an inclusive digital economy is an opportunity for the government to rebuild much-needed trust among Canadians, enhance privacy, and demonstrate that citizens’ rights are a top priority. According to the <a href="https://www.edelman.ca/trust-barometer/2022-edelman-trust-barometer-trust-canada">Edelman 2021 Canadian Trust Barometer</a>, only 53 per cent of Canadians trust government organizations – a drastic decline of six points since only the previous year.</p>



<p>DIACC’s research reflects this lack of trust. “A trusted digital ID framework needs to be designed with people at the centre. All Canadians need to be able to choose if and how they want to use their digital ID credentials. Digital ID is not intended to replace existing physical ID methods, but as an optional supplemental tool,” Brennan said.</p>



<p>Establishing a trusted digital ID will allow people and organizations the choice to verify themselves online securely, while protecting personal information with no user traceability. It offers a decentralized, privacy-enhancing solution for both the private and public sectors.</p>



<p>The DIACC applauds the federal government for including digital identity as a priority in Treasury Board President Mona Fortier’s <a href="https://pm.gc.ca/en/mandate-letters/2021/12/16/president-treasury-board-mandate-letter">mandate letter</a>. The need to invest in digital ID was also referenced twice in the House of Commons Finance Committee’s 2021 pre-budget recommendation as critical to supporting <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government.html">Canada’s Digital Government Strategy</a> in secure service delivery.</p>



<p>“It’s encouraging to see recognition of the critical role that digital identity plays in enabling Canada’s economy; however, we need to see a real commitment to action if we are going to reap the benefits of Digital ID and Digital Trust in meaningful economic growth,” said Dave Nikolejsin, the DIACC’s Board Chair, referring to the DIACC’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-overview/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™</a> (PCTF).</p>



<p>The PCTF is a publicly available set of tools, shared principles, and guidelines to help organizations operate in a digital ecosystem. It includes processes like Notice and Consent, Authentication, Verification, Privacy, Credentials, and Infrastructures – both technologically and operationally.</p>



<p>Most importantly, the PCTF is citizen-centric. It is designed to keep users safe.</p>



<p>“This is an opportunity for industry and government leaders to come together and build a strong partnership. We have the fundamentals, we have the expertise, and we have the framework. Now, we need mutual investment across sectors to put the PCTF into action,” said Franklin Garrigues, VP External Ecosystems at <a href="https://clicktime.symantec.com/3RHvB8cGMXspcP51pBTit217VN?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcts.businesswire.com%2Fct%2FCT%3Fid%3Dsmartlink%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.td.com%252Fca%252Fen%252Fpersonal-banking%252F%26esheet%3D52286601%26newsitemid%3D20200915005744%26lan%3Den-US%26anchor%3DTD%2BBank%26index%3D5%26md5%3D372921976ab1c50e42cd675da4f0b96b">TD Bank</a>, DIACC Board Vice-Chair.</p>



<p>Nearly two-thirds of survey respondents are calling for governments to collaborate with the private sector to develop a pan-Canadian digital ID. On top of this, three quarters want the government to move quickly.</p>



<p>Privacy. Security. Choice.</p>



<p>DIACC is committed to developing research and tools to enable secure, robust, and scalable Canadian digital identity (digital ID) solutions and services. With digital advancements happening at a surefire rate, DIACC prioritizes privacy, security, and, most importantly, choice of use at the forefront of all digital ID initiatives.</p>



<p>To achieve real growth and sustainability, Canadians need transparency in governance. They need a digital ID they can own and choose to use. A digitally and economically prosperous Canada depends on it.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director</p>



<p>According to recent research reports and news, Asia Pacific regions are witnessing a surge in cyber-attacks – and the highly publicized online attacks all start with compromised passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2021, nearly 470 customers of a Singapore bank had fallen victim to SMS phishing attacks, with total losses amounting to at least $8.5 million. In New Zealand, the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) received over 114,000 SMS scam reports between September and October 2021, the highest in the Department’s history. In India, cyber-attacks have doubled in the past three years, according to University of Surrey research, with enterprises the most common target of these attacks. In January, a local payment provider experienced a data breach, with 35 million customers having their data, including card information and fingerprint scans, released on the dark web for anyone to buy. These are just a few examples on a list that continues to grow.</p>



<p>The Industry Is Uniting to End the Password Problem</p>



<p>On February 15th, the FIDO APAC Marketing Forum (AMF) brought together FIDO members from 12 countries in APAC to share insights, lessons learned and best practices to mitigate the surge of cyber-attacks that have taken hold of the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Here are the highlights of the sessions:</p>



The agenda started with a welcome message from Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp; Shikiar said, “2022 is the year of FIDO adoption and this time we mean it. FIDO adoption is truly happening now at scale.&nbsp; Asia has always been at the forefront with early FIDO adoptions, and it is wonderful to see a new momentum in Taiwan and ASEAN.”



Megan Shamas, Senior Director of Marketing at the FIDO Alliance, reviewed 2021 highlights and shared 2022 global marketing programs that are being prepared. She detailed FIDO’s new year marketing programs that are divided into many different boxes, such as PR, digital, content, industry events, seminars, and research, while seeking member feedback.



The group heard from Karen Chang of Egis Technology, who is also Chair of FIDO Taiwan Engagement Forum while serving as a member at SEMI E187 Standard Committee. Chang pointed out that SEMICON Taiwan released SEMI E187, the first ever semiconductor standard. FIDO is listed as a reference of ‘Authentication Technologies’ in the document.



Le Tuan Khoi from MK Group in Vietnam shared their FIDO deployment case study. The insightful local trends on cybersecurity and cybercrime statistics were highly appreciated by the members. It was very helpful for us to understand the local markets and how FIDO can be accepted there.



Keiko Itakura from Rakuten Group shared Rakuten’s FIDO implementation case study. Itakura, who also serves as Co-Vice Chair of the FIDO Japan Working Group, said, “FIDO has great availability to unify authentication methods and phishing resistance by utilizing standard technology.”&nbsp; At the end of her presentation, the members congratulated the 25th year anniversary of Rakuten.



Special guest Yusuf Khan from Digital Dubai joined us to share digital ID trends and related activities in Dubai.&nbsp; He emphasized that balance between usability and security is very important, which FIDO Authentication is on the sweet spot.&nbsp; It was also exciting to learn that Dubai is exploring passwordless and secure mobile based digital identity.



Finally, Young Lee from DEFEND in New Zealand joined us as a special speaker.&nbsp; Lee gave us a bird-eye view of New Zealand’s 2021 Cybersecurity Landscape.&nbsp; He said, “thousands of phishing and credential harvesting attacks were recorded in Q2 2021, and it was a 73% increase from the previous quarter.”



<p>A Call to Participate</p>



<p>The FIDO APAC Marketing Forum (AMF), under the FIDO Marketing and Communications Board Committee, was inaugurated on November 28th, 2020, to provide a platform for regional members to connect, learn from each other and share best practices. Although it was established during the worst period of the global pandemic, the forum has now grown to 98 members from Australia, China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Members in the APAC region are encouraged to participate in this forum and can get involved by contacting info@fidoalliance.org.</p>



<p>We look forward to hosting yet another exciting AMF meeting in Q2 2022!</p>

   We're welcoming a new Interim ED, a new board member and going through leadership transitions.

<p>Over the past few months we’ve been on the search for an Interim Executive Director to hold the reins at The Engine Room for the next few months while our ED, Julia, is on leave. Alongside that, we’ve been looking for new board members, and today I’m thrilled to share that both of these searches have been successful! Gillian Williams has joined us as Interim Executive Director until September, and Elizabeth Eagen has joined our Board of Directors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, I’ll be transitioning out of The Engine Room at the end of March, after nearly seven years here (more on this below!). Laura Guzmán and Paola Mosso, who have been leading our Engagement and Tech teams respectively, will be stepping into the roles of co-Deputy Directors.&nbsp;</p>



 More on our Interim ED and our new Board Member&nbsp; 



<p>Gillian brings a wealth of experience in leading nonprofits focused on human gain and social justice at an executive level, having served as an Executive Director herself. She has worked and consulted with a number of nonprofits around areas of leadership, organisational and board development, and how to navigate major transitions. She’s hit the ground running already, and we’re delighted to have her on the team for the next six months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elizabeth has been an ally to The Engine Room for a long time – she gave us one of our first grants to start our Responsible Data work, and she’s already provided invaluable support and advice. She ​​established and led the Emerging Technology portfolio at the Open Society Foundations’ Information Program, and currently works as the <a href="https://citizensandtech.org/2021/09/meet-elizabeth-eagen/">Deputy Director at CAT Lab</a>. We’re so excited to have her deep expertise on our board, to help guide our future strategy and programmatic work.<br></p>



 Some background on the last six months 



<p>We’ve shared some of this over social media, but for more context on some of what’s been going on in the last few months: In September last year, our Executive Director, <a href="https://jkeserue.medium.com/embracing-the-complexity-of-cancer-906f16e5ad89">Julia, was diagnosed with early-stage cancer</a>. As she stepped out for treatment, I took on the role of Acting Executive Director, and I can only express my complete gratitude to the team, the Board and all our core funders for all the ways that they supported our team during that transition period. Everyone, without exception, stepped up to offer me the support, grace and trust I needed to be able to fill those big shoes under such tough circumstances, and the team as a whole really showed up for each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many ways, this period has been the biggest test of our commitment to wellbeing and solidarity that we’ve had as an organisation so far. Adjusting our organisation in a way that would allow our ED to step away for an undefined period of time, while ensuring that our commitments to partners were met, our work remained impactful and thoughtful, and that our team was supported –&nbsp;wasn’t easy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As it happened, in the months before Julia’s diagnosis we had also been discussing my exit from the organisation – I had been feeling like it was time for new challenges, and to open up new space for emerging leaders in the organisation. I’m so glad I was able to stay for longer than planned, but that personal desire, and belief in making some space, remained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve truly loved my time at The Engine Room, and will remain a lifelong cheerleader for the team and all of their great work. I feel immensely grateful to have landed at this organisation when I did: I can’t think of many organisations where I would have had the opportunity to grow at the pace that I have, to learn so much in a hands-on and supported way, to shape so much and work on such impactful, interesting, important topics with such smart and kind people.&nbsp;</p>



 What next?&nbsp; 



<p>As Julia is now happily in recovery, she will slowly be easing back into a support role at The Engine Room over the next few months, before rejoining us as our Executive Director in the autumn. At the same time, the current senior leadership team (Laura and Paola as co-Deputy Directors, and Gillian as Interim ED) will be settling into their roles, with others in the organisation taking on new responsibilities as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I feel so happy to be leaving The Engine Room with such strong leadership –&nbsp;both at the executive level, but also through all of the team, who are all leaders in their own right, shaping our programmatic work, pushing us to do and be better, and pushing forward our mission of strengthening civil society’s use of tech and data. On that note – make sure to take a look at <a href="https://2021.theengineroom.org/">our just-launched 2021 Retrospective</a> to get a glimpse of the work we did last year.</p>



<p>You can contact Gillian on gillian[at]theengineroom.org, and our co-Deputy Directors Laura and Paola are also available to talk through any questions these transitions might bring. It’s been an absolute honour to be part of this team, and I hope to be ‘seeing’ many of you online in the future!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tampa-based Schellman, a leading provider of attestation and compliance services, announced today that it is joining the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP) as a Steering Committee member. As the first IT audit firm to join the leadership of ToIP, this move represents Schellman’s belief in the growing suite of digital governance specifications and tools being developed by ToIP Working Groups.</p>



<p>Representing Schellman on the Steering Committee will be Scott Perry, whose firm Scott S. Perry CPA, PLLC, was recently acquired by Schellman. Scott was a founding Contributing Member of ToIP and has served as co-chair of the ToIP Governance Stack Working Group since its inception in May 2020.</p>



<p>“This is the culmination of work that began over six years ago when I started collaborating with Timothy Ruff, co-founder of Evernym and of the Sovrin Foundation, on audit and compliance in the emerging SSI space,” said Scott. “We realized that this could revolutionize how digital trust works everywhere on the Internet, and out of that was born the ToIP Foundation. So it is very gratifying for me to now join the Steering Committee and contribute directly to the success of the ToIP model.”</p>



<p>Scott has authored or co-authored a number of deliverables from the ToIP Governance Stack WG including:</p>



  <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Metamodel Specification (PDF)</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">Companion Guide (PDF)</a>  <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Risk-Assessment-Worksheet-Template-V1.0-2021-08-24.xlsx">ToIP Risk Assessment Worksheet Template (Excel)</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Risk-Assessment-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2021-08-24.pdf">Companion Guide (PDF)</a>  <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Trust-Assurance-and-Certification-Controlled-Document-Template-V1.0-2021-10-19.pdfatrix-Template-ToIP-Approved-V1.0-2021-10-10.xlsx">ToIP Trust Assurance and Certification Controlled Document Template (Excel)</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Trust-Assurance-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2021-10-19.pdf">Companion Guide (PDF)</a>  <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Trust-Assurance-Criteria-Matrix-Template-ToIP-Approved-V1.0-2021-10-10.xlsx">ToIP Trust Criteria Matrix Template (Excel)</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Trust-Criteria-Matrix-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2021-10-19.pdf">Companion Guide (PDF)</a>  



<p>Scott saw the acquisition of his firm as a means of harnessing a well-established delivery capability of digital trust audit services from a top CPA Firm; Schellman saw this as a quick entry into an important emerging segment of the compliance marketplace and wanted to cement this commitment by joining the ToIP Steering Committee.</p>



<p>“Holding digital trust actors accountable in any or all layers of the ToIP stack will require independent audit skills and experience in a variety of compliance frameworks,” said Avani Desai, CEO at Schellman. “The deliverables already published by ToIP serve as an audit methodology for trust assurance, so they will nicely complement the services we currently offer as a WebTrust CPA firm, an ISO Certification Body, a PCI Qualified Security Assessor Company, a HITRUST assessor, a FedRAMP 3PAO, and as one of the first CMMC Authorized C3PAOs.”</p>



<p>“I am very happy to see this recognition of the ToIP Foundation’s groundbreaking work in digital governance frameworks,” said Judith Fleenor, ToIP Director of Strategic Engagements. “Scott has been a leader in this work from the start, and the acquisition of his firm and the support of Schellman signals that the ToIP governance metamodel is starting to see serious traction in the market. Look for more evidence coming from several new digital trust ecosystems later this year.”</p>

Welcome 
Gail Hodges – OIDF


1:05-1:35
[Re]Assessment of the HEART Landscape<br>
Debbie Bucci has been working on behalf of the OpenID Foundation to better understand the Health sector and to access and raise awareness about the potential use of other OpenID profiles, such as FAPI, that have gained wide acceptance/ traction broadly in other sectors. To start the conversation, Debbie has been working on a cross walk of standards/profiles used in the health space and recently invited members of the HEART WG to join her to present her findings to date and to give others the opportunity to share activities/lessons learn. This session will provide an update and insights gained from those discussions as well as an opportunity for workshop participants to share their perspectives.
Debbie Bucci – Equideum Health


1:35-2:00
OpenID Connect for Self-Sovereign Identity Protocols<br>
The OpenID Connect for Self-Sovereign Identity (OIDC4SSI) protocols are facilitating adoption of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), empowering individuals to take control of their own identity. By using OpenID Connect, a cornerstone of modern identity systems as the foundation, OIDC4SSI ensures that SSI applications are trusted, secure, interoperable, and easy to deploy. For that reason, OIDC4SSI specifications are already being adopted and deployed in a number of implementations, rapidly becoming the foundation of many Self-Sovereign Identity solutions. This talk will discuss use cases motivating the work, how these protocols solve the problems, what challenges remain, and how they have come together to weave a web of trust for Self-Sovereign Identity.
Kristina Yasuda – Microsoft &amp; Torsten Lodderstedt – yes.com


2:00-2:25
GAIN 1.0 POC Community Group Forum<br>
The Globally Assured Identity Network (GAIN)&nbsp;White Paper was extraordinary effort of 150 co-authors who proposed a pragmatic approach to the burning business problem of the international interoperability of digital identity. This presentation&nbsp;will&nbsp;introduce and provide an update on the GAIN Proof of Concept (PoC) while encouraging global community input to help shape the PoC and maximize benefit for all participants and supporters.

  <p>Friday, April 8th @ 12h00 CET HCF Community Call:    Post DIA Conference feedback: HCF perspective</p>  <p>The Human Colossus Foundation (HCF) is a Swiss-based independent non-profit organisation. It envisions a new paradigm in digital interaction underpinned by a data-agile economy that aims to empower people, businesses and organisations to make better decisions based on insights from harmonised, accurate data. HCF’s mission is to facilitate the creation and subsequent development of such a data-agile economy, focusing on building open source core public utility technologies.</p><p>DDE "Dynamic Data Economy" refers to a data-agile economy composed of three foundational pillars - semantics, inputs and governance. The DDE is essentially a decentralised trust infrastructure aligned with the European data strategy where actors have the transactional sovereignty to share accurate information bilaterally. HCF facilitates DDE development by promoting standards that guarantee digital objects' structural and contextual integrity, the factual authenticity of events, and the consensual veracity of purpose-driven data agreements.</p>

<p>A practical guide to ethics in socio-technical systems design</p>



<p>by Kalin Nicolov &amp; Nicky Hickman</p>



<p>Albert Einstein is quoted as saying ,”I do not believe in the immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern without any superhuman authority behind it.”&nbsp; It is fitting therefore, that in the first of our Human Experience Working Group Expert Series we heard from Lisa Talia Moretti, a Digital Sociologist with the Ministry of Justice (UK) with a talk entitled ‘Dear Human, The Future Needs You!’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethics doesn’t have to be complex, feared or pushed to one side under pressure to ship product or to get an MVP out of the door.&nbsp; Instead, ethics can be baked into the design process simply by calling on the human in all of us.&nbsp; After all as Lisa said, *’humans are messy!’ Lisa’s talk took us on a journey of discovery as to what ethics is (a branch of philosophy), and what ethics is not (religion, law, science or social norms). &nbsp; Infused with insights and practical examples from UK’s Ministry of Justice digital journey around Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA), Lisa’s talk included many practical steps that all designers and technologists can take throughout the design process including asking very tough questions, taking time to think things through, and mapping interconnecting systems that are part of the ecosystem you are designing for.</p>







<p>Of course we are not as Albert Camus once said, ‘wild beasts loosed upon this world’, all of us have a moral compass and a sense of what is right and wrong, no-one intends for their product or service to cause harm. &nbsp; Neither are we superhuman, able to always understand the perspectives of all stakeholders or foresee the consequences of every cool feature or elegant line of code, nor indeed can we forecast how our products and services will be used for good or ill. Lisa called on all of us to remember that “technology is not a product, but a system”,&nbsp; and&nbsp; gave us practical steps to help us tap into our innate moral compass and design for those systems with the human experience and human flourishing at its heart.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/1.+Dear+Human%2C+The+Future+Needs+You.++Practical+Ethics+with+Digital+Sociologist%2C+Lisa+Talia-Moretti">read a summary and watch the video of Lisa’s talk here</a> on our Wiki or on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmnnj82wpTM&amp;t=20s">YouTube Channel here</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>About Lisa</p>



<p>For more than a decade, Lisa has researched and written about the relationship between technology, information and society for a diverse range of organisations across public, private and third sector. In addition to her role at the Ministry of Justice in the UK, Lisa is an Associate Lecturer at Goldsmiths, Plymouth and Cardiff Universities. In 2020, the British Interactive Media Association (BIMA) named her as one of Britain’s 100 people who are positively shaping the British digital industry in the category Champion for Change. She is a member of the AI Council for BIMA, Co-Chair of Sovrin Foundation’s Guardianship working group and previously a taskforce member for the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Blockchain Cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance released a paper today that outlines the next steps in the evolution of FIDO and passwordless authentication adoption. Specifically, we are introducing the concept of multi-device FIDO credentials to address current challenges with account recovery for consumer deployments at scale.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance has really been successful in changing the nature of authentication – FIDO Authentication is now built into every leading device and browser and many major brands have made FIDO logins available to their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, a challenge that persists is the requirement that users enroll their FIDO credentials for each service on each new device, which typically requires a password for that first sign-in. So what happens to your FIDO login credentials and how do you recover your account if you change your phone or laptop? They are not recoverable in today’s FIDO model. This presents issues for deploying FIDO at scale to consumers who are constantly moving between devices and updating to new ones. This is less of a challenge in the enterprise, where companies can solve this issue by deploying internal management tools used to support passwordless authentication, and for employees to recover accounts and credentials.</p>



<p>So while FIDO is available to deploy at scale today, a feature has been missing to make it as fully ubiquitous and available as passwords: the ability to have your FIDO credentials available to you across all of your devices, even a new one, without having to re-enroll for every account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Introducing multi-device FIDO credentials</p>



<p>The new <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/How-FIDO-Addresses-a-Full-Range-of-Use-CasesFINAL.pdf">paper released today</a> outlines the next steps for the evolution of FIDO to address this limitation. The paper introduces multi-device FIDO credentials, also informally referred to by the industry as “passkeys,” which enable users to have their FIDO login credentials readily available across all of the user’s devices. This will help service providers bring passwordless sign-in to consumers at scale by addressing the issue of account recovery – the key barrier to mass adoption of cryptographically secure, passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper outlines how the FIDO Alliance and the W3C WebAuthn working group propose to achieve this, which includes two key updates:</p>



  The ability to use a phone as a roaming authenticator through a defined protocol to communicate between the user’s phone (which becomes the FIDO authenticator) and the device from which the user is trying to authenticate.  Making FIDO credentials universally available on all the user’s devices to ensure they can survive device loss and sync across different devices  



<p>By introducing these new capabilities, we hope to empower websites and apps to offer an end-to-end truly passwordless option; no passwords or one-time passcodes (OTP) required. The user experience of sign-in becomes a simple verification of a user’s biometric or a device PIN – the same consistent and simple action that consumers take multiple times each day to unlock their devices. The vision is that these experiences will be available across all our devices, operating systems and browsers.</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance sees the introduction of multi-device FIDO credentials to be an important step towards deployment of phishing-resistant FIDO authentication at a broader scale in many use cases that today are totally reliant on passwords or legacy forms of MFA such as SMS OTPs that are under increasing attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re looking forward to hearing from industry stakeholders about this development and will be sharing more details on a webinar in April.</p>

 eIDAS and the European Digital Identity Wallet: Context, status quo and why it will change the&nbsp;world. Thumbnail: Why the European Digital Identity Wallet will change the&nbsp;world.<p>In 2021 the European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2663">announced the European digital identity wallet</a>. This article explains the basic concepts, highlights the significance of this development and provides an overview of the status&nbsp;quo.</p><p>The vast majority of citizens regularly use the internet. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1241896/european-countries-internet-users-use-accessed-internet-daily-age/">statista,</a> for 16–24-year-olds, the European average of daily internet users amounts to 95 per cent in 2020. Even for the age group of 55–64 years, the percentage of daily users is as high as 69 per cent on an EU average. Hence, access to digital services is expected. This includes services offered by governments and the private sector&nbsp;alike.</p> The difference between foundational and contextual identity <p>When speaking about “digital identity” we need to differentiate between a foundational and contextual identity. A foundational identity has a legal context and uniquely identifies a natural person. A contextual identity exists depending on a particular context and is not directly subject to government regulations. While a person generally only has one foundational identity, he or she can have hundreds of contextual identities.</p><p>Foundational Identities are also referred to as government-issued, eID, regulated-, foundational-, base-, or core identity.</p><p>Foundational or regulated identities are issued by an authoritative body of a government. A classic example is a passport. It grants rights and privileges in a global context and is subject to a highly regulated environment.</p><p>The Pan Canadian Trust Framework defines a foundational identity as followed: “A foundational identity is an identity that has been established or changed as a result of a foundational event (e.g., birth, person legal name change, immigration, legal residency, naturalized citizenship, death, organization legal name registration, organization legal name change, or bankruptcy)” <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_4/PSP-PCTF-V-1.4-Consolidated-Overview-EN-2021-12-16.pdf">PCTF&nbsp;V1.4</a>.</p><p>Contextual identity: also referred to as non-regulated-, private- or pseudonymous identity.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_4/PSP-PCTF-V-1.4-Consolidated-Overview-EN-2021-12-16.pdf">Pan Canadian Trust Framework</a> defines a contextual identity as followed:<br>“A Contextual Identity is an identity that is used for a specific purpose within a specific identity context (e.g., banking, business permits, health services, drivers licensing, or social media). Depending on the identity context, a contextual identity may be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a drivers licence) or may not be tied to a foundational identity (e.g., a social media profile)”.</p><p>Hence, one needs to know the context of the identity in question to understand who we are talking about. If we just say “follow @earthquakebot to get immediate information about earthquakes 5.0 or higher” you don’t know where to go and search for this bot. The context, which is missing is that the bot exists within the authoritative domain of the <a href="https://twitter.com/earthquakeBot">twitter</a> platform. However, on other platforms, this name might already be taken or used for other purposes.</p> Identification and authentication <p>Before we dive deeper into the topic of the eIDAS regulation we want to explain two key concepts, which the regulation is aiming to improve: identification and authentication.</p>The history and future of identification and authentication.<p>Identification asks: Who are you?<br>This implies the person or organisation you are interacting with doesn’t know you yet and has a legitimate reason or even the obligation to identify the natural person it’s interacting with.</p><p>Current means of identification include officially notified eID means as well as offerings from the private market such as postal service, video- or photo identification of your physical ID documents in combination with a photo or video of you. Currently, there are multiple eID implementations within Europe, however not every member state has notified an eID for cross border&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Authentication asks: Is it you again?<br>This implies that you had a previous interaction with the person or organisation you are interacting with so they already know&nbsp;you.</p><p>Current means of authentication include the username (mostly an email) in combination with a password or a single sign-on (SSO) service also referred to as “social login” provided by big technology companies.</p><p>Passwords are cumbersome to remember especially considering that users should use different passwords for different services. While “social logins” are more convenient and user-centric, they also come with critical drawbacks, since they lead to a high dependency on the “social login” provider and a lockin within their ecosystem. Interoperability is missing and oftentimes the business models of these providers are based on surveillance practices.</p><p>In the early stages of the web, we mainly used postal ident for identification and only passwords for authentication. In the second and current iteration of the web, we use photo- or video identification for the verification of regulated identities or notified eID means provided by the member state. For authentication, we use a combination of passwords and “social logins”. In the third iteration of the internet “WEB3”, we will use digital wallets for both identification and authentication.</p><p>A key differentiator is the control over identificators. Until now users were only able to choose an identificator within an authoritative domain, such as email addresses, usernames on social media platforms or telephone numbers. Ultimately the legal entity governing the domain, in which the identificator is used, has full control over the usage of these identificators. That’s different with decentralised identificators (DIDs), which are created and controlled by&nbsp;users.</p><p>The eIDAS regulation (electronic IDentification, Authentic and trust Services) instructs all relevant stakeholders regarding the use of electronic signatures, electronic transactions and their involved bodies as well as their embedding processes to provide a safe way for users to conduct business online. The first version of the European regulation came into effect in 2014. In June 2021 the European Commission proposed a revised version “eIDAS 2.0”, which is currently in&nbsp;draft.</p><p>This revision was initiated due to the current limitations as described in more detail in the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/694244/EPRS_BRI(2021)694244_EN.pdf">impact assessment</a>: <br>1) Optional eID notification for member states.<br>2) Limited option to exercise data protection rights.<br>3) Strong limitations to public services in practice.<br>4) No level playing field for trust service providers from different member&nbsp;states.</p><p>More information about the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2022/699491/EPRS_BRI(2022)699491_EN.pdf">findings on the implementation and application of the revised eIDAS regulation</a> was published by the European Parliamentary Research&nbsp;Service.</p><p>The European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet is an application for citizens running on a mobile device or a cloud environment, which can be used to receive and store digital credentials and interact with third parties to get access to digital services. The wallet will be provided to citizens by all member states. Its usage is optional for citizens.</p>Illustration of the roles interacting with the EUID Wallet. Graphic by&nbsp;Lissi.<p>The graphic above illustrates that there are multiple issuers of identity information. This information can be received, stored and presented by the EUDI Wallet. Entities requesting information from a citizen can be public institutions or representatives of those or commercial entities, which are required by law to identify their customers such as banks or airlines.</p><p>The wallet will enable:<br>1) both identification and authentication<br>2) the verification of third parties <br>3) the storage and presentation of verified identity data and <br>4) the creation of qualified electronic signatures</p><p>Currently, the intention for the EUID Wallet is to reach the level of assurance (LoA) “high”. The LoA represents the degree of an issuer’s confidence in a presented credential and its trustworthiness.</p><p>Similar to how the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forced the internet to recognise the data protection rights of users, the eIDAS regulation will set the foundation for digital identity and identity wallets on a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Very large platform providers will be mandated to accept the digital identity wallet. The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2020%3A825%3AFIN">digital markets act</a> classifies a platform as such, once they reach 45 Million monthly active users in the European Union, which is equivalent to 10 per cent of the European citizens. This solves the initial problem of a two-sided market in which both issuers and consumers of identity data want the other party to be present before joining. It also expands the scope of the regulation from initially regulated identities only to also include contextual identities — at least the access to them via means of authentication.</p><p>While some European Member states such as Sweden or Estonia already have an advanced framework for digital identities, which is used by the majority of citizens, this isn’t the case for all member states. Those who lag behind have the opportunity to leapfrog existing infrastructure.</p><p>Furthermore, there is a massive opportunity for Europe as a whole to standardise user-centric processes for identification and authentication while preserving citizen control and privacy. This will facilitate access to digital services from the public and private market alike. The harmonisation of legislation and technology on a European level will enable public bodies and private market participants to better reach European consumers.</p><p>The regulation has the chance to significantly improve processes via automatisation, verified data, flexibility and availability of a common infrastructure. It furthermore has the potential to reintroduce organisations with a direct encrypted communication interface to consumers without an intermediary.</p><p>A shared infrastructure for all member states with easy access for private entities would also greatly facilitate information exchange between ecosystems, which are currently separated and fragmented. Infrastructure with a suitable legal framework would benefit all stakeholders by providing much-needed trust and security for digital interactions.</p>Timeline of the toolbox process of the revised eIDAS regulation.<p>The European Commission has set itself a tough timeline by planning to mandate member states to offer a EUDI Wallet at the beginning of 2024. The next big milestone will be&nbsp;the</p><p>announcement of technical specifications as part of the eIDAS toolbox in October 2022. Hence, from the adoption of the legislation in early 2023 until the availability of the wallets there is only a one year period for member states to implement the wallet based on the defined standards.</p><p>These standards are defined in the eIDAS Toolbox. You can find more information about <a href="https://digitale-identitaeten.de/das-schaufenster-sichere-digitale-identitaeten-beschliesst-drei-strategische-top-themen-fuer-2022/">the timeline</a> published by the German research team accompanying the <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Sichere_Digitale_Identitaeten/Projekte_Umsetzungsphase/projekte_umsetzungsphase.html">Showcase Digital Identity</a> projects in&nbsp;Germany.</p><p>The outline of the toolbox was published by the eIDAS expert group in February 2022. You can find it&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/meetings/consult?lang=en&amp;meetingId=37639&amp;fromExpertGroups=true">here</a>.</p><p>Who is working on the eIDAS 2.0 toolbox?<br>The eIDAS regulation is revised by an expert group consisting of representatives from the 27 member states. The work of the eIDAS expert group is divided into four working groups&nbsp;(WG):</p><p>The WG Provision and exchange of identity attributes is concerned with the set, format and issuance and validity of personal identification data.</p><p>The WG Functionality and security of the wallets also takes into consideration the APIs and protocols for the communication between the stakeholders as well as the creation and usage of qualified electronic signatures.</p><p>The WG Reliance on the wallet/identity matching is concerned with the unique identification process, the authenticity of received credentials by the relying party and its authentication.</p><p>The WG Governance is concerned with the accreditation of certification bodies, the trusted lists, the list of certified European Digital Identity Wallets, security breaches as well as business models and fees structures.</p><p>What’s the status quo of the eIDAS toolbox?<br>The current outline of the toolbox contains information about the objectives of the EUDI Wallet, the roles of the actors of the ecosystem, the wallet’s functional and non-functional requirements as well as potential building blocks. However, it currently doesn’t provide any further information regarding a technical architecture and reference framework, common standards and technical specifications or common guidelines and best practices. These components will be added&nbsp;later.</p><p>There are multiple possible directions regarding the technological design of the EUDI Wallet. This primarily includes (de)centralized public key infrastructures, certificates such as X.509 certificates or verified credentials as well as communication protocols such as OpenID Connect or DIDComm. However, at this point, the final choice is still&nbsp;unclear.</p><p>The toolbox technical architecture will result in a single connection interface for relying parties as stated in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/meetings/consult?lang=en&amp;meetingId=37639&amp;fromExpertGroups=true">the outline</a>: “To ensure that the EUDI Wallet can be used in a seamless way by trust service providers and relying parties alike, a common authentication protocol shall be specified, ensuring interoperability (…).”</p><p>If you want to know more about how the toolbox process is defined, you can find a detailed description in the <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/regdel/web/meetings/2409/documents/6690">summary of the first meeting</a> of the eIDAS expert&nbsp;group.</p><p>There will be at least four pilot implementations of the European digital identity wallet, which are funded by the European Commission as part of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme">Digital Europe Programme</a>. Each pilot implementation should contain the use cases driver licence, diploma, payment authentication and eHealth as well as use cases in other areas such as digital travel credentials and social security. Such scenarios may also demonstrate the functionalities of the wallet for example qualified electronic signatures.</p><p>For one pilot implementation, at least three member states have to collaborate. While stakeholders from the private sector can also participate, the application must be submitted by the member states. The funding opportunity was announced in February 2022. With the application deadline of 17.05.2022, interested parties only have very limited time to form a consortia for a joint application.</p><p>The objectives of the call are as followed:</p>  Support the piloting of the European Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet  Promote the development of use&nbsp;cases  Test the interoperability and scalability of use&nbsp;cases  Trial user journey and collect feedback for&nbsp;updates  Promote the opportunities of the EUDI&nbsp;Wallet  Help build the necessary expertise and infrastructure  <p>The announcement of the funding and tender opportunity can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/digital-2022-deploy-02-electronic-id;callCode=DIGITAL-2022-DEPLOY-02;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=1,0;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programmePeriod=2021%20-%202027;programCcm2Id=43152860;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destination=null;mission=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState">here</a>.</p><p>In the following, we would like to summarise feedback from diverse experts and highlight the most important aspects, which need further attention. However, there are also other aspects, which need to be improved, which aren’t listed&nbsp;here.</p> Anti-coercion <p>Coercion is the practice of persuading someone to do something by using force or threats. Since there is a big imbalance of power between big corporations or governments and users/citizens, safeguards against abuses of this system for tracking, profiling or targeted advertising is of the utmost importance. When the only way to get access to a service is to surrender personal data to a third party, there isn’t much an individual can do against it. The regulation currently doesn’t address this issue adequately. Potential solutions could be to require information requests to have a non-repudiable digital signature from the verifier to prove inadequate requests as well as an anonymous complaint mechanism to report this bad behaviour as pointed out by <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Drummon Reed in the manning publication “Self-sovereign identity”</a>.</p> Privacy: <p>There are very positive principles included in the current draft, such as the explicit prohibition for issuers of a European Digital Identity Wallet to collect more than the necessary minimum information about the user than required to provide the service. However, it also includes a unique and persistent identifier of a wallet/citizen. The <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/system/files/2021-07/21-07-28_formal_comments_2021-0598_d-1609_european_digital_identity_en.pdf">European Data Protection Supervisor recommends alternative ways to replace the proposed unique and persistent identifier</a> by stating: “This interference with the rights and liberties of the data subject is not necessarily trivial; in some Member States, unique identifiers have been considered unconstitutional in the past due to a violation of human dignity. Therefore, the EDPS recommends exploring alternative means to enhance the security of matching.”</p> Transparency of the Toolbox&nbsp;process: <p>Since the eIDAS expert group solely consists of representatives from the member states, security or privacy experts from the private sector have very limited options to participate in the legislative process. The current draft also includes 28 occasions of statutory instruments, which clarify further details at a later stage, making it impossible to conduct a holistic risk and privacy assessment according to an <a href="https://en.epicenter.works/content/orwells-wallet-european-electronic-identity-system-leads-us-straight-into-surveillance">article by Epicenter</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/eidas/">Evernym, an Avast company, also points out </a>that remote wallet deletion, the limitation of just holding credentials from qualified trust service providers as well as high barriers to entry for the private market can significantly stifle the positive impact of the regulation.</p><p>The revision of the eIDAS regulation brings major opportunities with it. The European Commission has clearly identified the need to act and provide a holistic solution for the digital identities of natural and legal entities within the European Union. The eIDAS framework has the potential to be a global vanguard in creating trusted relationships for all stakeholders while also preserving privacy, security and transparency for its citizens.</p><p>While going in the right direction the technical details are still unclear. Without further information about the potential technical implementations and their consequences, a concluding assessment isn’t possible. There is a high risk that the planned pilot projects will develop in different technical directions, making future interoperability much more difficult. It’s also necessary to address the coercion and privacy concerns explained above. The limited options of participation for data protection and social experts also stifle public trust in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Given the global consequences of the GDPR, the eIDAS trust framework will likely have an even more severe impact on the daily lives of European citizens and beyond. Hence, it’s essential to get this right. Currently, it’s too early to draw conclusions. The publication of the final toolbox in October 2022 will include technical aspects and more detailed legal and business prerequisites. But one aspect is clear already: Wallets will be the&nbsp;future.</p><p>If you have further questions regarding Identity Wallets don’t hesitate to reach out to us via info@lissi.id — Your Lissi&nbsp;Team.</p> About Lissi: <p>Lissi provides convenient applications for companies and organisations to receive, organise and share trusted data from end users while respecting privacy and data sovereignty.

<p>What a rollercoaster the last few weeks have been! But through it all, DINZ remains on track with its mahi to advance both its purpose,&nbsp;where every New Zealander can easily use their Digital Identity&nbsp;and its mission,&nbsp;to empower a unified, trusted and inclusive Digital Identity ecosystem for Aotearoa New Zealand that enhances Kāwanatanga (honourable governance), Rangatiratanga (self-determination &amp; agency) and Ōritetanga (equity &amp; partnerships).</p>



<p>DINZ’s legendary keystone research of recent years is planned to be repeated in 2022 and is shaping up very well. But it needs your support to make it happen. Its critical importance to understanding year-on-year consumer perspectives of Aotearoa’s digital identity landscape is to be augmented in 2022. There will be an additional focus on sectors of society more challenged by digital identity, as well as a new focus on business perspectives. This is so important in the year that the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bill progresses through Parliament, where it is envisaged that some Digital Identity Service Providers may opt to become accredited/certified under the eventual regulation.<br><br>Leading by example,&nbsp;<a href="https://internetnz.nz/">InternetNZ</a>&nbsp;has stepped up as Platinum sponsor for this important research. DINZ deeply appreciates its support, this gets us over halfway towards the funds needed to begin the work. DINZ needs additional like-minded organisations who are leaders in this space – members or others – to lend financial support to enable this important research to start.<br><br><a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">Get in touch</a>&nbsp;for a Gold, Silver, or Bronze sponsor pack, outlining the opportunities available. Align your brand with this important piece of work and support and advance the industry.<br><br>Events planning is well underway, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/dinz-hui-taumata-connect-event/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;moved two months later to 27th July at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington. It takes place straight after the&nbsp;<a href="https://techalliance.nz/event/cyber-security-summit/">Cybersecurity Summit 25-26th July</a>&nbsp;and there are a few sponsorship opportunities still available to associate your organisation’s brand and purpose to this landmark event (details below).<br><br>DINZ has plans for several events in the major centres once restrictions ease, if venues can be located. Please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">get in touch</a>&nbsp;if your organisation has a suitable space that DINZ could use to host an event and do some long overdue face to face networking and catching up.</p>

<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>My educational background is in Gender Studies, so it was never my aim or expectation to have a career in the tech industry. In my first few jobs, before I had any knowledge of terms like ‘agile’ or ‘scrum’, I was naturally inclined to bring together colleagues from different functions, divide up our work into milestones, and deliver collaboratively as a team. In those early roles, because I was ‘good with computers’, I often found myself with tasks related to process digitization, website updates, and running digital marketing initiatives, in addition to team leadership and project management.</p>



<p>Several years into my career when I was working at ELLE.com, a mentor told me to look up product management, and I had a major lightbulb moment — I discovered there was a name for what I thought I did, professionally. Since that time, I’ve built a rich career in product, both as an individual contributor and as a people manager, and I’ve found my passion in strategic research and bringing new products to life.</p>
 
 
 


<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>This is such a tough question — at 20, I don’t think I was mature enough to have had a dream job. I had always been inclined to want to help people, and during my teen years I spent most of my free time volunteering with nonprofits. At 20, I’m sure I expected that I would pursue a career in an area that would better the world, with a particular focus on women and the environment.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>As I’ve taken on more senior roles, it’s been a challenge to find my leadership style and voice and to develop the resilience needed to continue to lead despite unfounded criticisms or biased feedback. Sometimes it can feel lose-lose for women in leadership, meaning that we are often penalized for demonstrating too many classically ‘male’ behaviours, while also penalized for being too classically ‘female’. There will always be critics, so I like to shift my focus inwards and frequently ask myself if I’m being true to my principles.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s the New Yorker in me, but I wasn’t naturally good at creating boundaries between work and life. It wasn’t until I moved from NYC to Sydney that I finally understood what balance could look like. I still work more than your typical 9-5, but my mindset is different. I leave my work at work, and I don’t check emails or Slack after I’ve closed my laptop for the day. And most importantly, I now take my annual leave on time and don’t check in with work while I’m away. I’ve finally learned how important it is to ‘switch off’ and leave space in my mind and my day for things that bring me personal fulfillment.</p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Women working in digital ID/tech need to be more visible, inside our orgs and externally in the industry. I think this is the #1 way we can encourage more women to pursue the same path. We have a responsibility to the generations coming up to create a presence, which we can do by asking to be part of hiring committees, volunteering to be mentors, and submitting to be speakers at industry events.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Early in my career I learned that the best way to make myself known to decision-makers was to put my hand up and ask for the work I wanted to be doing. This created opportunities for learning, development, and recognition. As I began to grow my reputation, when it came time to assign new projects or grant promotions, I was already visible and ‘proven’ to the management.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>I think we’re only just starting to see the widespread negative effects of product decisions made by my generation. Things like always-on culture, social media, endless scroll, filters, and nudges may feel like an essential part of digital life, but we’re already seeing the negative effects. As we get more distance from these so-called popular advances, more examples of ethically questionable decisions and results will emerge. Unfortunately, it will be the next generation’s responsibility to ‘clean up’ 20 years of tech-driven behaviors and culture, and I see this as a great challenge for the generation coming up now.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Find a mentor. Find a work friend. Find someone who champions you. Being a woman in tech can be difficult, but it can also be fun, engaging, and inspiring. It’s worth the challenge.</p>

<p>Without interoperability, you wouldn’t be able to read this article. Websites, computers, and servers must be able to recognize and share information with each other, and shared standards and protocols allow them to do so, thereby giving us the web. On a smaller scale, companies have their own intranets, and, on the smallest scale, you might have your own private thumb drive for personal documents that can interact with whatever machines you typically work on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interoperability is not a technological given or an inexorable process. It is a choice that needs to be actively made, and it can sometimes take considerable effort to make work. Think of electronic health care records and the years it has taken to make it easier for a patient to access their health data, something originally provisioned in a 2000 Privacy Rule to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.</p>



<p>Crises, however, can accelerate the slog to technological convergence—and that’s precisely what we’ve seen as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, a data-sharing provision of the 21st Century Cures Act came into effect: Patients must be able to have direct digital access to eight categories of clinical notes in an electronic health record, notably—given the need for COVID testing—lab test results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cometh the legislation, cometh the tech. <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">Indicio and SITA</a> had already been working on a decentralized, verifiable credential solution to integrate passenger health data with air travel in a privacy-preserving way. Built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a>, the technology solved the problem of patient privacy by eliminating the need for a centralizing party to store patient data in order to facilitate verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the Cures Act provision, there was now no obstacle to passengers in the US accessing their COVID test data directly from a Health Information Exchange in the form of a digital credential. They could use this credential to prove their test status without having to share personal information. In situations where it was important to know which test they had taken and when, they could choose to share this information with a verifier, such as the border control or health agency of the country they were visiting.</p>



<p>This solution is now known as the <a href="https://cardea.app">Cardea Project</a>. Successfully trialed in Aruba, its codebase has been donated to Linux Foundation Public Health as an open source solution for sharing health data through verifiable digital credentials. It has an active community group, led by Indicio and Shatzkin Systems, that is working on expanding its features and, critically, its interoperability.</p>



<p>To do this, Cardea launched a hackathon for interoperability— dubbed an “<a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/09/14/cardea-interoperability-hackathon/">Interop-a-thon</a>”— in September 2021. The goal was to get companies using Aries agents to test those agents against a reference implementation of Cardea and each other. Over a half day, SITA, Liquid Avatar, IdRamp, GlobalID, Canadian Credentials Network, and Network Synergies all successfully interoperated. That’s the headline; the story, however, is that it took work to make this happen—it was an exercise in uncovering glitches, unexpected problems, and overcoming them. That’s what made the Interop-a-thon so valuable for all the participants—and that’s why Cardea is holding a second <a href="https://cardea.app">Interop-a-thon</a> on March 17.</p>



<p>This time, in addition to&nbsp; agent testing, Cardea is going to field “out-of-band” invitations (a critical change coming to Hyperledger Aries at the end of March) and a simple reference implementation of <a href="https://indicio.tech/where-do-you-put-a-trust-registry-in-a-decentralized-digital-ecosystem-not-where-it-turns-into-a-wrench/">machine readable governance</a> (a way of adding governance rules at the agent level, thereby making governance portable and available offline).</p>



<p>Participants see interop-a-thons as a testing ground for interoperability, and therefore a way to ensure that the products and services they are building have the capacity to scale. This is a critical step toward achieving a network of networks effect. Not surprisingly, the number of participants signed up for the next Interop-a-thon is much greater than the first.</p>



<p>For Cardea, there are more and bigger trials on the way. And with each solution delivered, the scope for expansion becomes greater. If we can successfully implement a system for incorporating health data in travel, what about all the other clinical notes described by the Cures Act? What’s the roadmap to creating a decentralized health record?</p>



<p>This is the perfect challenge for an open source community to solve. And by testing the solution through an interop-a-thon, we can figure out how to make the many function as one.</p>



<p>If you want to learn about interoperability first hand, I highly encourage you to watch the video of their last Interopathon here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVywPPLhG0U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVywPPLhG0U</a>.

				 <p>We aim to provide one essential piece that is missing for uncommitted parties to engage in SSI with enthusiasm: the ability to get paid for sharing valuable insights (verifiable credential) will greatly encourage SSI uptake.</p>
<p>We believe three components are necessary and sufficient.</p>
 
 Issuers get the means to specify the terms and conditions for sale and verify that a payment has been executed. 
 Holders get the means to pay using “programmable money,” drawing on a prepay system, or tapping into an escrow account. More commonly, the holder will be able to forward the bill to a verifier. 
 Verifiers, typically a service provider seeking business from qualified holders, get the means to deal with the invoice or draw on a partner to facilitate the payment. 
 
<p>To protect privacy, we propose to link payments to the act of issuing (as opposed to presenting or verifying VCs). As a minimum, the logic would need to support most both debit and credit payments, the ability to charge different prices based on urgency and expiry, “invoicing” compliant with account and vat rules, and possibly to deal with refunds and the assistance of third parties to settle a transaction on behalf of all parties involved.</p>

				 <p>SIS is developing an SSI solution in the e-Government area that will enable government and business organizations operating in the cross-border logistics ecosystem to authorize their representatives in order to perform appropriate actions on behalf of the organization using an ecosystem-specific scheme (with required attributes). </p>
<p>Currently there are no authorization mechanisms that could link natural persons to organization in the cross-border logistics ecosystem. Problems occur if the organization and the representative are from different countries or the representative does not agree to use their personal identifier for organizational purposes. As well, lack of such a solution results in inability to ensure interoperability, security, and to prevent fraud. ESSIF4Log will allow to authorize the representative (by issuing him verifiable credentials). It will ensure better governance, security, interoperability, will become an enabler to speed up the eCMR development/implementation process.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of CIRA?</p>



<p>As a nonprofit organization, CIRA’s mission is to build a trusted internet for all Canadians. Leveraging more than 30 years of experience managing .CA domains, CIRA offers one of the world’s most advanced back-end registry solutions and operate one of the fastest-growing country code top-level domains (ccTLD) in the world. CIRA researches and develops new technologies and solutions that help increase the security and resilience of the internet; mitigate and respond to cyber-attacks; and support new network, data, and security standards around the world. We also participate in global internet governance and advocate for a variety of internet issues in Canada such as access to broadband internet, privacy and security. Their Community Investment Program provides more than $1 million in grants every year to projects that help create a better internet.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>We are going digital in all aspects of our lives and it’s important to have trust in our own ecosystem. CIRA believes that to build a competitive, safe, inclusive society for all Canadians; governments, organizations, businesses and the public need to trust that credentials created in a decentralized identity model are indeed from an authentic source.</p>



<p>Citizens who access services by authenticating with digital identity credentials have an expectation that the intermediary organizations responsible for performing the authentication will keep their personal information secure. Organizations involved in this chain of trust must adhere to a strict governance framework with clear rules for the collection, storage, and usage of personal information. Such a governance structure must be replete with accountabilities, checks and balances, and an audit function to ensure strict adherence. Ultimately, public trust in any system hinges upon user buy-in to the governance structure.</p>
 



 
 <a href="https://www.cira.ca/"></a> 



<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>We have seen incredible changes and significant economic advantages over the last two decades with the move to online service delivery. Critical issues have risen, from trust to privacy and security. CIRA believes that the evolution of privacy-enhancing, security-respecting, models for the delivery of digital identity is a key foundational requirement for the next stage of evolution. They believe that the approach to establishing trust anchors for decentralized digital identity may benefit from CIRA’s expertise in running one of the largest digital registries in the country and our experience in managing Canada’s DNS infrastructure.</p>



<p>CIRA believes that some important parallels can be drawn between the governance and international alignment in the management of the internet and maybe applicable to some of the issues we see with emerging decentralized identity models. W may be able to draw on our experience to help contribute to the next evolution of digital identity</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada is an advanced digital society and has contributed to the development of standards, policy and governance in all aspects of technology. Trust is very important not just nationally but internationally as various aspects of business and personal rely on digital identity. Trust is one of the core values in which Canada implements its innovative projects around the world and our capacity to be thought leaders is driving forward the creation, development and adoption of digital identity.</p>



<p>CIRA believes that community initiatives such as DIACC and other public and private sector collaborative forums in Canada, along with the presence of thought leaders and very significant contributors to the evolution of digital identity make Canada uniquely positioned to be a significant contributor to the continued evolution of digital identity.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>CIRA believes that the significant issues we are seeing with trust in digital Identity and the important principles in the philosophy embedded in decentralized identity are critical to the continued evolution of a healthy digital economy. Further, the CIRA’s decades of experience in managing the .CA domain registry on behalf of Canadians—which is at its core a form of digital identity—will positively contribute to community efforts to advance the state of digital identity and the digital economy as a whole.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>CIRA also has an innovation hub called CIRA Labs with a focus on leveraging our DNS expertise and managing their large network footprint, data centers and servers globally. They have been managing Canada’s original digital identity registry, the .CA domain name registry, on behalf of Canadians for more than 30 years. CIRA believes that the internet is an overwhelming force for good in the world, and with the right vision and collaborations, Canada can be a leader in its continued success.</p>

     <p>We have already <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/2021/12/21/e-id-based-on-ssi-needs-for-regulatory-support/">reported</a> that ambition level 3 obviously goes beyond the creation of the e-ID and aims to build an ecosystem of domain-ecosystems in which a variety of credentials can be exchanged and provided securely in addition to the e-ID.</p>
<p>In his presentation, one of our experts, Urs Fischer from HIN, explains in detail which challenges the SSI approach can help to address in the healthcare field. A special attention is made on the use-cases and challenges for physicians and other healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>The report therefore emphasises both the advantages of Ambition Level 3 as well as the reasons why the future ecosystem of the digital credentials in Switzerland should be based on on interplay of multiple sectors.</p>

<p>“Please mind the gap between the DID and the DID Document! Just like the London Underground, Layer 1 Utilities are a collection of connected rails and overlapping networks, on top of which SSI ecosystems are developed. The ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group (UFWG) are mapping out how they overlap, intersect and differentiate from each other.”</p>



<p>Layer 1 Utilities for decentralized identity are becoming increasingly diverse, complex and&nbsp; multi-functional. Covering a range of use cases from anchoring digital trust with DIDs, to decentralized governance, to enabling payments for identity credentials.</p>



<p>And as they continue to develop and expand, invariably, one question will keep coming up:</p>



<p>“What Layer 1 should I use?”</p>



<p>And to the person asking this question, I would say the following.</p>



<p>“It depends, where are you trying to get to?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like the London Underground, Layer 1 Utilities are a sprawling megalopolis of interconnecting chains, rails, and zones, laying the foundation of the ecosystems built on top.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are multiple routes and options to reach some destinations. Whereas, for other destinations, you may need to take one specific line. Some zones are more expensive than others. Others are far better connected. You can find lines underground, while some are above the surface. And if you really want, you can even find lines with trains that drive themselves!&nbsp;</p>



 Utility Foundry Working Group 



<p>As with any metro system and underground, there is not one line which goes to all stations. You need to understand where you may need to change, and where the overlaps are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Utility+Foundry+Working+Group">Utility Foundry Working Group (“UFWG”)</a>, we want to develop a cohesive map and topology of all Layer 1 Utilities, and what route is best to take for each destination. We want to help those interested in utilizing decentralized identity understand why some Utilities may fit certain use cases better than others, in terms of price, convenience, interoperability, functionality, and speed-to-production.</p>



<p>Please mind the gap between the DID and the DID Document!</p>



 The old and the new 



<p>The London Underground began in 1863 with the Metropolitan line and is still being built today, with the Elizabeth Line potentially launching this year, connecting central London with Reading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, decentralized identity has established Layer 1 utilities, and repurposed Layer 1 utilities, such as did:sov or did:web, as well as newcomers like did:keri, did:orb, or did:cheqd. In this new phase of the UFWG, we intend to continue existing work and deliverables on <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/utility-foundry-wg/blob/master/UTILITY_LIST.md">ToIP registered utilities</a>, as well as branching into new innovations, DeFi, and Layer 1 Payments, as well as decentralized governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would welcome all who are interested in the quickly developing ecosystem of Layer 1 utilities, or if you just have a desire to get more involved in SSI, to come and contribute to our deliverables:</p>



  Understand: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10NGAtlov49dbaDX96C0F4MdRrr20eHiE4RSZfJu0oXU/edit#heading=h.3e0mwiwnhg9n">A general framework for choosing which Layer 1 Utility and did method to utilise</a>  Compare: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18MpvpFPLjL2I7RSFI44heWrrvf3l9pAArzhznAPFVAQ/edit#gid=0">A comparison chart of all Layer 1 Utilities and identity overlay networks</a>  Comply: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11KkdraiY9oASjU-H91MGxJ7-mNyhnCsfNSG4MFq8Qec/edit">A guidance document for data protection and GDPR compliance</a>  Innovate: DeFi compliance on top of Layer 1 Utilities (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft</a>, <a href="https://notabene.id/">Notabene</a>, <a href="https://www.centre.io/">Centre</a>), payments for Verifiable Credentials (<a href="https://www.cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">Kilt</a>, <a href="https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/self-sovereign-identity-ssi-and-the-velocity-network/">Velocity</a>), overlay networks (<a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">did:ion</a>, <a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">did:tz</a>, <a href="https://securekey.com/securekeys-new-ledger-agnostic-solution-orb-helps-solve-decentralized-identifier-challenges/">did:orb</a>), <a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> and self-certifying identifiers, self-executable governance (to name a few!) are all Layer 1 Utility innovations on the horizon.

 EUDI Wallet: Illustration of the eIDAS roles and functions <p>In June 2021, the EU Commission presented a new draft on eIDAS regulation. The aim is to provide all citizens and businesses in the EU with digital wallets with which they can not only identify and authenticate themselves, but also store a variety of other documents (such as diplomas) and present them in a verifiable manner. In recent months, a group of experts has now presented a first outline for the architecture of an “eIDAS Toolbox” describing the reference architecture.</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert-groups/consult?lang=en&amp;groupID=3032">current version of the toolbox </a>of the revised eIDAS regulation already defined new roles within the framework as well as their functions.</p><p>In the graphic below we reorganised and regrouped the stakeholders to map the requirements for the eIDAS toolbox architecture onto a SSI framework (Self-Sovereign Identity framework). The graphic shows very clearly how well the requirements for the eIDAS toolbox can be implemented with SSI technology. This is also supported by the paper “<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-leveraging-the-ssi-concept-to-build-trust">Digital Identity: Leveraging the SSI Concept to Build trust</a>” by the European Union agency for cybersecurity ENISA.</p><p>We also added the arrow from the different issuers to the trust registries, since they need to provide information to these registries.</p>EUDI Wallet: eIDAS roles and functions reorganised by&nbsp;Lissi<p>Until the end of the year member states are now <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/digital-2022-deploy-02-electronic-id;callCode=DIGITAL-2022-DEPLOY-02;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=1,0;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programmePeriod=2021%20-%202027;programCcm2Id=43152860;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destination=null;mission=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=topicSearchTablePageState">requested by the EU Commission to implement first pilot use cases</a> on top of the reference architecture.

<p>Exploring why human trust should be an essential design element in the next generation of digital solutions</p>



<p>Every day I have conversations with people about verifiable credentials and digital identity. Invariably some form of the following challenge is put to me:</p>



<p>The world already operates pretty well using paper credentials. The costs, risks, and benefits writ-large are all well understood and accounted for. I get that Trust over IP is doing something different but what is the extra value we should expect for the effort and investment we would need to make to change the status quo?</p>



<p>Good question.</p>



<p>This year the<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group"> Ecosystem Foundry Working Group</a> (EFWG) at Trust Over IP (ToIP) wants to focus on just this question. In the early days, credential insiders had a vision of why what we were doing was not just different but better, and took to evangelizing the art of the possible. Since then, the vision and technology have matured sufficiently and we now seek to engage the larger community to hear about the business challenges they are facing that involve identity, credentials, and trust. Equally important, we want to hear from them about the organizational contexts in which these problems exist. Contexts that can expedite or hinder broader adoption and contexts that can help guide our thinking and evolution.</p>



<p>Since its inception, the EFWG has been hosting a very popular <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Presentation+Series">Presentation Series </a>showcasing projects, ideas, and solutions. This year we continue the series but with an emphasis on understanding the ‘why’ behind ToIP-aligned solutions. We believe we’re approaching the point<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19640634"> where high-value solution patterns</a> and sustainable contexts will emerge and the EFWG wants to be the place that fosters and<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19633443"> shares</a> this understanding.</p>



<p>We also want to communicate these ideas beyond working group discussions which is why we plan to distill and transmit this knowledge in a series of whitepapers and blog posts. We want to continue to socialize the concepts of verified credentials and digital identity, and explain the benefits and tools available to a broad audience. To help in communication and uptake we are spearheading the creation of <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Learning+Pathways+Taskforce">Learning Pathways</a> at ToIP. This will pull together the outputs of ToIP working groups and task forces into organized and digestible chunks with clear audiences and outcomes. We want to make the content that ToIP produces even more easy to access, put into context, and become actionable through the creation of these Learning Pathways.</p>



<p>Radio with pictures, music without a disc, computing capacity on demand. In hindsight these were all charmingly simplistic attempts to explain why certain emerging technologies were destined to usher in tectonic shifts. Over time though, we all began to understand the real impact the words tried to express. The EFWG is a community of experts and visionaries looking to provide context to some bold new ideas and welcome your participation.</p>



<p>We welcome all who are interested in the evolution of, or in being part of evolving this space to join us during our<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings#space-menu-link-content"> community zoom calls</a> every other Thursday at 8:00-9:00 am PST / 11:00-12:00 am EST / 16:00 – 17:00 UTC / 17:00 – 18:00 CET.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are affiliated with an organization that would like to be part of our Presenter Series, or would like to have a conversation with the community about how identity, credentials, and trust impacts your business, please reach out to:</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce the launch of the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) Proof of Concept Community Group, which aims to test the technical hypotheses underlying the <a href="https://gainforum.org/GAINWhitePaper.pdf">“GAIN Digital Trust” </a>white paper.</p>
<p>Back in September 2021, more than 150 co-authors called for the creation of a globally interoperable network for high-trust identity assurance. It was a “no logo, pro bono, open source” collaboration. Since then, an informal alpha proof of concept (POC) has been connecting Identity Information Providers and Relying Parties, leveraging OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance. Now, under the auspices of the OpenID Foundation, the group will be able to grow and test whether identity information can be shared across a variety of architectures, protocols, and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The Community Group will meet each Thursday at 7pm UTC beginning Thursday, March 3, 2022. Further information about the POC, including meeting details, FAQs, events, media, and other resources, can be found on the <a href="https://openid.net/gainpoc/">GAIN Community Group webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Enrollment in the POC is open to the public including organizations and individuals. If you are interested in becoming a member of the POC, please complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/LLG4VYGc4rUrZvXd6">registration form</a>&nbsp;and sign the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId%3Db7fc4075-3d35-44c5-954f-524ad0594cf8%26env%3Dna1%26acct%3Db25f9dff-690e-415a-9695-92ea42395ccd%26v%3D2&amp;source=gmail-imap&amp;ust=1646313761000000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2cz0TPpInTCKBvAcfxnopU">Participation Agreement</a>.

 What happened Wednesday night and how did we get to this point ? 
<p>Commercio.network on February 23rd at 18:11 reached &nbsp;the 66.66% consensus &nbsp;to &nbsp;migrate &nbsp;the blockchain &nbsp;core software to the 3.0 version. A great operation that involved 70 of the 100 nodes that are part of the network and reached 100% consensus a few minutes later. What a rush ! The absolute migration’s protagonists &nbsp;were &nbsp;Marco, Mario, Nicola, Markus, Daniele, Angelo, Mattia, Dave, Greg, Dilan, Ivar and all the other CTOs of the companies that are part of the network.</p>
<p>These intense minutes in which the chain migrated from version 2.2 to version 3.0 have been preceded by a year of hard work by &nbsp;20 developers coordinated by CTO Marco Ruaro who built from scratch the new release based on the latest version of COSMOS SDK. &nbsp;This release will allow Commercio to join &nbsp;the #IBCGANG and then finally be able to exchange virtual assets from &nbsp;commercio.network to &nbsp;the whole Cøsmos ecosystem &nbsp;via IBC interchange protocol and finally on Ethereum thanks to the new Gravity Bridge.</p>
 What has changed and what will change for users of the Commercio.network blockchain ? 
<p>Commercio.network is the world’s only legally binding blockchain (eIDAS compliant) that can solve 6 fundamental problems:</p>
 1. E-ID Create and manage Self Sovereign Identity SSI. 
<p>EIDAS2 electronic identity by implementing W3C SSI standards to issue DID DDO and external verifiable credentials (VC)</p>
 2. E-SIGNATURE Electronically sign PDF and XML documents 
<p>To electronically sign any digital document with the same legal effect as a paper document.</p>
 3. E-DELIVERY Notarizes the exchange of documents between parties 
<p>To exchange and notarize any digital document with the same legal effect as a paper document.</p>
 4. E-KYC Manage KYC procedures for AML purposes 
<p>To perform Know Your Customer (KYC) and sign the due diligence form in accordance with Anti Money Laundering (AMLD) regulations;</p>
 5. E-PAY Request a Certified SEPA Payment 
<p>To request SEPA payment from a user with a certified IBAN certified on blockchain eliminating most of frauds related to identity theft</p>
 6. E-MINT Issue and exchange NFT Certificate tokens 
<p>To allow users with an identity and electronic signature to issue an NFT to bind any digital, physical or financial asset</p>
 How will Commercio&nbsp;NFT Certificates &nbsp;on commercio.network change the world ? 
<p>An NFT on commercio.network is a digital bearer certificate, simply put it is a negotiable instrument that transfers ownership of any asset (such as certified digital assets, physical assets, receivables, stocks or debts) not to a specific person (assignee) but rather to whoever holds the NFT.</p>
<p>Who holds the NFT in their &nbsp;Wallet (non custodial) is the owner of the underlying asset. But not by virtue of a smart contract, but by a true legally binding contract between the parties. A contract written and signed following the &nbsp;European eIDAS &nbsp; that make any digital contracts legally binding. The scope of this invention is EPIC!</p>
<p>From version 3.0 it will be possible to invoke a function called Mint, to create &nbsp;an NFT that is a certificate related to a good (a watch, a picture, a car, a house, an invoice that you actually own) To do this it is necessary to sign a contract in which you confirm that you are the owner and that you are willing to transfer its title (sale) to whoever owns the NFT. This Contractual Obligation can be obtained only thanks to the fact that Commercio.network as eIDAS compliant, allows the exchange of legally binding documents.</p>
<p>L'articolo <a href="https://commercio.network/welcome-commercio-network-3-0-come-era-legally-binding-nfts/">Welcome to Commercio.network 3.0 the  era of  the legally binding NFTs</a> sembra essere il primo su <a href="https://commercio.network">commercio.network</a>.</p>

 Case Study: Zusammenarbeit von DATEV eG und Lissi für die Ausstellung von verifizierbaren Nachweisen. Case Study: Vereinfachtes Zugangsmanagement für Mitarbeiter:innen durch digitale Nachweise. Einführung Anwendungsfall <p>Ende November 2021 startete <a href="https://www.datev.de/">DATEV eG</a> die Nutzung von verifizierbaren Nachweisen mit der intern entwickelten CovidSHIELD-App, um Covid-19 PCR-Testergebnisse für Mitarbeiter:innen nutzerfreundlich in einem Wallet darzustellen.</p><p>Die PCR-Tests werden in einem internen Testcenter durchgeführt, welches Pooltests verwendet und damit sehr effizient arbeitet. Bei einem Pooltest werden bis zu 35 Personen (in der Regel aus demselben Arbeitsbereich und derselben Schicht) in einem “Pool” zusammengefasst.</p> Testablauf und Verbindungsaufbau <p>Jede Person gibt zwei Proben ab, eine für den gemeinsamen Pooltest und eine B-Probe für einen ggf. notwendigen individuellen Test. Zusätzlich wird von allen am Pooltest teilnehmenden Personen das <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> auf das Handy geladen. Die Pool-Master — das sind diejenigen Personen, die die Koordination eines Pools übernehmen — verfügen zusätzlich über die CovidSHIELD Web&nbsp;App.</p><p>Über den Scan eines QR-Codes mit dem Lissi Wallet wird eine Verbindung zur CovidSHIELD-App des Pool-Masters aufgebaut.</p>Illustration der CovidSHIELD Anwendung sowie des Lissi&nbsp;Wallets. Inhalt der Nachweise <p>Die im Falle eines negativen Testergebnisses ausgestellten Nachweise enthalten den Vor- und Nachnamen der getesteten Person, den Text “…ist negativ” sowie das Datum an dem der Test durchgeführt wurde, um die Gültigkeit überprüfen zu&nbsp;können.</p><p>Ein Nachweis wird immer nur über ein negatives Testergebnis ausgestellt, niemals über ein positives.</p> Ablauf bei negativem Pooltest <p>Zunächst erfolgt der PCR-Test der gemeinsamen Poolprobe. Ist diese negativ, so wird für alle Personen, die am Test teilgenommen haben, ein negativer Testnachweis über die CovidSHIELD-App erstellt.</p><p>Dazu wird durch Klick auf die Schaltfläche “Alle Proben sind negativ” automatisch die Ausstellung an alle getesteten Personen eines Pools gestartet und an das Lissi Wallet gesendet. Nach Annahme des Nachweises im Wallet kann dieser dann in Verbindung mit dem DATEV-Mitarbeitenden-Ausweis bei Bedarf beim Betriebsschutz gezeigt&nbsp;werden.</p>Illustration der CovidSHIELD Anwendung sowie des Lissi&nbsp;Wallets. Ablauf bei positivem Pooltest <p>Alternativ ist im Falle eines positiven Pooltests eine Analyse der abgegebenen B-Proben notwendig, da mindestens eine Person positiv ist. Nachdem diese Ergebnisse vorliegen, wird für jede Person das Ergebnis der B-Probe individuell in der CovidSHIELD-App ausgewählt und im Falle eines negativen Ergebnisses über die anfangs aufgebaute Verbindung an das jeweilige Lissi Wallet bzw. den/die Mitarbeiter:in gesendet.</p>Illustration der CovidSHIELD Anwendung sowie des Lissi&nbsp;Wallets. Zeitlicher Ablauf <p>Die folgende Darstellung zeigt den zeitlichen Ablauf für den Fall eines negativen als auch eines positiven Pooltests mit anschließender Überprüfung der B-Proben.</p>Illustration des Ablaufs des Anwendungsfalls. Technische Integration <p>Der Anwendungsfall wird aktuell von mehr als 700 Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern genutzt und es wurden bereits über 5.900 verifizierbare Nachweise ausgestellt. Dabei gab es bisher keinerlei Probleme hinsichtlich der Performance, der Verfügbarkeit oder des Speicherverbrauchs.</p><p>Von technischer Seite aus werden folgende Komponenten verwendet</p>  Keycloak als Zugriffsschutz (nur die Pool-Master können die CovidSHIELD-App nach korrekter Authentifizierung aufrufen)  Die selbstgeschriebene CovidSHIELD-App, um die Verbindungen zu den Lissi Wallets aufzubauen und die Testergebnisse einzupflegen  Der <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Cloud Agent Python </a>(“Aca-Py”) für die Kommunikation mit dem BCGov-Testnetzwerk und das Ausstellen der Nachweise an die Lissi&nbsp;Wallets  Die Backend-Komponente für die Business-Logik  Das BCGov-Testnetzwerk, um den <a href="http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/browse/domain?page=1&amp;query=3V3pcFYx2mXDt9NxjLbG2u&amp;txn_type=1">dezentralen Identifier (DID) der DATEV</a>, das Schema und die darauf aufbauende <a href="http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/browse/domain?page=1&amp;query=3V3pcFYx2mXDt9NxjLbG2u%3A3%3ACL%3A45784%3Astaging&amp;txn_type=102">Credential Definition</a> für die Nachweise zu hinterlegen  Das Lissi&nbsp;Wallet  Technische Komponenten und Rollen im Anwendungsfall Nutzung des Lissi&nbsp;Wallets <p>Zu Beginn wurden mehrere Wallets getestet. Die finale Entscheidung fiel auf das Lissi Wallet, da dieses das größte Maß an Benutzungsfreundlichkeit sowie den stabilsten operativen Betrieb bietet. Zusätzlich ausschlaggebend waren die automatische Auswahl des Netzwerks und die Verfügbarkeit der deutschen Sprache.</p> Implementierung <p>Der Anwendungsfall konnte zügig durch das Blockchain-Team aus dem DATEV eG Inkubator implementiert werden. Das Backend und auch das Frontend der CovidSHIELD-App wurden über TypeScript und Svelte implementiert. Die Kommunikation inklusive Ausstellung der Nachweise zu den Lissi Wallets erfolgt dabei über den&nbsp;Aca-Py.</p><p>Das Schema und die darauf aufbauende Credential Definition (also die Struktur der Daten, die in einem Nachweis enthalten sind) wurden auf dem BCGov-Testnetzwerk hinterlegt. Dazu sind Schreibrechte notwendig, welche über den Endorser-Service beantragt wurden.</p><p>Die anderen Komponenten (Aca-Py sowie das Lissi Wallet) bedürfen keiner expliziten Zustimmung für die&nbsp;Nutzung.</p> Vorteile der Implementierung <p>Die Implementierung des Anwendungsfalls basierend auf der SSI Technologie mit dem Lissi Wallet bringt folgende Vorteile mit&nbsp;sich:</p>  Direkte Ausstellung der Nachweise an Mitarbeiter:innen, die Nachweise liegen nur in dem Wallet der jeweiligen Person  Einfacher Empfang, Verwaltung und Präsentation der Nachweise  Schnelle Implementierung ohne große Genehmigungsverfahren  Kostengünstige Implementierung, mit lediglich Personalkosten und Hosting des Agents der CovidSHIELD-App  Verbindung mit weiteren Anwendungsfällen (DATEV-Mitarbeitenden-Ausweis, Zugangsmanagement etc.)  Vermeidung von Honeypots von personenbezogenen Daten durch dezentrale Speicherung   Weiterer Ausbau des Anwendungsfalls <p>Bisher wird lediglich eine Sichtprüfung des Nachweises durchgeführt. Um die kryptografische Verifizierung des Nachweises zu vereinfachen, wird das Lissi Wallet zukünftig die Funktion anbieten, dass Nutzende ihre Nachweise direkt als QR-Code präsentieren können. Zudem soll das<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0095-basic-message"> Basic Massage Protokoll</a> unterstützt werden, sodass getestete Personen über den aktuellen Stand des Tests informiert werden können (z.B. “Poolprobe positiv, B-Proben werden analysiert”).</p><p>Bei Fragen oder Anliegen der Case Study können Sie sich an <a href="mailto:info@lissi.id">info@lissi.id</a> oder <a href="mailto:blockchain@datev.de">blockchain@datev.de</a> wenden.</p> Herausgeber: <p>Blockchain@DATEV<br>DATEV eG<br>Paumgartnerstr. 6–14<br>90429&nbsp;Nürnberg</p><p>Lissi <br>Main Incubator GmbH<br>F&amp;E Einheit der Commerzbank Gruppe<br>Eschersheimer Landstr. 6<br>60322 Frankfurt</p>

<p>The Trust over IP Foundation was established to bring trust into the virtual, online world where, all too often, there is low or no trust in data exchanges. In this post, on the topic of how the public sector should consider SSI, we examine the efforts of the US federal government to adopt zero trust architecture (ZTA) and its implications for using decentralized identity.&nbsp; As stated in federal guidance, “The foundational tenet of the Zero Trust Model is that no actor, system, network, or service operating outside or within the security perimeter is trusted. Instead, we must verify anything and everything attempting to establish access.”</p>



<p>The proliferation of cloud computing, mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT), and wireless technology has changed the traditional paradigm of computing, and with it the traditional approach to cyber security leveraging access management and security controls at the network boundaries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing this increasing threat, the US Government, through the Department of Defense (DoD) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has led the development of a new approach to security and threat management called Zero Trust Architecture, or ZTA. A zero trust cybersecurity approach removes the assumption of trust typically given to devices, subjects (i.e., the people and things that request information from resources), and networks. It focuses on accessing resources in a secure manner, regardless of network location, subject, and asset, and enforcing risk-based access controls while continually inspecting, monitoring, and logging interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two weeks ago, the requirements of the Executive Order were further delineated in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Office of Management and Budget memo M 22-09</a>, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles, and set a deadline of October of 2023 for all federal agencies to implement ZTA standards and objectives in their technology infrastructure. Unfortunately, the opportunity to truly recognize “zero trust”, and by extension the principles of SSI, appear to be left as a gap. The ToIP framework provides an opportunity to implement design choices which help address this gap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The role of Identity in Zero Trust</p>



<p>Identity plays a key role in ZTA. “Users” and “Devices” are two of the seven pillars of Zero Trust in DoD, and one of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA’s) “five pillars” for zero trust maturity (identities, devices, networks, applications and workloads, and data). The DoD implementation guide specifically references the Identity and Credential Access Management (ICAM) Reference Design as the basis for managing the identity of Person and Non Person Entities to support ZTA. The OMB guidance comes up short, only referencing “Using centrally managed systems to provide enterprise identity and access management services” to support an agency ZTA strategy. NIST and DoD have both laid the foundation for serious consideration of SSI and decentralized identity that appear to fail to make it to the guidance at a federal level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zero Trust and SSI</p>



<p>Zero Trust is based on the premise that “that no actor, system, network, or service operating outside or within (emphasis added) the security perimeter is trusted”. In the same respect, SSI ascribes to the principle that identity is retained by the person (entity) and only shared based on pre-agreed terms of trust – a Trust Framework. ZTA requires that “we must verify anything and everything attempting to establish access” while SSI prescribes selective disclosure and zero knowledge proofs that cryptographically confirm an identity without repeated disclosure of identity attributes for both authentication and authorization. ZTA and SSI then become “both sides of the same coin”, protecting both the entity (which must trust the verifier in sharing their information) and the network (which must verify the entity to trust it with access).</p>



<p>The President’s Executive Order makes one thing clear – “…the Federal Government needs to make bold changes and significant investments in order to defend the vital institutions that underpin the American way of life.” This bold change means moving from the traditional thinking of centralized, or even federated, identity structures and methods and recognizing “trust must go both ways” or&nbsp; expect no trust at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the ToIP Framework has yet to be demonstrated at the scale of full&nbsp; ZTA interoperability needed by the U.S. government—or other world governments—it is indeed the architecture they should be investing in to reach that level of interoperability at scale. It will also enable governments to do so without vendor lock-in, support “digital sovereignty” and—even better—it will enable peer-to-peer trust between any governments, their agents, and citizens based on their own governance frameworks and trust policies.</p>



 If You Are a Government… 



<p>Efforts are underway around the globe to promote new trust models between governments and citizens that promotes privacy and improves how trust is established between entities sharing information. Now is the time for the US government to consider and adopt the ToIP Framework as a starting point to not only support ZTA but promote greater privacy in information sharing within its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

 Staffing changes at DIF 
 
 
<p>Balázs' time at DIF coming to an end: both the team here at DIF and all of our members would like to thank Balázs for his tireless work in building up and supporting a vibrant community over the past few years.</p>
 
 We wish him all the best in his future endeavors at multi-chain KYC verification platform <a>kycDAO</a>. We also expect him to still come back and visit! 
 Balázs: Thank you. Seriously, the DIF community was my home for the past 2,5 years. Getting involved with such an exciting and ever-growing group was a life-changing experience. I had the chance to help hundreds of companies take their first steps on their decentralized identity journey. With the help of our membership, the foundation grew from ~70 members to 300+ members spanning the globe. From the original 4 working groups, we have formed 10 WGs, including multiple joint groups with some of the most established players in the industry.<br>
My role as the head of operations offered extensive exposure to concepts and ideas that were challenging the status quo of digital identity management. With the help of members, we explored different work items and models that sometimes never reached the market.<br>
I look forward to leveraging my understanding of decentralized identity and open source IPR protected work. I will still be available on DIF slack and around the community! 
 
 
 
<p>DIF would like to welcome Paul Grehan to DIF as Program Manager: A warm welcome from the entire community; we are excited to work together and see how was can engage, delight and surpass in 2022 and beyond!</p>
 
 Paul: Firstly, I would like to acknowledge all the hard work and effort that Balázs has put into this community to date, amazing! I feel privileged to be a part of such a strong and committed cohort of like-minded people and organizations, driven by a need to develop such a crucial element missing in today's digital environment - decentralized identity.<br>
To say it's an exciting time in this field would be the understatement of the decade and I am thrilled (and a bit nervous!) to help the foundation support and grow the community to deliver on its incredible potential. There is a long list of individuals that help make this community a success, my promise is to ensure we, at DIF, continue to enable you all to do so.<br>
Please feel free to contact me via any of our platforms (incl. Slack &amp; Discord) or directly - I would love to hear your story and how DIF plays a role in that.

 Condatis' blog takes a look at the identity model called <a href="https://condatis.com/news/blog/bring-your-own-identity-you-own-it/">Bring Your Own Identity,</a> and how decentralization brings privacy and data ownership to individuals. 
 In <a href="https://condatis.com/news/wallets-turned-digital/">Wallets turned Digital</a>, Condatis' Solutions Architect, Richard Astley, talks about the importance of identity, the links between physical and digital wallets, verifiable credentials, and more. 
 

<p>Centre.io</p>
 
 Centre.io just launched Verite, an open-source Verifiable Credential framework bringing data minimization and “once-only” architectures to portable KYC verification across the Web3 and DeFi ecosystems. The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220217005290/en/Centre-Announces-Verite---A-Decentralized-Identity-Solution-for-Crypto-Finance">press release includes a link to the comprehensive "dev docs" and sample implementation.</a> 
 
 
<p>ValidatedID</p>
 
 Is it possible to issue Verifiable Credentials compliant with the existing European regulation while eIDAS v2 is not approved? ValidatedID have integrated a new eIDAS Bridge in their VIDchain Services to do just that, based their development in the EC’s ISA2 program. <a href="https://www.validatedid.com/post-en/the-time-for-the-eidas-bridge">More details here</a>

 The challenge of dealing with unknowns 
<p>How to move forward when expectations are high whilst divers and many open questions seem to lure on the way? How to demonstrate value of a constantly developing technology before all open issues are clarified? These uncertainties seemingly dominated the recent participation conference organized by the federal project team as the start of a series of similar events to accompany in the most transparent way the development and legislation of the newly proposed E-ID-Ecosystem for Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DIDAS (Digital Identity and Data Sovereignty Association), a not-for-profit organization uniting leading experts on Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) from academia, public and private entities in Switzerland, proposes a two streams approach to tackle this great endeavour.&nbsp;</p>
 Stream 1&nbsp; – Exploring the Foundations 
<p>The main goal of stream 1 is to show, not to tell.&nbsp; In a sandbox-type test environment practical uses cases of all sorts and sectors shall be developed and demonstrated to the general population not yet familiar to the concepts of an E-ID-Ecosystem.&nbsp; Here the main effort is to develop prototypes of the tools and applications for verifiers, holders and issuers of digital credentials, which will be made easier by leveraging readily available tools and frameworks for the underlying decentralized trust network . This is a standard procedure in modern product management known as MVP (minimum viable product). These applications will never go in production directly but serve to demonstrate the interactions of all players in such an ecosystem with all its different sectors. The key goal here is&nbsp; to demonstrate user interactions and raise all necessary questions upfront to enable the construction of a secure and efficient future E-ID-Ecosystem for real life in Stream 2.&nbsp;</p>
 Stream 2 – Building the Extended SSI Ecosystem 
<p>Stream 2 takes up all important tasks which are necessary to design and build the infrastructure, tools and governance required to provide the solid, secure and internationally interoperable basis for a Swiss E-ID as well as digital credentials from all other sectors. Key questions such as security, privacy, efficiency and resilience as well as necessary business models will be carefully evaluated, discussed and implemented.&nbsp;</p>
 Moving Fast Towards Production 
<p>Both streams will run in parallel. They will nurture each other by sharing experiences, identifying and raising new questions and finding new answers.&nbsp; The key is to iterate on the implementation in an agile way until the moment when the system, tools and governance will be safe enough to be put into production. We expect the first pilot implementation not to be the E-ID itself but rather verifiable credentials in need of lower assurance levels such as membership cards, tickets or other credentials which will be used , potentially, on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In such pilot applications, critical questions of user experience and acceptance can be validated in real life. The findings and results will feedback into further development of the systems and hardening of security and privacy. This is also a great practical way to identify legal aspects that need clarification or even potential changes in the relevant laws. Since we expect strong further development in all aspects of SSI, this approach allows for agile and continuous improvement until the stage where it will be safe enough to broadly launch the Swiss E-ID with great user experience and many questions answered.&nbsp;</p>
