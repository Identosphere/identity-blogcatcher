<p>Description</p>



<p>The Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) has been developed jointly by UN/CEFACT and OASIS as the successor to the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) version 1.3 and the OASIS Business Document Envelope (BDE) Version 1.1.</p>



<p>XHE defines a business-oriented artefact either referencing (as a header) or containing (as an envelope) a payload of one or more business documents or other artefacts with supplemental semantic information about the collection of payloads as a whole. An exchange header envelope describes contextual information important to the sender and receiver about the payloads, without having to modify the payloads in any fashion. This vocabulary is modeled using the UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification Version 2.01.</p>



<p>The TC received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ph-xhe open source project, Chasquis Consulting, and Efact [5].</p>

An important dimension of this development has been the expansion of new media, where new technologies such as social media have <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-new-media-platforms-have-become-powerful-across-africa-107294">given voices</a> to the hitherto voiceless and amplifying once stifled perspectives.</p><p>Given that the tight control many authoritarian regimes on the continent exercised relied on having a tight grip on public discourse, the Internet and the new media it spawned soon ran into <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37300272">cross hairs</a> with governments from Cairo to Cape Town. Africa has one of the most censored digital environments in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pushing back against this censorship is a community of digital rights defenders. A basic, yet important tool in their efforts to promote media freedom is <a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018/05/23/why-and-how-do-we-document-the-impact-of-rights-violations/">documentation</a>. In the aid of digital rights defenders everywhere, here’s a summary of some of the most important developments in digital rights in Africa in Q1&nbsp;2021.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/human-humanity-silhouettes-camera-109103/">Pixabay</a> Internet shutdowns and website&nbsp;blocks <p>Sage-like, I had <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">written presciently</a> in the first week of January that it was not a matter of if, rather when Internet shutdowns will occur in 2021. Like clockwork, the first Internet <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/uganda-shuts-down-internet-during-presidential-election/av-56243961">shutdown</a> happened shortly later in Uganda on January 13 on the eve of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55649467">Presidential elections</a> which saw young activist Robert Kyagulanyi (aka Bobi Wine) challenge Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan President. The Internet shutdown was ordered by the government in retaliation for Facebook’s move to block a number of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-uganda-election-facebook-idUSKBN29G1H9">pro-government accounts</a>.</p><p>On November 4 2020, the Ethiopian government cut off <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/ethiopia-telephone-internet-services-tigray-2731442">telephone and Internet service</a> in the northern region of Tigray at the commencement of military offensive against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The restrictions on telephone and Internet service persisted into 2021. Curiously, numerous Twitter accounts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/17/ethiopias-cracking-down-tigray-activists-are-spreading-news/">were created</a> elsewhere in the country in the following days to fill the information vacuum created in the Tigray&nbsp;region.</p><p>Following opposition protests after run-off elections in Niger on February 21, mobile Internet service providers <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/niger-election-internet-blackout/">disrupted service</a>. The election was won by Mohamed Bazoum, a former Interior Minister and candidate of the ruling party in the first <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56175439">democratic transition</a> in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>On March 5, Facebook, YouTube, and Whatsapp were <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/social-media-and-messaging-apps-disrupted-in-senegal-amid-political-unrest-eA1R5pBp">restricted</a> on the Orange/Sonatel network in Senegal following protests against the arrest of opposition politician Ousmane Sonko of the Pastef party. Ousmane Sonko had been earlier accused of rape — an allegation he claimed was <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/03/05/senegal-blocks-social-media/">politically motivated</a>.</p><p>On Election day March 21, there was a disruption to Internet connectivity in Congo. The election, won by incumbent President Dennis Sassou Nguesso who was seeking his fourth term in office, was marked by low <a href="https://www.africanews.com/2021/03/21/congo-election-low-voter-turn-out-internet-shutdown-mark-polls//">voter turn-out</a>. The major opponent to the incumbent Guy-Brice Parfait Kolélas died of Covid-19 on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56474855">election day</a>, after being flown out to France for medical attention.</p><p>In January, People’s Gazette, a critical website in Nigeria, was <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2021/01/28/nigerian-government-blocks-peoples-gazette-website-over-critical-media-reports">blocked</a> ostensibly from orders from the Nigerian government following an <a href="https://www.gazettengr.com/atiku-rsf-global-rights-gatefield-others-condemn-nigerian-govts-blocking-of-peoples-gazette-website/">investigative report</a> about senior officials of the President.</p> Legal and Policy developments <p>In Kenya, the Finance Act of 2019 empowered the Kenya Revenue Authority to announce a Digital Services Tax in 2020. The tax came into <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/12/tnf-kenya-digital-services-tax-regulations-effective-date-2021.html#:~:text=Overview%20of%20the%20digital%20services,of%20the%20gross%20transaction%20value.&amp;text=The%20digital%20services%20tax%20will,services%20through%20a%20digital%20marketplace.">effect</a> on January 1 2021.

According to AccessNow, it gives sweeping <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/kenya-right-to-privacy/">powers</a> to the Cabinet Secretary of Interior and Coordination of National Security to access data from any phone or computer.</p><p>In a landmark judgment in <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/4416/south-african-constitutional-court-declares-bulk-surveillance-powers-unlawful">favour</a> of privacy in February, South Africa’s Constitutional Court declared the bulk interception of communications by the country’s spy agencies unlawful. The case was based <a href="https://www.techfinancials.co.za/2021/02/15/top-court-ruling-on-south-africas-spy-law-is-a-victory-for-privacy-but-loopholes-remain/">on evidence</a> that the state spied on investigative journalist Stephen Patrick Sole of amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism while communicating with a source. The applicants including amaBhungane Centre argued that the Regulation of Interception of Communications Act of 2002 (RICA) and the National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994 (NSIA) violate the right to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>In Uganda, the Tax Amendment Bills, 2021 is before Parliament for debate. If passed into law, will take effect from 1st July 2021. Among its goals are <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ug/Documents/tax/Uganda%20Draft%20Tax%20Amendment%20Bills%20Highlights%202021-2022.pdf?id=ke:2sm:3tw:4%23TaxAlert,%23Tax::6tax:20210401144115::4687826861:5&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_campaign=%23TaxAlert,%23Tax&amp;utm_content=tax&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;linkId=115105719">repealing</a> the top services (OTT) tax (reducing the rate of over the top tax from 20% to 12%) and introducing a new tax on internet&nbsp;data.</p><p>Zambia enacted a Cybersecurity and <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/acts/Act%20No.%202%20of%202021The%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Cyber%20Crimes.pdf">Cybercrime Act</a> which gives sweeping powers to the government to exercise greater control over social media and conduct communications surveillance without a court order. The Law has been quickly <a href="https://misa.org/news/zambias-newly-enacted-cybercrime-law-challenged-in-court/">challenged</a> in the High Court of Zambia by a coalition of civil society organizations who are praying the court to declare the law unconstitutional.</p> Arrests and detentions <p>In Zimbabwe Devine Panashe Maregere and his wife Vongai Nomatter Chiminya were both arrested in January for sending <a href="https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/africa/couple-detained-for-claiming-mnangagwa-died-of-covid-19-3272772">a message</a> on WhatsApp claiming that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had died of Covid-19. They were charged at Beitbridge magistrate court with publishing or communicating falsehoods.</p><p>On February 9 2021 Innocent Bahati, a poet and singer was <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/30/rwanda-arrests-prosecutions-over-youtube-posts">reported missing</a>. He was last seen a few prior in Nyanza, Southern Province. Innocent’s poems, which he recited in videos posted on YouTube, focused on issues such as poverty or criticism of the government, for which he had once been detained.</p> Countering Business as usual in Q2&nbsp;2021 <p>Why digital rights violations persist in the most brazen forms such as Internet shutdowns and clampdowns on freedom of expression in Africa has roots in the broader dysfunctional state of politics and society in general on the continent. We can only improve human rights standards when there has been a more fundamental change in the way our societies are run — which will include key institutional reforms in electoral democracy and economic justice. It is a campaign we’ve <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">commenced</a> in Q1 2021 and will gladly continue in Q2&nbsp;2021.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/what-happened-with-digital-rights-in-africa-in-q1-2021-93a890cf3e2d">What happened with digital rights in Africa in Q1 2021?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity</p><p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, "v1" so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p><p>What exactly is a “Sidetree”?</p><p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. &nbsp;Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains-- but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the &nbsp;Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF members.</p><p>The team that delivered the specification</p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA, USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON, Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. &nbsp;Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX, USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p><p>The first generation of Sidetree Systems</p><p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey &nbsp;has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION network.  <p>What's next for Sidetree </p><p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p>

<p>Digital health passes — often mischaracterized as “vaccine passports” in the popular press — are making headlines as a key component in the drive to restore global travel and restart the global economy after the massive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Enabling individuals to receive and selectively share proof-of-test, proof-of-vaccination, and proof-of-recovery with the highest standards for security, privacy and data protection will allow destination countries and travel systems worldwide to accept credentials from multiple market vendors. But concerns related to equity and access can only be addressed if these health pass implementations are designed to be interoperable.</p>



<p>As the leading global consortium for interoperable digital trust infrastructure, the ToIP Foundation has partnered with the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> –&nbsp;a project of <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> –&nbsp;to host a new Working Group focused on the core issues of interoperability, privacy, and equity for digital health passes. The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pahttps://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73790">Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass </a>consists of nine drafting groups, each focused on a specific interoperability challenge as defined in the<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GHPC-Interoperability-Blueprint-Outline-v2.pdf"> Interoperability Blueprint Outline</a>.</p>



<p>“The Good Health Pass Collaborative is bringing people together to solve a set of problems that affect the entire world,” said John Jordan, executive director of the ToIP Foundation. “This ambitious effort uniquely aligns with the mission of ToIP because it requires interoperable digital credentials that can be accepted and verified anywhere they are needed. Getting this right, and doing so now, will not only make it safe for people to travel again, it will open the door for new tools and services that can solve other challenging problems that also require global-scale digital trust. For these reasons, ToIP is honored to contribute to this urgent global mission by hosting the Interoperability Working Group on behalf of the Good Health Pass Collaborative.”</p>



<p>Each drafting group, consisting of volunteer representatives from around the world representing the health, travel, technology, and policy sectors, will first conduct an intensive 30-day sprint to develop an initial set of draft recommendations. This will be followed by a second 30 day community and public review process to develop a final set of recommendations.</p>



<p>“Digital health passes –&nbsp;If properly designed and implemented –&nbsp;could offer a path to safely restore domestic and international travel, resume certain aspects of public life, and restart the global economy,“ said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “Collaboration is critical at this juncture. Our organizations share a commitment to ensuring that digital health passes are designed and implemented in ways that serve the needs of the individuals and institutions that rely on them, while simultaneously protecting core values like privacy, civil liberties, and equity. ToIP has developed a powerful set of tools and models for digital trust frameworks, and we are delighted to be partnering with them in this critically important effort.”</p>



<p>The nine drafting groups collaborating within the new Working Group are:</p>



  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Paper+Based+Credentials+Drafting+Group">Paper Based Credentials</a> will define how a paper-based alternative can be created for any digital health pass so access will be available to all.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Consistent+User+Experience+Drafting+Group">Consistent User Experience</a> will specify the common elements required so that individuals can easily, intuitively, and safely use digital health pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Standard+Data+Models+and+Elements+Drafting+Group">Standard Data Models and Elements</a> will determine the core data items needed across all digital health pass implementations for both COVID-19 testing and vaccinations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Credential+Formats%2C+Signatures%2C+and+Exchange+Protocols+Drafting+Group">Credential Formats, Signatures, and Exchange Protocols</a> will specify the requirements for technical interoperability of Good Health Pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Security%2C+Privacy%2C+and+Data+Protection+Drafting+Group">Security, Privacy, and Data Protection</a> will define the safety requirements for Good Health Pass compliant implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registries+Drafting+Group">Trust Registries</a> will specify how verifiers can confirm that a digital health pass has been issued by an authorized issuer.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Rules+Engines+Drafting+Group">Rules Engines</a> will define how digital health pass apps can access different sources of policy information to determine what test or vaccination status is needed for a specific usage scenario.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Identity+Binding+Drafting+Group">Identity Binding</a> will specify the options for verifying that the holder of a digital health pass is the individual who received the test or vaccination credential.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Framework+Drafting+Group">Governance Framework</a> will define the overall set of policies that must be followed for an implementation to qualify as Good Health Pass compliant.  



<p>By adhering to the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint that will be synthesized from the outputs of these nine drafting groups, airlines, airports, hospitality industries, international customs officials and others will be able to process visitors easily without requiring additional unnecessary steps mandated by proprietary systems. Travelers will not be confused about which credential they need for each point of verification. Moreover, since individuals will be fully in control of their own personal data in credentials in their own wallets or devices, they can be confident that their private health data is not being tracked or misused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested organizations are invited to join the ToIP Foundation to participate directly in this new Working Group or in the public comment period in May. They are also encouraged to join the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> at ID2020 to participate in the construction, adoption, and advocacy of the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p>

<p>Ceramic is a public, permissionless, open source protocol that provides computation, state transformations, and consensus for all types of data structures stored on the decentralized web. Ceramic's real-time stream processing enables developers to build secure, trustless, censorship-resistant applications on top of dynamic information without trusted database servers.</p><p>This overview introduces how:</p>  Decentralized content computation gives rise to a new era of open source information  Stream processing provides an appropriate framework for dynamic, decentralized content  You can use Ceramic to replace your database with a truly decentralized alternative  <p>To skip ahead and get started building, try <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> to demo Ceramic in a browser application, the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI, or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p><p>This post was originally published on the Ceramic documentation site. Contents here may fall out of date, but you can always find the most up to date version <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">here</a>.</p> The internet of open source information <p>At its core, the internet is a collection of applications running on stateful data sources – from identity systems and user tables to databases and feeds for storing all kinds of content generated by users, services, or machines.</p><p>Most of the information on today's internet is locked away on application-specific database servers designed to protect data as a proprietary resource. Acting as a trusted middleman, applications make it difficult and opaque for others to access this information by requiring explicit permissions, one-off API integrations, and trust that returned state is correct. This siloed and competitive environment results in more friction for developers and worse experiences for users.</p><p>Along other dimensions, the web has rapidly evolved into a more open source, composable, and collaborative ecosystem. We can observe this trend in open source software enabled by Git's distributed version control and in open source finance enabled by blockchain's double-spend protection. The same principles of open source have not yet been applied to content.</p><p>The next wave of transformative innovation will be in applying the same open source principles to the world's information, unlocking a universe of content that can be frictionlessly shared across application or organizational boundaries. Achieving this requires a decentralized computation network designed specifically for content with flexibility, scalability, and composability as first class requirements.</p> Decentralized content computation <p>Open sourcing the content layer for applications requires deploying information to a public, permissionless environment where files can be stored, computation can be performed, state can be tracked, and others can easily access content.</p><p>Advancements in other Web3 protocols have already achieved success in decentralized file storage. As a universal file system for the decentralized web, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (including <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> and <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a>) provides an extremely flexible content naming and routing system. As a storage disk, durable persistence networks (such as <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>, and <a href="https://sia.tech/">Sia</a>) ensure that the content represented in IPFS files are persisted and kept available. This stack of Web3 protocols performs well for storing static files, but on its own lacks the computation and state management capacity for more advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. These are required to enable developers to build fully-featured decentralized applications.</p><p>Ceramic enables static files to be composed into higher-order mutable data structures, programmed to behave in any desired manner, and whose resulting state is stored and replicated across a decentralized network of nodes. Ceramic builds upon and extends the IPFS file system and underlying persistence networks, as well as other open standards in the decentralized ecosystem, with a general-purpose decentralized content computation substrate. Due to Ceramic's permissionless design and unified global network, anyone in the world can openly create, discover, query, and build upon existing data without needing to trust a centralized server, integrate one-off APIs, or worry if the state of information being returned is correct.</p> Streams <p>Ceramic's decentralized content computation network is modeled after various real-time stream processing frameworks found in Web2. In these types of systems, events are ingested, processed in real-time, and the resulting output is applied to a log. When queried and reduced, this log represents the current state of a piece of information. This is an appropriate framework for conceptualizing how dynamic information should be modeled on the decentralized web. Furthermore because the function that processes incoming events on any particular stream can be custom written with logic for any use case, it provides the general-purpose flexibility and extensibility needed to represent the diversity of information that may exist on the web.</p><p>On Ceramic, each piece of information is represented as an append-only log of commits, called a Stream. Each stream is a DAG stored in IPLD, with an immutable name called a StreamID, and a verifiable state called a StreamState. Streams are similar in concept to Git trees, and each stream can be thought of as its own blockchain, ledger, or event log.</p> StreamTypes <p>Each stream must specify a StreamType, which is the processing logic used by the particular stream. A StreamType is essentially a function that is executed in real-time by a Ceramic node upon receipt of a new commit to the stream that governs the stream's state transitions and resulting output. StreamTypes are responsible for enforcing all rules and logic for the stream, such as data structure, content format, authentication or access control, and consensus algorithm. If an update does not conform to the logic specified by the StreamType, the update is disregarded. After applying a valid commit to the stream, the resulting StreamState is broadcast out to the rest of the nodes on the Ceramic Network. Each of the other nodes that are also maintaining this stream will update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.</p><p>Ceramic's flexible StreamTypes framework enables developers to deploy any kind of information that conforms to any set of arbitrary rules as a stateful stream of events. Ceramic clients come pre-packaged with a standard set of StreamTypes that cover a wide range of common use cases, making it easy to get started building applications:</p>  Tile Document: a StreamType that stores a JSON document, providing similar functionality as a NoSQL document store. Tile Documents are frequently used as a database replacement for identity metadata (profiles, social graphs, reputation scores, linked social accounts), user-generated content (blog posts, social media, etc), indexes of other StreamIDs to form collections and user tables (IDX), DID documents, verifiable claims, and more. Tile Documents rely on DIDs for authentication and all valid updates to a stream must be signed by the DID that controls the stream.  CAIP-10 Link: a StreamType that stores a cryptographically verifiable proof that links a blockchain address to a DID. A DID can have an unlimited number of CAIP-10 Links that bind it to many different addresses on many different blockchain networks. CAIP-10 Links also rely on DIDs for authentication, same as the Tile Document.  Custom: You can implement your own StreamType and deploy it to your Ceramic node if the pre-packaged StreamTypes are not suitable for your use case.   Authentication <p>StreamTypes are able to specify their authentication requirements for how new data is authorized to be added to a particular stream. Different StreamTypes may choose to implement different authentication requirements. One of the most powerful and important authentication mechanisms that Ceramic StreamTypes support is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, the W3C standard for decentralized identifiers. DIDs are used by the default StreamTypes (Tile Documents and CAIP-10 Links).</p><p>DIDs provide a way to go from a globally-unique, platform-agnostic string identifier to a DID document containing public keys for signature verification and encryption. Ceramic is capable of supporting any DID method implementation. Below, find the DID methods that are currently supported by Ceramic:</p>  3ID DID Method: A DID method that uses Ceramic's Tile Document StreamType to represent a mutable DID document. 3IDs are typically used for end-user accounts. When 3IDs are used in conjunction with <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a> (as is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>), a 3ID can easily be controlled with any number of blockchain accounts from any L1 or L2 network. This provides a way to unify a user's identity across all other platforms.  Key DID Method: A DID method statically generated from any Ed25519 key pair. Key DIDs are typically used for developer accounts. Key DID is lightweight, but the drawback is that its DID document is immutable and has no ability to rotate keys if it is compromised.  NFT DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for any NFT on any blockchain. The DID document is statically generated from on-chain data. The DID associated to the blockchain account of the asset's current owner (using CAIP-10 Links) is the only entity authorized to act on behalf of the NFT DID, authenticate in DID-based systems, and make updates to streams or other data owned by the NFT DID. When ownership of the NFT changes, so does the controller permissions.  Safe DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for a Gnosis Safe smart contract on any blockchain. Typically used for organizations, DAOs, and other multi-sig entities.   Ceramic Network <p>The Ceramic Network is a decentralized, worldwide network of nodes running the Ceramic protocol that communicate over a dedicated topic on the Libp2p peer-to-peer networking protocol. Ceramic is able to achieve maximum horizontal scalability, throughput, and performance due to its unique design.</p> Sharded execution environment <p>Unlike traditional blockchain systems where scalability is limited to a single global virtual execution environment (VM) and the state of a single ledger is shared between all nodes, each Ceramic node acts as an individual execution environment for performing computations and validating transactions on streams – there is no global ledger. This "built-in" execution sharding enables the Ceramic Network to scale horizontally to parallelize the processing of an increasing number of simultaneous stream transactions as the number of nodes on the network increases. Such a design is needed to handle the scale of the world's data, which is orders of magnitude greater than the throughput needed on a financial blockchain. Another benefit of this design is that a Ceramic node can perform stream transactions in an offline-first environment and then later sync updates with the rest of the network when it comes back online.</p> Global namespace <p>Since all nodes are part of the same Ceramic Network, every stream on Ceramic exists within a single global namespace where it can be accessed by any other node or referenced by any other stream. This creates a public data web of open source information.</p> Additional node responsibilities <p>In addition to executing stream transactions according to StreamType logic, Ceramic nodes also maintain a few other key responsibilities:</p>  StreamState storage: A Ceramic node only persists StreamStates for the streams it cares to keep around, a process called "pinning." Different nodes will maintain StreamStates for different streams, but multiple nodes can maintain the state of a single stream.  Commit log storage: A Ceramic node maintains a local copy of all commits to the streams it is pinning.  Persistence connectors: Ceramic nodes can optionally utilize an additional durable storage backend for backing up commits for streams it is pinning. This can be any of the persistence networks mentioned above, including Filecoin, Arweave, Sia, etc. (coming soon).  Query responses: Ceramic nodes respond to stream queries from clients. If the node has the stream pinned it will return the response; if not, it will ask the rest of the network for the stream over libp2p and then return the response.  Broadcasting transactions: When a Ceramic node successfully performs a transaction on a stream, it broadcasts this transaction out the rest of the network over libp2p so other nodes also pinning this stream can update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.   Clients <p>Clients provide standard interfaces for performing transactions and queries on streams, and are installed into applications. Clients are also responsible for authenticating users and signing transactions.</p><p>Currently there are three clients for Ceramic. Additional client implementations can easily be developed in other programming languages:</p>  JS HTTP client: A lightweight JavaScript client which connects to a remote Ceramic node over HTTP. The JS HTTP client is recommended for application developers.  JS Core client: A JavaScript client which also includes a full Ceramic node. The JS Core client is for those who want the maximum decentralization of running the full Ceramic protocol directly in a browser application.  CLI: A command line interface for interacting with a Ceramic node.   Getting started  Try Ceramic <p>To experience how Ceramic works in a browser application, try the <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> app.</p> Installation <p>Getting started with Ceramic is simple. Visit the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p> Tools and services <p>In addition to various standards referenced throughout this document, the Ceramic community has already begun developing many different open source protocols, tools, and services that simplify the experience of developing on Ceramic. Here are a few notable examples:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect:</a> A authentication SDK for browser-based applications that allows your users to transact with Ceramic using their blockchain wallet.  <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX:</a> A protocol for decentralized identity that allows a DID to aggregate an index of all their data from across all apps in one place. IDX enables user-centric data storage, discovery, and interoperability. It is effectively a decentralized, cross-platform user table. IDX can reference all data source types, including Ceramic streams and other peer-to-peer databases and files.  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink:</a> A service that issues verifiable claims which prove a DID owns various other Web2 social accounts such as Twitter, Github, Discord, Discourse, Telegram, Instagram, etc. Once issued, claims are stored in the DID's IDX.  <a href="https://tiles.ceramic.community/">Tiles:</a> An explorer for the Ceramic Network.  <a href="http://documint.net/">Documint:</a> A browser-based IDE for creating and editing streams.

<p>The OpenID Foundation is proud to participate in the first ever ‘Identity Management Day,’ an annual awareness event that will take place on the second Tuesday in April each year. The inaugural Identity Management Day is&nbsp;April 13, 2021.</p>
<p>Founded by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/">Identity Defined Security Alliance</a>&nbsp;(IDSA), the mission of Identity Management Day is to educate business leaders and IT decision makers on the importance of identity management and key components including governance, identity-centric security best practices, processes, and technology, with a special focus on the dangers of not properly securing identities and access credentials.</p>
<p>In addition, the&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/">National Cyber Security Alliance</a>&nbsp;(NCSA) will provide guidance for consumers, to ensure that their online identities are protected through security awareness, best practices, and readily-available technologies.</p>
<p>From the point of view of an open identity standards development organization and with a hat tip to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">Kim Cameron’s 7 Laws of Idenity</a>, here are my 7 Laws of Identity Standards:</p>
 
 A identity standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its implementations. 
 A standard’s value can be measured by the number of instances of certified technical conformance extant in the market. 
 Certified technical conformance is necessary but insufficient for global adoption. 
 Adoption at scale requires widespread awareness, ongoing technical improvement and a open and authoritative reference source. 
 When Libraries/Directories/ Registries act as authoritative sources they amplify awareness, extend adoption&nbsp;and promote&nbsp;certification. 
 Certified technical conformance importantly complements legal compliance and together optimize interoperability. 
 Interoperability&nbsp;enhances security, contains costs and drives profitability. 
 
<p>On behalf of the OpenID Foundation, I want to thank Julie Smith, Executive Director of the IDSA for her and her colleagues’ leadership. The OpenID Foundation looks forward to supporting this important event in the years to come.</p>

<p>Forough Ghahramani, EdD, MBA, MS, Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs at Edge, served as a lead organizer for the event. A diverse group of speakers covered topics including the role of data science in the humanities, data-informed sustainability and urban development initiatives, and an industry panel exploring the expanding role of data science in healthcare, telecommunications, and IT services.</p>
<p>“The conference featuring speakers from academia and industry provided opportunities to showcase the latest data science-related research in a number of domains, learn how leading edge companies are leveraging data science for success, and to connect with potential mentors, collaborators and others in the field,” said Dr. Ghahramani. “Attendees left with a better appreciation of the fact that data science needs diverse perspectives to determine the future of data-driven decision making in a world where data collection and analysis are increasingly penetrating every aspect of our lives.”</p>
<p>“The selection of talks, the pace, and the interaction [among speakers and attendees] were so well done, and valuable to all in attendance. I personally had several takeaways, especially for my work in developing Data Science programs with an eye on diversity, equity and inclusion,” said a university Dean in attendance.</p>
<p>The event, and Dr. Ghahramani’s role as organizer, also highlights Edge’s commitment to supporting academic research and data science initiatives via <a href="https://njedge.net/research/">EdgeDiscovery</a>, a research and discovery framework designed to provide access to leading-edge technology, advanced computing resources, and training for the research community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tendermint, the team behind the interoperable blockchain ecosystem&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto/cosmos">Cosmos</a>, is building out a decentralized exchange (DEX) with a new acquisition.</p>
 
 
<p>The development studio has acquired B-Harvest, a decentralized finance project that has developed on Cosmos since the early days and which runs one of Cosmos’ validator nodes. Tendermint would not disclose all the details and dollar amount behind the acquisition, but it includes a four-year vesting of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/cosmos">ATOM&nbsp;(+3.17%)</a>&nbsp;tokens.</p>
 
 
 Tendermint will integrate B-Harvest’s Gravity DEX into Cosmos to facilitate “trustless and permissionless” trades, Tendermint’s CEO Peng Zhong told CoinDesk. 
 
 
 
 “We started working with B-Harvest in October because we were looking for a team with experience in finance and DeFi to create a decentralized exchange. With the Gravity DEX, it’s designed not just to be a native exchange for ATOM, but an exchange for tokens that use other blockchains, as well,” Zhong said.

				 <p>Verifier Universal Interface (VUI) is an interoperability working group that aims at building a complete set of standard APIs for Verifier components in SSI ecosystems</p>
<p>As different technology providers build SSI solutions, it becomes critical to ensure interoperability between these solutions. Available standards for SSI still have important gaps, leading us to an ecosystem of full-stack providers whose approach to interoperability is building proprietary plug-ins for each one of the other available solutions. This approach to interoperability is not scalable.</p>
<p>The underlying problem is that building standards take time. That is the reason that we propose a practical and focused approach to enable scalable interoperability in the SSI community.</p>
<p>We propose to start with a specific SSI component, namely the Verifier component, and lead the definition of the minimum set of standard APIs necessary to implement or interoperate with such module. That is, a role-centric approach to standardization at API level.</p>
<p>To date, 12 organisations are contributing to this initiative. The VUI working group has already drafted a first version of a generic spec that integrates existing standards and interop efforts and fills the gaps to provide a complete set of APIs. This draft version can be found at <a href="https://bit.ly/3h5VE7P">https://bit.ly/3h5VE7P</a> and has been built using ReSpec.</p>
<p>This draft version for VUI includes today 6 APIs:</p>
 
 Presentation Exchange 
 Consent Management 
 Schema resolution 
 Issuer resolution 
 ID resolution 
 Credential status resolution 
 
<p>Next steps <br>As next steps, the Working Group (WG) needs to take this ground work to a more mature level. That is, to further define the specification by achieving consensus in the broader community, and bridging perspectives from DIF, W3C, EBSI, and Aries.</p>
<p>The WG is organized in Working Packages (WP), one for each interface. Any participant can lead or contribute to WP, which shall integrate at least 2 Implementors and 1 Integrator. Implementors are responsible for defining the API, a set of interoperability tests, and service endpoints for Integrators to execute those tests.</p>
<p>The WG has launched a survey in the broad SSI community and two of the 6 interfaces have been selected as initial WPs:</p>

 And nominations are now being accepted <p>DIF was established to represent our fast changing community and to create a safe space for the co-development of next-generation code and specifications. From the original handful of members 4 years ago, the foundation has grown to become an organization with over 200 member companies, representing thousands of PRs and a strong commitment to decentralizing identity software.</p><p>Since its inception, DIF has been primarily governed by a Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is a &nbsp;group of member representatives whom lead DIF, set strategy, assure the high quality of ratified work items, react to the community’s needs, among other decisions.</p>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/@element5digital">Element5digital</a><p>Over the last year, one of the main foci of the current Steering Committee has been restructuring itself to ensure it will represent the interests and diversity of its growing membership. Among the conclusions of this analysis was that a larger steering committee would garner more trust and visibility into DIF's internal governance as an organization. An operating addendum was adopted last month which formalizes procedures for periodic elections and distribution requirements. The following repackages those policies in the form of a Frequently Asked Questions document: for further clarification, see the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/c06c17bd2df58633eb74d9d5237281c79d9b676e/Org%20documents/Membership%20agreements/DIF%20Governance%20-%20Operating%20Addendum%20-%2020210304.pdf">addendum itself</a>.</p> 
    When are the dates and deadlines for this election cycle?
<br>  Announcement of election + Nomination starts - 8th April (Thu) 
 Last day for questions to candidates - 6th May (Thu) 
 Nomination Closes - 13th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot opens - 20th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot closes - 27th May (Thu) 
 New SC first meeting - 3rd June (Thu) 
 

    Who can be nominated and by whom?
    <br><p>Any individual who is active in DIF can nominate a DIF member to the Steering Committee, and/or get nominated for the Steering Committee by someone else. We recommend nominating members of the DIF community with high visibility and recognition, whether among DIF's membership or among the wider community. Only one individual can represent each DIF member organization, and there are distribution criteria to keep the Steering Committee balanced, but those considerations are applied *after* the election. This means that multiple colleagues from the same member organization can be nominated and accept that nomination, but only one of them can sit on the Steering Committee. The DIF membership includes Associate members, Contributors, individuals who signed a Feedback Agreement, and adjacent/partner organizations referred to as Liaisons (i.e. OIDF or Hyperledger).
    </p><p><br>
Nominations should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Nomination">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address.
</p><br> 

    How and when do nominated people become candidates?<br>
    <p>Nominees will be contacted by DIF staff and must accept the nomination before the nomination period closes. Along with confirmation that they would serve if elected, they also provide a short biography and an optional statement describing their interest in and qualifications for serving on the Committee.
Early nominations are encouraged.
</p>
<br>
    How do voting members select which candidates to support?<br>
    <p>DIF Staff will share this list of accepting nominees and their statements with the membership via Slack. Since all Associate Members are eligible for one vote, it is recommended that colleagues within one member company confer or discuss in backchannel before submitting a vote on behalf of their whole company.</p>
<br>
    How can interested DIF members ask questions of all the candidates to help them decide?<br>
    <p>    
    If there are specific issues of interest to all or most of the DIF membership, any DIF member (whether they work at an Associate Member organization or not) may send clear questions to DIF staff.  Nominees should send these questions to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Questions_for_the_candidates">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address, and a representative cross-section of these (lightly edited or unedited) will be compiled into a document sent to all nominees.
</p>
<br>
    Who votes and how?<br>
    <p>Only associate members can vote, and each votes as a whole on one ballot. This too is done as via email: ballots should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Ballot_for_NAME_OF_MEMBER_ORGANIZATION">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address. These will be audited confidentially and not published in any way (not even as tallies). If one member organization accidentally votes more than once, DIF staff will reply to the emails to clarify the issue, so please use a monitored/normal email address in the organization's domain rather an personal accounts or "alts". All ballots are assumed to be collective/company-wide decisions even if multiple are received.</p>
<br>
    How many candidates can each associate member vote for?<br>
    <p>Each ballot should contain between 0 and X names, where X is the number of open seats.  Most elections, X should be between 4 and 6.  If less than X are named, the rest of the organization's votes are forfeited-- each vote counts singly.</p>
<br>
    When is the actual election period?<br>
    <p>DIF elections run for one week, from the distribution of the final list of candidates to one week later at midnight EST. In this election, those dates will be Thursday 20 May and Thursday 27 May, respectively. In the weeks leading up to 20 May, DIF staff will also contact all associate members to clarify any questions about the process and confirm the dates, the number of seats, the nominee statements, etc.</p>
<br>
    How often will the Steering Committee elections take place?<br>
    <p>They are expected to be annual, with 2-year terms to preserve continuity across elections.  If seats are unexpectedly made available between elections, they will stay open until the next election.</p>
<br>

<p>Energy Web is thrilled to be one of the three founding organizations behind the newly announced <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord (CCA)</a>. In the next year, we anticipate dozens of novel approaches coming to market focused on decarbonizing the crypto industry in the spirit of the CCA. But we’ve also developed an open-source application that can play a major role in decarbonizing Crypto: <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero (EW&nbsp;Zero)</a>.</p><p>EW Zero is a public, low-cost application built on top of the open-source Energy Web stack that helps renewable energy buyers drive their carbon footprint to zero via purchases of different renewable energy products, such as <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/prec">impact-rich renewable energy certificates</a> from emerging economies and power-purchase agreements. We can use EW Zero beginning today to help the crypto industry achieve the provisional targets of the CCA by 1) helping crypto holders directly decarbonize crypto holdings while 2) enabling entire crypto networks to decarbonize from the bottom-up.</p> Demand-side solution: help crypto holders directly decarbonize their crypto&nbsp;holdings <p>Because of how energy markets are structured, cryptocurrency producers (such as miners) in many places around the world have very little choice in exactly where their power comes from. And even where that choice exists, given the extremely fragmented nature of renewable energy markets and regulatory frameworks with varying degrees of support for renewables, finding the right renewable energy product is a daunting task. EW Zero attacks both of these problems head-on by providing renewable energy buyers with a digital application for locating, procuring, and claiming emissions reductions from verified renewables around the world in a user-friendly, streamlined way.</p><p>In the spirit of the CCA, EW Zero can be used by crypto holders to make their crypto holdings green. Whether you are an institutional cryptocurrency investor, a retail crypto hodler, application developer, crypto service provider, or an exchange, EW Zero enables you to purchase renewable energy equal to the non-renewable energy used to create and maintain your cryptocurrency holdings.</p><p>This isn’t a new concept: corporates from around the world have been purchasing low-carbon products to help decarbonize supply chains in support of corporate sustainability objectives. In climate-speak, this concept of covering the power consumption from crypto purchases/holdings is analogous to actions to reduce Scope 3 carbon emissions. What’s new here is that we’re using EW Zero to apply these kinds of transactions to decentralized sources of power consumption: blockchains.</p><p>Here’s a simple example: you are an institutional cryptocurrency investor who purchased 20,000 BTC. Based on publicly available data, we can estimate the amount of electricity attributable to your 20,000 BTC holdings each year. By extension we can estimate the total carbon footprint of your BTC by making assumptions about how green various grids are around the world (in fact, one of the provisional objectives of the CCA is to develop an industry-wide open source account standard to make this even easier). With that information in hand, you can use EW Zero to search for different renewable energy products around the world. You can then buy enough renewables to make-up for the non-green energy that went into your 20,000 BTC. There are several renewable energy products to choose from: energy attribute certificates (EACs) from existing and future assets, power-purchase agreements, and onsite solar. Energy Web will encourage buyers to support impact-rich EACs, in part because locationality standards are less applicable compared to standard corporate renewables procurement. And once you’ve bought your renewables, you can “claim” the emissions reduction from them since EW Zero makes it easy for buyers to trace the full lifecycle of every megawatt-hour of clean power they bought all the way back to the specific power plant that the energy came&nbsp;from.</p><p>This is just one example for an institutional buyer. We can make the same kinds of transactions possible in a more automated way for retail crypto holders via exchanges (think “green crypto” features directly on your favorite exchange) and integrations with&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>This is just what we can do with EW Zero today. Our vision is for a whole new category of “negative emissions” products to make their way onto Zero. Here, instead of purchasing renewable energy, cryptocurrency holders invest in different negative emissions projects from around the world to remove and lock away carbon associated with their crypto holdings.</p> Supply-side solution: enable crypto networks to decarbonize from the bottom-up <p>Grids around the world are decarbonizing and so are the blockchains underpinning them. However, verifying and credibly measuring the share of crypto production powered by renewables is extremely challenging since most data come from self-reported surveys and proxies (see <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18642645/bitcoin-energy-price-renewable-china">Vox’s article </a>on this topic) and entities like crypto miners don’t normally get the certificates or bills they need to prove where their renewables come&nbsp;from.</p><p>EW Zero and other components of the Energy Web stack address exactly this issue irrespective of the geography or market. Crypto miners and other blockchain actors will be able to automatically track renewables consumption at any given time and report that while preserving privacy. These claims will be, on the other hand, verifiable using a validation mechanism. For example, imagine a miner has onsite solar connected to the grid. This solar, along with the miner, each have unique, self-sovereign digital identities verified by trusted sources like corresponding solar manufacturers and local grid operators. All relevant events, such as estimated power production and excess power sent to the grid, are documented and validated on a highly granular level (e.g., every 30 minutes). That way, this specific miner can provide a verifiable proof of renewably powered, mining-related consumption anywhere in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The last point is key for all industries, not just crypto. Today corporates face significant challenges with reporting their impact in countries without an official tracking system. Energy Web’s open-source tech stack solves this issue. This proposed concept is similar to how Google and Microsoft are working to make their data centers 100% renewably-powered on an hourly basis according to when their data centers actually consume electricity in line with the emerging <a href="https://www.energytag.org/">EnergyTag</a> standard for&nbsp;EACs,</p> Join the Crypto Climate&nbsp;Accord <p>We are excited to act on the goals of the CCA and decarbonize blockchains. Interested companies from the energy and crypto sectors can join the CCA by contacting Energy Web directly via <a href="mailto:doug.miller@energyweb.org">doug.miller@energyweb.org</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/making-crypto-green-with-energy-web-zero-301cf4a979e5">Making Crypto Green with Energy Web Zero</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

We now offer a demonstration for the Lissi Wallet, which enables you to experience the user flow of receiving credentials and answering information requests.</p><p>You can find the demonstration on <a href="https://lissi.id/demo">www.lissi.id/demo</a>. You can either open the demo on your phone or on a desktop browser. While we recommend using the <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">Android</a>) for an optimal experience, the demo also works with other compatible wallets.</p><p>The demo contains different example use-cases to illustrate a potential user journey. The use cases are adjusted to the demonstration setup, meaning that in a real scenario there might be additional steps necessary depending on the use case at question.</p> Use case 1: Online ID (eID — electronic Identification) Get your online&nbsp;ID<p>In the first step, you get your online ID. This credential is issued to you from a municipal office&nbsp;. Imagine you are in this municipal office and show your physical ID card first. You could also get this credential by using the eID function of your pass and directly and digitally extract it via NFC from your eID-Card.</p> Use case 2: Credit&nbsp;Card Get your digital credit card from your&nbsp;bank.<p>Once you got your online ID in your wallet, you can use it to get a credit card. You can easily request a credit card as a new customer of a consumer bank.

<p></p>



<p>1.What is the mission and vision of one37 Solutions?</p>



<p>Our mission is to unlock the potential of the universal identity with privacy, security and trust, one experience at time.</p>



<p>Our vision is to deliver unparalleled personalized user experience built on decentralized secure identity platform.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>The economic costs of the fragmented identity systems across various channels and businesses, the weak identity systems resulting in identity theft, SIM swaps and account takeovers, and increased corporate liability due to data breaches and regulatory non-compliance are skyrocketing and taxing in both existing and emerging markets.</p>



<p>The implementation of trustworthy digital identity systems will have exponential effects on the market growth and efficiency by streamlining and simplifying daily processes between citizens, governments and service providers in existing markets looking for efficiency and in emerging markets looking to close their digital gap and gaining security and speed of implementation.</p>



<p>At the onset, the rollout of decentralized identity systems seems both timely and significant. However, considering the various challenges that the global industries such as travel and healthcare have been currently facing in the form of security threats, adherence to health norms or regulatory compliances, there is a digital race to incorporate all of the above through a single trust platform while also ensuring a truly seamless experience. Thus, to stay competitive and build customer loyalty, there needs to be a paradigm shift in the way new advancements in technologies can be incorporated to balance such rising risk and opportunity demands.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>A trusted digital identity will have a major impact on the Canadian and world economies by adding tremendous value to a country GDP. The speed of trust will have ripple effects on every aspect of the economy.</p>



 <a href="https://www.one37id.com/"></a> 



<p>one37 provides a state-of-the-art, safe and secure decentralized identity platform for identity verification in verticals such as travel and health. We are working with our partners and service providers to improve the daily lives of citizens in various scenarios such as “Contactless &amp; Touchless Travel” and facilitate the seamless interactions between travelers and service providers along their journey while ensuring user authenticity, data integrity, compliance and governance for all relevant stakeholders within an ecosystem.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada&nbsp;is the world leader in digital identity and the protection of privacy and personal information. By championing the implementation of a decentralized identity technology across the public and private sectors, Canada will provide the role model for the decentralized identity implementation across the world and foster unprecedented growth in the digital identity economy. Canada is in a unique position to shape the future of travel, healthcare, banking and governmental services with monumental implications on both the governmental and corporate sectors worldwide.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>To &nbsp;participate in the on-going discussions and the valuable work that DIACC is spearheading in digital identity and the implementation of the PCTF and be able to add value, work with other companies and partners and contribute in return to the growth of the identity economy.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Every one37 team member is a strong believer in the deep impact that the decentralized universal identity will have on improving the life of every Canadian and world citizen and we are committed to working with our partners to add tremendous value one experience at a time.</p>

<p>1.Understanding and Awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I increase the understanding of Blockchain in my organization?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main problems associated with Blockchain are a deep misunderstanding of the technologies associated with it and a widespread lack of understanding of how it works, especially in industries other than banking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.Collaboration and Federation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What problems and opportunities does my organization share with others in its industry? </p>
<p>Blockchain’s strength lies in creating maximum value for companies operating in the same industry sector and in areas with the same issues and opportunities. However, what is still problematic about current application methods is that they are compartmentalized approaches. Companies focus on their private blockchains, effectively negating the primary value of the blockchain – the network effect – and thus producing a less efficient result than a traditional approach. </p>
<p>3.Corporate Culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who will be most affected by the implementation of a blockchain project? </p>
<p>Although many industries have already undergone significant transformations with Digital Transformation, the implementation of Blockchain represents another complete departure from traditional approaches. It bases its reliability and authority on a decentralized network, rather than a central institution, and this loss of control can be deeply destabilizing for businesses. A Blockchain is about 80% business process change and 20% technology implementation. This means that a more open approach is needed to understand the opportunities and changes going forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Costs and Benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the costs and benefits of a Blockchain project?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startups don’t ask themselves this question and have already started to use Blockchain technology by creating new businesses and solutions to replace existing ones. On the other hand, it is traditional businesses that are asking this question because the benefits are not necessarily obvious. For large companies, Blockchain initially presented itself as something unforeseen and poorly understood. No company right now, however, feels like completely ignoring Blockchain because, given its gradual expansion, there is a fear that one day another competing company, which relies on a Blockchain system, will be a competitor.</p>

 An open letter to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network advocating for financial inclusion in its regulations <p>April 7,&nbsp;2021</p><p>On December 23, 2020, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Treasury Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/15/2021-01016/requirements-for-certain-transactions-involving-convertible-virtual-currency-or-digital-assets">Requirements for banks and money services businesses</a>” related to certain transactions involving convertible virtual currency (CVC) or digital assets with legal tender status (“legal tender digital assets” or LTDA). FinCEN is identifying additional statutory authority for the proposed rule under the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, providing additional information regarding the reporting form, and reopening the comment period for the proposal.</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit"> Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a> took the opportunity to submit its formal response to FinCEN on March 29, 2021 — focusing explicitly on how their proposed rules will impact financial inclusion.</p><p>Sovrin Foundation asked Amit Sharma, Chair of the Sovrin CIFWG, to tell us more about the potential impact of the NPRM, their response and recommendations to&nbsp;FinCEN.</p><p>Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the Sovrin CIFWG? What’s your mission and who are your group&nbsp;members?</p><p>The purpose of the Sovrin CIFWG is to advance the mission of financial inclusion globally, by addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by innovations in the financial services and payments landscape, and the attendant financial and regulatory compliance implications. We are an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts who monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and under-served. CIFWG focuses on how economic and regulatory technologies can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and associated risks injected by innovation. We have developed and been actively promoting the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and virtual asset service providers (VASP) processes.</p><p>Q: What do you mean by global financial inclusion, and why is it important?</p><p>Global financial inclusion remains a desirable and necessary development goal — 1.7 billion adults lack a bank account[1], and millions more have limited or no access to traditional financial services around the world. Furthermore, “de-risking” — the efforts of financial institutions to terminate or restrict relationships of certain clients and customers — has continued to be amplified by the continued growth of global anti-money laundry (AML) / counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls[2]. The result is a disproportionate impact for the financially under-served, the global poor, and institutions and sectors that provide services to these segments of the economy. The attendant consequences of financial exclusion cannot be overstated given that remittances from migrant workers alone total over $500 billion a year (three to four times foreign aid) and is a vital source of finance for poor countries.</p><p>Q: What is the NPRM regarding “Requirements for banks and money services businesses” proposed by FinCEN&nbsp;about?</p><p>The December NPRM proposed to address the threat of illicit finance with respect to certain transactions involving CVC or LTDA by (a) establishing new reporting requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions analogous to existing currency transaction reports, and (b) establishing new record keeping requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions that is similar to the record keeping and travel rule regulations pertaining to funds transfers and transmittal of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>On January 1, 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (Division F of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283?link-type=html">Pub. L. 116–283</a>) (“AML Act of 2020”) became law. FinCEN proposed that by regulation, CVC and LTDA are monetary instruments because they are “similar material” to “coins and currency of a foreign country, travelers checks, bearer negotiable instruments, bearer investment securities, bearer securities, [and] stock on which title is passed on delivery[3].”</p><p>Q: What do you think about the NPRM? How does it impact the fintech sector and its key stakeholders?</p><p>We believe combating illicit finance activities is necessary and a top priority for FinCEN. But efforts to serve both law enforcement equities and financial inclusion do not present a binary choice. An effective anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime should also prioritize increased engagement of financially underserved, de-risked and/or excluded parties to foster a financial system that provides enhanced participation, greater transparency, and innovation in domestic financial systems.</p><p>Further, the data on illicit finance risks in the CVC sector don’t necessarily support the need for the proposed rule changes which are motivated to strengthen law enforcement and regulatory oversight efforts. According to a recently released report by Chainalysis, illicit activities or crime related to virtual assets has continued to decline, with the illicit share of cryptocurrency activity falling to just 0.34% in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Importantly within the data analyzed by Chainalysis, the concentration of illicit activities has shown to be primarily with a “small group of shady cryptocurrency services, mostly operating on top of large exchanges, [who] conduct most of the money laundering that cybercriminals rely on to make cryptocurrency-based crime profitable[4].” This data would seem to call for more targeted efforts by law enforcement to concentrate investigations of criminals by identifying owners of these deposit addresses and the organizations that are conducting deliberate money laundering operations at scale (among otherwise legitimate activities).</p><p>As such, we are concerned with the proposed rules as they impact a growing sector that is increasingly providing solutions to marginalized and financially excluded constituencies. Also, organizations operating in CVCs, including fintech companies, virtual asset services providers (VASPs), and other similar organizations may fall under the broader definition of nonbank financial institutions or money services businesses/money transfer operators (MSBs/MTOs) that already face enormous scrutiny by mainstream financial institutions when evaluating their respective risks related to onboarding into new accounts. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) itself has acknowledged the fact of de-risking disproportionately impacting certain sectors like MSBs/MTOs[5].</p><p>Q: What is the role of the CVC services in regards to global financial inclusion, and how secure are&nbsp;they?</p><p>As CVC services continue to evolve and grow, so do the applications and opportunities inherent in facilitating greater inclusion of underserved and marginalized communities and organizations into the global financial ecosystems. As such, self-hosted wallets are playing an increasingly important role with virtual assets, as global financial operations continue to be unbundled, and an ongoing trend toward de-centralized financial services continues unabated[6].</p><p>Self-hosted wallets enable anyone with an internet connection to transact with others in digital assets on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis. Additionally, these wallets can be used to store value or digital assets securely and provide capability for the user/consumer to hold resources personally that enable them to interact in the fiat and digital financial context. This enables consumers to transact with counterparties directly without the need for a third-party intermediary–similar to making a cash transaction for a purchase of a good, pay an expense, or transfer value to a friend or family&nbsp;member.</p><p>When combined with blockchain technology, P2P transactions are arguably more secure and more transparent than activities undertaken in cash, as the convenience of cash and the efficiencies that come with electronic payments are combined with the risk controls associated with pseudonymous transactions that are not otherwise dependent on a specific financial intermediary[7].</p><p>Q: In sum, what are your recommendations to FinCEN regarding the&nbsp;NPRM?</p><p>We really appreciated the opportunity to comment on the NPRM. We believe that any proposed rule should explicitly include a thorough assessment of the threats to financial inclusion that may come about with such a proposal, and the Agencies should consider the concerns outlined in the response in our letter as part of such an assessment.</p><p>Secondly, increased targeted enforcement and requirements for transaction monitoring would strengthen law enforcement regulatory intentions with the proposed rules vs a more wholesale application of record keeping and reporting for related to all noncustodial wallet holders and their activities. In short, a smaller group of actors are engaged in such activity, and enforcement and regulatory measures should be better targeted to them vs the industry as a whole — especially in light of the financial exclusion implications of such proposed&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Strengthening financial inclusion, including by encouraging innovation in the financial services arena with technology applications that extend beyond existing banking and payments systems can actually provide enhanced security, risk and compliance controls, while bringing greater opportunities to marginalized and otherwise financially underserved or excluded communities. The underlying technologies include:</p>  The facilitation of cross-border remittances via P2P and blockchain networks that provide efficiency, cost advantages and security;  The enhanced auditability and traceability of transactions conducted via these applications that better enable financial services regulators and law enforcement interests; and  The application of digital and sovereign identity management capabilities that strengthen know-your-customers processes and customer information programs while preserving the essential privacy protections inherent in financial services.  <p>We welcome follow up with Agencies and participating members that are interested in providing guidance, examples and use cases of inclusion efforts — including the application of self-hosted/un-hosted wallets in particular.</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;Amit!</p><p>Anyone can download the full letter <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvQOHN9LeyoLAZFMgpYENLUXhYZaWClK/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<p>By: FIDO Alliance staff</p>



<p>A major milestone has been realized, with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI-Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) becoming the first organization to the achieve the Certified Authenticator Level 3+ level, which is the highest level of validation currently offered by the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The path toward the Level 3+ designation has been several years in the making.</p>



<p>Dr. Rae Rivera, Certification Director for the FIDO Alliance explained that the Certified Authenticator program was originally launched in August 2018 in a bid to define greater levels of assurance for FIDO authenticators. She noted that the FIDO Specifications include an inherent amount of security and privacy. The goal with the Certified Authenticator program is to provide additional security assurances for the authenticators themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the first Certified Authenticator Level 3+ designation now granted, Rivera expects other organizations will follow, helping to improve strong authentication for users and organizations around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re continuing to see more pickup and uptake in the Certified Authenticator program,” Rivera said. “At each higher level, there’s less risk of a vulnerability.”</p>



<p>Understanding the Different Certified Authenticator Levels</p>



<p>There are three core levels (L1, L2, L3 and ) in the Certified Authenticator program with each level building on the requirements of the preceding level. Incremental additional assurance can be obtained to allow a vendor to achieve a “+” within each level (L1+, L2+, L3+).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program evaluates authenticators to answer the question ‘how well does the authenticator protect the private key?The most basic entry level is L1 which Rivera said a vendor can achieve by supporting and implementing the FIDO specifications. An authenticator certified at L1 provides protection against phishing and credential abuse.</p>



<p>Moving up to L2, Rivera noted that restricted operating environments are required to protect against malware attacks. When you get to L3 and L3+, Rivera said that it’s all about looking at hardware authenticators, and how they provide protection against brute force attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the core attributes of our higher level programs, specifically level three and three plus, is that they require the product to have what we call a companion program certification,” Rivera said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She noted that the companion program certification that has been defined for those higher levels is <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/">Common Criteria</a> &nbsp;which provides sets of evaluations and designations to help define the security posture for a given device or service.</p>



<p>“The higher level that you go, the less vulnerable the authenticator is to any kind of attack,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Why the Level 3+ Certification is Significant</p>



<p>With BSI now certified at L3+ the door is open to others to follow the same path toward the highest level of security assurance.</p>



<p>“Personally I feel like this is a huge leap forward for the program,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Rivera noted that to date there have been many products that have been certified at the lower levels of the Certified Authenticator program. Now that the first L3+ has been achieved she anticipates that there will be more interest from organizations to go through the program to gain that additional higher level of assurance.</p>



<p>“This certification clearly demonstrates the value of our certified authenticator program – particularly at the higher levels,” she said. “Government and regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, energy and education often have more sensitive use cases that require specific types of authentication into their networks. Vendors and relying parties in these markets see this as a benefit because it meets the need for hardware protection and is also Common Criteria certified.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How Others Can Benefit from the First Level 3+ Certification</p>



<p>Now that BSI has hit the Level 3+ certification, there is now quite literally a path for others to follow.</p>



<p>Rivera explained that with the L3+ certification there is a protection profile associated with it. The protection profile contains all the components that are used to achieve the L3+. As such, another vendor could utilize the protection profile to develop their product to get certified at the higher level.</p>



<p>“The protection profile serves as good guidance for those that are seeking the higher levels as to what they need to do and what modifications they need to make to their implementation,” Rivera said. “BSI getting certified at Level 3+ has made it a little easier for others to start achieving this level.”</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation held three interop events for implementations of the OpenID Connect Federation specification during 2020.  The learnings from each were used to iteratively refine the specification after each round, just as we did when developing OpenID Connect itself.  The current specification is the result of the iterative rounds of improvement, informed by the experiences of multiple implementations.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/RolandHedberg">Roland Hedberg</a> for organizing these useful interop events and to all those who brought their code to test with one another.</p>

<p>First public reviews for 3 extensions to popular messaging standard Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) are open through April 29th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) TC are pleased to announce that three new AMQP specifications are now available for public review and comment:</p>



  Event Stream Extensions for AMQP Version 1.0  AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0  AMQP Claims-based Security Version 1.0  



<p>The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations. It connects systems, feeds business processes with the information they need and reliably transmits onward the instructions that achieve their goals.</p>



<p>Event Stream Extensions for AMQP Version 1.0 defines a set of AMQP extensions for interaction with event stream engines, including annotations for partition selection and filter definitions for indicating offsets into an extension stream to which a link is attached.</p>



<p>AMQP Filter Expressions Version 1.0 describes a syntax for expressions consisting of property selectors, functions, and operators that can be used for conditional transfer operations and for configuring a messaging infrastructure to conditionally distribute, route, or retain messages.</p>



<p>AMQP Claims-based Security Version 1.0 describes an AMQP authorization mechanism based on claims-based security tokens.</p>

 <a href="https://www.neatebox.com/">Neatebox</a>, a Scottish pioneer of “Social Tech”, has been awarded the Inclusion and Empowerment Award by WSA 2020 and is announced as the only UK business within the <a href="https://wsa-global.org/2020/12/17/wsa-winners-2020/">WSA Global Top 40.</a> 
<p>The <a href="https://wsa-global.org/">World Summit Awards</a> select and promote digital solutions that address global issues and improve society. Backed by the UN, the final jury of 43 internationally recognised experts selected 40 solutions from 26 countries. The winning organisations are diverse, and united by their impactful solutions for local communities, their technical finesse and strength in&nbsp; design.</p>
<p>This prestigious win for Scotland and the UK is important because it further cements their position as global digital front-runners and central to the digital accessibility conversation. It highlights the need for businesses to be responsive to their customers needs, safety and comfort in the continuing public-health crisis. It helps us understand that safe, affordable solutions are available to ensure we are more disability aware.</p>
<p>Neatebox’s Founder and CEO, Gavin Neate, comments “to be recognised at any time is fantastic but to represent your country by winning a World Summit Award for Inclusion and Empowerment at a time when disabled people are under such dreadful strain due to the effects of COVID19 is truly inspiring for us all.&nbsp; We very much hope that this award will raise awareness of what is possible and lead to us to work with those countries and businesses who see the provision of services for disabled and vulnerable people as a reflection of their international stranding in the world.”</p>

<p>The long-awaited vision of the Cosmos blockchain has now been realized, as holders of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/cosmos">ATOM&nbsp;(+4.83%)</a>&nbsp;token have voted through<a href="https://ibcprotocol.org/">&nbsp;inter-blockchain communication</a>&nbsp;(IBC), enabling assets to transfer easily between blockchains.</p>
 
 
<p>The<a href="https://cosmos.bigdipper.live/proposals/41">&nbsp;final vote</a>&nbsp;to enable the feature was 112 million to 75, overwhelmingly in support of activation.</p>
 
 
<p>In the simplest terms, IBC enables messages to travel between blockchains that have implemented the standard. The most obvious use case in crypto is sending messages to transfer tokens off one chain and onto another.</p>
 
<p>“At its core, IBC is a method of securely exchanging data between two independent (sovereign) blockchains. This means that any two blockchains that support IBC can send communication back and forth in a permissionless manner,” Zarko Milosevic, chief scientist at the blockchain consultancy Informal Systems, told CoinDesk by email.</p>
 
 
<p>This development has the potential to open up opportunities in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-defi">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a>&nbsp;sector, where a product on an application-specific blockchain could use an asset from a completely different chain.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, ATOM is the governance token for Cosmos, the blockchain built to enable IBC. “Previously, ATOM was relegated to the Cosmos Hub with regard to its utility as a governance token. It is now transferable and interoperable with all blockchains that support IBC,” Milosevic said.</p>

<p>One place ATOM may go: the Terra blockchain, which runs<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/anchor-launch-ust-stablecoin-dai-defi">&nbsp;a DeFi savings account</a>&nbsp;called Anchor. Terra could plug in to IBC and make ATOM one of the tokens its underlying money market will loan.</p>
 
 
<p>IBC was built into the Stargate upgrade enabled by the Cosmos ecosystem<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cosmos-upgrades-to-stargate-another-2017-ico-very-nearly-completes-its-vision">&nbsp;in February</a>. ATOM holders, however, opted to let Stargate run a bit longer and do further testing before enabling IBC. The vote put IBC into effect on Cosmos.</p>
 
 
<p>There was no delay between the vote and the feature going live. “Since it is a parameter change, it does not require for the chain to be halted,” Milosevic explained.</p>
 
 
<p>The activation of IBC is not enough for all blockchains to work in conjunction with each other, though. IBC is a protocol that other blockchains can use, but they must upgrade to the IBC standard.</p>
 
 
<p>That is theoretically possible for<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/one-network-many-chains-the-case-for-blockchain-interoperability">&nbsp;any blockchain to do</a>, but those built on Tendermint, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency.asp">consensus model</a>&nbsp;native to the Cosmos ecosystem, are likely to be the first to adopt the standard. Some of the blockchains that are built on Tendermint include<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/kava-halted-yield-farming-bug">&nbsp;Kava</a>, Agoric, Akash,<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/foam-turns-to-token-grants-to-build-out-decentralized-mapping-platform">&nbsp;Foam</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-com-to-burn-70b-cro-tokens-ahead-of-full-blockchain-launch-next-month">&nbsp;Crypto.com</a>.</p>

<p>The FAPI Working Group published a <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> as a resource for those new to FAPI and implementing FAPI. This FAQ will evolve over time as the Foundation engages with new members like the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission as well as colleagues in the US, Australia, Brazil and other jurisdictions on their open banking initiatives which were <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/16/standards-adoption-and-the-adoption-of-standards-financial-grade-api-fapi-1-0-final-specifications-published/">recently highlighted in an OIDF blog</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the OpenID Foundation achieved a major milestone in <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">publishing the Financial-grade API (FAPI) Parts 1.0 and 2.0 final specifications</a>. This is a true accomplishment for open banking initiatives worldwide.</p>
<p>Many organizations and jurisdictions have utilized the FAPI Implementers Draft 2 as the starting point of their adoption of FAPI in defining their open banking solution stacks. To assist these organizations and jurisdictions in transitioning from the FAPI RW Implementers Draft 2 to the FAPI 1.0 Advanced Final specification, Joseph Heenan, led the OpenID certification work and&nbsp; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/FAPI_1.0/changes-between-id2-and-final.md">published a non-normative list of changes document</a>.</p>
<p>This document is a non-normative list of the changes between the second implementers draft of FAPI1 part 1 (read only / baseline) and part 2 (read-write / advanced) and the final versions:</p>
 
 Changes are listed as major if they may require alterations to implementations. 
 Changes are listed as minor if they are generally clarifications and are unlikely to require alterations to existing implementations that were already applying best current practice. 
 Most changes have both client and server clauses that reflect the same change to the protocol; such a change is only listed once below in the interests of brevity. 
 
<p>The progress and pace of standards development is a function of the contribution of human capital, especially domain expertise. The Foundation would like to thank member, Authlete, a consistent key contributor to the FAPI standards. Authlete’s contribution of Joseph Heenan’s time and talent that was key to the ongoing improvements in the evolution of the FAPI standard.</p>

<p>Chalk up a win for the good guys on data privacy.&nbsp; And California residents are the ultimate winners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in December, 2020, the Me2B Alliance submitted a <a href="https://me2ba.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ccpa-fourth-round-comments-letter.pdf">letter</a> to the Office of the Attorney General for the State of California. The letter was in response to proposed changes to the regulations adopted by the AG’s office to implement the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA). Our letter noted that the Alliance has a clear preference for privacy by default , which in this instance means that “opt in” (a consumer’s clearly stated preference to share her information and receive advertising) is a more respectful default standard than requiring consumers to “opt out.” Further, as our letter pointed out, “mandating opting-out of selling data is tantamount to a default setting allowing the selling of data.” Instead, people should be presented with a clear, affirmative statement to allow the selling of data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proposed section 999.315(f) of the California privacy regulations would have created a uniform button to signify the consumer’s ability to opt out of having her personal information sold online. Our letter observed that the problem with this approach is that the button is a generic checkmark icon. Research amply shows that these kinds of icons are less understandable as a user interface (UI) than a simple “do not sell my data” text statement.&nbsp; We also pointed out other infirmities with the icon approach, which the new regulations would have mandated for all businesses in California.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 15th, the AG’s Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved additional CCPA regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice. Notably, the Department withdrew its original language mandating the “Privacy Options” icon. In its place is new language making commercial use of the icons optional only.&nbsp; In other words, our stated concerns about the icons were well received, and ultimately adopted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wish to thank the Department of Justice for considering and acting upon our concerns.&nbsp; We believe millions of residents of California will be better served by online privacy notices that more clearly communicate their rights to control access to their personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Newark, NJ, March 30, 2021 – Edge, the region’s nonprofit research and education network and technology partner, has announced a partnership with Proctorio, a leader in the remote proctoring industry. Via its EdgeMarket Cooperative Pricing System, Edge has awarded a contract which will give its members the ability to efficiently and affordably engage with Proctorio’s solutions and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proctorio’s proprietary software will enable Edge member organizations to more efficiently protect exams administered and degrees earned in an online setting. The solution integrates seamlessly with commonly-used Learning Management Systems (LMS), including D2L Brightspace, Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle, and more, delivering a highly-configurable and scalable platform for protecting exams in alignment with member institutions’ overall educational and instructional technology strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution provided by Proctorio also places a premium on the privacy of students. It is the first and only proctoring solution to use Zero-Knowledge Encryption, which means that only institutions can access the exam recordings collected and control who can access them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As education continues to move online, ensuring exam integrity is important,” said Joshua Gaul, Executive Director of EdgeLearn. “Solutions like Proctorio’s provide institutions with the tools they need to proactively protect exams, while also fitting into broader ed-tech strategy through integrations with leading LMS providers and the depth of customization provided. The ability to customize the proctoring experience to the needs of the course or even the individual exam provides faculty and instructional staff the freedom to leverage the technology to meet their specific needs.”</p>
<p>“Proctorio is excited to support Edge member organizations in better securing exams administered in any setting,” said Mike Olsen, Founder and CEO of Proctorio. “Through this strategic collaboration, we are protecting the credibility of degrees earned online and ensuring that the future workplace is shaped by employees who lead with integrity and fairness.”</p>
<p>Staffed by 100+ education experts, Proctorio was serving 2.5 million active weekly users and proctoring 250,000 exams per day by the end of 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5 Use Cases for an Immutable and Distributed Blockchain</p>
<p>Blockchain has two distinctive characteristics:</p>
<p>Immutability: written data cannot be changed<br>
Distribution: data is present in multiple locations</p>
<p>These two features enable an interesting set of new use cases</p>
<p>Immutability</p>
<p>Unlike a classic database, transactions and values in a blockchain cannot be overwritten and are secured by cryptographic systems that make it obvious if the data has been tampered with.</p>
<p>1 Currency platform: Cryptocurrency is definitely the most ‘visible’ element in a Blockchain, especially if it is public like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) are. Each currency transfer is immutable and the same token cannot be given to two different people at the same time (double spending).</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is an inexpensive unit of account for transactions and a system to boost the security of a Blockchain. It is sometimes represented by a Token, which is another form of an underlying asset Transaction platform: A Blockchain network can validate a series of transactions relating to the value of Cryptocurrency, documents or assets that have been digitised into a Token. (tokenized). Each time a consensus is reached, a transaction is immutably recorded on a ‘block’, which is a storage space.</p>
<p>2 Verification platform: The Blockchain keeps track of these transactions, which can then be verified as having taken place. The Blockchain is therefore this giant transaction verification platform that can handle both<br>
micro-transactions as well as high-value transactions.</p>
<p>Distribution</p>
<p>By increasing the number of server nodes, the ability of a hacker or hostile government to block the network decreases.</p>
<p>3 Distributed ledger: The Blockchain is also a distributed, public, time-stamped ledger that keeps track of every transaction processed on its network, allowing the user’s<br>
user’s computer to check its validity so that there can never be a double count. This record can be shared between multiple parties and can be private, public or semi-private.</p>
<p>4 Distributed Exchange: Cryptocurrency is the basis of the Blockchain. When Cryptocurrency is considered as any currency, it can become part of a financial instrument, leading to the development of a variety of new Fintech financial products: derivatives / options / swaps / synthetic instruments / investments / loans.<br>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>For many women, March symbolizes more than just a month of observance. It’s a time where women across all industries and geographies celebrate the achievements of their peers and colleagues today and take a critical look at the opportunities they’re creating for young women just entering the workforce. It’s also a chance for us to celebrate the historic achievements of the pioneering women that came before us. At Omidyar Network, we’re constantly working to create a culture and world where all women have equitable access to the systems and powers that govern our daily&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Like many, I was inspired to do this work by the first woman in my life — my mother. My commitment to social justice was developed while watching her work as a special education teacher for more than 30 years. As an educator, she worked passionately to support and empower students who were often marginalized because of their race, class, or learning abilities. As an active member of her union, she understood why it was critical for people to have power and voice in the workplace. She taught me the importance of being engaged in my community and how to live my values and support my community through politics — one of my first memories is stuffing envelopes for our neighbor who was running for the Montgomery County Council and reading her NOW newsletter.</p><p>After her sudden death in 2000, I’ve always wondered what she would think of some of the unfortunate events the country has endured over the years. Part of me is relieved that she did not have to witness the horrors of 9/11, the recession, and the pandemic. On the other hand, I think she would have been amazed to see the remarkable women who have trailblazed their way through the world by challenging the status quo, reimaging what’s possible, and ensuring equality for the leaders of the future. My mom, along with other women before me, would have beamed with pride to bear witness to the accomplishments of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and most recently, Vice President Kamala&nbsp;Harris.</p><p>I am constantly awed and inspired by the incredible women grantees we work with at Omidyar Network who are shaping a new inclusive economy, ensuring a responsible tech ecosystem, and positively impacting our society. We have the honor to work with a powerhouse team of women leaders such&nbsp;as:</p>  Ifeoma Ozoma with Earthseed who’s taking on the role of Big Tech as a brave whistleblower at Pinterest, holding the company to account for racial bias and inequality;  Lisa Donner from <a href="https://ourfinancialsecurity.org">Americans for Financial Reform</a> who’s working to reimagine our economic system by way of representation and ensuring equality; and  Solana Rice from <a href="https://www.liberationinageneration.org">Liberation in a Generation</a> who’s providing equitable access to communities for meaningful social&nbsp;change.  <p>Click <a href="https://twitter.com/OmidyarNetwork">here</a> for a look at how we’ve highlighted our grantees for our Women’s History Month campaign!</p><p>I feel an obligation and a great sense of joy to carry out the legacy built by these women, my mother, and many others, through the work Omidyar Network does every day. We’re committed to showing up for each other and addressing all instances of biases and inequality. I see so much of what my mother believed in and stood for in Omidyar Network’s mission and through our phenomenal team of women grantees, including:</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/legacy-community-and-equity-reflecting-on-womens-history-month-9ac5c5edff80">Legacy, Community, and Equity: Reflecting on Women’s History Month</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Drilling down: Co-development <p>Competitors working together in the&nbsp;open</p><p>Having gone over the subtleties and complexities of <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c61c55cdec30169ea99471b9bd09e81b">open-source software</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495?source=friends_link&amp;sk=971c11824b0023758c34114cffc6c339">open standards</a> in general, we will now drill down into how exactly DIF advances both, in the form of a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) document. Topics covered&nbsp;include:</p>  What “standardization” means to DIF and what DIF means to standardization.  A newbie-friendly survey of how DIF relates to nearby organizations with overlapping or related&nbsp;foci.  What “co-development” and “coöpetition” really mean, concretely  <p>The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>We can start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations. Click on the image below to download a clickable PDF&nbsp;file.</p><a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/ssi-architectural-stack--and--community-efforts-overview.pdf"></a>Src: E.D. Rouven Heck 2019, updated by Interoperability Working Group,&nbsp;2020 What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization.</p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through&nbsp;OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening.</p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation.</p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working&nbsp;groups.</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”.</p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.”</p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the&nbsp;group.</blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development — patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to&nbsp;market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or&nbsp;not.</p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further&nbsp;down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape! In our next piece, we’ll sketch out how you can get strategic about open source, roll up your sleeves, and get your hands dirty at&nbsp;DIF.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-co-development-in-the-open-765a86ab153f">Drilling Down: [Co-]Development in the Open</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Berkman Klein Center event explores how technology factors into pandemic&nbsp;response Kendra Albert, Tanya Cooper, Roslyn Satchel, and Thema Bryant-Davis during a Berkman Klein Center event on “Marginalized Women, Technology, COVID-19, and Intimate Partner Violence.” Screenshot by Lydia Rosenberg.<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has upended myriad aspects of everyday life, from education to the economy to interpersonal relationships. For victims and survivors of intimate partner violence, the many struggles of escaping or finding support are particularly exacerbated by the pandemic. An <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">event</a> hosted by the Berkman Klein Center explored how technology factors into this problem — how it can help, and how it can&nbsp;harm.</p><p>Moderated by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/roslyn-satchel">Roslyn Satchel</a>, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center and the Blanche Seaver Professor of Communication at Pepperdine, the event convened an interdisciplinary group of scholars to discuss various issues surrounding intimate partner violence, particularly for marginalized women, during the pandemic. The discussion covered fostering safe spaces online, access to resources, and navigating the legal system during the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://gsep.pepperdine.edu/about/our-people/faculty/thema-bryant-davis/">Thema Bryant-Davis</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Pepperdine University, and director of the Culture and Trauma Research Lab, spoke about coping with trauma and supporting victims and survivors.</p><p>“The reality is that COVID-19 has also increased the risk of intimate partner violence when we see the large number of people who are practicing physical distancing and social distancing. There has been less of a buffer, less of an opportunity to come outside of the home and to seek services. And so we are mindful of the urgency of this work, as well as the additional barriers that make help-seeking difficult,” Bryant-Davis said.</p><p>“Part of what we are mindful of in the midst of COVID is the need for technology to be utilized in order to reach survivors and in order to protect survivors and help us to heal and restore,” Bryant-Davis said. “Many clinicians like me are currently practicing telehealth solely, so working with people in their healing journey by phone and by Internet which has benefits and challenges.” She pointed to easier access to resources not requiring travel, but also the dangers of sharing spaces with&nbsp;abusers.</p><p><a href="https://law.pepperdine.edu/faculty-research/tanya-asim-cooper/">Tanya Asim Cooper</a>, associate clinical professor of law and director of the Restoration and Justice Clinic, shared her experience working with victims of intimate partner victims from a legal perspective and illustrated her work through a case&nbsp;study.</p><p>“Studies show racial disparities in domestic violence for victims of color, predominantly women and they are in the greatest danger,” she said. “From my experience and based on my research, victims of color generally are perceived as less credible victims, suffer more serious violence, and require more concrete evidence of abuse, especially physical violence. They need photographs, they need not just medical records, they need medical professional live testimony.”</p><p>These demands are hard for people to meet — especially during the pandemic, with courts closing and forcing victims to wait. Cooper described how her clinic transferred their work online, but how she worries about people lacking technological skills or access to the internet.</p><p>“If law enforcement and courts can’t or won’t assist, especially during the pandemic, let’s equip faith communities and other online communities where marginalized women go, and let’s equip them to help,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Several event participants mentioned the idea of fostering online communities and safe digital spaces during the event. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Kendra Albert</a>, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, prompted the panel to question some of the values embedded in technologies and online tools and how those can be challenged in the intimate partner violence&nbsp;context.</p><p>As examples, Albert cited how phone companies may provide data about recently contacted phone numbers because “insiders are assumed to be safe.” Albert also pointed to Facebook’s “People You May Know” feature as a tool that has been shown to suggest mutual friends but that may expose degrees of connection that should remain private, such as therapist relationships “It’s just one example of these technologies that are often built on the assumption that more connection is better, that Facebook wants to connect to all of us or thinking about sharing as a net good, while not considering the very real reasons that people’s sharing or engagement with these platforms might be deeply contextual and they may have concerns about this information getting shared more broadly,” Albert&nbsp;said.</p><p>Although these contexts and situations are often not considered when developing such technology or their values, marginalized people are able to adapt the technologies to their circumstances, circumventing the intended uses and norms, Albert&nbsp;added.</p><p>“The reality is marginalized folks have been using, thriving, and changing technologies that were built without them in mind forever, for as long as we’ve had technologies,” they said. “And that we can think of examples of marginalized folks innovating and actually driving these technologies forward as the things that create change and in some cases, create money for these platforms. So I think while still keeping in mind that domestic violence victims and survivors, especially domestic violence victims and survivors that are women of color, Black and brown women could be much better served by these platforms and that their needs for contextual controls and control over one’s information.”</p><p>Towards the end of the conversation, Satchel drew connections between the speakers; she highlighted the theme of safety and security and acknowledged that the event is continuing an important conversation about centering the experiences of marginalized people and the value of cross-disciplinary discourse.</p><p>“This question of safety and security is really animating the very core of this discussion. And as a communication ethicist, as a person who actually studies communication in a variety of contexts, I really value interdisciplinarity. Why? Because it allows for conversations like this to happen,” she said. “The beauty is that we’re coming back to a common core, marginalized women. Women who are marginalized by race, socioeconomic status, ability, gender, sexual orientation, language, ethnicity, immigration status, and many more caste markers have very unique experiences, unique experiences that may very well cause them to call for different solutions and different options for justice.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">here</a>.

<p>Recognition of the value of FIDO in European digital identity systems and eIDAS continues to grow.&nbsp; This month has featured two new updates in Europe on the FIDO front: the release of a landmark ENISA report that discusses the role FIDO2 plays in eIDAS, and the accreditation by the Czech government of a new eID solution using FIDO2.</p>



<p>In March 2021, the EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) issued the report <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-report-remote-id-proofing">Remote ID Proofing</a>, which describes the current regulatory landscape and supporting standards for the European countries’ remote identity proofing laws, regulations and practices. ENISA’s report is based on the ETSI TR 119 460 and ETSI TS 119 461 documents, which describe the policies and practices for remote identity proofing among trust service providers in the EU. Especially the eIDAS regulation, the AMLD5 directive to prevent money laundering, and EU directives on issuing ID-cards and exchanging identity information have been taken into account from a legal perspective.</p>



<p>Several methods for remote identification are proposed in the ENISA report: video recorded sessions, identification based on eID schemes or electronic signatures, bank identification, scanning of existing ID-cards, or a combination of several methods. In particular the option to identify a user with an eID scheme is of interest from a FIDO perspective. The following statement is written in section “2.2.4 Electronic identification means” of the ENISA report:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A protocol used by several electronic identity means providers is OpenID connect. It is an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0 and is specified by the OpenID foundation. This protocol allows to verify the identity of the applicant based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, and by obtaining basic information about the applicant. Another technology that can be used in eID solutions is FIDO2. The FIDO Alliance explains in a <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FIDO_Using-FIDO-with-eIDAS-Services-White-Paper.pdf">whitepaper</a> how FIDO2 can be used for eID means corresponding to eIDAS article 8.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In the very same month, the Czech ministry of interior <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/e-podpis-povinne-zverejnovane-informace-oznameni-o-udeleni-akreditace-pro-spravu-kvalifikovaneho-systemu-elektronicke-identifikace-poskytovatel-cz-nic-z-s-p-o.aspx">issued eIDAS accreditation</a> for the Czech domain registry CZ.NIC, meaning that their identity provider mojeID can deploy FIDO2 as an eID scheme at eIDAS level of assurance High under the following conditions:</p>



  The FIDO2 authenticator is FIDO certified at Level 2 (or higher)  The FIDO2 authenticator is based on a secure element that is certified at FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or Common Criteria EAL4 + AVA_VAN.5  The FIDO2 authenticator has a PIN set and the PIN is required for all transactions at level of assurance High  Username and password are used in conjunction with FIDO2  



<p>Both ENISA’s report on remote identity proofing and the official approval of CZ.NIC’s FIDO-based eID scheme are great examples of how FIDO has been recognized as a viable authentication protocol for eIDAS compliant eID schemes in the EU.</p>

<p></p><p>Having gone over the subtleties and complexities of <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c61c55cdec30169ea99471b9bd09e81b">open-source software</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495?source=friends_link&amp;sk=971c11824b0023758c34114cffc6c339">open standards</a> in general, we will now drill down into how exactly DIF advances both, in the form of a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) document. In this FAQ, we'll cover what co-development means in general, at DIF, beyond DIF, and in legal terms. The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>Let's start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations. &nbsp;Click on the image below to download a clickable PDF file.</p> What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these &nbsp;technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. &nbsp;On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the sector. </p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization. </p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening. </p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. &nbsp;It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation. </p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. &nbsp;The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. &nbsp;The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working groups. &nbsp;</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. &nbsp;DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). &nbsp;The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”. <br></p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.” </p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the group. </blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. &nbsp;These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development -- patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. &nbsp;In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or not. </p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape!

<p>By: FIDO Alliance Staff</p>



<p>What’s the role of FIDO authentication in financial services and what can be done to help consumers and issuers be more secure? Those topics were at the foundation of the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Modern Authentication for Financial Services, hosted by the FIDO Alliance on March 25.</p>



<p>The financial services focused event included speakers from eBay, Financial Data Exchange, Gemini, Google, Javelin Strategy and Research, Mastercard, JP Morgan Chase, StrongKey, Trusona and Visa, with topics spanning from the future of authentication to best practices on how to optimize the authentication experience for users.</p>



<p>In his opening keynote, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance noted that over the course of the pandemic there has been an increase in cyberattacks against financial services institutions, which has only heightened the need for stronger authentication methods.</p>



<p>“At the end of the day, the vast majority of statistics and the vast majority of these problems come down to fundamental truth, which is that we’re trying to run a hyper connected economy, a networked society, on a authentication model that simply is not fit for purpose and that of course is our dependence on passwords,” Shikiar said.</p>



  



<p>Shikiar detailed how the FIDO Alliance is working to help move the world away from passwords and help users benefit from stronger forms of authentication. In particular, FIDO is playing a key role in the financial services market across a number of categories. FIDO specifications are being used today by financial services firms to help protect online accounts against account takeovers and phishing attacks. A key goal is to also make it easier for organizations to use strong authentication. Shikiar emphasized that the FIDO Alliance’s tagline is: simpler, stronger authentication.</p>



<p>“If there’s one thing the industry has seen is that the more complex the approach is for MFA [Multi-Factor Authentication] , the less likely someone is to stick with it,” Shikiar said. “So for people to keep using strong authentication, it needs to be easy and single gesture, which is the core of FIDO’s approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Improving Authentication with FIDO at Visa</p>



<p>Visa is one of the world’s largest credit card brands and financial services firms on the planet and it sees FIDO as being a strong tool for helping to improve security and reduce fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a keynote presentation, David Henstock, Head of Identity and Authentication Products at Visa, observed that FIDO specifications have a significant role to play in helping to drive better outcomes within the payments industry. Henstock noted that what has increasingly occurred in recent years is that fraudsters are targeting the authentication layer.</p>



  



<p>“The question that always comes up is what can Visa do to help fight account takeover fraud?” Henstock stated. “The culprit more often than not is knowledge based authentication, or simply put&nbsp; – passwords.”</p>



<p>Henstock noted that FIDO is an easy way to upgrade from usernames and passwords to a more secure standard upgrading the authentication experience that sellers have. He added that overall FIDO helps to provide a better, more easy to use customer experience for authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO is also important to help with regulatory compliance. In Europe, the PSD2 [Payment Services Directive version 2] is a key driver for strong authentication adoption as it mandates the use of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).</p>



<p>“If you’re doing digital commerce in Europe, you must abide by the SCA regulations,” Henstock said.</p>



<p>In a bid to help organizations with FIDO deployment, Arshad Noor, CTO at StrongKey used his Authenticate session to detail new capabilities in the StrongKey FIDO server that can help organizations meet the challenges of global requirements.</p>



<p>“We see a lot of confusion in the WebAuthn and FIDO ecosystem where people are confused between security capability, and the user experience that consumers go through when interacting with FIDO,” Noor said. “We believe that FIDO should first be viewed as a security technology, and second as a convenience technology.”</p>



<p>Consumer Confidence in Passwords is Declining</p>



<p>The need to move away from passwords isn’t just about regulation, it’s also about consumer confidence in the security of password based authentication.</p>



<p>In a session, Javelin Strategy &amp; Research analysts Rachel Huber and John Buzzard outlined the state of the market in terms of fraud and online security.</p>



  



<p>“We have discovered trend wise that consumer confidence with passwords is down substantially and I want to say -finally,” Buzzard stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Buzzard noted that consumers have begun to realize that stronger authentication methods including biometrics are effective ways to validate identity. He added that consumers are now indicating that they are ready to move away from passwords.</p>



<p>“Whether the password disappears, maybe it becomes sort of like the Mayor McCheese of the city in the sense that it’s there but it doesn’t mean anything if that’s what it requires,” Buzzard said. “That’s still okay because we’re ready to move forward with stronger forms of authentication.”</p>



<p>Payments and the Future of Authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO standards are at the core of security efforts at eBay, which helps the online marketplace meet the needs of its diverse user base. In a panel on Payments and the Future of Authentication Ashish Jain, Product Management Executive, Identity, Mobility &amp; Analytics, eBay explained that a key challenge for his platform is having the right experience that can fit the needs and requirements of a broad customer base.</p>



  



<p>“When we started investigating FIDO and saw that it was supported by Google, Microsoft, and Apple, it gave us the confidence that it can meet the needs for a variety of our customers and hence, we continue to investigate and invest in the protocol,” Jain said.</p>



<p>For Christiaan Brand, Product Manager for Identity &amp; Security at Google, FIDO adoption started out as a way to help curb phishing risks and has evolved to become a way to help improve multiple aspects of security for both Google and its users.</p>



<p>“FIDO is one of those few security inventions, which aims to both address security and improve on that axis, while at the same time also improving on the usability front,” Brand said. “The FIDO components that have been built into the platforms nowadays do give our users, better and more secure experiences.”</p>



<p>For Ranjita Iyer, SVP, Identity Solutions at Mastercard, FIDO specifications are being combined with other standards including the<a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/"> EMV 3D Secure</a> effort to enable a seamless authentication and payment experience that can lead to better approval rates for digital transactions and lower fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Integrating FIDO with other standards is also something that the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) is implementing with its stack. Don Cardinal, Managing Director, Financial Data Exchange explained in a session that his organization is dedicated to unifying the financial service industry around an interoperable royalty free standard for secure permission to access data.</p>



  



<p>“The whole idea is to stop sharing user IDs and passwords and stop using them in the entire session,” Cardinal said. “Ideally, if you have OIDC [<a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>] and FIDO throughout FDX you can enroll, use and consume the whole setup and never use a credential, which I think is really powerful in today’s day and age.”</p>



<p>Optimizing UX for Strong Authentication&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the technical details of FIDO specifications are critical to enabling strong authentication, optimizing the user experience is critical to adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the final panel of the day, Megan Shamas, Director of Marketing, FIDO Alliance noted that there is an effort that is currently underway to to test and improve the FIDO user experience. Guidance from that testing effort is set to be publicly available in late 2021.</p>



<p>Kerry Hebert, Design Director (CX/UI) at Visa emphasized that it’s likely that FIDO implementation hinges on user adoption and adoption is only going to happen if the user registers. She noted that for&nbsp; users to take the step of registering, they need to believe that there’s value in what it provides and in some way makes the consumer’s life a little bit better.</p>



  



<p>Kevin Goldman, Chief Experience Officer, Trusona strongly suggests that financial services firms not think about user experience as something that is bolted on to the end of the process. Rather he suggests that it’s an integrated part of the entire process of supporting and enabling FIDO standards.</p>



<p>Judy Clare, Vice President, Product Manager, Digital Identity and Authentication at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, suggested during the panel that from an experience perspective, FIDO engagement needs to be easily digestible for consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You really have to have that value proposition out there&nbsp; – what’s in it for me, and why should I be clicking through this and take an extra 30 seconds to sign up for it and then go on my way, because I am here to do something and this wasn’t it,” Clare stated. “So it’s really important to keep the user in mind.”</p>



<p>Next Up: More Authenticate Summits and Authenticate 2021 Conference</p>



<p>There’s much more content to come from the FIDO Alliance in 2021.</p>



<p>Looking forward there is another virtual event coming in June which will focus on strong authentication in Europe. Plans are also coming together for a physical Authenticate conference set for October in Seattle.</p>



<p>“In general, what we see is a lot of best practice sharing, everyone is in this together, and is motivated to help protect the networked economy and FIDO authentication presents a great way of doing so,” Shikiar said. “So we encourage you to certainly take part.”</p>

<p>Today, SecureAuth is an official member of the OpenID Foundation a non-profit international standardization organization committed to enabling, promoting and protecting OpenID technologies. As a distinguished member of the Foundation, SecureAuth also now has a voice in the elections for the governing body.</p>
<p>SecureAuth Innovation Labs is dedicated to actively supporting and participating in the Shared Signals and Events Working Group (SSE WG) of the OpenID Foundation. This includes research and development teams commitment to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. This protocol serves as the identity layer for human-based and machine-to-machine communications alike, which is built into SecureAuth’s Protect platform.</p>
<p>Always at the forefront of innovation, SecureAuth has been a long-time advocate and contributor of the OpenID Foundation prior to becoming an official member. As a trailblazer of the interoperability and extensions of authentication protocols that are integrated into every app to verify users, SecureAuth aligned with the latest standards for customers across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We welcome SecureAuth’s membership in the OpenID Foundation and look forward to their contributions to the SSE WG and their support for open standards in identity, access control and authentication”, said Don Thibeau of the OpenID Foundation. “The success of the Shared Signals Working Group is one of the great hidden successes. One objective is to define mechanisms to deliver system implementers with an approved standard for securely sending signals and receiving signals, access and avoid account takeover.”</p>
<p>The mission fits with SecureAuth’s core objective, which is to enable the continuous assessment of risk and trust, by leveraging signal and events in a way that security can be achieved without compromising the user experience and sharing of security events, state changes, and other signals between dependent systems.</p>
<p>SecureAuth’s participation in the SSE WG will aid in implementing two new standards: Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol (CAEP) and Risk &amp; Incident Sharing and Collaboration Initiative (RISC).</p>

<p></p>
 In this video Mathew Goetz, Garrick Hileman and John Biggs will talk about ‘Will the bitcoin be the currency of future?’ in Al Jazeera’s Inside Story episode. 
<p>Before summarizing the video, Let’s talk about what is Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin and what does it do?</p>
 What is Cryptocurrency? 
<p>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.</p>
<p>Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>
 What is Bitcoin? 
<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in January 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p>The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and, unlike government-issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to.</p>
 How does it work? 
<p>Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a ‘digital wallet’ app on a smartphone or computer. People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. It enables a new payment system and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.</p>
 Video Summary 
  
<p>Bitcoin is the world’s most famous and least understood currency. It has exploded in value seemingly for no reason in March, 2020. In March last year a single bitcoin was worth five thousand US dollar and in December it hit twenty thousand US dollars for the first time. Now it is forty thousand US dollars.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is the name given to any digital currency which allows people to skip middle man i.e. bank or money exchange facility it does that by a very complicated system called blockchain that’s unique to a few cryptocurrencies and is said to make them safer. Bitcoin is simply the first and also the best-known version of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Mathew Goetz is the founder and CEO of Block Tower Capital, former executive of Goldman Sachs and former systems engineer. He talks about cryptocurrency from an institutional perspective. He calls this market cycle of cryptocurrency as bull markets. According to him a trending bull market is where people are looking for good news and data to interpret and there are real buyers and real demand. He thinks that a single bitcoin may worth hundred thousand or even more in the next 12 or 18 months.</p>
<p>Garrick Hileman is the head of research at Blockchain.com, visiting fellow at London School of economics and a cryptocurrency economist. According to him, Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital alternative currency or asset they have ever seen grow to this size and monetary assets.</p>
<p>It is by nature are difficult to value their value based on supply and demand. A lot of people reference gold and bitcoin has earned the nickname digital gold. the size of the entire gold market is 10 trillion and bitcoin today is worth less than 1 trillion about 730 billion. Roughly at present many people think that bitcoin has more functionality in many ways than gold and has a tighter scarcity. Eventually it will actually surpass and eclipse gold’s total market value at some point. Currently Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency that is a type of decentralized online currency.</p>
<p>John Biggs is the editor in chief in Gizmodo and former editor at Coin desk. The people who have invested in 2010 or early on they are now making millions but it is pretty impossible for a person at the current hype cycle unless that person is insider. According to him it will not be wise to buy bitcoin now.</p>
<p>In contrast, Mathew Goetz says that the industry has been matured over time and bitcoin has been matured as a financial asset and now there are institutional demands. Mathew said the market infrastructure is based on real things while John said it is not. Some people now see bitcoins as a safe long-term investment despite its volatility. Some experts say that injection of stimulus has made it more attractive.</p>
<p>Garrick Hileman believes that cryptocurrency can be a hedge a defense against inflation when countries have governments around the world anticipating a recession may be tipping over into a 1922 style depression where they have to start printing more money to get it into the system because people around the world because of covid-19 are losing their jobs this quickly for a long time.</p>
<p>John Biggs says that cryptocurrency can not be used as a defense to fight inflation or depression because the governments are not investing more on cryptocurrency but they are investing very little that too inactively. On the contrary Mathew Goetz thinks that currently insurance companies, public companies are buying it and ultimate sovereigns and governments will buy and invest in it too.</p>
<p>If people leave their money in the dollar, they are going to lose half of it over the next five years with the rate of monetary expansion so when they have a hard asset like Garrick Hileman was mentioning like bitcoin that has finite supply that can’t be inflated away by a politician a central banker, they will tend to invest in it.</p>
<p>Big brands like PayPal are now allowing users to trade using cryptocurrency like bitcoin. People in poor countries with a little or no infrastructure can now still do banking and live in a cryptocurrency world. According to John Biggs in developing countries people can do banking in many other ways without using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Historically cryptocurrencies have been quite volatile so, people need to be aware of not only its volatility but also of complexity of using this technology.</p>

<p>If you’re a DIACC member and would like us to feature your spotlight,&nbsp;<a href="https://diacc.ca/contact-us/">contact</a>&nbsp;us today to learn more!</p>


 
 
 

 



 
<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>My journey has been far from a straight line. I have a BA in political science from the University of Alberta and a masters in African Studies from the University of Oxford. Since finishing my education, I’ve worked in multiple sectors and countries. I started in student journalism, shifted to the non-profit start-up space working on community development with a social justice lens and dabbled in academia for a bit. Eventually, I settled into public relations in Nigeria for 4+ years. Upon moving back to Canada, I spent time in customer experience strategy for a power utility before joining the Saskatchewan government, first as the director for digital citizen services and now for digital ID.</p>



<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>I’ve never quite had a dream job but I always knew I wanted to make a positive impact in people’s lives and somehow do my part in making the world a better place. That’s why I am so drawn to the public sector.</p>



<p><br></p>
 
 
 


<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>I’m extremely fortunate to say that I’ve had very few challenges on account of my gender identity. That said, I’ve grown up in professional environments where the gender balance is more prevalent. I have heard enough horrendous stories from other female leaders to know that my experience is not the norm. My barriers have more come from age, especially in my earlier years of leadership. As a young leader people consistently assumed I knew less and could do less. We often undervalue our youth as a society and this is something I consistently remind myself of as I work with the next generation of youth.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Work life balance is sacred to me, as is my respect for deadlines, and those two things can often come into conflict. My general rules for myself and my teams:</p>



  Work to outcomes. Be clear on your deliverables and get the job done. But in doing so, set boundaries and prioritize.  Ask for help in doing this if you need it. We only have 8 hours in a day and weekends and evenings should be exceptions, not the expectation.  Take your holidays! Payouts and carrying over should be exceptions not the norm.  


 
 
 
<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Tech doesn’t have to be intimidating (look at my background!) and tech also doesn’t have to mean being a developer. But I do believe that, love it or hate it, tech will continue to grow ever more central to our society. Dig into your passion and spend the time to understand how technology is impacting, shaping and changing that space. If the actual technical details aren’t for you, look to the concepts, outcomes, and impacts that technology has to offer and dig in there.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Lift people up. Lift people up. Lift people up.</p>



<p>This goes for all voices that need more prominence in our organizations, not just women. Take the time on projects, in meetings etc., to give space to those who may not naturally take it themselves. This can come in many forms:</p>



  End meetings with a round table.  Work with a teammate or colleague to help them find professional outlets to develop their passion.  Be a mentor and a coach.  Offer public praise and private – and always constructive feedback.  If you have a hand in assigning resources, prioritize diversity. Diverse perspectives always benefit an organization and provides opportunities to lift people up.  



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you? </p>



<p>Women are a very diverse group and our challenges are not homogenous. For those like me, who have faced very little discrimination on account of their gender identity, the challenge will continue to be to recognize and use that privilege to widen the conversation and create space, not just for other women but for all those along the gender spectrum. We cannot become complacent that equality for some women is equal to equality for all.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Find your passion. Hone your strengths. Dig into the details, stay outcomes focused and curious, and always, always stay open to feedback.</p>

<p>This is a transcript of a keynote originally delivered at the 2021 Stefan A. Riesenfeld Symposium, <a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/">Global Speech Under Pressure</a>. The video of the speech can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="https://globalspeechunderpressure.com/recordings">here</a>.</p><p>Thank you so very much: both for this incredible honour and for these kind words. And thank you to everyone who is joining us today via Zoom or the livecast — I am deeply grateful that you are making the time to engage with us on the many important topics we will be discussing at the Symposium today and tomorrow. To me the honour to kick us off with a few words, so let me do&nbsp;that.</p><p>Freedom of expression is an important right in and of itself. It plays a key role in our societies as an enabler of democratic debate, in holding our leaders to account, and it is crucial for truth finding. It is a fundamental right for us as individuals: expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</p><blockquote>…expressing our views, convictions and beliefs is a central aspect of our self-determination.</blockquote><p>Freedom of expression also is a basic right for us as we act and organise in groups: it allows us to share information with each other, exchange views and opinions, and debate matters that concern us all. The American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman Frederick Douglass summed up the important role freedom of expression plays by saying that: “To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker. It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to speak and hear as it would be to rob him of his&nbsp;money.”</p><p>But one of the things that makes freedom of expression so especially important is the way in which it facilitates the enjoyment of other fundamental rights. Here, it is obvious to think of the role of the press in bringing wrongs to light and thereby helping the enforcement of human rights standards. And the press, often referred to as the “lifeblood of democracy”, is indeed crucial. However, what I am getting at is something more all-encompassing. It is the interconnectedness of the different human rights acknowledged in international and national frameworks, and the role freedom of expression plays in that constellation as a facilitator.</p><p>This special role that freedom of expression plays as a supporting right inevitably also has its drawbacks.</p><p>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation for the purpose of undermining, abusing or even destroying these other rights. Put very simply: if you can make good things happen, it also offers an opening for bad things to happen. Today, I want to look at some examples of the benefits of freedom of expression in this facilitating and supporting role, and also reflect on some of the challenges it&nbsp;brings.</p><blockquote>Because freedom of expression underpins and is so closely connected to the exercise of other rights, it is also open to exploitation</blockquote><p>In doing so, I want to take a slightly broader view than many of us have the liberty of taking day to day, confronted with a world in which — currently by necessity due to the pandemic — we are living significant parts of our lives online. Much focus is placed at the moment on the challenges that technology and social media bring for freedom of expression — and human rights in general — in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>In doing so, we don’t always properly take into account that the right — which the drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights wisely framed as applying without frontiers and as a right that can be exercised through any means — already has a history of having been tried and tested through a variety of contexts and rapid societal developments.</p><p>When I say this, I by no means intend to downplay the novelty of the developments we are seeing unfold at the moment, nor the speed or scale at which this is happening. But I do want to emphasise that the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too.</p><blockquote>…the human rights framework has made it through a lot already and it is my view that it will be able to withstand this,&nbsp;too</blockquote><p>Another aspect I want to place squarely within the frame before we enter into the panel discussions today and tomorrow (which I am very much looking forward to), is that the way freedom of expression plays out in different contexts, online and offline, is a manifestation of the choices we make as a society and the power structures that govern it. This is a consideration that I don’t think is always sufficiently taken into account. Too often the focus in our debates about free speech in the digital age lies in dealing with symptoms, rather than reflecting on their root&nbsp;causes.</p><p>To illustrate these points, I want to highlight three contexts in which we’ve seen freedom of expression facilitate other rights in both the offline and online contexts: publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights. After that, I’ll conclude with some reflections that we can jointly look at in more detail during the various panel conversations of the Symposium.</p> Examples of Freedom of Expression as a Facilitating Right <p>The Impact of Printing and Digital Publishing</p><p>The ability to express ourselves in writing and to share those writings with others has facilitated a great deal of other rights and advances in our societies over the centuries. It has helped the promotion of freedom of religion, the right to health, the right to rest and leisure, education, culture, and generally allowed us to share ideas and scientific discoveries across frontiers when we were not yet able to text or e-mail each other in&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>To start with its offline variety: the printed word has been referred to as one of the “Four Great Inventions” of ancient China, alongside the compass, gunpowder, and papermaking. When the German goldsmith Gutenberg adapted the technique in the 15th century, it made printing more affordable, easier to use, and more accessible. Historians often note the printing press’ significance as an “agent of change” throughout history, including during the Reformation, Renaissance and Scientific Revolution.</p><p>The printing press also provided more general access to the written word, which in Europe had been the domain of universities and the church. Universities and church institutions managed libraries and if books needed to be reproduced, this was done by making careful copies by hand. These books were mainly written in Latin, which made them inaccessible to anyone who did not master the language, even if they were literate.</p><p>As printing made the production of written texts at scale so much easier and affordable, it became lucrative to start printing works in languages that were accessible to those outside of ecclesiastic and academic circles. By starting to print in languages other than Latin, “regular” languages were standardised. It also facilitated the creation of communities around commonly read works to discuss their&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that anyone was able to get printed whatever they wanted. Governments were able to restrict what did and did not get printed, and the workings of the “market” also made sure that not just everyone was able to see their ideas published and circulated.</p><p>Prior restraint, a form of censorship that allows government to review the content of printed materials and prevent their publication, was, and in some countries still is, a reality. Just like the practise of banning certain books on grounds such as national security, or for being perceived as obscene or blasphemous. Here, it is good to keep in mind that even books we would deem fairly innocent now, such as Alice in Wonderland, Ivanhoe, and Oliver Twist, all have been banned by various governments at some point in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Besides government interference, “access” — a concept I always find hard to define, but which speaks volumes about our ability or inability to effectively get to those with power in our societies — to a large extent determined who got to publish. A lot of power lies in the hands of the publishing industry, whose decisions of what “audiences” will want to read are made by teams and individuals that, according to recent survey data, still are predominantly white, cis-gender, straight and able-bodied. This inevitably has led to an underrepresentation on the shelves of our public libraries and bookshops of authors that do not fit that&nbsp;picture.</p><p>The arrival of digital publishing and online self-publication has shaken up the publishing landscape to some extent, in the sense that the lower barrier for “access” and the lower cost of publishing mean that authors have more options to get their work out in public now that this no longer is the same as getting “printed”.</p><blockquote>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications</blockquote><p>The new publishing landscape also allows for marginalised groups to create their own platforms to fill a gap left by mainstream publications and reach a wider, more international audience than would be possible with, say a physical “”, the nonconformist, self-published booklets made by&nbsp;hand.</p><p>This does not mean that we’re now, in the digital age, completely free from the power dynamics and censorship at play in traditional printing and publishing. First, the traditional barriers that exist for those who are systematically excluded remain: think of the time, space and resources it takes to write in the first place. The “room of one’s own” and money to support themselves that Virginia Woolf argued women needed in order to write was accessible only to a privileged few.</p><blockquote>…we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free&nbsp;word</blockquote><p>Second, digital publishing brings its own specific drawbacks with it. The website of an online Zine can be geographically blocked, doxxed or taken down; and we should all wonder if bypassing a publishing house to directly e-publish on Amazon truly is a win for the free word, trading traditional publishing houses as gatekeepers for a trillion-dollar capitalist behemoth.</p><p>The Galvanising Effect of Seeing Civil Rights&nbsp;Protests</p><p>Freedom of expression has traditionally been closely linked to the right to protest and the right to assembly. We organise and take to the streets to express our views on matters we believe should change in our societies, to get those in power to listen to us and, sometimes, even to tell them to step down. An important role in this is played by the media, and nowadays by us as citizen journalists and activists.</p><p>Gil Scott-Heron said that the revolution will not be televised, but television did play an important role in advancing the fight for civil rights in the South of the United States. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. understood the role the press and television could play in the civil rights movement by helping make visible to audiences across the United States — where, by the early 1960s, about 90% of households had a television set — what the Black experience in the country was. In their history of television news, Unsilent Revolution, journalists Robert Donovan and Ray Scherer wrote that “The civil-rights revolution in the South began when a man and the eye of the television film camera came together, giving the camera a focal point for events breaking from state to state, and the man, Martin Luther King Jr., high exposure on television sets from coast to&nbsp;coast.”</p><p>This attention from the media is often credited to have helped activists and politicians push for the adoption of key legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in&nbsp;1965.</p><blockquote>…the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to&nbsp;us.</blockquote><p>There are also some critical notes to be placed here, of course. Not only is who gets to broadcast determined by a licencing system, which is administered by the state; the news we get to see and read about entails editorial choices, as does the way in which it is presented to us. We’ll talk about the theoretical aspect of that in a moment, but I want to note here that the way in which events in the South were covered and the imagery of resistance that was spread was to a large extent shaped by the needs of the then-new television stations and their desire to connect with a wide audience across the US. I think I do not need to make explicit what the makeup of those news stations looked like — today, still, diversity within broadcasting and news companies is lamentable.</p><p>Social activist and civil rights movement leader Julian Bond summed up the media’s approach at the time as follows: “What the media craved was a steady diet of bold mass action campaigns in the streets, ideally faced by violent white resistance, which could dramatize the issues at stake and make good print or electronic copy.”</p><p>The television networks had a clear idea of what their viewers wanted to see, and this resulted in an imagery of Black suffering, combined with extraordinary restraint in not responding in kind to any violence endured. This means that other narratives and perspectives of the fight for civil rights, which was of course a lot more complex than the TV version, did not get a place on prime time television. To come back to Gil Scott-Heron: to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white audience.</p><blockquote>…to the extent that the revolution was televised, it was only a small part of it, curated and made presentable and palatable for a predominantly white&nbsp;audience</blockquote><p>If television was the medium that controlled audiences at scale in the 1960s, social media platforms perform that function in our current day and age. And of course especially since the COVID-19 pandemic took on a global scale in early 2020. Here, we are not dependent on a state body granting broadcasting licenses or newsroom making editorial choices, but what we do and do not see appear in our timelines is just as curated, and guided by the terms of service on which social media platforms operate and the algorithms that make sure items either end up “trending” or quietly slip out of&nbsp;sight.</p><p>There are many examples of social media playing a role in organising protests offline, of which the street protests against structural racism and police violence against Black people and people of colour last year is a recent and vivid&nbsp;example.</p><p>The Black Lives Matter hashtag and movement was born in the summer of 2013, when labour organiser Alicia Garza responded on her Facebook page to the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the man who murdered Trayvon&nbsp;Martin.</p><p>Following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, the Black Lives Matter movement swelled in numbers, with protests not only taking place across the United States, but also internationally. Social media facilitated much of the organising and allowed information, images and videos of protests to be instantly shared with millions worldwide.</p><blockquote>The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see</blockquote><p>Another protest that we saw in 2020 was the #EndSARS demonstrations in Nigeria. The movement had started in 2017 to protest against police brutality in the country by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and was reinvigorated in October last year after new abuses were brought to light. The live protests built on social media and after people took to the streets, the violent response to some of the demonstrations was livestreamed for all the world to&nbsp;see.</p><p>This online sharing of information — photos, protest details, livestreaming videos — is also where the greatest vulnerability lies for movement organising. Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use of and, of course, a variety of private companies have been able to monetise. By monitoring messages and images posted on social media, sometimes through the use of fake user accounts, and combining that with other information, it is possible to identify upcoming protests and even individual protesters.</p><blockquote>Surveillance becomes easy with so much information at the ready and it is something governments have made grateful use&nbsp;of</blockquote><p>While the FBI needed to get Attorney General Robert Kennedy’s approval to place wiretaps on Dr King’s home and offices in an attempt to discredit him and destroy his reputation, no such measures are needed when surveilling movements through public social media posts. The same information that helps us mobilise in the streets can be collected and turned against&nbsp;us.</p><p>Supporting the Fight for LGBTQ&nbsp;rights</p><p>Freedom of expression ties in with the fight for equal rights of LGBTQ people in many ways. Amongst others by bringing to light inequalities and calling for them to be addressed; through organising and demonstrating, as we just touched upon; and by supporting the expression of individual identity.</p><p>Just like exposure was important for the civil rights movement to get racial inequalities examined and addressed, it is important for many other rights movements to see their cause featured in the media. But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</p><blockquote>But: who decides what makes it into the morning paper and the evening&nbsp;news?</blockquote><p>A well-established media theory is that of “Hallin’s spheres”, developed by journalism historian Daniel C. Hallin in the late 1980’s. Hallin divides the world of political discourse into three concentric spheres: the middle circle is the sphere of consensus, which concerns topics on which there is widespread agreement. In the sphere of consensus, journalists assume everyone agrees. There is not a lot of exciting material for them to cover there, but it is also not kept out of the press. The next circle is that of legitimate controversy, topics on which people hold differing views. These topics are the most important to cover for journalists: there will be a lot of interest in them and journalists can help facilitate an informed debate. The outer circle is that of “deviance”, a label we wouldn’t really choose anymore nowadays, and those are the topics that fall outside the bounds of legitimate debate. Journalists are free to ignore these topics in their coverage. What falls within these categories shifts as public opinion shifts, which of course raises a bit of a chicken and egg question on how public opinion can shift if no one is reporting on certain&nbsp;issues.</p><p>For a long period of time, LGBTQ issues were part of the third circle we just looked at: they were not reported on at all in mainstream media or only to a limited degree, and then often negatively. In response to a nationwide demand in the United Kingdom by lesbians and gay men to be able to access news on the gay and lesbian liberation movement, the newspaper Gay News was founded in 1972 in a collaboration between former members of the Gay Liberation Front and members of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.</p><p>The paper played a key role in the struggle for gay rights in the 1970s in the UK. Described as the movement’s “debating chamber”, the paper reported on discrimination, progress that was made in the fight for political and social equalities, and campaigned for further law reform, including equal rights in employment and the trade union movement. It also published personal ads, even though this was illegal at the time, under the headline “Love knoweth no&nbsp;laws.”</p><blockquote>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed</blockquote><p>Overcoming the obstacle of publishing alone is not enough: if you want to also reach your readership, your paper will need to be distributed. And this is where Gay News ran into difficulty a number of times. It had repeated clashes with W.H. Smith, which controlled one-third of the newspaper and magazine distribution in the UK at the time and who initially refused to stock the paper due to an alleged “low potential for&nbsp;sales”.</p><p>In countries like the UK, distribution is less of a problem these days for LGBTQ publications. In addition to self-published online Zines as touched upon earlier, big commercial publishers like Condé Nast have started to take on intersectional queer publications like the community platform them. To speak with Hallin’s circles: they are no longer part of the “outer” circle. This is not to say that the playing field is even now, but the landscape is starting to&nbsp;change.</p><blockquote>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities</blockquote><p>Social media platforms more generally have served as spaces for community building, information sharing and organising for queer communities. It is not entirely a rosy picture, however. While there is no need to rely on a conservative establishment to get content distributed, like Gay News had to if it wanted to effectively reach its audience, social media platforms bring their own obstacles. Content “moderation” is often skewed against queer expression, and platform policies, such as Facebook’s real name policy, which effectively forces transgender persons to use their dead name if they want to be able to access the platform, are highly problematic. Going online also doesn’t mean it is possible to fully escape government censorship: platforms tend to comply with local “gay propaganda” legislation like we see in, for example Russia, and take down LGBTQ content or suppress related hashtags and search&nbsp;results.</p><p>Freedom of Expression and&nbsp;Power</p><p>We just looked at publishing, protest, and the fight for LGBTQ rights, and how freedom of expression facilitates — and sometimes hampers — other rights both offline and online in those contexts. Now, before we move on to the panel discussions, I would like to share some further reflections on where we are with freedom of expression at the moment and what I believe we should be thinking of as we navigate the digital landscape.</p><p>At the outset of this talk, I said I did not want to downplay the challenges we are facing at the moment, with most of our lives moving online and the exercise of our human rights along with it. And it is of course a reality that the exercise of many of our rights are now taking place on private platforms.</p><p>But: the question how we hold “big business” to account for human rights violations is also something we have struggled with before speech moved online. We are all too familiar with the images of, for example, big oil companies destroying wildlife and the livelihood of farmers through their negligence, as well stories about the use of child slavery in the production of our food, clothes, and smartphones. And while the conversation about corporate social responsibility and business and human rights is still very much ongoing, there are some positive lessons we can draw on for rethinking responsibility and accountability when it comes to corporations.</p><blockquote>…the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will.</blockquote><p>In the end, though, the effectiveness of any of this, whether it is the responsibility of the Shells, Exxons or Facebooks of this world, will depend on political will. How far are our societies, the governments that we elect, willing to go to guarantee that human rights are upheld, guaranteed and protected?</p><p>The main challenge is of course how the human rights framework is set up, which is state-centric: the state has a number of obligations — to respect, protect and fulfil human rights — vis-à-vis individuals. We are not yet at a stage where direct horizontal effect of human rights, which would allow individuals to seek redress for human rights violations from another individual directly, including from actors like companies, is a&nbsp;fact.</p><p>So for the moment, we will need to work within the framework that we have, which means that human rights enforcement against companies and corporations, including the platforms on which much of our public debate takes place nowadays, will have to go via the&nbsp;state.</p><p>And this brings us back to the question of power dynamics: as individuals, we are dependent on the state and the international systems that states have created to see our human rights respected. Who actually gets to seek redress is a matter of access to justice, which is by no means equally distributed. The quip that “justice is open to all, like the Ritz hotel” still very much holds&nbsp;true.</p><p>This is what often makes me a bit anxious about the discussions on “regulating platform power”. Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very nervous. As some of the examples we just looked at demonstrated, and the overall picture around the globe when it comes to protecting free speech and journalism shows, government is often the problem and not the answer when it comes to stifling the free flow of information.</p><blockquote>Especially when these discussions point towards putting in place more legislation, I get very&nbsp;nervous</blockquote><p>Take an example like the NetzDG legislation in Germany, which makes it mandatory for companies like Facebook to remove “hate speech” from its platform or risk hefty fines. Enthusiastically copied by countries across the world, often by countries that do not have a good track record when it comes to protecting free speech, and often modified to expand the type of speech that should be taken down, this type of legislation has been shown to incentivise an overly zealous approach to speech removal. Putting the wrong type of pressure on platforms, and giving governments more power to suppress expression is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>If we are talking about regulation, I am much more in favour of thinking in the direction of parallels to the way another powerful private sector, that of banking and finance, is regulated. This would include putting in place stringent transparency obligations: what is taken down and promoted online and why; how are these processes and decisions automated? It would need to be combined with clear and accessible procedures for people to seek redress for perceived violations within an acceptable timeframe (as “justice delayed is also justice denied”…).</p><p>My main qualm with theorising about “solutions” for the conundrum of online speech regulation, however, is that we must ensure to not mistake the manifestation of a problem for the problem itself. Our societies have big, structural problems: power asymmetries that maintain structural inequalities, institutional racism, capitalism. Whatever we create in that setting, including internet platforms, will reproduce that.</p><blockquote>…while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look&nbsp;deeper</blockquote><p>So while it’s nice to think we can “fix the internet”, I believe we should have no illusions of succeeding beyond symptom suppression if we aren’t willing to look deeper at the root causes of why it’s broken in the first place. If we accept societies in which those whose human rights are routinely violated generally won’t be able to easily seek justice, how do we expect to do better when it comes to safeguarding their human rights&nbsp;online?</p><p>You have heard me be critical of our societies and its power structures and I imagine some of you might be asking the question: “But wait: what about the human rights system itself? This, too, is a product of those same power structures and interests.” This is a very good point, and one I often struggle with, especially when I am reminded of Audre Lorde’s quote that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house”.</p><p>Where I stand on this at the moment is a belief that we need to combine a longer-term, aspirational vision with a certain degree of pragmatism. Even if our human rights framework may not be perfect, it is a good place to start to fight for our rights as individuals and as communities. And while we do so, we can work on changing the system itself in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>In doing this, we have to continue to be mindful of the broader impact our work has. Will taking up this particular fight lower barriers for others or increase them? Are we trading individual success for common good? This will entail making difficult choices at times, in which especially those of us who are lawyers and litigators will need to set our egos aside and look beyond short-term wins and ask what structural, systemic change we want to work towards in the longer&nbsp;term.</p><p>Coming back to the right to freedom of expression, and the role it plays in facilitating not only other human rights, but also the very struggle for their realisation, I want to make one final&nbsp;note.</p><blockquote>Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement</blockquote><p>And that is that it is important to make sure that, whatever we do, we don’t end up with a lowest common denominator approach or a restrictive interpretation of what a good space for debate is. Progress, especially if we want it to lead to addressing some of the fundamental power inequalities I mentioned before, requires vigorous debate and sometimes fiery disagreement. When I say this, I am not arguing for a right to insult, but rather for a right to provoke. Professor, feminist, and social activist bell hooks expressed this wonderfully in her 1994 essay “Censorship from Left and Right”, and I would like to close with her&nbsp;words:</p><p>“When repression via censorship becomes the norm in progressive political circles, we not only undermine our collective struggles to end domination, we act in complicity with that brand of contemporary, chic fascism that evokes romantic images of unity and solidarity, a return to traditional values, while working to deny free speech and suppress all forms of rebellious thought and action. In recent years, feminist thinkers have fought long and hard to make feminist thinking, theorizing, and practice a radical space of openness where critical dialogue can take place. Much of that struggle has been waged by women of color, beginning with the conflict over whether or not to see issues of race and racism as feminist agendas. Feminist movement, black liberation struggle, and all our progressive political movements to end domination must work to protect free speech.

<p>The 3 properties of the Blockchain&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain is a trust system made possible by technology by removing the human factor, which is always the weak link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This trust needed within a Blockchain network is made possible by three key characteristics inherent in the technology in question:&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Decentralisation</p>
<p>– Immutability</p>
<p>– Distribution</p>
<p>For each of these three properties of the Blockchain, it is possible to imagine some examples of specific use cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralisation&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Blockchain ledger is shared among multiple participants. This ensures transparency between participants in the Blockchain network nodes without the need to have a central authority controlling it Decentralised trust: all Blockchains are trusted services, this trust does not only apply to transactions but extends to data, services, processes, identities, business logic, terms of an agreement or physical objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It applies to almost anything that can be digitised as a (smart) asset with an intrinsic or related value </p>
<p>Decentralised infrastructure: Blockchain can also be seen as a software design approach that binds together a number of computers that commonly obey the same ‘consensus’ process to release or record information they hold, and where all related interactions are verified by cryptography.</p>
<p>Decentralised database: Blockchain destroys the paradigm of current proprietary databases. A Blockchain is like a place where you store semi-public data in a space. Anyone can verify that you put that information there, because the container has your signature, but only you can securely unlock what is inside the container, because only you have the private keys to that data.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m very grateful for the opportunities provided to me as an employee of RBC. The bank has created a fast paced environment where I truly learn something new each day. I’m constantly challenged to grow in my role, something I find very rewarding as I know it’s because my team sees potential in me.</p>
<p>This type of environment is something I never thought I’d be able to find in a role that doesn’t require me to travel extensively. I’m very fortunate that I can develop my my career each day while still being home in time for dinner with my family each night.</p>
<p>My work allows me to be my best self in all aspects of my life and that’s what drives me to get out of bed.</p>
 
How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Throughout my career, I’ve been in many different roles – systems administrator, business analyst, technical lead, project manager and project control officer. The wide variety of experiences has really helped me understand how these various functions work together technically.&nbsp; More importantly, I’ve learned many power skills from the people that I’ve worked with. Each person we meet has a story to tell and a lesson to teach.</p>
<p>In one of my first corporate roles, my supervisor was a former submariner, obviously carrying a superhuman level of diligence that I try to incorporate into my own work. There we shared a manager who taught us the importance of being calm and approaching things rationally in every situation.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve had an amazing manager and mentor, Melissa Carvalho, who has taught me what it means to be agile. Melissa has taught me to always be prepared with facts and data surrounding every situation so we know when to push and when to pivot. This has allowed me to accomplish more and deliver higher quality work than I honestly knew I was capable of.</p>
<blockquote>
 It’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.<br>
What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
</blockquote>
<p>Another mentor I’ve learned a lot from taught me about working with people in unique environments. Every environment is truly unique. As non-unionized employees in a union environment, we needed to learn very quickly how to be aware of and always respectful of the protections afforded to our unionized counterparts. The team had a large workload and needed to comply by certain timelines to ensure they were following their commitments to the union too. With limited time to get to know everyone and learn the roles I’d be helping them with, I found that it’s much more important to learn what works for people before learning processes or technology.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>I want to focus on continue here…Continue setting baselines and benchmarks to ensure we’re all held accountable to providing equitable opportunities. Continue facilitating discussions on how we can build better products that work for all of our clients. Continue cascading these messages into the workforce.</p>
<p>I know we still have so much work to do, but I’m very inspired by the conversations I’ve had in recent months. A lot of questions after previous WiD engagements centered on why diversity matters. In the past year, there’s definitely been a shift. People are now asking how they can be a part of creating diverse teams and providing equitable opportunities.</p>
 
In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In terms of technology, diverse workforces create better solutions that work for more people. More importantly, diversity brings a richness to our lives that make us all better, stronger, more creative and more compassionate.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>We’ve been looking at a lot of art over the past year- almost like a tour of museums from home. I’m currently reading about Burhan Doğançay (1929 – 2013), a Turkish-American artist probably best known for his works turning graffiti and signs posted on urban walls into modern art. I love that art transcends time and provides a geo-political view of the past.</p>
  
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Work on time management and develop a better understanding of your priorities!</p>

 Tell us a little bit about what you do in the world of identity 
<p>My current role is Director, IAM Business Systems Analysis at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). In this role I oversee a team of Business Analysts who are assigned to work on the various solutions we implement to help centralize the bank’s internal enterprise Identity and Access Management</p>
<p>Another service I oversee is the enhancement process, basically managing requests to enhance and innovate the solutions that support our various objectives. We also manage the Intake process for new capability requests across the many IAM services to ensure they align to our roadmaps and strategic direction.</p>
<p>More recently we have started to focus on Customer IAM (CIAM) and my team will support these initiatives that look to centralize not only our enterprise IAM but also CIAM within the bank. It’s a really exciting development for us as it aligns to such a core focus for our industry.</p>
<p>I can certainly say no two days are the same!! There are so many moving parts. Recently, I have been handling the organizational change management responsibilities for the IAM services we work on, which has added an exciting new layer not only for me but for the wider team.</p>
<p>What I really love most about my role is the combination of self-growth opportunities, the people I work with, the organization as a whole, the great leadership I have experienced,&nbsp; Leading a team of amazing and resilient individuals, I am so proud to be able to support their career growth and development,</p>
<blockquote>
 Diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table. 
</blockquote>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Firstly I had to remove any self-doubt and trust that I was capable.</p>
<p>Although I have been in the IAM space for 10+ years, I came in with no experience or formal training and that was scary. Much of what I know I learned on the job but I was also fortunate to have had a number of great leaders and mentors. Here I want to call out Melissa Carvalho, Her knowledge and expertise really motivated me. Thanks to her and my other mentors I became a sponge just absorbing everything they taught me. I am convinced that has contributed to getting me to this point, encouraging me to continue to grow and learn.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>To ask questions and encourage questions, feedback, recommendations and input.</p>
<p>We may have always done things a certain way&nbsp; but it does not always mean this is the only way. Being curious allows us to find efficiencies and improvements. It helps build a culture of creativity and thought leadership, driving and seeking change.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>As we focus on identity trends from advancing MFA with adaptive authentication, AI, biometrics or even self-sovereign identity, challenge the status quo.&nbsp; Do not rush into digital identity solutions without the backing of a diverse team who can help address the wide range of issues faced by our users.</p>
<p>Continue to focus on diversity within this space, to make room for different opinions and drive new discussions.</p>
<p>Stop looking for specific, pre-defined skillsets and start and/or continue to provide opportunities for candidates from outside our sector and ‘different’ backgrounds. Different people bring different perspectives which is exactly what we need if the identity sector is to thrive.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Because it broadens our perspective and allows for a variety of viewpoints that inspire me. I see real creativity and innovation come through from our teams but, more importantly, diversity helps establish a better sense of community, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80240086">RBG (Ruth Bader Ginsburg)</a></p>
<p>This documentary is so powerful and moving and gives a real insight into the life and personality of this amazing woman who drove so much change around women’s rights.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>When a plan does not work out the way you envision, don’t let it stop you!</p>
<p>Adapt to change; failure is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Look at the lessons it taught you, rather than the setbacks or discomfort you felt.</p>
<p>And, finally, fall forward and use it to build your resiliency tool kit!</p>

 Berkman Klein event explores the early years of online platforms, the state of current platforms, and the&nbsp;future <p>“Today’s platforms were inspired by the many that preceded them, but along the way, we started to go astray. How can we make sense of where we are today? What can we understand about the decisions that were made and the structures we had in place? And most importantly, how can the builders of new platforms that also intend to bring the world closer together, give everyone the power to create or organize the world’s information, do it&nbsp;better?”</p><p>BKC fellow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jad-esber">Jad Esber</a> posed these overarching questions at the start of a Berkman Klein Center <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">event</a> that looked back on online platforms over the past 30 years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a>, the founder of Flickr, <a href="http://www.bohnettfoundation.org/david-bohnett-bio/">David Bohnett</a>, the founder of Geocities, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/baym/">Nancy Baym</a>, Sr. Principal Research Manager, Microsoft Research, joined Esber to reflect on early platforms, the state of newer platforms today, and what they could look like in the future. Their conversation covered topics including subcultures, content moderation, and the evolution of technology.</p><p>Fake and Bohnett are themselves founders of early popular platforms, and early in the discussion, the panelists highlighted the significance of founders’ values shaping the platforms, and how that trend continues today.</p><p>“You can do a lot to influence and change and manage how a community grows and develops from the outset,” Fake said. “And so much of it is based on the personalities of the founders: what they value, what they don’t value, how they design the software,” she said, also pointing out the important role of business&nbsp;models.</p><p>“I paid a lot of particular attention to the values of building communities of interest,” Bohnett added, highlighting that founders’ values also play a critical role in the inclusiveness of platforms. “Do the founders and the early settlers or participants in these communities value inclusiveness and diversity through their actions?” he asked. “That’s what helps foster&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Baym, in turn, emphasized that values may be harmful in the long run. “They’re essential but I think that we see platforms over and over kind of lose their way when it becomes about the founder’s values,” she said. “And one of the ways I think that they go really wrong is that early on their users who are different from the founders who were running into real problems with those platforms and the users are going, ‘hello, there’s this really bad thing happening to me here.’ And the founders for whatever reasons are not fully able to absorb what they’re hearing about the dangers their platforms are posing. And I don’t mean to underestimate the technical and human labor demands of trying to deal with all of that adequately. They’re very, very hard problems.”</p><p>The discussants also talked about the shift from free services that run on users’ data towards fee-based platforms and how these business models may shape or inform user behavior and investment in the online communities.</p><p>“I do think that people are evolving into a kind of a paid model in reaction to a lot of the exploitation that they’ve suffered under for a long time. And as a result of that, I think, these are obviously very positive trends,” she said, citing Patreon and Substack as examples. “I do think Internet business models swing back and forth between the paid and the free and it’s a pendulum swing that many of us, I think that work in kind of online social systems actually welcome to a great degree. So, I do think that the behaviors are different on platforms that you pay for for all of the reasons David and Nancy have already kind of explained.”</p><p>But the pay-to-play model is not an option for everyone, Baym noted. “I think the trick with platforms you have to pay for, of course, is that we want people who don’t have excess income to be able to participate in online communities,” she said. “So we have to think through how do you enable that so that people in poverty are not getting a third rate internet while the rich folks get the really good community, which of course exacerbates wealth and&nbsp;equity.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/hindsight-2020">here</a>.

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/webinars/future-of-work/"></a>Scotland is facing a population crisis. 
<p>As the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland-s-rural-communities-to-lose-quarter-of-their-population-1-4709834">Scotsman reported</a> in 2018 Scotland’s rural communities face losing up to a third of their working age population by 2046, losing more than a quarter of their population within the next thirty years, with Western Isles, Argyll and the Southern Uplands among the worst affected.</p>
<p>“A report by the James Hutton Institute found that “sparsely populated areas” – defined as those where fewer than 10,000 people can be reached within 30 minutes of travel – account for almost half of Scotland, but just 2.6 per cent of the population live there.”</p>
<p>It’s not unique to Scotland. In Spain they are selling off whole ‘<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-29/ghost-villages-for-sale-as-spain-fights-rural-desertification">ghost villages</a>‘.</p>
 Workers on Tap – Tapping into the Gig Economy 
<p>The answer is the ‘<a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/gig-economy">Gig Economy</a>‘.</p>
  
<p>These refers to the overall trend of employment shifting more to contracting self-employed freelancers, a trend that the Economist described as <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2014/12/30/workers-on-tap">Workers on Tap</a>.</p>
<p>The Cloud is enabling the ‘<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-on-demand-economy-2014-7">On Demand Economy</a>‘, exemplified by ventures like Uber taxis and Airbnb. These ventures disrupt traditional industries by overlaying a ‘digital mesh’ across cities to better harness their idling resources, like available accommodation for rent or freelance taxi drivers looking for work.</p>
<p>“Every week, new services launch that aggregate and organizes freelancer labor (those with excess time) to help those who have money but not time.”</p>
<p>On Forbes.com <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abdullahimuhammed/2018/06/28/4-reasons-why-the-gig-economy-will-only-keep-growing-in-numbers/#495a263811eb">Abdullahi Muhammed writes</a> how by 2020 half of all American workers will be freelancers. NACo provides a <a href="https://www.naco.org/featured-resources/future-work-rise-gig-economy">detailed report</a> on the same trend.</p>
<p>Sites like <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer.com</a>, <a href="https://www.abodoo.com/">Abodoo</a>, <a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/">Peopleperhour</a> and <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a>, among many others, all offer marketplaces where you can hire workers on tap.</p>
<p>For some sectors like tech it’s increasingly becoming seen as the norm for an employed engagement; many leaders recognizing simple ideals like how <a href="https://www.inc.com/brian-de-haaff/3-ways-remote-workers-outperform-office-workers.html?cid=sf01001">remote workers outperform office workers</a>.</p>
 The Future of Work 
<p>It’s not a new idea, also back in 2004 Thomas Malone wrote about the coming <a href="http://ccs.mit.edu/futureofwork/">Future of Work</a>, and long before that the original visionary Charles Handy described how our employment will evolve to become ‘<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/nov/10/economicdispatch.money">portfolio working</a>‘. Malone said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Imagine organizations where most workers aren’t employees at all, but electronically connected freelancers living wherever they want to.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Handy offers a blueprint for how to practically structure such a virtual team that we will implement, describing a ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_organization">Shamrock organization</a>‘.</p>
  
 Digital Enterprise Centres 
<p>Interestingly the trend does not dictate entirely individualized, work-from-home scenarios, indeed the key point for rural communities looking to attract this work force is that it works best with some office facilities, provided very locally.</p>
<p>Digital Enterprise Centres are ‘Co-working’ places of work, simply offices rented in small units to one person or more at a time, so that they can enjoy the benefits of those facilities but without having to pay for the entire place.</p>
  
<p>Their role as economy enabling hubs is key – While the Gig Economy is inherently about individuals working alone as freelancers, often via online virtual tools and booking methods, there is still considerable value in facilitating physical collaboration.</p>
<p>This is one of the key recommendations made by the Scottish Rural College, to unlock £2.5 billion in growth for the nation through better digitally enabling our rural communities, where they describe them as “Digital Enterprise Centres”, with the recommended action being:</p>
<p>“Establishing hubs in rural towns which businesses can use or visit for better connectivity, start-up workspace, hot-desk space and training.”</p>
<p>A key dynamic is of course connecting to the Digital Economy – These work spaces provide the ‘tools of the trade’, enabling new micro-businesses to participate in a variety of online digital markets.</p>
<p>We can see them as essential foundations for the Gig Economy, when you consider factors such as the challenges for employers looking to utilize them on a large scale, challenges such as <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-create-belonging-for-remote-workers/">helping to create belonging</a>, through a better program of support for how managers can <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-managers-can-best-support-a-gig-workforce/">best support a gig economy workforce</a> remote workers.</p>
<p>Coworking centres can contribute towards these goals as shared office environments are ideal for cultivating mentorship and support environments, and is also a sound business model in it’s own right – The gig economy has been driving an explosion in <a href="https://angel.co/newsletters/cash-is-pouring-into-co-working-100418">demand for coworking office space</a>.</p>
 Conclusion – Quality of Life 
<p>For towns seeking to retain and attract young workers and their families this is how to do it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sharemyoffice.com/blog/item/38-are-rural-coworking-hubs-the-future-of-the-rural-economy">This Sharemyoffice article</a> suggests Rural Coworking hubs are the future of the rural economy, and they’re right, and in her <a href="https://medium.com/remote-office/rural-coworking-is-a-thing-2251e720f943">Medium article</a> describes why:</p>
<p>“Also if you work in a small team, the bonds made in rural coworking spaces tend to be stronger, since in these situations you normally live and work from the same place. Whether that includes, hikes and bike rides, swimming or surfing, skiing or rock climbing, living outside of the cites allows us to reconnect with the nature — which is what most of us need from time to time.”</p>
<p>Thousands are moving out of the cities to <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/how-get-by-800-month-london-netherlands/">enjoy a better quality of life</a>, and with Scotland’s rural areas like <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/scotland/orkney-islanders-best-quality-life-uk/">Orkney offering the very best of this</a> across the entire UK, there is a uniquely powerful perfect storm of opportunity to promote Scotland as the best nation in the world for digital living and working.</p>

<p></p>
 For years now, the way we work has been rapidly digitised and distributed. 
<p>Some have been at the forefront of this trend. However for many, the onset of Covid-19 accelerated this change and organisations everywhere have found themselves facing barriers with on-premise legacy technology as they tried to embrace this new norm.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.cobry.co.uk/">Cobry</a>, we have always encouraged people to work in new, modern ways and push boundaries. As <a href="https://www.cobry.co.uk/what-is-the-cloud/">Google Cloud</a> partners, all of our work takes place on <a href="https://www.cobry.co.uk/g-suite/">Google Workspace</a> (formerly G Suite) – Google’s business productivity platform. Luckily for us and our clients, Google Workspace equipped us with the tools to truly prosper in a work from home setting. This meant that as we had to part ways with our bonnie office in Glasgow almost a year ago, our transition to working from home was pretty seamless.</p>
<p>We have reflected on our use of Google Workspace as a distributed team over the past year and have shared some tips on how your organisation can implement these tools to succeed from any location. We hope that if you are already on Workspace then this article will provide you with ways to enhance your use of the tools; and if Workspace is new to you, then you gain some insight into how great the platform truly is. First though, for those who fall into the latter category let’s discuss what exactly Google Workspace is.</p>
 What is Google Workspace? 
<p>Google Workspace is a cloud based IT system built specifically for business. Its core apps provide you with everything you need to get anything done all in one place. These include Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Chat and Meet, to name a few. All of which are designed to foster communication, collaboration and productivity no matter where you are.</p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/introducing-google-workspace">Google Workspace rebranded itself</a> from G Suite in late 2020 to reflect the transformation that was happening in organisations all over the world. For many, work is no longer a physical place we go to and valuable interactions with colleagues are now largely happening online.</p>
<p>Google’s vision (through Google Workspace) was to create a highly integrated platform that allows people to spend time on what really matters and foster human connections no matter their location. With consistent updates and additions to their core features, it is clear that Google is succeeding in its mission to solve the unique needs and challenges of a broad range of customers.</p>
<p></p>
 Google Workspace – Simple, Secure, Flexible 
<p>Security has never been more important as our world of work becomes ever more digitised. Unfortunately, this want for security oftentimes has resulted in tools becoming unusable and inflexible. On Google Workspace, however, this is not the case. Google is constantly innovating in order to deliver top level security features that help you create flexible and bespoke Workspaces.</p>
<p>No matter your organisation’s device strategy, Google Workspace provides a world of quick and easy security wins that ensure your data will always be safe and secure. For example, Google Workspace operates on a Chrome browser-first approach, meaning that all work is carried out on the browser. As a result of this, there is no need to download tools or data onto your local device.</p>
<p>This, in turn, eradicates the possibility of downloading viruses onto the device. Moreover, Google Chrome’s sandboxing technique will protect your organisation’s data online. This is a technique in which each tab operates in a restricted, isolated environment. Therefore, if a tab is exposed to malware, the other tabs and the rest of the machine won’t be affected.</p>
<p>And this is just one example. Through the Admin Console, there are quite literally hundreds of security settings that you can customise in order to suit your unique business needs. No business is the same, and Google recognises the importance of providing security features that mould to your organisation and use of the tools, not the other way around as is quite often the case.</p>
<p>So, that’s Google Workspace in a nutshell. We’ve made our case for why we believe it to be a secure and flexible workspace platform that enables effective communication and collaboration – irrespective of device or location. But don’t just take our word for it, let us prove it too. Read on to discover just some of the Google Workspace features that make it such an amazing platform.</p>
 Cobry’s Top 5 Workspace Tips 
 Structure your day with Google Calendar 
<p>Setting daily routines creates structure, increases productivity and helps you reach your goals. Although that is easier said than done, especially when we’re mid pandemic and so far away from what was normal only a few months ago. Google Calendar has some great features that will help you structure your day and work better with your colleagues.</p>
 Working hours 
<p>Within Google Calendars settings, you have the option to specify your working pattern. This includes setting start and finish times as well as days. By setting your working hours, your colleagues will be able to see the days and times that you work, and will know not to book meetings or events with you during these times. Therefore, when you are off duty, you can dedicate your full time to relaxing and doing the things you love.</p>
<p></p>
 Time Zones 
<p>If you have colleagues dispersed over different countries, this is a super handy feature for you. In your calendar, you can display a primary and secondary time zone, as well as up to 5 world clocks. This means you can quickly and easily check your colleagues’ local time and plan meetings or catch ups accordingly.</p>
<p></p>
 Collaborate in real-time with Docs, Sheets and Slides 
<p>Each of Google’s productivity apps provides the opportunity to collaborate and communicate with your teammates quickly and effectively. Using the comments feature in each of these apps, you can discuss the work at hand and assign tasks to one another without ever leaving that tab.</p>
<p>Additionally, suggesting mode allows you to edit pieces of work without changing the original content. Your suggestions will appear in green text alongside the original content and will automatically appear as a comment. This allows you to work through edits as a team and provokes discussion which will result in high quality work.</p>
 Work synchronously with Google Meet 
<p>Despite working in what is becoming an increasingly digital and dispersed world, there really is no substitute for face-to-face communication. Google Meet is a video conferencing solution which gives you the opportunity to work and communicate with your colleagues at the same time. Meet is great for initiating projects, working collaboratively and having valuable discussions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Google Meet offers a range of tools and features to enhance your video experience. For example, you can enable captions in a variety of languages to ensure that everyone on the call can keep up with discussion, as well as audience tools such as polls and Q&amp;A which heighten engagement.</p>
 Chat with Google Chat 
<p>Unfortunately, for just now, stretching across the desk to ask a quick question or spontaneous discussion in the office isn’t possible. Instead, communication with your colleagues is now a much more deliberate and thoughtful process conducted through email or video calls as just discussed. These tend to be clunky and time consuming processes with long response times – not always the best conditions for inspiration.</p>
<p>This is where Google Chat comes in. Google chat is an instant messaging service which provides the potential for informal and spontaneous communication. You can chat to an individual, create group chats or even use rooms to communicate and collaborate with larger teams or in departments. At Cobry, we find using chat is the best way to facilitate quick and off the cuff discussion – some of which, we must admit, is not entirely work related.</p>
<p>What’s more, if these conversations quickly spiral and provoke creativity and inspiration, which is often the case at Cobry, you can start a Google Meet call from chat.</p>
 Stay social with the tools 
<p>It’s not all work here at Cobry! We are a close knit group and whilst we miss our epic ping pong battles in the office, we have ensured that our shenanigans somewhat continue in the virtual world.</p>
<p>Each Monday and Thursday morning we jump on a Google Meet call and spend 30 minutes catching up with the rest of the team. During this half hour discussing work is forbidden and patter (Scottish for banter) is mandatory! This is a great way to keep in touch with everyone and get some valuable social time.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>So, by reading this, we hope that we’ve managed to impart some of the things we love about Google Workspace upon you. At Cobry, we have spent over a decade experiencing and working with all of the amazing features of Google Workspace.</p>
<p>The platform and its tools elevates our working lives and has been the solid foundation on which each and every member of our team has been able to prosper whilst working from home.

 Monday morning used to be pretty hectic. From waking up early to make a cup of coffee and to rush for work, we did all of these in a real fast hurry. 
<p>Things are a bit different now. While those of us lucky to be working are now doing so from a spare bedroom or a kitchen table, the Coronavirus has forced a sudden pivot to working away from the office.</p>
  
<p>While the circumstances are unwelcome, there are some benefits to this style of working. Now we have a more content workforce, a more motivated workforce, and also a more productive and efficient workforce as well. So when the Coronavirus is behind us, will our workday ever be the same again? That’s an important question.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of our time traveling to work and for most, the commute is getting longer all over the world. Globally, two fifths of professionals consider the commute to be the worst part of their day. Commuting has been found to be a major cause for stress that impacts on our physiological health and as well, wellbeing.</p>
<p>The total working day gets longer, one gets less time at home also less exercises. When someone have long commutes then that person cooks less healthy food. Before the pandemic, approximately 25 million U.S. workers spent more than 90 minutes getting to and from their jobs every day. In South Korea, one in four workers has a journey that long.</p>
<p>But research claims our commute can also provide us with a means to separate our personal and professional lives. In a world of 10-second bed-to-laptop commutes, that’s a chance for some ‘me time’. But while journey times were already generally on the up, more of people were actually starting to commute less. It’s due to ‘Flexible working’. Increasingly most people have seen people remote working from lots of different locations.</p>
<p>There has been a reluctance to encourage flexible working, perhaps because managers see it as a loss of control, it can be quite difficult to manage people who you don’t necessarily see on a day-to-day basis. There might be concerns around efficiency or productivity.</p>
<p>What researchers have found is that productivity can actually improve as a result of flexible working. There isn’t necessarily any impact upon the business, if it’s managed effectively. There’s quite a lot of benefits. There is an opportunity for workers to have more autonomy over their scheduling, over when they work and where they work.</p>
<p>When people have that degree of autonomy, it does lead to a workforce that is happier.</p>
<p>A two-year Stanford study of 1,000 employees at one company found that working from a home office resulted in a 13% increase in productivity and 50% of them were less likely to quit. Despite this, half of them still wanted to go back to the office nine months later, even though their average commute was 40 minutes each way.</p>
<p>Another survey conducted by Bain and Company on its own employees, found that productivity increased for some due no commute and an ability to focus better at home, but also decreased for others due to a lack of work mindset and a dedicated workspace.</p>
<p>Our changing relationship with work could affect where we live, too. It could accelerate a move to what’s known in urban planning theory as the ‘polycentric city’. Polycentric city would be a place where you can work, you can live, you can recreate, you can have your social life, your family in a more local and distributed way.</p>
<p>In cities like Paris, it’s known as the 15-minute city, where daily necessities are within a 15-minute reach on foot or by bike. One can reduce transit times, GHG emissions and also one can provide more equitable, more sustainable access to services by this more distributed city model. Companies will need to support workers in that externality and it could take many forms.</p>
<p>Does everyone wanna work from home? No, some people like going to a place, commuting. In soon, we are going to see a whole range of new types of work as people have gained confidence in the efficiency of work from home during this time.</p>
<p>Since the virus outbreak, there are many companies are getting positive results. For example, serviced office brand Regus has already seen a surge of more than 40% in activity in New York City commuter hub southern Connecticut.</p>
<p>In the U.K., house builders are seeing developments outside of London driven by a change in home office working. While experiences and jobs vary all over the world, many workers have come to expect change. More than 90% of people in a recent survey said they wouldn’t return to the office full time after COVID. There are reasons for employers to embrace the change too.</p>
<p>Twitter and Facebook have said the switch could become permanent for large parts of their workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has sent shock waves through the world of work. Having an on-off relationship with the office could make us happier and more productive, while also helping the environment and making our cities more livable.</p>

<p>What has your career journey looked like?</p>



<p>During my 15 year of career, I’ve had opportunities to work for leading firms including Wall Street institutions. My career is shaped by experiences with Aon/Hewitt, Wachovia/Wells Fargo, Fannie Mae, Bank of Tokyo, and Brown Brothers Harriman. I’ve played different roles including Software Engineering, Business Analysis, and Product Owner. Following my passion towards entrepreneurship, bootstrapped blockchain startup vlinder a couple of years ago. It’s been an exciting journey – startup life has given me exponential learning.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>When you were 20 years old, what was your dream job and why?</p>



<p>Technology was gaining significant prominence back then and I wanted to perform a high-tech job (in Silicon Valley) leading to a CIO type role.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>Honestly, I have been lucky not to face any significant barrier through my carrier. Personally, I believe such barriers are in the mind.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>The key is to set family time aside and not think about work during that time. In this connected world, sometimes it is hard to decouple work (e.g. looking at emails, chat channels, linkedIn from smart phone). However, with discipline and drawing the line, balance can be achieved.</p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the digital ID/tech space?</p>



<p>Tech cannot be painted blue or pink. Tech is for the entire population, pick your leader, inspiration, and follow them. If I have to stress a particular point, taking cue from the previous question, good work/life balance can be achieved in Digital ID/Tech space (given that most of the work can be performed remotely).</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Sometimes unconscious bias may exist – it’s important to think objectively and not about why a subset of the population cannot go up the ladder. It’s also important not to pay attention to historical metrics or even how many women are in executive positions in a given organization which is not a reflection of the future that can be achieved.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>I would rather focus on the opportunity ahead of us – enterprises and the world now focus on equality and even have goals on the number of women leaders on the board. Some early indicators linking profitability and number of women leaders on the board are published.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Pursue the dream, strive for excellence, and success will follow.</p>

 Here’s what the next three months look like for BrightID. BrightID Q2 2021&nbsp;Roadmap<p>Let’s go into each of the six milestones in a little more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>🔬 Node discovery. How does a client (for example the BrightID app on your mobile device) know which node in the BrightID network to connect to? After this milestone, clients will be able to find out about other nodes from a small list of hard-coded “seed” nodes. If seed nodes trust other nodes, they’ll be added to the list. Then clients can use a “<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race">promise race</a>” and other data to find the best node to connect&nbsp;to.</p><p>👩‍🔬 Anti-Sybil: Stronger connection types. You may have noticed there are different connection levels in BrightID. Different connection levels create different graphs of users. The goal is to have a verification that uses the very strong “recovery” connection level, which real people only assign to others they trust enough to help guard their BrightID against theft or&nbsp;loss.</p><p>🕵🏽‍♀️ Blind signatures. Currently, BrightID nodes store mappings between anonymous identifiers used by apps and BrightID identifiers so that an app can query about someone’s unique verification using their own identifiers. (BrightIDs are not shared with apps.) While this structure makes it less likely that a data leak could reveal information from one app to another, we can do even better. <a href="https://forum.brightid.org/t/improved-privacy-social-recovery-for-apps-no-need-for-contexts/54">With blind signatures, we can remove this mapping completely</a>. This simplifies the architecture and makes the system even more immune to data&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>📲 Client portability. We’ve already created the necessary features in the node API for a user to install BrightID on multiple devices and backup or recover their BrightID using another device, but would be hard to implement this without an example. We’re going to build a web version of BrightID that supports these features so that others can use it as an example to make their own BrightID&nbsp;clients.</p><p>💉 Anti-Sybil: attack modeling and injection. <a href="https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-AntiSybil">We’ve already created a great platform for modeling sybil attacks and comparing the results of different algorithms or parameters</a>. In some approaches to sybil-resistance in social networks, there is a manual review step, and the algorithm is used to prioritize accounts to review. As a pseudonymous network, BrightID prefers an automated way to define the line between sybil and honest users. We can do this by automatically injecting modeled attacks into the real graph and measuring their rank against previously measured&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>🛡️Node Security. BrightID nodes have already gone through a hardening process, with sensible rate limits in place by default, but we want to take another pass at this. We also want to create <a href="https://stoplight.io/blog/introduction-to-api-testing/#api-producer-contract-testing">API contract tests</a> to make sure our node API and <a href="https://dev.brightid.org/docs/node-api/">reference docs</a> match. We will also audit the use of digital signatures and secure message&nbsp;passing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/brightid/brightid-2021-q2-roadmap-e8585a42c3fc">BrightID 2021 Q2 Roadmap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/brightid">BrightID</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>After about one year of research and development work, the experience linked to the Self Sovereign Identity Essif project of the European Union in the field of anti-money laundering eKYC has been positively concluded.</p>
<p>eSSIF-Lab is an EU-funded project that aims to promote the wide deployment of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) technology as a third generation, open and trusted digital identity solution for faster and safer electronic transactions via blockchain and in real life.</p>
<p>Commerc.io srl participated in the business program created to accelerate SSI-related businesses and solutions. The program included both business and technical support to integrate SSI technology with market proposals. The business focus was on a very important topic: The anti-money laundering also known as KYC/AML</p>
<p>Know Your Customer&nbsp; or KYC is an expression indicating a recognition process used by companies to verify the identity of their customers and assess potential risks or illegal intentions in the relationship with the customer in order to comply with the anti-money laundering regulations that govern these activities.</p>
<p>Commerc.io srl has developed a prototype (Proof of Concept) of an eKYC solution for the issuance of a verifiable credential on an SSI wallet of a Blockchain and CommercioID based on a bank transfer of a supervised bank.</p>
<p>Video of the demo is available at this address https://youtu.be/Y42WtVZ8cdE</p>

<p>The Commission on Enhancing National Cyber Security report from December 1st, 2016 emphasized the importance of securing and growing the digital economy. In line with the recommendations from this document, and in compliance with the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada’s (DIACC) <a href="https://diacc.ca/the-diacc/principles/">10 Canadian Principles of a Digital Identity Ecosystem</a>, SecureKey Technologies entered into a multiphase program with DIACC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) to evaluate, develop, and deliver a solution for enabling distributed privacy enhanced identity ecosystems.</p>



<p>This paper summarizes the work done as part of Phase 3 of the program, concentrating on the “Commercialization of the Verified.Me project,” and building upon the recommendations from the Applied Research completed in Phase 2 which are further described in this <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DIACC_SecureKey_Phase2_White-Paper.pdf">white paper</a>.</p>

 We meet Krista Pawley to find out about her role as a&nbsp; ‘woman in identity’ …. 
<p></p>
 Tell us about yourself and your work as Co-Lead at IdentityNORTH 
<p>We started IdentityNORTH as a small group of 30 people in a conference room and we’ve now grown into a community of over 3000 leaders from all sectors dedicated to working together to build a more innovative, secure, and inclusive digital economy.</p>
<p>What gets me excited about this work is the ability to connect with some of the smartest people in tech, public policy, civil society and business on some of the biggest questions facing our our world.</p>
<p>Over the years that I have been doing this work, I have seen how our conversations have evolved&nbsp; from highly technical discussions focused on IT and workflows to a more user-centric dialogue, focused on people, privacy and leveraging digital Identity.&nbsp; We are much more focused now on how we enable a more inclusive and safe digital economy.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that we have the talent, vision, and community in Canada to lead the world in digital transformation. It’s what gets me up each morning!&nbsp; And I know we can do it in an inclusive, privacy-enhancing way that will benefit all Canadians. The ability to be part of something that makes that kind of positive impact is so exciting to me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I have had the privilege of working at senior levels across government&nbsp; (on and off Parliament Hill),&nbsp; the private sector (financial services, loyalty, and consumer retail sector leading teams in over 50 countries) and the non-profit world (working with a global leader in education and financial inclusion). Five years ago I decided to take what I had learned over the past 20 years and turn my experience, network, and energy towards building communities of action around the big questions that have the potential to drive positive change in Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>Inspired by the leaders and mentors who guided me throughout my career, I worked with communities like IdentityNORTH, SingularityU Canada, the Atlantic Council Geo Tech Centre, and Equitas to build communities of leaders who believe that we have the tools, the technology, and the responsibility to build a better future together.</p>
<blockquote><p>Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation.</p></blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>People like to be asked, and they like to be thanked. A political boss taught me that!</p>
<p>If you are looking to build a community, you need to think about who should be part of that community. Don’t go just for those you already know and who look, sound, and think like you. Invite people from different backgrounds and perspectives. Seek out the different and invite them to be part of the conversation. This is how we grow, how we learn. When people feel included, they are more likely to help you and you are more likely to learn.</p>
<p>Oh, and say thank you. Being grateful and expressing that gratitude shows others that you recognize and appreciate them. It also re-enforces your own sense of appreciation for all that is good and constructive around you. That gratitude can help see you through a lot of challenges.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>If you are looking to grow your business in the digital age, digital identity is a vital enabler of that growth. The Pandemic pushed us forward at least five years in terms of customers’ willingness to adopt and demand secure, trusted, convenient, and user-centric digital services. From e-commerce and on-line banking to healthcare and education, every sector has the potential to be transformed through digitisation. The leaders who recognize this and build tools to enable their organisations to adapt will not only survive; they will thrive.</p>
<p>CEOs and Boards need to STOP looking in the rearview mirror and building strategies and business models that imagine a future that looks like our past. They need to START thinking about the exponential technologies that are transforming our world and think about how these might impact their business and sector. This new way of leading will require both courage and imagination. They need to START seeking out truly diverse perspectives to help them imagine the unimaginable future and plan for it – because chances are what is unimaginable is more likely than many believe.</p>
<p>Lastly, they need to CONTINUE building the critical infrastructure that will enable them to seize these opportunities. Working with organizations like DiACC (Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada), Women in Identity, and IdentityNORTH, leaders have the opportunity to move ahead of the competition. Diverse viewpoints from these extended teams helps with understanding and implementing the critical frameworks and tools that will make a real difference.</p>
<blockquote><p>diverse perspectives help to imagine the unimaginable future</p></blockquote>
 
Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the key to learning. If all we ever hear are the voices of those who look, think, and feel like us, we will fail to learn and grow.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>Warren Berger’s A More Beautiful Question.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many of us have lost our curiosity; we are afraid to ask questions for fear of looking foolish. Berger shows us that the foolish thing is , in fact, to stop asking. That learning, wisdom, and growth come from the courage to ask and stay curious.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Seek out the people you admire and ask them for advice. I was too shy as a teen to do this. When I got older, I learned that many of the people I admired were kind, generous people who were happy to help when approached with a thoughtful, clear request.</p>

<p>Digital Identity NZ is entering a new phase of its journey; our superlative inaugural Chair David Morrison is joined by Ben Tairea as Co-Chair and Tamāra Al-Salim as Deputy Chair.&nbsp; You can read more about Tamāra’s and Ben’s stories below.&nbsp; The trio will lead the governance of the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council</a>&nbsp;as we navigate the next period of rapid change.&nbsp; This is also my last newsletter as Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ.&nbsp; Like David, I took on this role upon the formation of Digital Identity NZ in 2019, and after nearly 2 ½ years it is time to hand over the pleasure and responsibility to someone new.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I reflect on the last 2+ years, an overriding theme is one of interconnectedness, both technically and socially.&nbsp; The premise and promise of digital identity is more seamless and efficient ways of interacting online, whilst at the same time improving privacy, transparency, security and choice (solutions that are truly mana-enhancing).&nbsp; The words of the karakia gifted to us by Janelle Riki-Waaka (kaiwhakahaere/advisor and member of our Executive Council) are apt to the journey we are on:</p>



<p>Unuhia te pō, te pō whiri mārama<br>Tomokia te ao, te ao whatu tāngata<br>Tātai ki runga, tātai ki raro, tātai aho rau<br>Haumi e, hui e, tāiki e!<br>&nbsp;<br>From the confusion comes understanding<br>From understanding comes unity<br>We are interwoven, we are interconnected<br>Together as one!</p>



<p>We start and end all of our Council meetings, webinars and working groups with these words as a reminder of our shared past, present and future.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is much work still to be done as we collectively work on a digital identity ecosystem designed for Aotearoa.&nbsp; This is the work of Government, iwi, innovators, advocates, academics, community groups and businesses of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; My parting challenge to us all is to continue to work in trusted collaboration for the benefit of all people in Aotearoa, and to do so with the core principles of Te Tiriti anchoring the mahi (work); kāwanatanga (honourable governance), rangatiratanga (self determination and agency) and ōretitanga (equity and partnership).</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

While contracting third-party service providers can improve operations, enhance productivity, generate new revenue sources, and reduce costs, commercial vendors introduce a wide range of risks.

 Leverages the Energy Web technology stack, with an initial focus on industrial and home battery&nbsp;storage <p>Brussels, Belgium and Zug, Switzerland — 16 March 2021 — Today<a href="https://www.bebat.be/en"> Bebat</a>, the Belgian battery compliance scheme; <a href="https://over.fluvius.be/nl/thema">Fluvius</a>, the electricity and natural gas distribution system operator (DSO) for the Flemish Region of Belgium; and<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/"> Energy Web</a> jointly announced an open-source solution for decentralized lifecycle battery asset management, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/easybat/">EasyBat</a>.</p><p>Since 2006, the EU’s <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02006L0066-20131230&amp;rid=1'">Battery Directive</a> has required member countries to institute takeback schemes to ensure environmentally responsible recycling and/or disposal of post-consumer batteries. To date, lifecycle asset management for batteries has been cumbersome at best. Before EasyBat, tracking battery assets was essentially non-existent. Currently, in Belgium, the registration of customer-owned assets, such as a home battery, requires a lot of information and burdensome paperwork collection.</p><p>EasyBat aims to greatly simplify that process. The solution is built on the<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/"> Energy Web Decentralized Operating System</a> (EW-DOS) open-source technology stack and focuses on the entire battery lifecycle. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, installers, and accredited inspection and certification organizations issue and verify every relevant asset transaction. The fact that all these entities work together on a shared decentralized ecosystem is an important and never-seen-before innovation.</p><p>“By having created a decentralized digital passport, the entire logistic flow — from put-on-market all the way to reverse logistics for the takeback obligation and waste collection — is digitized on a decentralized digitally trusted ledger,” said Philippe Decrock from Bebat. “This represents a revolutionary, customer-centric solution and affirms a key business case for distributed ledger technology.’”</p><p>In recent years, battery lifecycle management has taken on heightened importance, thanks to the fast-growing adoption of customer-owned distributed energy resources (DERs), including residential batteries and electric vehicles&nbsp;(EVs).</p><p>Just last month, the European Commission<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2312"> announced the first initiative</a> (the EU Battery Regulation) under its Circular Economy Action Plan: making batteries sustainable, high-performing, and safe along their entire life cycle — thus making them consistent with the carbon-neutral ambition of the European Green Deal. This includes minimizing the environmental impact of batteries and repurposing batteries from electric vehicles and industrial batteries so that they can have a second life. The core of this new initiative is the idea of a Battery Digital Passport, which is exactly where the EasyBat solution built on EW-DOS comes into&nbsp;play.</p><p>“We’ve long focused on creating ‘passports’ for assets like batteries. This concept is core not just to our tech stack but to the evolving electricity system around the world. The European Commission’s new initiative on Battery Passports is a strong validation of the concept and sets the stage for market transformation throughout the EU. We’re excited to see it come to life in EasyBat,” said Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer for Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>EasyBat will help Bebat to easily monitor the specific data linked to the legal takeback obligations and/or extended producers responsibility (EPR) of battery manufacturers. They have an obligation to register and report the put-on-market of various batteries (including technical specifications such as chemistry/weight/modules) through the battery’s lifecycle up to the moment of collection at a battery’s end of life. EasyBat makes it possible to holistically manage customer-owned batteries (both private &amp; professional use) participating in Belgian electricity markets — including those on the Fluvius network. EasyBat heavily leverages the open-source EW-DOS technology stack, including EW Switchboard, a new interface for managing decentralized, self-sovereign identities, as well as their associated assets, roles, and permissions.</p><p>Thanks to Switchboard and EW-DOS, customers remain in control of their own identity and the information associated with their assets, such as EV, residential, commercial, and industrial batteries. They create a self-sovereign ‘digital twin’ for any assets, which third-parties such as the manufacturer, installer, and/or DSO can verify. Such a DER Passport — or Battery Passport, in EU Commission parlance — provides a shared state of the asset and its history to any pre-approved energy market participants.</p><p>For example, DSOs like Fluvius and lifecycle management programs like Bebat can monitor batteries throughout their full value chain, from manufacturing to sales to providing energy services such as grid flexibility to secondary re-use (in the case of electric vehicle batteries) to end-of-life disposal (collection, dismantling, and recycling).</p><p>“This approach extends far beyond tracking the history of every DER throughout its lifetime, from manufacturing to operation to end-of-life recycling or decommissioning,” said Bart Coelus of Fluvius. “Creating digital twins of assets, especially DERs at the grid edge, gives grid operators like Fluvius unprecedented visibility into the physical grid they manage. That digital representation of the actual grid will be the core layer of future grid operations. EW Switchboard accelerated our progress on this front, allowing us to move further, faster down the path of digitalization.”</p><p>About Bebat<br>Bebat is a Belgian nonprofit association (vzw) established in 1995 by battery manufacturers — including Duracell, Energizer, Varta and Panasonic — to enable companies to meet the take-back obligation for the Belgian market. Bebat gives new life to used batteries and ranks among the world leaders in the collection of used batteries. Used batteries can be handed in at one of 24,000 collection points, convenient and free of charge. Bebat organises their collection as well as the sorting and recycling process. In 2019 Bebat collected more than 3,600 tons of batteries in Belgium. Over the last five years, Bebat has already collected 10.000 electric vehicle (EV) batteries, which it recycles through the best recycling companies in Belgium and Europe. With the growth of waste industrial batteries, Bebat also measures to make possible repurposing, re-use of waste batteries with still-usable capacity, and responsible end-of-life disposal for spent batteries. Bebat is also part of <a href="https://www.reneos.eu/">Reneos European cooperative</a>, a network of Europe’s top national battery collection systems, including GRS Batterien in Germany, Stibat in the Netherlands, Batteriretur in Norway, and Cobalt in Italy. The Reneos network covers 20 EU countries.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://www.bebat.be/en/homepage">https://www.bebat.be/en/homepage</a>.</p><p>About Fluvius<br>Fluvius is the network operator created on 1 July 2018 by the merger of Eandis and Infrax.

<p>I’m pleased to announce that the OpenID Foundation has <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">published the Financial-grade API (FAPI) Parts 1.0 and 2.0 final specifications</a>. This is a true accomplishment for open banking initiatives worldwide. The Foundation couldn’t have reached this important milestone with the FAPI specification without the leadership of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> led by&nbsp;Chairman Nat Sakimura, Anoop Saxena (Intuit), Dave Tonge (MoneyHub), and a diverse group of experts with the technical chops, persistence and patience for the painstaking work of open&nbsp;technical standards development.</p>
<p>In many respects this is old news. &nbsp;Hundreds of organizations, large and small, from around the&nbsp;world, have for years adopted FAPI in the most&nbsp;important way, they’ve implemented it. &nbsp;They’ve&nbsp;implemented it after&nbsp;publicly self-certifying&nbsp;their&nbsp;conformance. In doing so they’ve confirmed:</p>
 
 FAPI is good for adoption (A standard is only as good as its adoption) 
 FAPI delivers on its promise of reliability, repeatability and security 
 FAPI is being adopted by others 
 
<p>Ultimately FAPI has reached a tipping point in the lifecycle of a standard where there is positive feedback:</p>
 
 A standard is only as good as its adoption 
 A standard’s adoption is driven by its value of the reliability, repeatability and security of its results 
 A standard’s value is measured by the number of instances of certified conformance extant in the market 
 
<p>Few areas of the increasingly noisy, fragmented global ecosystem demonstrate the importance of a standardized, certified approach better than open banking. Despite the potential, many stakeholders are still struggling to&nbsp;keep to open banking rollout schedules more than two years after the UK Open Banking Implementation Entity and PSD2 came into effect. The lack of a standardized security approach is acknowledged as a key factor in this, and one the&nbsp;OpenID Foundation is trying to right through ongoing collaboration with the American, Australian, Brazilian and European colleagues. And if standardization is essential, certification has a critical role to play:</p>
 
 Ensuring implementations’ interoperability and security, while bringing clarity and stability to a complex functional standards environments 
 Helping enforce the secure data exchanges between banks, Fintechs, and schemes to facilitate meeting the&nbsp;complex and changing regulatory requirements 
 
<p>The best way to celebrate the final publication of FAPI 1.0 is to note its <a href="https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor-fase2/">unheralded but important adoption in Brazil</a>. When visiting “Welcome to the Open Banking Brasil Portal developer area”, the references to&nbsp;Financial-grade API (FAPI) are clear even without the English translation. And there are indications of FAPI adoption in Bahrain and the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>But our collective efforts lack a home. Whether in an OIDF, FDX, Berlin Group or STET Group container there is no single,&nbsp;trusted place where anyone, at any time, at no cost can&nbsp;reliably find an&nbsp;authoritative&nbsp;listing of all open&nbsp;finance technical&nbsp;standards.&nbsp;Simply described we need a database, an online library of libraries, of all the technical standards in the open finance ecosystem. While simply described, it is not without challenges. While modest, it solves a burning&nbsp;business problem and one that requires a solution that best comes from an international collaboration of organizations, perhaps beginning with the OpenID Foundation.</p>

<p>President Biden’s ability to rebuild alliances, restore America’s standing in the world and unite the nation hinges on his ability to reign in tech giants here at&nbsp;home</p><p>By Gus Rossi, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>President Biden’s pledge to restore diplomacy as the United States’ primary instrument of foreign policy is an important and necessary shift away from his predecessor’s destructive America First approach that shunned multilateralism and jeopardized relationships with important allies.</p><p>But diplomacy alone is not a cure-all for America’s diminished standing abroad. To regain the trust of our allies and the American people, the Biden administration must wrest control of international affairs from American technology giants and into the hands of US citizens.</p><p>For decades, America’s foreign and digital trade policies had been guided by the notion that whatever Silicon Valley wanted was good for America — and for the world. That naive assumption is finally giving way to the recognition that unregulated and unaccountable tech giants pose great and literal danger for public safety, democracy, and competitive markets.</p><p>President Biden now has an opportunity to act against these&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The hands-off approach began in an era when the internet promised a free flow of information and ideas around the world. Technology, many believed, brought down autocracies in the Arab Spring with tweets instead of bombs. By unlocking social media’s organizing and mobilizing power, Barack Obama became America’s first Black president.</p><p>Democrats, including the Obama administration, were enamored by the tech industry. It helped that many tech leaders supported the administration’s priorities and gave generously to support those progressive causes. Inevitably, this love affair shaped Democrats’ digital foreign and trade&nbsp;policy.</p><p>But Big Tech has long enjoyed a cozy relationship with the executive branch, regardless of which party occupies the White&nbsp;House.</p><p>Silicon Valley has for decades pressured the US to limit the role of the International Telecommunication Union (the U.N. body tasked with setting internet, telecom, and other technical standards) so that tech companies can operate with as few regulations as possible.</p><p>In the early 2010s, the US Embassy to the E.U. lobbied on behalf of Silicon Valley against Europe’s privacy laws and promoted the APEC privacy framework, an alternative that was both toothless and&nbsp;weak.</p><p>When negotiating trade agreements, the US Trade Representative tried to include the Communications Decency Act (CDA) third-party liability shield that enables tech platforms to profit from disinformation and hate&nbsp;speech.</p><p>Both the Obama and Trump administrations consistently fought European efforts to tax tech companies.</p><p>By doing Big Tech’s bidding, US policies left consumers — and our national interest — vulnerable. The result is waning US influence across the globe and a fraying democracy at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Abroad, the EU has become the de-facto regulator of the tech economy with the 2014 adoption of its data and privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It has since threatened to ban American companies from moving data across the Atlantic because the US does not offer guarantees for Europeans’ data. China has also seized the opportunity and is promoting its technology to manage our ally’s critical telecom infrastructure. Meanwhile, Chinese social media companies are collecting reams of American and European personal data through social media platforms.</p><p>Stateside, organized online and in plain sight across a variety of internet platforms, the failed insurrection at the Capitol was only the latest, most shocking example of Big Tech’s perverse incentive to promote disinformation and radicalization, suppress innovation, monopolize markets and other anti-democratic activities.</p><p>Fortunately, there signs that the love affair between Democrats and Big Tech is disintegrating:</p><p>Last year, dozens of Democratic state attorneys general brought antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Facebook of being complicit in adding disinformation to the public debate. California, the heavily Democratic home to Silicon Valley, adopted a second landmark privacy law. The House Antitrust Subcommittee subpoenaed thousands of documents from tech titans, grilled CEOs at hearings, and published a report that outlines how to make digital markets competitive. And many Democratic members of Congress are actively considering bills to curtail the power of tech platforms.</p><p>Now, President Biden can both strengthen US democracy and rebuild relationship with allies by making substantial updates to America’s digital foreign policy including:</p><p>· Collaborate with the EU’s to develop and promote a framework for democratic governance of the tech economy, pro-competitive rules, and accountability principles.</p><p>· End trade agreements that make it harder for third countries to hold platforms responsible for promoting disinformation and hate speech. The CDA should not be exported.</p><p>· Protect transatlantic data flows and consumer data with an international agreement that commits the US to a privacy framework compatible and equivalent to Europe’s.</p><p>· Update global corporate tax rules for online companies to avoid a costly balkanization of taxation to American companies and allow third countries to collect a fair amount of taxes from the profit that companies make&nbsp;abroad.</p><p>· Diversify the State Department’s delegations to international institutions by offering travel stipends to independent academics and civil society experts to ensure corporate interests are not the only ones represented.</p><p>How we approach diplomacy abroad should reflect our values and interests at home. More than ever the world needs to hear that America and President Biden believe in the democratic governance and regulation of the tech economy for the public’s interest, not Silicon Valley.

		 Change or Be The Change 
<p>More clearly than before, we are seeing the recent pandemic as a catalyst and accelerator for Digital Transformation, or Dx as the term is now designated. As many higher education institutions have been on a Dx trajectory, there is now no denying that higher education’s future is digital. According to Pearson’s 2015 student mobile device survey1, 42% of college students at that time were using two or more Internet of Things (IoT) devices on any given school day. In the past six years the vast and accelerating proliferation of mobile devices on campuses now indicates that over 11.5 billion devices are exchanging data globally. The collective impact of this phenomena on how students live, work, and learn, combined with the consumerism of education and related motivations and drivers for selecting a particular higher education institution to attend, creates a survival condition across the spectrum of education that can only be met by Dx.</p>
<p>Whereas institutional leaders previously looked at information technology as a necessary cost center, the view of technology and its role in Dx is taking on a vastly different context today.&nbsp; In implementation and practice, Dx is not just about technology and “digitization” or “digitalization”, where digitization involves the transform of analog information, and digitalization involves processes. Dx is vastly more complicated and challenging, but done well results in a higher education institution that grows and thrives in today’s hyper-connected and automated world. In 2020, Educause defined Dx as “a series of deep and coordinated culture, workforce, and technology shifts that enable new educational and operating models and transform an institution’s operations, strategic directions, and value proposition.”2</p>
<p>Success with Dx efforts can have multiple barriers including lack of trained leadership in organizational change management, missing internal skill sets in business process modeling and notational form, gaps in systems thinking at an enterprise level, legacy models involving data silos, or undefined or conflicting business rules.3 The foundation for success in Dx does not involve technology as the ultimate determinant as technology, in and of itself, does not have inherent value; how institutions apply technology as an enabler of mission success is the determinant. Moreover, in today’s cloud environments, Dx transcends internal campus requirements to include network and cyber infrastructure that fully supports current and future needs and changes in information technology architectures. The importance of a defined ecology for the student lifecycle, mapped to and informed by networks and technology, has never been more pronounced.</p>

		<p>Higher education institutions cannot afford to ignore Dx as a critical success factor. Dx is primarily concerned with the student experience, thus the importance of a defined student lifecycle ecosystem. In a recent report4, Educause noted that student success and experience was a primary motivating factor behind a majority of Dx initiatives. Six out of seven of the key drivers for Dx involved student success, and 87% of institutional respondents in their survey identified “improving the student experience” as the main driver behind institutional planning and investment in Dx. The roadmap to success with Dx is complex and difficult to achieve. There is no “silver bullet” application or technology architectural configuration that will facilitate the required transformational change. Elements of digitization and digitalization, as previously defined, are a good starting point, but without a comprehensive road map that includes strategy and planning for comprehensive and phased tectonic shifts in institutional culture, workflows, and infrastructure that enable new methods of operation and teaching and learning, most institutions will not achieve sustainable growth and financial health.</p>
<p>Key takeaways from the Dx discussion include: 1) an increasing number of higher education institutions are concerned with and engaging in Dx initiatives; 2) Dx can bring to the institution a renewed sense of optimisim about the future; 3) awareness and keen understanding of Dx most often does not reside in campus IT organizations or any collection of campus operations; 4) the impact of a successful Dx initiative has been demonstrated across a variety of college and university sectors; and 5) the two greatest barriers to success are generally reluctance to cultural change and expense. The case may well be that institutions have two choices with respect to Dx, they can change or they can be the change. Leading pre-COVID prognosticators in higher education point out that “institutions survive the challenges they face and flourish because they had a compelling vision, the ability to recognize and adapt to changing circumstances, and strong, effective leadership. With these elements, any institution can do wonderful things. Without it, institutions in any industry are doomed. Colleges and universities have demonstrated that they have a history of adapting to changing circumstances amid difficult times.”5 Now may very well be those times.</p>

<p>Contributions made by members of the DIACC’s Outreach Expert Committee</p>



<p>One of the nicest things about this pandemic is wearing our sweatpants all day, every day, while working. Right? Wouldn’t it be nice to wear sweatpants to the office, when this is all over?&nbsp;Sure, but that’s unlikely, at least if we want to keep our jobs.&nbsp;So, we choose to forgo our private sweatpants rights, to keep our more public jobs.&nbsp;Privacy and how we protect it has never been more important in our daily lives.&nbsp;Yet, a balance is necessary, between privacy and security, in our ever increasingly digital lives.&nbsp;With that, there is a rather public debate about privacy and the ethical use of biometrics.&nbsp;In particular, face biometrics can be misunderstood and feared with respect to our Right to Privacy.&nbsp;This article is an attempt to create a better understanding of it and, hopefully, reduce fear of such a promising and effective technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our use of biometrics enables our safety. At its most basic level, a biometric is a physiological trait or attribute that is unique to an individual person. When we recognize the faces of our loved ones, friends, and colleagues with our own eyes, we are using biometrics to help us build relationships and trust. Biometrics are, in a way, fundamental to human interaction and society.&nbsp;Today, biometrics can be used in person or automated, to increase convenience and security in various situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many types of biometrics that we use daily.&nbsp;Face images are, by far, the most common.&nbsp;Any time somebody requests to see our driver’s license, passport, or ID badge, we are using biometrics.&nbsp;Most governments include face biometrics, in the form of a photograph, in their driver’s license, passport, or other national ID databases, as well as on the credential, itself.&nbsp;We use face biometrics, attached to a credential, to establish trust, when we access privileges, like driving a car, government services, commercial air travel and even buying liquor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today there is some confusion and fear about biometrics, what they are, and what they can actually do. There are only two basic functions that a biometric can perform, Identification and Authentication. When we first meet somebody, we may associate their name with their face. When we see that face we can identify that person by accessing the information in our mind. “Hi, I’m Jennifer” associates a name to face and allows us to identify them. When we arrive at a restaurant, we might scan customers to see if we recognize any of them. We identify Jennifer by recognizing their face in the crowd of people. In another instance, we can authenticate Jennifer by recalling information about them when presented with their face. If Jennifer were to knock on our front door, we can authenticate them with our own simple sight. Fundamentally these are the only two functions of a biometric. A properly designed face biometric system should include high confidence liveness checks, to differentiate between a real human face and a photo (for example) and face matching, in order to prove that a person is in fact who they claim to be. Stay tuned for our next blog where we’ll talk about liveness checks, anti-spoofing, and other methods to prevent various types of fraud.</p>



<p>In this age of information hyperbole, perhaps it’s understandable that there is some public misunderstanding of how these important technologies can and should be used.&nbsp;Big Brother surveillance and Privacy are central to debates about the ethical use of face biometrics.&nbsp;However, when examined thoroughly, we find that most, if not all of the ethical debate centers on how the biometrics are used and, more specifically, whether the biometric is used Voluntarily or Involuntarily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We tend to prefer freedom of choice, with our personal privacy.&nbsp;Sometimes we guard it.&nbsp;Other times, we agree to forgo some privacy, to access and enjoy many privileges of our society.&nbsp;For example, when applying for a credit card loan, the bank logically prefers to understand whether or not we are likely to repay the loan.&nbsp;To control its fraud and compliance risk, it requires knowing who it’s lending to and whether we are an existing customer, or potential fraudster, posing as a customer.&nbsp;So, we volunteer to divulge our private identities and backgrounds.&nbsp;We also allow the bank to compare our identity to those of existing customers, to learn if we are an existing customer or a fraudulent account holder at the bank.&nbsp;The bank Identifies us as a new customer (or not), as well as a legitimate customer (or not).&nbsp;It’s our choice to participate in this identification process, or not.&nbsp;It’s voluntary.&nbsp;If we agree, once we are approved, the bank requires us to Authenticate ourselves, every time we try to access the valuable privilege. In this case, we voluntarily relinquish our privacy Right, to get something of value in return.&nbsp;Moreover, the process includes both Identification and Authentication in a safe, productive and ethical way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in some cases, the privilege we want to enjoy is so valuable (granting it is so risky) that the service provider may be tempted to invade our privacy, without our consent, to protect it.&nbsp;Of course, there are some bad people out there.&nbsp;The problem is that we can’t tell who is good and who is bad, unless we specifically identify them all.&nbsp;To this end, law enforcement may wish to investigate and identify everyone within a certain group, like those walking down the street.&nbsp;The City of London, England, for example, installed CCTV cameras on most city street corners, to survey walkers-by for criminal activity.&nbsp;Moreover, the CCTV system was equipped with biometric facial recognition technology, to learn if any passers-by were in the criminal mugshot database.&nbsp;The City used Involuntary face recognition surveillance to Identify anyone in the field of view.&nbsp;Innocent passers-by had no choice but to submit to such a surveillance investigation and many view this as a clear violation of privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to any tool, there is nothing inherently ethical or unethical about face biometrics, however these tools must be used responsibly.&nbsp;In a voluntary scenario, both Identification and Authentication can be important functions when used to protect our privacy and enable privileges that could not be offered without the presence of a human authentication method. This can help break down barriers to accessing government services or performing international business (by using authentication to reduce instances of fraud) or even protecting your own assets by granting access to your files via authentication of your unique profile. However in an involuntary scenario, potentially unethical&nbsp;scenarios exist that require deep conversations and eventually regulation about the balance between safety and privacy.</p>



<p>Understanding the difference between Voluntary and Involuntary facial recognition is a foundational issue that is helping us set the boundaries for the ethical use of biometrics by both governments and businesses. How that data is stored and used are all tied into this same problem. While there is nothing inherently ethical nor unethical about face biometrics, understanding and regulating its acceptable use is an important step to building public confidence in this trust enabling tool.</p>

 With necessity being the mother of invention, an <a href="https://summit.digitalscot.live/talks/covid-19-technology-innovations/">upcoming webinar</a> will explore the technology innovations being pioneered in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and what potential for Scottish ventures this presents. 
 Vaccination Passports 
<p>A flagship use case is ‘Vaccination Passports’.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/21/1015353/covid-vaccine-passport-digital-immunity-record/">MIT asks</a> if you will have to carry this on your phone, where it might function like an actual passport, being shown as you arrive at airports, and could also act like a work authorization at your job, or a pass to get into restaurants, bars, and shopping malls.</p>
<p>Highlighting the type of issues that need addressed such as a <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/travelers-using-counterfeit-covid-test-results">booming black market</a> in fake test results that is diminishing trust in printed records and driving demand for cheat-proof digital documents, they define the medical and technology challenges and nature of this opportunity:</p>
<p>“There are a lot of players in the field, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson-health/health-pass-puts-privacy-first/">IBM</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">the Commons Project</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a>. </p>
<p>They’re coming at the problem from different angles but are ultimately chasing the same goal: let people share required information about their health, while protecting other private information. Yet it’s still too early to rely on any of these for a fast and widespread solution.”</p>
<p>Many governments, as well as airlines and other businesses are trialing or in talks to build “health pass” apps, which let users ask participating labs and health systems to send authenticated test results and other data straight to the app, bypassing verification concerns.</p>
 Scotland’s Opportunity – A Digital Healthcare Ecosystem 
<p>To begin zeroing in on the specific opportunity for Scotland, we can first identify the core technology challenge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Connecting any systems across borders means navigating a patchwork of languages, databases, and privacy laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights the work of Scotland’s <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/about/">NDS team</a>, who are building the ‘National Digital Platform’, the technical architecture which ensures that key things are only done in one way across Scotland such as how people are identified and where clinical data is stored.</p>
<p>As they explain <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/blog/the-national-clinical-data-store/">here</a>, their National Clinical Data Store (NCDS) is storing vaccinations data and being made accessible to healthcare staff, via their <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/42708/turas-vaccination-management-tool">VMT app</a>.</p>
<p>“Under the bonnet, the VMT sends copies of the records of immunisations to the&nbsp;NCDS. For those that may be interested, this is achieved using a “FHIR API” based on the&nbsp;<a title="Opens new window" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core">UK FHIR Core</a>&nbsp;Immunisation Profile. A FHIR API is essentially an industry standard way of sharing digital health data.&nbsp;The&nbsp;NCDS can then&nbsp;securely share citizens’ immunisation history records to other services, again using a FHIR API.”</p>
<p>As we’ll explore in the upcoming and future webinars, Scotland’s opportunity is to build upon this core innovation through a collaborating community, a Digital Healthcare Ecosystem, to flesh it out in multiple directions including ways to expand user uptake and to enable new scenarios for how users interact with and update data.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant when we consider the broader context of Scotland’s overall digital agenda. In their just released digital strategy, the Scottish Government describes a key objective of:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Adopt a common approach to online identity where personal data is controlled by the individual.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll explore how this type of personal data ecosystem can be pioneered in Scotland, with key drivers being a national technology platform equipped to deliver highly effective solutions for tackling crisis situations like Covid-19.</p>
<p>This is a flagship example of the global potential for ‘GovTech’ accelerator programs – Building local solutions in response to needs that are common across the world, creating the intellectual assets that can underpin massive worldwide growth for Scotland’s tech sector.</p>

<p>One of the key principles of DIDAS is that we help experts coming from various industries and professions to work together, learn from each other and bring new ideas on how to apply SSI technology in real world.</p>
<p>To make it happen, we encourage our members to propose topics and explore ideas in dedicated working groups.&nbsp; Working Groups allow us to agree on the goals that the experts will pursue jointly,&nbsp; structure the work and define the results. After all, we want to see SSI become a reality in Switzerland!</p>
<p>We are very happy that more than 15 experts got together to kick off our Onboarding Working Group. This group grew out of the idea that many different activities today require sharing of verifiable information – personal identity, company registration, tax identifiers, addresses, and so on and so forth.<br>
In Switzerland, Financial sector is very strong and so a lot of innovation happens around Fintech.&nbsp; Our original idea, therefore, was to focus on Fintech use-cases around onboarding, KYC and AML processing and similar activities.</p>
<p>As we started to explore these ideas in depth during the session, we understood that not only Fintech, but other Industries ( e.g. Insurance, B2B Supplier onboarding, etc) can benefit strongly from an ability to securely exchange identity and registration data using Verifiable Credentials, which are easy to maintain in the future, including automated invalidation of credentials that were recalled by their issuers.</p>
<p>It is also clear that various use-cases depend on the existing legislation and might be difficult to implement in today’s legal environment.<br>
In recognition of this fact, the group has agreed to catalog various use-cases, examine their legal implications and requirements, explore whether or not it is possible to find solutions and approaches that are compatible with the today’s set of laws, plan technical PoCs and implementations.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Swiss lawyers are among the most creative professionals in the world and are enthusiastic about opportunities to find improvements in the legal system that are required to make Switzerland the best and the most innovative country to do business. The recent legislation on Blockchain Assets in Switzerland is a great demonstration of that fact.<br>
Even in the case that some SSI onboarding use-cases might be difficult to implement within the limits of the current legislation, the group will identify the needed improvements and&nbsp; work with the lawmakers, regulators and politicians to develop and promote the required changes.</p>
<p>This is one of the core missions of DIDAS –&nbsp; drive Thought Leadership and remove barriers to implementation of SSI and Verifiable Claims technology&nbsp;in Switzerland.</p>
<p>If you are interested and want to bring your technical, business, legal and/or creative skills and ideas into the effort, even if you know nothing about the SSI yet, we are looking for you!</p>

<p>ebCore TC's latest specification ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that ebXML Messaging Protocol Binding for RegRep Version 1.0 from the OASIS ebXML Core (ebCore) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) is a family of standards developed through a joint initiative of OASIS and the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). Five of these ebXML standards, including Collaboration Protocol Profile and Agreement, have been approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as the ISO 15000 standard. ebXML provides an open, XML-based infrastructure that enables the global use of electronic business information in an interoperable, secure, and consistent manner by all trading partners.</p>



<p>The ebXML Messaging Protocol Binding for RegRep v1.0 specifies a messaging protocol binding for the Registry Services of the OASIS ebXML RegRep Version 4.0 OASIS Standard. This binding is compatible with both the versions 2.0 and 3.0 of ebMS as well as the AS4 profile and complements the existing protocol bindings specified in OASIS RegRep Version 4.0.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>

 Q&amp;A explores threat actors, early detection, and content moderation Oumou Ly interviews Lisa Kaplan for the latest episode of The Breakdown from the Berkman Klein&nbsp;Center.<p>From 2016 to 2020, research, civil society organizing efforts, industry planning, and national security responses to disinformation centered on the issue from the perspective that malign influence was propagated almost exclusively by foreign adversaries. This thinking was upended to a large extent in 2020 when disinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the presidential election, and other sustained-attention information events exposed the severity of the threat posed by domestic disinformation.</p><p>In this episode of the Breakdown, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly</a> is joined by Lisa Kaplan to further unpack what accounts for the shift in focus, whether stakeholders might consider adjusting mitigations already deployed to combat disinformation, and assess how current organizing around the disinformation problem can be reevaluated and repurposed to suit new challenges.</p><p>Read the transcript, which is lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou, I’m a fellow on the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/research/assembly">Assembly: Disinformation</a> Program. I am recording today from California, and that is why my background doesn’t appear the way it normally does, but I am excited nonetheless to be joined by Lisa Kaplan of the Alethea Group. Lisa founded the Alethea Group to help organizations navigate the new digital reality and protect themselves against disinformation. Thank you for joining us, Lisa. I’m so excited to have a conversation with you about this and many, many other pertinent issues.</p><p>Lisa Kaplan (LK): Thanks so much for having me, excited to be&nbsp;here.</p><p>OL: Yes. So our conversation today centers on a really, really big topic in the disinformation space, and that is the shift in focus among a bunch of different stakeholder groups, including the national security community, academics, civil society, and others, in focusing on disinformation from a national security/foreign policy geopolitics perspective. Can you give us a little taste of your background and talk about what compelled you to found the Alethea&nbsp;Group?</p><p>LK: So I started the Alethea Group in 2019. And prior to that, I was the digital director on a 2018 Senate campaign.</p><p>One of the things about disinformation that I always like to remind people is that it’s not always a foreign government and it’s not always people who are seeking necessarily geopolitical ends. The goals for threat actors really do vary depending on the threat actor. And that’s one of the reasons why the hard work, the attribution that we do at Alethea Group is so important. But it does depend on who the actor is and what their motive is. And once you know that, you can infer what their goal may be and it can help to mitigate a situation before it even starts or we use [it] to mitigate a situation that’s elevated into more of a crisis situation.</p><p>So I was working for Senator Angus King and because he was running against a Democrat and a Republican, we were looking at disinformation narratives from both sides, not necessarily doing the work of attribution, but because we were a campaign, we had limited resources, trying to understand what the narratives were that were out there. And what we realized is the disinformation, it was targeting candidates, it was targeting issues, but at the end of the day, it’s really targeting voters, us as people. And when you think about it as an election context, it’s really straightforward. It’s trying to influence people’s decisions around when, where, and who to vote for. You know targeting those decision points. Are you going to vote? And then if so, for whom are you gonna cast your&nbsp;ballot?</p><p>However, disinformation, it’s not an issue that’s limited to just elections and especially for sophisticated actors. So think foreign adversaries, think for-profit disinformation networks who have built up influence to then sell to the highest bidder or are building up influence to be able to generate ad revenue through clicks, for example. They’re not just talking about one election or one candidate, they’re talking about a variety of different issues. And so I say that because for us, and it’s the proliferation of this, the number of threat actors since 2016 has been exponential. What started as being primarily Russian, we now have, according to Oxford, over 80 countries who are actively engaging in social media manipulation, and that doesn’t even account for all of the individuals who have stood up their own operations. We also see both sides of the aisle to be clear, political consultants engaging in similar behaviors as on social media manipulation tactics. So it really comes down to who is the actor and what is the goal. Now fast forward. One of the things that we saw, unfortunately, and it’s very unfortunate that it took essentially an insurrection attempt at the US Capitol to really catapult this conversation.</p><p>And there are a variety of research organizations including ours that had been beating this drum for several years now. And so people were saying, oh, it’s just a meme, but no, it can really, you know, disinformation really can lead to offline harms. And we know that. We’ve seen that with Pizzagate, We’ve seen that with different events such as the LA Dodgers stadium being shut&nbsp;down.</p><p>So we are seeing more and more offline action happening as a result of disinformation. I think one of the things about what happened at the US Capitol, is it’s a really important case study. And I say that, and I know it sounds clinical but because what happened was obviously a horrible day for our democracy. And I think it affected the research community in a variety of different ways. That was a very tough month for everyone. So I don’t wanna sound overly clinical about it, but in a lot of ways, there are a lot of lessons that can be learned. So for example, we can draw a straight line from some of the narratives that were happening in March saying that the election would be rigged, that there would be political violence, that people needed to start preparing for the worst, to what happened on January 6th. One of the good things to come out of January 6th, though, is that most people get a second chance. Not everybody, obviously there’s a Capitol police officer who died in the line of duty protecting the Capitol, but we’re able to really learn from this moment and move forward so that we’re addressing this threat in a way that does make it so that we’re able to identify these online threats and prevent them from becoming offline&nbsp;harm.</p><p>OL: Thank you for that summation of not only what happened on January 6th but for illustrating that you can draw a through-line between the initial Stop the Steal on narratives and organizing to what ended up happening on the 6th. And what I think is also projected to continue this week on the 4th. Can you talk a little bit about your practice at Alethea Group and how you help organizations navigate through this new digital environment?</p><p>LK: So at Alethea Group, what we do is we detect instances of disinformation, misinformation, and social media manipulation, as well as track other types of online harm such as targeted harassment to be able to help individuals figure out how to navigate this new digital reality. I think that a lot of times people don’t realize how many options they actually have. So for example, if you’re able to detect what a lot of people are doing right now is they’re analyzing something once it’s already gotten onto Twitter, onto Facebook, onto YouTube, for example, and it’s on one of these mainstream platforms and they call the social media platforms and they say, please take it down. That’s one option. But if you’ve gotten to that point, in a lot of ways it may already be too late. So what we do is we practice early detection. So we catch narratives when they start and we’re able to then track them and understand how they may be influencing individuals and seeking to change individual’s behavior. We analyze on the network level. And what that does is it enables us to take more&nbsp;options.</p><p>So for example, let’s take these for-profit disinformation networks. Well, you know, if they’re making a profit off of a potential organization, there could be an opportunity to seek damages. If they’re misappropriating intellectual property such as your name, your likeness, trademarkable or patentable, or copyrighted material, there are legal options that organizations can take to seek recourse. And if there is an opportunity to do counter-messaging, and I’m not talking about fact-checking and our experience fact-checking, while it’s helpful in creating a paper of record or it’s helpful in giving something to point to, to set the story straight, it’s not sufficient. And here’s why. The people who are choosing to believe in a narrative aren’t necessarily going to believe something salacious about — change their mind — and say they no longer believe something that’s totally salacious about you and confirms their biases about you just because you’re the one that said it isn’t true. So we’re talking about really counter-narrative building. And that can be done in an ethical way by creating a greater understanding around an individual or an organization. So what we do is we help through the entire process. So we detect what’s happening, we assess whether or not it’s having an impact on an organization’s goal. And then we help to mitigate any potential impacts, the idea being that we can solve a lot of problems before they become a real issue or a challenge for an organization.</p><p>OL: Along with the expansion of the threat landscape, there has been sort of an uptick in sustained information events, like the COVID pandemic, like Stop the Steal, and just a lot of that, not just disinformation, but chatter around the election. Are there other structural developments or other factors that you attribute to the expansion of the threat landscape and the shifts that you know the shift in focus from foreign disinformation to domestic?</p><p>LK: Yeah. I think one of the things about disinformation and, you know, there was conversation around how this was gonna happen after 2016 because it’s fast, cheap, and easy to do. If you know how to run a good marketing campaign, you can probably figure out how to run a disinformation campaign. And so with that, and then you also look historically, open-source estimates say that the Russian inner attempt to influence the 2016 election cost a million dollars, which is a rounding error to most large organizations or federal governments. So it wasn’t a question of if other organizations were going to start engaging in these tactics, it was a question of when. And I think what we’ve seen is the proliferation of that. It’s the proliferation of the number of threat actors that’s causing an increased number of threats when it comes to the disinformation landscape.</p><p>So going to the COVID-19 pandemic, and these narratives have shifted over time and they vary again, based on the threat actor. So one thing we saw, and again this is all open-source, just Russian state media. You know we did see Russian state media pushing race narratives targeting different communities and trying to pit them against each other. We saw RT put out content that was more focused on, you know, “what’s the big deal with calling it the China virus,” for example, “we called it the Spanish flu.” And RT typically targets one audience. And then we saw it in the NOW, which is, typically targeting younger audiences on Instagram with videos being like, “if you are Asian, you will get attacked in New York City.” And it’s not to say that people haven’t experienced those sorts of attacks. And, you know, as a result of disinformation, going back to the online to offline action, and I don’t wanna make it sound like it’s just the Russian government because there are definitely other actors who are playing in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>But it is I think just providing more opportunities from that perspective. And then, similarly, there’s the financial motivations and the financial perspective. So we’ll see some of these junk domains pushing false information about the pandemic and they’re doing so because they are likely to generate a profit. They have advertising revenue that they’re getting from clicks. So I think it really does depend on who the actor is as to why they’re pushing it, but because it’s so cheap, easy, and potentially lucrative to do as well as it works from a geopolitical perspective. So, and if it’s cheap, why not try it? There’s not really a high cost to people who are executing these sorts of campaigns.</p><p>OL: Not at all. And I would just echo what you said by pointing out that it’s been so interesting that since 2016, you know our own elected leaders see value in exploiting the sort of fissures in society that we have and exploiting them for their own political gain. And as you mentioned, this happens both on the right and on the left. I wanna shift gears and talk about some of the specific mitigations.</p><p>So one of the most significant impediments to legislating on disinformation and engaging on it from a policy or regulatory perspective is that moderation is often criticized as being a brush up against the First Amendment. What is your thinking around how regulation can encourage effective moderation without brushing up against those First Amendment concerns? And then I guess also more broadly, what is your thinking around what the government’s role should be in addressing domestic disinformation?</p><p>LK: Well, I do appreciate and admire a lot of our colleagues in this space who are putting out really important research that can inform eventual legislation. Where I see the opportunity for more immediate action is actually through other means such as our judicial system. And I’ll get to that in a second. When it comes to the First Amendment, that’s an argument that I just don’t really buy. We accept limits to speech in real life. I can’t yell fire in a movie theater — like there will be consequences for me. We’ve accepted that there are some limits on speech in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>And so I think we should be reframing this question to say, how can we make the online conversation more reflective of the conversations that we have offline? I think one of the things that’s become really clear in the pandemic when we’ve all been forced inside and online to a degree is, that that’s not where we’re at right now but there’s no reason why that’s not where we can be. I think what we need to be talking about too, though, is when it comes to content moderation, I don’t think that that necessarily removes the threat altogether. For example, we saw a lot of accounts be deplatformed for breaking the terms of service multiple times. And again, I think that’s a perfectly acceptable consequence. It’s kinda like the “no shirt, no shoes no service” version of social media platforms. It’s like, if you break the rules on multiple occasions you’re not gonna be allowed back in. But where I think we need to be headed and where I think we’re going to see the most progress in the immediate, is enforcing some of the laws that are already on the&nbsp;books.</p><p>So for example the Dominion lawsuit that’s ongoing right now is something that I’m paying attention to. I think that that is a potential avenue. We’ve also seen some successes when it comes to copyright infringements because bad guys aren’t really paying attention to following the laws if they’re spinning up disinformation campaigns. So I think that we can potentially anticipate some actions taken there. I think that the other thing that has been interesting to watch unfold is, the Stop Hate for Profit sort of activism. I think that that is potentially having an impact as well. So all that said, I don’t see this as a speech-only issue. I think that there are very serious concerns especially when we’re thinking about the world outside of the United States and the Western liberal order where sometimes social media is how you evade censorship. And so these are really tough challenges and there are no easy solutions. And I think having these conversations and debates is hugely important because if this were an easy fix, it would be solved by now. But I am confident that this is something that we will begin to see, and we’ve seen progress since 2016 to be fair. But we will continue to see progress. We will continue to see solutions proposed and implemented.</p><p>OL: You had mentioned earlier that you have observed that fact-checking is not necessarily the most effective way to clamp down on some of the bad and false information we see circulating online and certainly not enough to interrupt the cementing of alternate realities that really disinformation is intended to&nbsp;foster.</p><p>LK: Yeah. So I think that fact-checking definitely plays a role but I don’t think it’s something that can be done alone. I think, you know, labeling that sort of thing. These are relatively new features. And so, well, how effective they are — that’s a little bit outside of my purview. And I look forward to reading somebody’s research someday that did a longitudinal study on how effective labels were on any given social media user. But I do think we need to start thinking about this challenge more holistically than we currently are, right? So for example, it’s not just what’s happening on social media platforms, it’s also what’s happening on blogs. It’s how some of these disinformation networks are being financed. It’s through advertising revenue, it’s through, frankly, people who are building influence and then turning around and selling it for profit. Those are all things that I think we can incorporate into part of the solution when we’re trying to figure out, how do we put out the fire that’s happening right&nbsp;now?</p><p>I think when we look towards long-term solutions to figure out, what is it that we can do to really change the equation to make it so that disinformation is not as successful as it is now? There’s all kinds of things we can do but I keep coming back to education. If every single person knew what we knew and likely what everybody who’s listened to these podcasts knew, we’d be in a lot better shape. So how do we make it so that we’re not so special anymore? How do we make it so that the general population is more resilient to disinflation? And a lot of that has to do with education. So when I was in high school we used to do these things where we would basically learn how to read a news article. We would learn how to read a newspaper based on, you know what page was the article on in the newspaper for relative importance. What paper were we reading? Who’s the author? When was the paper published? How do you read the first two paragraphs? How do you read for bias? Why aren’t we teaching that for a digitized world? Because I am still pretty old school and I like physical newspapers, so I get them but I am like the rarest subscriber you will see for my age demographic. Like one of the things we need to consider is how do we modernize our approach to consuming media? And I don’t wanna put it on the social media user to protect themselves from a sophisticated information operation. But again, when you think about it as a holistic solution this can also be a piece of the puzzle that really makes the difference.</p><p>OL: So Lisa, my final closing question for you is, do you have anything that you think about as something that could be maybe a smaller low-intensity effort, but could make a world of difference in terms of moving the needle forward on this&nbsp;problem?</p><p>LK: Yeah, so I think that I always come back to, if every individual just stopped and thought before they hit send, or tweet, or post, or share, or whatever, I think we are all potential threat vectors, for furthering a disinformation or misinformation flow because disinformation and misinformation target us and our biases. And so by not sharing it and spreading it, we’re not making the problem worse. So I think if everybody did that, it would go a long&nbsp;way.</p><p>OL: Thank you so much, Lisa. I really enjoyed our conversation. Thanks for joining&nbsp;me.</p><p>LK: Thanks for having&nbsp;me.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-lisa-kaplan-on-domestic-disinformation-f86bdecf3147">The Breakdown: Lisa Kaplan on domestic disinformation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>The past year has seen working Americans struggle amidst a global pandemic and economic crisis, further exacerbating the deep, structural inequities in our society. Over and over again, the rules, ideas, and power that lie at the heart of our economy and democracy have rewarded the few at the expense of the many. In order to build a truly equitable and inclusive society, these trends must be quickly reversed. President Biden signing the American Rescue Plan into law today moves us one step closer to that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Because of critical aid in the American Rescue Plan, child poverty in the United States is expected to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/26/970999998/with-one-move-congress-could-lift-millions-of-children-out-of-poverty">drop by half</a>. More than one million unionized working people who faced the prospect of losing their pensions will now receive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/business/dealbook/bailout-pensions-stimulus.html">full retirement benefits</a> for at least the next 30 years. The government will be sending direct <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/08/1400-stimulus-checks-who-is-eligible-how-soon-they-could-arrive.html">relief checks</a> to the majority of Americans who earn less than $75,000 a year. Unemployed Americans will receive an extra $300 on top of their current benefits through the end of this summer. State and local governments will finally get <a href="https://statescoop.com/senate-approves-relief-package-with-350b-in-state-and-local-aid/">urgently needed aid</a> so they don’t have to make harmful cuts or enact&nbsp;layoffs.</p><p>This $1.9 trillion investment in families will help set us on a course toward an economy that works for all Americans. While there is still much to be done, Omidyar Network welcomes this momentous piece of legislation and we look forward to collaborating with our partners, grantees and policy makers to continue the path forward to a more equitable and inclusive society.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-network-applauds-enactment-of-the-american-rescue-plan-5d2b395e90d5">Omidyar Network Applauds Enactment of the American Rescue Plan</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Announcing ELP <p>Today we're excited to announce that we are officially opening applications for the Ceramic Mainnet Early Launch Program (ELP). This program allows a limited number of projects to get early access to the Ceramic mainnet before it is opened to the general public later this year.</p><p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply to the Early Launch Program</a> if you want to deploy your <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> and/or <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> project to production in the coming months. </p> FAQs  Who is the program for? <p>ELP is for projects that want to use Ceramic and/or IDX in production ASAP. We created this program so you could get started immediately.</p> When does the program start? <p>Starting today we will begin accepting applications on a rolling basis. For those accepted into the program, mainnet access will begin in approximately 4-6 weeks. We will communicate the official mainnet start date via email. Before mainnet is ready, you can start prototyping your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a>.</p> How do I apply? <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Apply using this form</a>. Our team will promptly evaluate submissions and reach out via email when we are ready to onboard your project. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us evaluate your submission.</p> How will you evaluate applications? <p>We have a set of evaluation criteria but generally we will prioritize projects with the most active users, those who have been most active in our community, those who plan to go live with Ceramic/IDX as soon as possible, those with the most interesting use cases, those that deliver the most aggregate value to the Ceramic ecosystem, and those who can commit to providing us detailed feedback.</p> What happens if I'm on the waitlist? <p>While you're waiting, you can begin prototyping and building your application on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a> and contributing in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>. We will accept projects from the waitlist on a rolling basis.</p> What are the program details? <p>Projects that have been accepted into the ELP get early access to Ceramic mainnet nodes running on <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/">3Box Labs</a> infrastructure. For the duration of the program, these will be the only nodes connected to mainnet.</p> Is this a "centralized mainnet"? <p>We like to think of ELP as a mainnet with training wheels. All the primary features of mainnet are there such as a Ceramic mainnet pubsub topic and anchoring document updates on the Ethereum mainnet, but by limiting variables such as the number of nodes on the network and the number of overall participants we can make sure everything works well in a controlled production environment before opening the network to the chaos of the general public.</p> How long does the program last? <p>We have not yet set an end date. We will conclude the program and launch the public Ceramic mainnet when we feel the network has been battle tested enough by applications in production during ELP.</p> What happens at the conclusion of the program? <p>After ELP has concluded, Ceramic mainnet will be released to the general public and anyone can run a node and deploy their project in production.</p> When is public mainnet launching? <p>At the conclusion of ELP.</p> Where can I learn more? <p>Join the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Sign up today <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.typeform.com/to/XizKdGH2">Complete the ELP application</a></p>

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of  Stonebridge Solutions?</p>



<p>Stonebridge’s primary objective is to establish new mechanisms for identification, privacy and security to enable legitimacy, establish trust between two unknown parties and prevent fraud before it happens.</p>



<p>Our next generation technologies anticipate evolving and growing threats to both consumers and merchants and are designed to prevent these risks and empower users to positively impact their security and privacy as they transact digitally.</p>



<p>Our vision is to reduce the economic impact of fraud by provisioning a secure &amp; private ‘digital last mile’ for payment.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



 <a href="https://stonebridgesolutions.ca">https://stonebridgesolutions.ca</a>/ 



<p>The world is experiencing a social and economic shift at an unprecedented rate. This is driving the growth of new and more sophisticated threat models and legacy systems and technologies that are not easily adapted to address them creating a large gap being exploited by fraudsters and driving a an urgent need for a trusted digital identity.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>One of XUMI’s founding principles it that there is economic value creation through the prevention of fraud and the elimination of risks through the establishment of a trusted digital ID that can be legitimized at the point of interaction.</p>



<p>We also believe that the promotion of digitization in Canada coincident with a Pan-Canadian framework for digital identity will enable greater and more efficient access to banking, government benefits, education, health care and many essential services while facilitating the security of the digital footprint and this will strengthen Canada’s economy locally and its position globally.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada has a significant role to play as a leader in digital identity and trust. We have a demonstrated history of ‘locking arms together’ collaboratively to work towards the common good. When that is blended with best in class technology, banking, government, and healthcare through DIACC we can effect a change and establish a framework for success for others to model.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>We joined DIACC because we understand and share the mission. We believe in the ‘root of trust’ being established and held by a trusted authority and have designed the last mile to extend this in a secure way to consumers and merchants. When we set out 4 years ago we believed that the road to global digital transformation was long, and then suddenly it wasn’t. Our technology is bigger than we are, and it has the ability to change the game, switch things up, have impact. We believe in the power of partnership and collaboration between great teams to solve extraordinary challenges. While working quietly away on our tech we’ve witnessed an unprecedented shift to digital in the last year, and alarming growth in the risks associated with it. We want to help, lend what ever we can to eliminate those risks and feel we can further that objective through DIACC.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Stonebridge Solutions is a small, focused tech company located in Vancouver BC. Our objective of eliminating fraud began with the simple phrase “there has to be a simpler, more secure and easier way”. </p>



<p>We’ve spent 4 years devoting ourselves to eliminating the threat models associated with merchant payment, mobile wallets and mobile devices while designing innovative, intuitive and frictionless experiences for users, and a platform to support it under the brand name XUMI.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to sponsor the Identity, Unlocked podcast. This week’s episode <a href="https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/public/49/Identity%2C-Unlocked.--bed7fada/ad784008">“eKYC with Mark Haine” features host Vittorio Bertocci and special guest Mark Haine</a>. The episode focuses on the work of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">OpenID Foundation’s eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group</a>. Mark Haine is the Director at considrd.consulting and one of the Co-chairs of the eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group. Among the many dots Mark is connecting on behalf of the OpenID Foundation is work with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, the Open Identity Exchange Trust Framework Initiatives and the Open Banking Implementation Entity.</p>
<p>The working group is named for two processes that are largely the same but represent different industries. eKYC or Electronic Know Your Customer is a process most closely tied to the financial industry, whereas identity assurance is the more generic counterpart present in most other sectors. Identity assurance is the process of establishing the Identity of someone you’re interacting with within a very reliable fashion, and while it was historically often carried out in person, the rapid transition to new technologies and options for remote engagement have created a need to find ways of moving identity assurance online and allowing for it to be done in a standardized fashion.</p>
<p>The working group <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/charter/">charter</a>, in summary, explains the group’s aim to deliver a tech solution that communicates “verified claims” and information about how they were verified. The metadata about the “verified claims” answers questions of how and when claims were established. The working group represents many countries and industries and was launched in the context of the OpenID Foundation because of the natural connections between the foundation and the group’s initiative. Offering further detail on this project, Mark comments on the choice not to mandate but strongly encourage the use of FAPI, the level of adoption of the working group’s spec thus far, and – with regard to deliverables – what specification documents and definitions the group is working with. As the conversation winds to a close, Mark explains the danger of using scope, the benefits of the TXN claim within the working group’s specification, the PKI analogy for the trust framework, and ways listeners can help by fostering awareness of the program and its many less obvious use cases.</p>

     <p>Chain of custody </p> <p>A time-ordered sequence of parties who take physical custody of an object or collection of objects as it moves through a supply chain network. </p> <p>Chain of ownership </p> <p>A time-ordered sequence of parties who take legal possession of an object or collection of objects as it moves through a supply chain network. </p> <p>Critical Tracking Event (CTE) </p> <p>A record of completion of a step in the business process in a supply chain, that is critical to record and share, in order to ensure end-to-end traceability.</p> <p>Key Data Element (KDE)</p> <p>Those data required to be present in a CTE to accurately represent what occurred in the step of a business process, in order to ensure traceability. </p> <p>Party </p> <p>An organisation or individual acting as an entity in a supply chain. Parties may play multiple different roles in the supply chain. </p> <p>Supply chain </p> <p>A supply chain is a system of organisations and business processes that are involved in the manufacture, distribution and maintenance of a product or asset. </p> <p>Supply chain visibility </p> <p>The awareness of, and control over, specific information related to product orders and physical shipments, including transport and logistics activities and the statuses of events and milestones that occur prior to and in-transit. [Aberdeen Group] </p> <p>Traceability</p> <p>Traceability is the ability to trace the history, application or location of an object [ISO 9005:2015]. When considering a product or a service traceability can relate to:</p> <p>■ the origin of materials and parts;</p> <p>■ the processing history;</p> <p>■ the distribution and location of the product or service after delivery. </p> <p>For practical reasons, “trace” or “track and trace” may be used as equivalent terms to designate the action of ensuring the traceability. </p> <p>Traceability system </p> <p>The system used by an individual party to manage traceability in its supply chain(s). A traceability system includes mechanisms for the identification of objects and for the capture of information about observations of those objects over time as they move between locations or participate in various business processes. </p> <p>Traceability party </p> <p>A party that has been selected to be in scope of a traceability system. Parties in scope of traceability systems may include those that take custody of traceable objects, those that take ownership of traceable objects, those that inspect traceable objects, those that insure traceable objects, etc. End-customers (including consumers and patients) will often not be treated as traceability parties, since they do not necessarily carry a traceability responsibility and very often remain unknown to the other traceability parties.</p> <p>Traceability location </p> <p>A traceability location is a designated physical area that has been selected to be in scope of a traceability system. </p> <p>Traceable object </p> <p>A traceable object is a physical or digital object whose supply chain path can and needs to be determined. </p> <p>Tracing </p> <p>Tracing is the capability to identify the origin and characteristics or history of a particular traceable object upstream (through earlier observations) based on data recorded at defined points of the supply chain. Trace or Tracing backward or ascending traceability </p> <p>Tracking</p> <p>Tracking is the capability to locate or follow the path of a particular traceable object downstream (through later observations) based on data recorded at defined points of the supply chain. Track forward or descending traceability </p> <p>Transparency </p> <p>Transparency refers to the need to ensure visibility and access to accurate information across supply chains (inclusive of consumers), including the provision of relevant traceability data to trading partners and consumers in a spirit of openness. </p> <p>Visibility </p> <p>Visibility is the ability to know exactly where things are at any point in time, or where they have been, and why.</p> <p>Visibility event data </p> <p>Visibility event data are records of the completion of business process steps in which physical or digital entities are handled. [ARCH] </p> <p>Each visibility event captures what objects participated in the process, when the process took place, where the objects were and will be afterwards, and why (that is, what was the business context in which the process took place).</p>

<p>March 10, 2020 – Today, the <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">Baseline Protocol</a>, part of the Ethereum OASIS Open Project and in partnership with <a href="http://opencollective.com/opensource">Open Source Collective</a>, announced that it has received a grant of $100,000 from the <a href="https://ethereum.foundation">Ethereum Foundation</a> to be used for the purpose of encouraging and accelerating baseline protocol R&amp;D and enablement efforts. This comes on the first anniversary of the community’s formation.</p>



<p><a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/">Launched in March</a> of 2020, the Baseline Protocol uses advances in peer-to-peer messaging, zero-knowledge cryptography, and blockchain technology to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises without moving company data out of traditional systems of record.&nbsp; Today, hundreds of companies and thousands of individuals are actively participating in the initiative, which coordinates with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.&nbsp; For more information go to <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">baseline-protocol.org</a>.</p>



 “2021 is stacking up to be a breakout year for Enterprise blockchain usage with more and more projects landing on the public Mainnet,” said Dan Shaw of the Ethereum Foundation. “Baseline has been a key driver of this, since the protocol enables private collaboration between enterprises without putting any sensitive data on-chain.” 



<p>The Baseline Protocol community conducts steering committee meetings every two weeks. Starting in April 2021, these meetings will include a segment to hear proposals for projects seeking funding from the grant pool. Each month, the Technical Steering Committee will allocate a portion of the total grant to selected projects. Allocations are managed by the <a href="https://opencollective.com/baseline-protocol">Open Source Collective</a>. These projects can include technical work such as contributions to open source code and also can include work to contribute enablement content, documentation and outreach programs. For more information on proposing projects for grants and bounties, go <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/news/grants-ef-funding-2021/">here</a>.</p>



<p>It is hoped that this grant will attract other organizations to contribute additional funding to the effort. Organizations interested in contributing can do so <a href="https://opencollective.com/baseline-protocol#category-CONTRIBUTE">here</a>.</p>

<p>Conviction Voting (CV) is a governance mechanism that allows users to signal their preference on various issues by staking their tokens on proposals. A proposal passes if it has sufficient weight allocated to it. The weight of a proposal is calculated based on the amount of tokens that have been staked and the amount of time these tokens have been staked. The <a href="https://medium.com/commonsstack/announcing-the-conviction-voting-cadcad-model-release-8e907ce67e4e">introduction to conviction voting</a> by Common Stack is a great primer if you want to learn more about how CV works. </p><p>Implementations of CV so far have been developed on the EVM, which makes the results and outcomes completely trustless. While there are some deployments like <a href="https://1hive.org">1Hive</a> and <a href="https://cv.commonsstack.org">Common Stack</a>, high gas costs and the sub-optimal user experience of transferring tokens for every vote make this quite problematic. Fortunately conviction voting systems can be securely implemented using off-chain, verifiable data structures. Building CV systems off-chain, as opposed to on-chain, avoids the high gas costs and poor user experience that plagues current implementations while still achieving verifiability and participant trust.</p><p>This article will explain how you can use <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> as an underlying data structure to build a conviction voting dapp.</p> Intro to Ceramic and IDX <p>Ceramic is a decentralized protocol for verifiable, version-controlled content. Ceramic is used to create mutable documents on IPFS with permanent identifiers, called DocIDs. All document updates are signed and then periodically anchored into the blockchain for time-stamping and consensus. You can think of a single Ceramic document as its own ledger (a doc-chain) which contains all the information needed to reconstruct the state of the document in a completely trustless manner. For more details refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md">Ceramic specification</a>.</p><p>IDX is a decentralized identity protocol built on top of Ceramic which makes it easy to associate data to a user, discover data a user has created, and build user-centric applications. You can think of IDX as a decentralized user table. Each user has their own index which is a map from definitions to records. Definitions are globally-defined descriptions of data created by developers. Each user has their own individual record for each definition which stores their content. For more information have a look at the <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/overview/">IDX developer documentation</a>.</p> System overview <p>The proposed conviction voting system is based on an ERC20 token that is periodically snapshotted. This means that the token balances of all users are not updated continuously but instead on a set interval, e.g. twice a day. Additionally, users can easily change their voting preferences at any time.</p><p>There are three main system components:</p>  User-created content including: 1) proposal documents which contain information for a given proposal, and 2) conviction documents where users set their preferences among all live proposals  A snapshot service that takes snapshots of the balances of all users of a particular ERC20 token, calculates the total conviction weight for all proposals from users' conviction documents, and saves them into a conviction state document  An oracle system that resolves passed proposals on-chain when the conviction state document has sufficient conviction weight for any given proposal   User-created content  Proposal document <p>Any user can create a proposal document when they want to request funds for a project. This document could contain any amount of information, but most important to be included is: <code>context</code> the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-19.md">caip-19 asset id</a> (ERC20 token address) that is used for the conviction voting, <code>beneficiary</code> the receiver of the funds if the proposal passes, <code>amount</code> the amount of funds to send if the proposal passes.</p><p>Example content<br>This example is a proposal to get some funding for a project. Other proposals might include executing a transaction with call data, setting a protocol parameter, or updating some organizational document.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  title: "Develop an off-chain conviction voting system",
  currency: "ETH",
  amount: 200,
  beneficiary: "0xabcdef",
  description: "Fund team X to implement off-chain conviction voting using Ceramic &amp; IDX.",
  url: "https://ceramic.network"
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Proposal document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Convictions document <p>Each participant in the conviction voting system creates their own convictions document when they first interact with the conviction voting dapp. This document contains the convictions the user has assigned to various proposals as a fraction of their entire token holdings. Every time they change their preference the underlying Ceramic document gets updated, signed, and eventually anchored on-chain.</p><p>A conviction voting dapp would create a definition as defined in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">CIP-87</a> and each user would store a convictions document as a record in their IDX.</p><p>Example content<br>In this example we see a single user's convictions document. They have created <code>proposal2</code> and they have allocated different fractions of their token holdings to proposal 1, 2, and 3.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  proposals: ["&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;"],
  convictions: [{
    proposal: "&lt;proposal1-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.2,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.5,
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal3-DocID&gt;",
    allocation: 0.3,
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Preference document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Snapshot service <p>The snapshot service performs the task of periodically taking a snapshot of the balances of all token holders of the particular ERC20 being used. Using this information together with individual users' conviction documents, it <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">calculates the total conviction</a> and writes it to a conviction state document. This service is not trusted since anyone could compute the same conviction state by simply grabbing the data from the blockchain. The service executes at a set time interval, for example twice a day.</p> Syncing data &amp; performing calculations <p>Since we are not restricted to calculate the conviction score for all proposals on-chain we can simply use the discrete version of the conviction voting algorithm which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad</a>. On every discrete time interval the snapshot service grabs all token holders and their balances from the blockchain (e.g. using TheGraph). The address of each token holder is used to look up their individual IDX document which should contain their convictions document. The total conviction y_t+1 can now be calculated for each proposal using the formula in Figure 1.</p>Figure 1: How to calculate the total conviction for each proposal j. Source: <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb">https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad/blob/master/algorithm_overview.ipynb</a><p>Once total conviction for each proposal is calculated, the snapshot service also calculates the trigger function for each proposal. Finally the service updates the conviction state document with the new state.</p> Conviction state document <p>The conviction state document stores the full state of the conviction voting system. It is created and updated by the snapshot service. It contains two main arrays as well as supply information:</p>  <code>participants</code> - all token holders, their current token balance, and the latest CommitID of their convictions document at the time the snapshot was made  <code>proposals</code> - all active proposals and their total conviction which has been calculated by the snapshot service  <code>supply</code> - the total supply of the ERC20 token that is used for governance  <p>Example content<br>In this example we see that there are two participants who have a token balance and have created their own convictions documents. We also see that there are two active proposals, both of which have not yet been triggered, and have different levels of total conviction.</p> <code>{
  context: "eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474...", // ERC20 adddress as CAIP-19
  supply: 9001,
  participants: [{
    account: "0x12345...",
    balance: 1337,
    convictions: "&lt;convictions1-CommitID&gt;"
  }, {
    account: "0xabcde...",
    balance: 42,
    convictions: "&lt;convictions2-CommitID&gt;"
  }],
  proposals: [{
    proposal: "&lt;proposal1-DocID&gt;",
    totalConviction: 234,
    triggered: false
  }, {
    proposal: "&lt;proposal2-DocID&gt;",
    totalConviction: 432,
    triggered: false
  }]
}
</code> <p><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/87">Conviction state document schema in CIP-87</a></p> Oracle system <p>Once we have the conviction state document it's trivial to check the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BlockScience/Aragon_Conviction_Voting/blob/master/models/v3/Trigger_Function_Explanation.ipynb">trigger function</a> for any particular proposal. When a proposal has sufficient weight an oracle service (e.g. Chainlink) can be triggered to submit the data of the passed proposal on-chain. This would send the requested funds to the beneficiary in the proposal. It's also possible to use conviction voting to set smart contract parameters or proposal ranking (not execution). In these cases we would calculate a dynamic average instead of using a trigger function.</p> Executing proposals on-chain <p>In order to execute the transaction on-chain we can use an oracle system to get the relevant state from the conviction state document on-chain if a proposal has been triggered. Ideally this would be a set of oracles that can independently verify the state of this document before it's committed on-chain. However, in many cases it might be sufficient to use a simpler oracle system such as Chainlink to simply fetch the state of the document from the Ceramic gateway. The main data that needs to make it on-chain is <code>beneficiary</code> and <code>amount</code>.</p> Notes on security  Snapshot trust <p>The main point of trust in this system is the snapshot service. While anyone can independently verify that it has performed the proper calculations, this might not always happen. When implementing this CV system in production there likely needs to be some additional checks and balances that enable the snapshot service to be replaced. Alternatively a system may choose to require multiple snapshot service providers that are operated by independent parties.</p> Proposal manipulation <p>The proposal document could be updated to request a larger <code>amount</code> of funds after it has already started getting a large amount of conviction. In order to mitigate this attack, the snapshot service might require users to reconfirm their conviction for the proposal, without losing the time staked, before it is triggered.</p> Convictions reorg attack <p>Since Ceramic documents currently rely on the "earliest anchor wins" conflict resolution method, a user could perform a <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md#data-withholding-attacks">data withholding attack</a> where their conviction would be counted twice. The attack would involve the user first updating their preference document to proposal A and anchoring it, but withholding this data by not submitting it to the Ceramic network. Then they would set their preference doc to proposal B and publicly submit this to the network. Once proposal B has been passed, they would publish their data about proposal A which would invalidate their conviction on proposal B (because A was anchored earlier) and it would look as if they have staked their tokens on proposal A for a long period of time. This entire problem is solved by the fact that the snapshot service sets the CommitID of the user's preference doc in the snapshot document. So if a user cheats like this it would be simple to see that they have double voted and all of their votes would be invalidated from that point in time.</p> Alternative implementations <p>IDX can be used to store any type of user-related data such as verifications for social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Discourse, ...), a BrightID score, or any other similar information. This flexibility makes it possible to easily experiment with quadratic voting where accounts that are less likely to be sybils can influence the vote more.</p><p>Using an oracle to trigger actions on-chain would be ideal, but as a minimum viable product it might be simpler to just use the off-chain voting system as a way to generate signal. A trusted multi-sig can then be used to execute on-chain actions, similar to how <a href="http://snapshot.page">snapshot.page</a> is used.</p> Get involved! <p>This article outlines a basic framework for how off-chain conviction voting systems can be built, but there are still many details that need to be solved.

<p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>This post expands on the first key pillar for building a new economic paradigm as outlined in <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Our Call to Reimagine Capitalism</a>. Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>Five decades ago, our society experienced a seismic shift. Underneath the layers of headlines about the crises of the day — lingering economic stagnation, growing calls for civil rights and racial justice, and the departure of a disgraced president — the values that we used to guide our lives were changing. Old traditions and ideals were being abandoned, and new ones were emerging. <br> <br>One value, in particular, quickly rose to the forefront of our social discourse and crystalized to become our cultural touchstone: individual liberty. <br> <br> Liberty, of course, is a bedrock American value — ranking right in between “life” and “the pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence. Our country was founded on the belief that a society and economy can only truly thrive when individuals are free to pursue their desires and self-interests, both at the ballot box as a citizen of a democratic nation, and in the free market as an enterprising participant of a capitalist system.<br> <br>For two hundred years, a commitment to liberty was one of the integral pieces of the base on which we sought to construct an ever-larger, ever-more-inclusive American society. In the 1970s, however, this base of diverse values and norms failed to shelter us from the crises of the time, and we chose to prioritize liberty as the base value that could keep our social edifice standing. Meanwhile, we abandoned the other values, norms, and institutions supporting our society as unnecessary constraints on liberty, and through willful neglect if not active undermining, allowed these parts of our social foundations to erode and decay.<br> <br>To build on this new, more sparse, foundation of values, we turned to a set of ideas that described markets as the ideal tool for maximizing liberty. Ideal markets, after all, are ones where anyone is free to buy, sell, work, or trade without interference. We therefore accepted as fact a simple, yet compelling theory: that these free markets, by generating wealth and automatically distributing it from businesses to working people, would create the best possible society for everyone. <br> <br>For the past fifty years, these ideas have been the blueprint we used to design and build our society.<br> <br>We have measured the wellbeing of our society by tracking the wellbeing of markets, and lauded ourselves as GDP, corporate profits, job numbers, and the stock market continued to rise. <br> <br>We have sought to remove government from markets and our lives: lowering taxes, deregulating, and increasingly relying on markets to provide services that had once been the responsibility of government. We worked to weaken labor unions, community leaders, even our own elected representatives — anyone who threatened to challenge the wisdom of markets. <br> <br>At the same time, we have empowered business leaders and trade associations, assured that these job creators knew best how to generate profits that would naturally, and without intervention, trickle down to the rest of society. <br> <br>Have trickle-down economics worked? If we view our society through the narrow frame of profits and growth, we could almost believe that the last fifty years have been a success. Look at the stock market! If it’s reaching record heights, then we must all be richer than we’ve ever been before!<br> <br>But, of course, we all know this view to be a delusion. By so many measures, our economy has failed us. Our growing GDP masks our growing inequality, just as rising job numbers ignore how job quality and wages have been falling, forcing more and more people to work multiple jobs while still being barely able to support their families. Meanwhile, growing corporate profits do not mean this wealth is shared with the working people who made those profits possible — let alone invested to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/windfall-profits-and-deadly-risks/">protect people’s health during a pandemic. </a>Finally, an excess focus on free markets has, if anything made the markets themselves weaker — less innovative, less competitive, less resilient — as businesses used their new freedom to earn profits through monopolies and rent seeking rather than producing services of value to society.<br> <br>If these fifty years have been an experiment of an economic theory, it is time to conclude, based on overwhelming evidence, that it has failed. Freer markets did not create a freer society. In fact, by “freeing” business from having to account for the negative consequences of their behavior, we burdened people, communities, and the planet with the growing weight of these costs, and by “freeing” people from familial, community, and public support systems, we forced people to pay the full price of any accident or mistake they might run into. <br> <br>In doing so, we eliminated the choices people could make. How many of us have been unable to search for a better job, move to a new state, or open a new business because we and our families simply cannot afford the risk? Our living costs are rising, and there is nothing left to catch us if we fall.<br> <br>We have spent too long trying to balance the entirety of our vibrant and complex society on top of a narrow and crumbling foundation. It is time for us to widen our frame of thinking and design a society built using a broader set of values that will be resilient to the growing tremors facing the world. <br> <br>We need values like the dignity of having one’s worth measured by one’s contribution to one’s community, and not one’s wage; like the security and stability that comes from knowing that, even if the worst were to happen — unemployment, sickness, injury, natural disaster, or even a pandemic — you would still be able to keep your family in your home, put food on the table, and receive needed care; like the justice of seeing past harm accounted for, and future harm averted; like the sustainability of a society that can prosper in perpetuity.</p><blockquote>Our definition of success must be more than just a subset of economic indicators. True success is achieved when our families are safe and healthy, when our communities are welcoming and full of opportunity, when our use of our planet’s resources are not unsustainably destructive…and, yes, when our businesses, small and large, can thrive and support our society’s wellbeing.</blockquote><p>Omidyar Network supports a number of organizations that are pushing to expand the range of values and ideas used to understand the economy. Our goal is not to advance any one solution, but rather to generate a multitude of proposals for moving us from a society that prioritizes only profits to a reimagined capitalism which prioritizes human flourishing in all its&nbsp;forms.</p><p>Our search for new ideas led us (unsurprisingly) to think tanks. This is why we are supporting a range of organizations that are elevating human centered perspectives on the social role of our economy and proposing innovative solutions to our collective challenges.<br> <br>The <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/">Roosevelt Institute</a>, for example, advocates for structural economic change through progressive policies. Their fellows are key voices in promoting the pursuit of economic security, more dignity, and, ultimately, more human thriving for more people. As its President and CEO Felicia Wong <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RI_EmergingWorldview_report-202001-1.pdf">notes</a>, “The move to values beyond ‘freedom to participate in a capital-focused marketplace’ is the central pillar of post-neoliberal thinking. If the new progressivism is to thrive, making plain the values inherent in our economic choices will be essential.” One of their recent reports, <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/new-rules-for-the-21st-century-corporate-power-public-power-future-american-economy/">New Rules for the 21st Century</a>, discusses the need to strengthen our democracy by thinking differently about the respective social roles of markets and government; last summer, they released a <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RI-TrueNewDealReport_202008.pdf">True New Deal</a> promoting essential reforms for the COVID-19 era. <br> <br>Meanwhile, <a href="https://americancompass.org/about/">American Compass </a>is working to create a coalition of thinkers drawing on conservative values for family, community, industry, and strong social and political institutions to advance economic ideas that ensure markets are serving people and their communities. Launched in May 2020, they have published and hosted discussions with thinkers from across the conservative and broader political spectrum. In September, they released a <a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/conservatives-should-ensure-workers-a-seat-at-the-table/">joint-statement calling for a renewed conservative labor movement</a> that elevates worker voices in economic and market discussions, which was signed by a number of prominent conservative figures, including Senator Marco Rubio and former attorney general Jeff Sessions.<br> <br>Our second focus is in strengthening the coalition of organizations working to disseminate these new economic ideas and incorporate them into strategic and policy discussions. <br> <br>Although the academic field of economics has developed <a href="http://www.oecd.org/governance/beyond-growth-33a25ba3-en.htm">an array of new branches of research</a> — from behavioral to ecological economics — that deepen our appreciation for the complexity of markets and their impact on society, this new thinking is not reflected in the ways that economics is taught in schools and universities, especially at the introductory level. We are therefore supporting the dissemination of <a href="https://www.core-econ.org/">CORE</a>, a new open-source economic curriculum developed with the collaboration of top economists, which incorporates recent advances in economic thinking. This curriculum is being adopted by schools and universities around the world.<br> <br>To help coordinate and align this growing global field of organizations that are developing and implementing new economic ideas, we are also supporting the <a href="https://www.econchange.org/">Economic Change Unit</a>, which both amplifies new ideas and works to strengthen the groups working around the world to transition us to a more equitable, sustainable, and democratic socio-economic paradigm.<br> <br>We have also turned to the media, given its power to shape how we all understand the economic forces impacting our lives, to help disseminate these ideas and reframe how we think about our economy. To that end, we have supported compelling reporting on the structural economic inequities that have been laid bare by the pandemic by journalists and photographers from new outlets such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/21362321/economy-american-policy-coronavirus-covid-recovery-fix-solutions-mobilization-great-rebuild">Vox</a>, and <a href="https://covid19-biggerpicture.trust.org/">Thomson Reuters</a>. <br> <br>Finally, we know that good ideas do not come from experts alone, and that real change is impossible without a broader cultural shift in how we, as a society, understand and discuss the economy.<br> <br>In addition to supporting a range of local and national organizations that are working to formulate and disseminate new ideas at the grassroots level, we are also working to cultivate the next generation of economic leaders and thinkers. Last year, we collaborated with The <a href="https://prospect.org/essaycontest">American Prospect </a>in a high school essay contest inviting students to read and reflect on one of four books highlighting the interlinking economic and racial justice challenges facing our country. We also partnered with <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/sponsored/story/tell-us-your-plan-to-reimagine-capitalism">Teen Vogue </a>to solicit ideas from young people about how they would redefine economic success in our society. Amongst hundreds of submissions, we heard ideas ranging from educating people to move money in support of racial justice to a worker-owned coffee shop on a mission to end wage theft and democratize the workplace.<br> <br>The ground below our feet is shifting, as it did all those decades ago. It is our mission to ensure that we have a solid foundation of values on which to build, and as many design ideas as possible at our disposal. With these, we can embark on the collective task of making American society as resilient and inclusive as possible.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-grounding-our-economy-in-a-new-ideas-and-values-99596c8dabe8">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Grounding Our Economy in a New Ideas and Values</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Tell us what you do and what it is about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I have been managing the World Bank’s (WBG) Identification for Development Initiative (ID4D) for the last 5 years alongside a sister initiative – G2Px – which we launched end of 2019.&nbsp; Through ID4D, we are helping countries realize the transformational potential of digital identity in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. G2Px focuses on supporting countries on digitizing payments from government to individuals, but in a more holistic way so that it can pave the way for broader outcomes of financial inclusion and women’s economic empowerment. It’s why we have the tagline of “payments that empower”.</p>
<p>These two WBG-wide initiatives are aimed squarely at helping governments and policy makers to reimagine and build the digital rails that underpin the way they transact with individuals. It also can transform the way people engage with their governments and with each other.&nbsp; A digital stack of ID, together with digital payments and trusted data exchange, has the ability to really empower individuals and change the way services are delivered – faster, more transparently and more conveniently.&nbsp; This past year, under the COVID pandemic, we have seen the need for all of this come to light with countries ramping up service delivery digitally, including social assistance to those most in need.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I joined the World Bank Group 20 years ago. &nbsp;I was passionate about international development and eager to contribute.&nbsp; The same passion sustains and energizes me to this day. When I joined, I didn’t imagine I would stay this long, but it’s hard to leave when the Bank provides the opportunity to work both in support of countries and on global public goods around on key development issues.</p>
<p>My earliest support system was generated at home. Growing up, my mother and father always encouraged my sisters and I and set the expectations to try our best and make a difference in any way we could.&nbsp;&nbsp; My parents came to the US in the mid ‘60s from Sri Lanka. At the time, it wasn’t always the norm for parents to push their daughters academically. &nbsp;But my parents certainly did (much to my annoyance at that same time) and that support helped me tremendously. And of course, now, that support system has expanded to include my husband who shares equally with the kids and at home.</p>
<p>The other thing that has helped me tremendously is my wonderful set of colleagues, team members and mentors – both within the Bank and in our wider group of external partners who have been with us since the beginning of these initiatives.&nbsp; We could not have achieved the multi-sector approach we have taken to digital public platforms without a really strong ecosystem of senior management support and hard-working teams who are passionate about this agenda across the Bank and externally.</p>
<blockquote>
 The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies. 
</blockquote>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>One of my favorite quotes is from anthropologist and women’s rights campaigner, Margaret Meade: “”Never doubt&nbsp;that a small group of thoughtful committed individuals can change the world. In fact, it’s the only thing that ever has.”</p>
<p>It’s been a guiding principle for me and I’ve adopted it in the advice I give to all our new team members. &nbsp;“Don’t wait until a system or an individual tells you to do something. Change comes from a group of individuals, not a “system”.</p>
<p>People often think reforms come from “policy” or “a system”. But what I have realized is that behind any policy or any system or organization are people – individuals and groups of human beings just like us!&nbsp;&nbsp; At work, we often will work with senior levels of governments and of course a high-level vision is key. But behind the vision you’ll always find a group of individuals who are shaping that vision and a group of individuals that need to work together to make the vision a reality.</p>
<p>So the advice I give to young professionals joining the Bank or newer team members is to know that you have the capability to be a shaper.&nbsp; An organization like the World Bank may appear to the outside as large and bureaucratic. But you can be quite entrepreneurial. You can shape the agenda – as long as you work hard to bring together different teams and different ideas as part of it. And don’t surprise anyone!</p>
<p>Collaboration is also part of what I do today. I know, for instance, that we couldn’t have agreed the updated Principles for Identification for Sustainable Development we have just published without a strong team of partners and collaborators working together on a shared vision.</p>
<p>It’s summed up in the words of an African proverb, printed on the walls of Gates Foundation HQ. “If you want to go fast, go alone.&nbsp; If you want to go far, go together.”</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>We have been working with governments to shift the identity agenda away from the way it has traditionally been viewed it.&nbsp; Identity is a core element for countries to transform service delivery to people, particularly in the digital age.&nbsp; The COVID-19 crisis has shone a spotlight not just on ID, but Good ID, ID that is a gateway to inclusion and the development of digital societies.</p>
<p>So, to CEOs I would say: “Build greater innovation on top of foundational ID systems, including new applications that will help people transact more seamlessly.&nbsp; There are increasingly ambitious countries all wanting to do digital ID the right way.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity is the combination of different ways of thinking, different cultures and ethnicities, gender that leads to whole being greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>As a woman in identity, I am proud that about 80% of our team is female!&nbsp; Given the dearth of women in technology and identity space, I feel like we’re making a real contribution towards shaping the next generation of identity and digital development experts.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
Vyjayanti Desai
<p>Amanda Gorman’s poem at the inauguration of Joe Biden, “The Hill We Climb” Not only was it great to have a young woman captivate the entire world but it was hopeful and unifying, while also surfacing some of the very real issues that we face today.&nbsp; And her delivery of it was so inspiring.</p>
<p>I also have grown to really enjoy podcasts this past year. It was one of the things that kept me sane while taking my daily walks during the pandemic. Two podcasts: “It Was Said” and “Hope through History” by Jon Meacham are among my favorites.&nbsp; Each episode centers around a powerful, impactful public speech including Franklin D Roosevelt during the Great Depression, Hillary Clinton’s speech on ‘Women’s Rights are Human Rights’, Robert F Kennedy’s eulogy for Martin Luther King and Ronald Reagan’s farewell address.&nbsp; &nbsp;I’d love to see him expand this podcast and bring in speeches from across the globe.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>I have teenage twin boys, so I get plenty of practice giving unsolicited advice to teenagers!  But the advice I would give to the teenage me is: “Live in the moment; cherish everyone and everything around you because you never know when it may change.” My mother passed away from cancer when I was in high school and that definitely made me change my perspective. I try to ground myself by not worrying about the little things and try to live with a perspective of a glass half full.</p>
<p>And .. “be that change maker!”</p>

<p>DIACC is hosting a series of spotlights showcasing our amazing female DIACC members in the digital identity space, noting the importance of diversity. These spotlights will be regularly socialized through DIACC’s LinkedIn and Twitter channels as well as our monthly member newsletters.</p>



<p>If you’re a DIACC member and would like us to feature your spotlight, <a href="https://diacc.ca/contact-us/">contact</a> us today to learn more!</p>



<p>How long have you worked in your sector, and in your current position?&nbsp;</p>


 
 
 
<p>I have been in the tech industry for over 25 years in a variety of companies providing every type of software solution from graphic signage design tools, to Operating Systems, to 3D instrumentation clusters for avionics, to remote identity and document verification.&nbsp; I joined WorldReach Software, in the role of Director of Marketing, 11 years ago. I’ve loved every minute of it!</p>



<p>WorldReach, for those who have never heard of us, uses innovative processes and technology to verify you are who you say you are. We enable highly trusted digital services through our systems for government (borders, immigration, passport and consular) for digital on-boarding, safe and seamless travel, and digital Identity verification and corroboration.</p>



<p>We are probably best known for the core digital channel solution behind the UK Home Office’s EU Settlement Scheme. This smartphone based digital ID Verification (IDV) and enrolment capability has become the world’s most successful immigration programme of its kind with over 5 million completed applications to date!</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>What has your career journey looked like? Have you always worked in the private sector?&nbsp;</p>



<p>My career path has been so varied my general joke is “You can’t get here from there”. My educational background is in Fine Art. In fact, I have a painting in the Parliament Buildings. The short answer (which is not actually that short) is Fine Art led to Freelance Illustration, which led to Graphic Design, which led to Marketing Management in a software company. This opened me up to a much more technical path – first to Strategic Alliance Management for the Embedded OS market, then to Industry Segment Management, then to Product Management, then finally back to what I would term “Technical Marketing”.</p>



<p>I have always worked in the private sector, however for more than the last decade, I have been working exclusively in B2G. This has meant that one of my primary goals today is to understand all the challenges, wants, needs and technical requirements of the public sector. WorldReach clients are Governments from all over the world: Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Immigration and Border Agencies, but also any department with a citizen service role. Therefore, I spend the majority of my time researching Government digital service delivery program requirements worldwide.</p>



<p>When you were twenty years old, what was your dream job, and why?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given my artistic DNA, it likely will not be that surprising to hear that my dream job would have been to be a conservator in a prominent museum – someone who spends all their days cleaning, repairing, protecting and conserving incredible works of art. That would have been the perfect combination of my love of art, art history and my annoyingly anal-retentive detail-oriented skillset. Either that or I would have loved life as a professional soccer player! Even in my early twenties, I did not envision a long career in technology.</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>


 
 
 

 



 
<p>Externally – being taken seriously. As a woman in the male-dominated tech field over the last quarter of a century, one often hears this. For me personally, also being an openly gay woman adds an additional nuance to climbing the corporate ladder.&nbsp; I have unfortunately experienced homophobia from co-workers and management a few times in a few companies in the past, but I am happy to report that that appears to be in the rear view mirror for me. Still, it is a reminder of why we all need legal protections against discrimination in the work place and employment strategies focussed on diversity and inclusion.</p>



<p>Internally – overcoming the nagging doubt that you do not “belong in the room where it happens”. &nbsp;No matter how much experience you have in a certain industry, women tend towards the infamous “imposter syndrome”. Once you push that aside – and maybe that just comes with growing older and wiser – it really does become far less of a barrier. Belief in oneself goes along way to harnessing your own potential.</p>
 
 
 


<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Early in my career, I had to step away and become the main support for my incredibly ill child. As a mother, of course, that’s would you do, and what you want to do – there was no question. However, it also helps put things into perspective. There are always things in ones’ life that are more important than work. My son is now 33 years old and cancer-free, thankfully.</p>



<p>In the fast moving, highly competitive tech world, one’s work life can easily take over every waking hour – especially now, during COVID, when many of us are working from home. The boundaries can get very fuzzy. Nevertheless, it is still incredibly important to ensure you understand the crucial role of self-care. If you are exhausted, if you work around the clock, every aspect of your life will suffer – and that includes work.</p>



<p>I personally need physical activity. A long walk with my wife, friends and loved ones, working out in my basement gym, playing with my dogs – it all helps this balance ‘dance’.</p>



<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the tech space?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women can do anything, but sometimes we need permission to dream big. I think the media can play a big role in this as well. Girls and women need to see people just like themselves succeeding. They need to hear the ups and downs of real-world tech careers. They need to think, “If she can do it, maybe I can too!” Let’s just celebrate all the incredible women in tech much more often!</p>



<p>I also think more needs to be done in our educational system. More female guest speakers to come into classes (virtually or physically) and share their journeys, especially in STEM. Perhaps more mentor initiatives. I know I would have loved to participate in anything that showcased successful women particularly in traditionally male-dominated jobs. To show how fascinating and rewarding delving into technology can really be. To imagine yourself having an effect on the systems that are being built now and in the future. To take pride in creating, in innovating. It took me far too long to discover this on my own.</p>



<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>Do not be afraid to take up space. Do your homework and use your voice confidently. Be respectful and open, but do not apologize for everything.</p>



<p>A very good friend of mine gave me some great advice when I was in middle Management struggling to climb. She reminded me “perception is reality”. In the corporate world, you can be a wonderful capable worker, quite talented, but if the people in charge do not see it or know it, you will remain in the very same place but just with an ever-increasing workload. So – Volunteer for projects that will “stretch you”, that will require you to grow and learn, that will be seen. Be helpful and kind to all your colleagues, contacts and teammates. Go out of your way to lessen their workload, to be a person of value. Soon, it will be others that will be singing your praises – you will not have to!</p>



<p>If Senior Management do not value you in title, responsibilities and compensation, do not be afraid to leave and find it elsewhere. Have confidence in your own value.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>As the next generation of women begin to earn their way into more and more powerful positions, it will be easy to forget how hard the fight has historically been for the generation before them. Look back and learn. Look to the other successful women in the industry. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.</p>



<p>One of the biggest challenges these women will face is to recognize when their own drive and competitiveness becomes destructive. You cannot sustain being a “superwoman”. We are all human…and this where work/live balance is so important.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>


 
 
 
<p>Use your own natural talents to the best of your abilities; apply it to your passion and cultivated it. Whether that is being detail-oriented, analytical, a problem solver, purely creative, a team player or combinations of all of them. Know there is value in it all.</p>



<p>There is a misconception that there is only one type of person in STEM. An engineer, a scientist, a developer, a mathematician – only a linear thinker. Women often bring a different perspective, a different way of thinking and solving problems. A creativity. This variation, this diversity of thought is a necessity to produce the best most inclusive results – and the most interesting people!</p>

<p>How long have you worked in your sector, and in your current position?</p>



<p>I’ve been the CEO of Outlier since founding the company in 2013.</p>



<p>What has your career journey looked like? Have you always worked in the private sector?</p>



<p>I’ve worked as an employee for very large companies, including banks, investment firms and insurers as well as for consulting firms, but always in the private sector. It’s a running joke on our team that I might “retire” into a public policy or academic role one day.</p>
 



 

 
 
 

 
 
 
  
 



 
<p>When you were twenty years old, what was your dream job, and why?</p>



<p>When I was 20 years old my dream job was probably to be a world-famous DJ…little did I know that I was about to fall into a compliance role and fall in love with unravelling the puzzle that is Canadian regulation!</p>



<p>As a female leader, what has been the most significant barrier in your career?</p>



<p>I think that it took me a long time to truly be authentic in my work roles because authenticity means vulnerability. On my last day as a banker, one of my colleagues and I shared a cab to the airport and he told me that although I was very smart and well-liked, I was always holding myself back and this lack of authenticity would hurt me in the long run. I don’t think that I really understood what he meant until I founded Outlier. At that point, I had the freedom to create the type of environment that I wanted to work in, and to keep building on that vision. It’s something that I’m always working on.</p>



<p>How do you balance work and life responsibilities?</p>



<p>Anything that I would say here would be disingenuous. I don’t really have a “balance” in the traditional sense, and I’m ok with that. Don’t get me wrong, I cook and workout and do self-care things, but I’ve given up on the idea that there needs to be some sort of clean lines between my work and home lives. My colleagues are some of my best friends. It helps that I love what I do and get really excited about the intellectual challenges. If I didn’t have friends in the industry, who would I have philosophical conversations about ideal policy outcomes with?</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>How can more women be encouraged to pursue careers in the tech space?</p>



<p>I think it starts early. I’ve bought a few Cubettos (tactile coding toys) for bright young girls in my life. I try to take the time to talk to women, especially those starting out in their careers and to be honest about my experiences. I want my nieces (and my nephews) to choose a career that they’re passionate about. Gender shouldn’t be a barrier to that.</p>



<p>I’m also trying to practice radical honesty with my male colleagues because it helps to build awareness. For instance, a male CEO that unreservedly admire told me that he took a nap on a bench in a quiet spot in a Toronto park between meetings, and I told him how envious I felt that he could do that without really worrying about safety. It led to a really great discussion about some of the hidden differences that exist for men and women in business travel.</p>
 



 

 
 
 


<p>What are some strategies you have learned to help women achieve a more prominent role in their organizations?</p>



<p>One of the funny things that I’ve noticed running a compliance and tech meetup is that 100% of the people that reach out to me to ask to speak are white men. It’s not that the foremost experts in these fields are all white men. It’s not that the best or most knowledgeable speakers are all white men. It’s that white men have been trained to be very comfortable approaching someone that they’ve never met and asking for stage time. I try to make sure that I’m reaching outside of my usual network and beyond those that are volunteering. I try to keep track of people that I’ve spoken to that have really interesting insights that I want to see on stage, on committees, and in leadership roles. I try not to shy away from the conversations about what we can do better – because we can always do better.</p>



<p>The other thing that I’ve become very cognizant of after working with someone that abused alcohol, power, and people is my responsibility as a leader to ensure the safety of those around me. We’re in a new era where creeps that try to take advantage of their position are starting to be held to account, but there is still a lot of bad behavior going unchecked. When a known offender is at an event, I will warn organizers and suggest measures to ensure the safety of participants. This is uncomfortable but better than the alternative.</p>



<p>What will be the biggest challenge for the generation of women behind you?</p>



<p>I think that the challenge is always the same – building the best possible world with the tools at our disposal. Someone once told my mom that she would never have a VP title (despite actually doing the VP job for 6 months) because she was a woman. He said it to her face, and there was no recourse. By the time I was the same age, it would be career suicide for someone to say that to my face. By the time my nieces are my age, I’d love for us to be so evolved that no one would even think it.</p>



<p>What advice would you give to young women entering the field?</p>



<p>Sometimes being the only person like you in the room is power. When there are 8 men talking in the same way, I can embrace the fact that my voice is different and able to cut through the din…and when this is the case, it’s also likely that everyone “like you” is going to be judged based on what you say. It’s a lot of responsibility in a sense, and a lot of work but the results are worth the effort. You’ve got this.</p>

<p>Debates on whether or not E-ID Law is a good thing or a disappointment have been growing in intensity and have taken a decidedly political turn.<br>
Our Association is politically neutral and so we tried to stay away from these debates. We’ve been asked recently however about our opinion on the matter as independent experts that strive to bring and establish privacy friendly Self-Sovereign Identity technology to Swtizerland. We’ve decide not to pass that opportunity and shared our view points on the Law and DIDAS.</p>

 Indian Farmers’ Protest, Blocking Orders to Twitter, and the Fragile Balancing of Free Speech Amid Abysmal Regulation  Outlining limitations of blocking&nbsp;orders <p>February 2021 has borne witness to a standoff between Twitter India and the Modi Government. In the backdrop of a six-month-long <a href="mailto:https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/indian-farmers-protest-in-delhi-determined-to-stop-modi-s-new-laws">farmers’ protest</a> which has garnered both national and international support, the Indian Government issued blocking orders for Twitter to <a href="mailto:https://thenewsmen.co.in/india/india-directs-twitter-to-block-1178-accounts-in-fresh-notice/33050">remove over 250 accounts</a> linked to the farmer’s protest that were considered a threat to public order. At first, Twitter complied with the order, but within a few hours unblocked the accounts. This led to the government issuing a non-compliance order to Twitter which threatened to impose fines and imprison Twitter executives for up to seven years. As a result, Twitter complied with the order and blocked a majority of the accounts. However, in a <a href="mailto:https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html">statement</a> that followed, they clarified that they would not take action on 250 of the accounts, those that belonged to media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians, since removing those would violate their owners’ right to freedom of speech. Further, they stated that they would continue to explore options under Indian law for the accounts that had been affected by the Government’s blocking&nbsp;order.</p><p>The resulting hornet’s nest stems from a combination of the Modi government’s strong-armed will to curb dissent and the inability of current Indian laws to provide a fair balance between restrictions on illegal speech and procedural safeguards to protect freedom of speech. This article will shed light on the flaws with the current procedure laid down for issuing blocking orders, which the Government frequently and arbitrarily uses to seek the removal of content that is entirely legal under Indian law but simply critical of government actions. Some examples of such behavior include the recent blocking of over <a href="mailto:https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/aliexpress-to-tiktok-to-pubg-mobile-full-list-of-all-chinese-apps-banned-in-india-so-far-7064134/">100 Chinese mobile applications</a> and discussing the <a href="mailto:https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/government-may-block-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-in-specific-situations/1271470/">possibilities of blocking Facebook, Whatsapp, and Instagram</a> citing reasons of public&nbsp;order.</p><p>Government blocking orders in India are primarily regulated by Section 69A of the <a href="mailto:https://www.indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1999/3/A2000-21.pdf">Information Technology Act, 2020</a> (“IT Act”) and the procedure for blocking is laid out in the <a href="mailto:https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28%20Procedure%20and%20safeguards%20for%20blocking%20for%20access%20of%20information%20by%20public%29%20Rules,%202009.pdf">Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009</a> (“Blocking Rules”).</p><p>Section 69A of the IT Act provides that the Central Government may block public access of any online information if it is believed to be necessary in the interest of the state, public order, or for preventing incitement to commit a crime. Most of the controversial or speech-restrictive requests for removal are initiated by the Government under this section because of the opacity and flexibility of the accompanying Blocking Rules, which provide the procedure that must be followed for the issuance of such&nbsp;orders.</p><p>The Blocking Rules essentially set up an examining committee with a designated bureaucratic officer acting as its chairperson to consider the legality of blocking requests. There are three main shortcomings of the Blocking Rules, first lack of transparency, second, fundamentally inadequate provisions for allowing a response from recipients, and third, casting a wide net over what qualifies as an ‘emergency’ blocking&nbsp;order.</p><p>The first of these concerns the lack of transparency: the blocking rules mandate strict confidentiality of any requests made for removal of content and the subsequent action which is taken by the intermediary. This not only means that blocking orders are not subject to the public’s right to information but also creates a serious obstacle for an aggrieved party who would want to appeal the decision. Hence, mandating secrecy within the rules renders judicial redressal futile. For instance, Tanul Thakur, the creator of a satirical website, was <a href="mailto:https://www.theleaflet.in/content-takedown-and-users-rights/">not given access to the blocking request</a> even after publicly claiming ownership of the&nbsp;website.</p><p>Next, it is difficult or impossible to successfully challenge an order once issued. The Blocking Rules provide that once the examining committee receives a blocking request, an opportunity may be given to the intermediary or content creator to appear and submit their “reply and clarifications”. However, in reality, this right to reply is hardly ever exercised. No record can be found of this having happened in the past. This may be for two reasons: first, because the designated officer in most cases does not issue a notice seeking an appearance and reply from the relevant party in the first place, and second, because intermediaries cannot be expected to be in a position to defend each of the millions of takedown notices that they receive. Hence, in the off-chance that the examining committee seeks a response from the intermediary, asking intermediaries to appear in front of designated officers to justify the content uploaded by one of its millions of content creators remains a futile exercise. It is even more so if such response is sought from the content creator because they would not have access to the blocking request in the first place, due to mandated&nbsp;secrecy.</p><p>This general lack of awareness of a right to respond to order is evident in the present case of the tweets supporting the farmers’ protest, where the designated officer told Twitter that there existed “no statutory requirement to provide or demonstrate justifications to the intermediary while passing orders under Section 69A”. Further, he stated that it was “astonishing” for Twitter to be commenting on “significant issues of freedom of speech”. This evidences an obvious departure from the due process — a process which, if followed appropriately, could have potentially led to several pieces of important information remaining online.</p><p>Finally, the language in the Blocking Rules providing for the issuance of emergency blocking orders is extremely broad, and confers almost unlimited discretion to the issuer, defining emergency orders only as an order that can be passed when “no delay is acceptable”. By contrast for regular blocking orders, it is required that the examining committee issue directions as a unit and then have the direction approved by the Secretary of the Government’s Department of Information Technology before notifying the intermediary. However, in cases of emergency blocking orders, the Department Secretary can decide on her own accord and retrospectively bring the request to the examining committee. The two disconcerting aspects here are first, lack of any clear definition of what comprises an emergency, and second, the liberty of the government to act as a check on itself without balancing this with sufficient transparency for an aggrieved person to seek judicial&nbsp;relief.</p><p>These shortcomings may very well be the reason that <a href="mailto:https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/ttr-17.html">India ranks in the top five countries</a> that made the most removal requests to Twitter in the first half of 2020. The Blocking Rules’ lack of procedural safeguards protecting freedom of speech makes it extremely easy for the Government to issue take-down orders, and very difficult to challenge those&nbsp;orders.</p><p>The constitutionality of Section 69A and the corresponding Blocking Rules was challenged in the Supreme Court of India in the landmark <a href="mailto:https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/">Shreya Singhal ruling</a> of 2015. This ruling is famous for invalidating Section 66A of the IT Act which prohibited the dissemination of information causing ‘annoyance’, ‘inconvenience’, or ‘insult’. However, the same ruling reaffirmed the constitutionality of Section 69A and the Blocking Rules on grounds that any violations could be reversed once individuals moved to Court. It seems clear it is time for this position to be reassessed, given the impossibility of judicial review due to the confidentiality provision.</p><p>Withholding information from the public, not providing sufficient opportunity for the aggrieved party to respond, and creating a vaguely defined situation of what comprises an emergency has allowed for a wide net to be cast for the situations in which such orders can be issued. This fear of over-regulation has exacerbated over the past few years and is evident in the severe crackdown on free speech by the Indian Government. For instance, over the past years, the Indian Government has issued several blocking orders for Twitter to remove legitimate content highlighting the <a href="mailto:https://thelogicalindian.com/news/twitter-blocked-kashmir/">human rights violations in Kashmir</a> and the <a href="mailto:https://lumendatabase.org/notices/22220327">Khalistani movement in north-west India</a>.</p><p>There is an urgent need to reform the Blocking Rules and place adequate procedural safeguards within the mechanism of issuing blocking orders. <a href="mailto:https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">Article 19 of the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights</a>, an international human rights instrument to which India has ratified, lays down a three-part test of legality, legitimacy, and necessity that a law restricting freedom of speech has to be in line with. This test has been applied on several occasions by the Supreme Court of India, including in the Shreya Singhal ruling discussed above. The constructive way forward is through dialogue between lawmakers and civil society to ensure that the Blocking Rules are revised to comply with these tests and to ensure that the legal mechanism for the Government issuing blocking orders is transparent, contains adequate procedural safeguards, and provides for effective judicial oversight through transparency.</p><p>Finally, until these loopholes in the existing laws are fixed and adequate judicial and procedural safeguards are put in place, it is incumbent upon the Indian Government to ensure that such laws are used sparingly and not merely as armor to regulate content that is critical of its practices.</p><p>— About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

 How the EWT Escrow Model Unlocks the Full Potential of the Energy Web Tech&nbsp;Stack <p>As our <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">CEO Walter recently explained</a>, service-level agreements (SLAs) are important tools when it comes to widespread commercial adoption of new technologies, especially digital technologies like software-as-a-service (SaaS) and cloud computing. They give enterprise customers confidence by providing guaranteed performance and availability of service at a fixed cost, and they give vendors clear delivery requirements and stable&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>We intend for <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/">EW-DOS</a> to become a de facto standard for digital identity and infrastructure in the energy sector. For this vision to become reality, we need to figure out how to deliver the guarantees of traditional SLAs and the convenience of “-as-a-service” subscriptions—in the context of a public network operated by many different organizations from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Over the past year we’ve spent hundreds of hours researching technologies, brainstorming commercial and operational models, and speaking with members of our community to identify a solution. The result is an EWT escrow and subscription model for services in the Utility Layer of the EW-DOS stack that combines well-established elements from financial markets and enterprise IT procurement practices with features common in emerging decentralized finance and escrow applications.</p><p>In addition to promoting the physical, commercial, and political decentralization of EW-DOS, this model will catalyze the transition from pilots and proof-of-concept applications to mainstream adoption and commercial implementations. It’s also a triple-win scenario for the three primary stakeholders in the Energy Web community:</p>  Users of EW-DOS—especially enterprise customers like grid operators, OEMs, and energy companies—will gain easy access to performant, reliable services that help them realize the benefits of running applications on&nbsp;EW-DOS.  Operators of EW-DOS, including EWC validators and technology vendors, can build stable, profitable business models around hosting infrastructure nodes in a public&nbsp;network.  The EWT community gains a new way to use their EWT to contribute in the development and operation of EW-DOS infrastructure, which ultimately will accelerate digital transformation across the global energy sector and help to decarbonize the grid&nbsp;faster.  <p>This article describes the key roles, processes, and value propositions of the escrow model at a high level. While the main components are already being developed into a working prototype, some of the fine details have yet to be finalized. Our intent with this article is to elicit feedback and questions from the community, so don’t hesitate to respond in the comments&nbsp;below.</p>How it&nbsp;startedHow it’s&nbsp;going How EWT Escrow&nbsp;Works <p>Just like in proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus models (and in traditional escrow models in financial and energy markets), the purpose of EWT escrow is to incentivize/reward honest behavior and discourage/penalize bad actors. However, instead of being used to achieve consensus in a blockchain, EWT escrow is used to achieve performance guarantees for digital services like key management, data storage, and high-volume messaging in the Utility Layer of the EW-DOS stack. These services are necessary to support all types of applications running on EW-DOS, from <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/catalonian-grid-operator-electra-caldense-energy-web-and-bamboo-energy-announce-grid-flexibility-51c75e5bcc25">distributed flexibility markets</a>, to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">identity registries for energy assets</a>, to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/r3-joins-energy-web-to-provide-enterprise-grade-settlement-services-for-the-energy-sector-d4a6a834da44">enterprise-grade settlement</a>, and even <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">decarbonizing blockchains themselves</a>.</p><p>The EWT escrow model has two primary roles, which anyone in the global community can&nbsp;become:</p>  Service Providers (“Providers”) are organizations that operate Utility Layer service nodes. In order to become a qualified Provider, an organization must pass a basic KYC check and deposit a minimum balance of EWT into an escrow smart contract for a multi-year period. Once qualified, Providers can launch service nodes by depositing an incremental amount of EWT in escrow and passing a performance test for each node. To meet the minimum escrow balance requirement, providers can either acquire the necessary EWT themselves or accept EWT from external Patrons in the wider community. As long as Providers deliver services in accordance with the prescribed rules, they will earn a stable income on their deposited EWT.  Patrons are individuals or organizations that deposit EWT in escrow on behalf of Providers (similar to the relationship between <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-validator">validators</a> and <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-nominator">nominators</a> in Polkadot). Unlike Providers, there are no minimum balance thresholds or lockup periods for Patrons; anyone who holds any amount of EWT can participate. Patrons have the flexibility to withdraw or transfer their EWT from the escrow account(s) of Providers at any time, creating competition among Providers to deliver the most-reliable services (and thus earn the highest and most-stable income) and to offer the most competitive revenue-sharing models (to attract the most Patrons).  <p>There is no limit to the number of Service Providers. In fact, to meet the enterprise performance requirements for applications running on EW-DOS, we anticipate the need for hundreds of Providers operating thousands of nodes globally to ensure sufficient geographic coverage and network reliability for millions of applications and end-users.</p><p>At this time, the expected minimum escrow threshold for becoming a qualified Provider will be in the range of 10,000–100,000 EWT with an additional 1,000–10,000 EWT per service node. The incremental escrow requirement for individual nodes means each node will be judged (in terms of payments and penalties) on its own performance, and it also helps prevent monopolization. The final decision on the threshold requirements will be made based on feedback from the EW-DOS community, and must balance the need to ensure reliability and guarantee trust for enterprise users without creating insurmountable barriers to entry for potential Providers.</p><p>In addition to incentivizing good performance, Provider escrow accounts are used to make the Utility Layer carbon neutral from day one. Each month, the escrow accounts will be drawn down to purchase renewables via <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web&nbsp;Zero</a>.</p><p>Providers will be required to commit to delivering services for ~two or more years from the time of their initial enrollment (two years is a standard contract length for most enterprise IT services). During this period, deposited EWT will remain locked and if the Provider fully ceases delivering services they will forfeit their escrow balance. Providers who commit to a longer service delivery period will earn more each year than those who commit to the minimum duration. This multi-year commitment ensures that Providers are fully dedicated to delivering reliable services, and gives enterprise customers assurances about service availability and quality over a longer time horizon. After the initial commitment period, Providers may exit the Utility Layer service pool and withdraw their EWT from escrow by providing six months advance notice (which allows other Providers to backfill capacity as&nbsp;needed).</p><p>As long as Providers operate reliable service nodes that meet the performance standards (e.g., uptime, throughput capacity, latency) for each Utility Layer service, they will earn stable income through a combination of subscription payments and rewards from the Community Fund. Annual income for a Provider will be in the range of 10–20% of their EWT escrow account&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Initially, Providers’ income will be subsidized by the Community Fund&nbsp;, but over time as adoption (and subscription volume) increases, this subsidy will diminish. We expect that within 3–5 years, the Utility Layer will be driven by a sustainable commercial model where the vast majority of Provider earnings will be derived from subscription payments.</p><p>Patrons should expect to earn similar, if not identical, income as Providers (i.e., at least 10–20% of deposited EWT annually), though exact revenue-sharing arrangements will be determined by each Provider individually. To reiterate, there are no minimum escrow thresholds or commitment periods for Patrons. It is up to each Provider to define their own terms for Patrons, and natural competition encourages Providers to invest in appropriate infrastructure to ensure high-quality services, and to offer favorable terms to attract Patrons and maximize their own earning potential. When evaluating Providers, Patrons should consider not just revenue-sharing terms, but also reputation (e.g., overall historical performance) and individual node&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>In the event that a node fails to deliver services in accordance with the performance standards, the offending node and its Provider each lose a portion of their EWT deposit (similar to slashing in other crypto staking models). Accordingly, Providers are strongly incentivized to invest in appropriate resources and backup systems to ensure that nodes do not experience unplanned outages (especially if they have accepted EWT from external Patrons). If they fall below the minimum threshold, they must replenish their balance to remain eligible to host their node(s). Importantly, Utility Layer services are designed so that the failure of any given node does not materially impact the overall service. Much like electric grids, the Utility Layer is built to withstand the unexpected loss of individual components.</p> What to expect moving&nbsp;forward <p>Our goal is to launch the first Utility Layer services, complete with escrow and subscriptions, in production by Q3&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Here’s what to expect between now and&nbsp;then:</p>  In the next two weeks, we will publish more information outlining the service subscription model and explaining how EW Switchboard is used to manage both escrow and subscriptions.  In April 2021, we will release a series of video demonstrations, technical documentation, and a clickable prototype for the escrow and subscription models.  In May 2021, we will conduct an alpha release of escrow and subscription tools on our testnet&nbsp;Volta.  In June 2021, we will conduct a beta release of escrow and service components on the Energy Web Chain (EWC), with an initial cohort of Service Providers from the EWC validator community.  Throughout the remainder of the year, we will focus on scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.  <p>We’ll also be publishing a steady stream of articles, tutorials, and demos in the coming months to further explain the operational and commercial details of the escrow model.

 Thriving or Surviving? A Conversation on the Black Informal Economy with Equity and Transformation <p>By Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Richard Wallace- Founder and Director of Equity and Transformation<p>For years, politicians have talked about the need to create economic opportunities that support and expand the middle class in America. On one extreme, the political dynamics and systems of power place the greatest attention on the well-heeled and the well off. However, at the other extreme are those everyday people struggling simply to survive day-to-day within the same system. In this economic system, individuals and families are either thriving or just surviving.</p><p>Richard Wallace, founder of Equity and Transformation [EAT] in Chicago, is an advocate for those working in the Black informal economy — people who are excluded from mainstream sanctioned opportunities to earn a livable wage, and instead, use creativity and community networks to make enough money to piece together a&nbsp;living.</p><p>As we continue our <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">blog series focused on racial justice</a>, we’re speaking with leaders in the field to highlight their perspectives and life journeys that led to their work. EAT [an Omidyar Network grantee] calls out the hypocrisy of our economic system by asking some direct questions: Who has economic privilege in our society, even at more disadvantaged levels, and why? How and why does the state determine which forms of work are sanctioned while others are illegal? In January, EAT issued the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a> which examines each of these dynamics and more as part of the organization’s mission to support those in the informal&nbsp;economy.</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-team/nicole-allred/">Nicole Allred</a> conducted this interview with Richard Wallace. A transcript of our conversation is below, edited for length and&nbsp;clarity.</p> Nicole Allred: Richard I want to go back to the beginning to hear about your childhood, your mother’s transition into the ministry, and how that shaped your worldview from the&nbsp;start. <p>Richard Wallace: It was an interesting journey. I grew up in a single-parent household raised by my mother, who often worked two jobs most of her life. I remember when she came home one day and said she was quitting her job for the ministry. We were already poor, but in my mind, it was about to get worse! So, she left her job and began her work in the ministry starting in the church. She wanted to preach, but the male dominated system wouldn’t allow her, so she found solace preaching where no one else was, and that was behind prison walls. This is really where I get introduced to the practice of being accountable to the people you want to help and, in the inverse, who are helping you, and this is how I approach the work&nbsp;today.</p> NA: And you were about six or seven when your mom started the ministry, right? <p>RW: Yeah, she would take me behind the prison walls without a pause. I would go through the searches and be back there with most of the folks we consider “heavies.” They would tell me stories about what they would do in the ’90s in Chicago if they were&nbsp;free.</p><blockquote>“These were genuinely great humans behind bars, and I knew that when I left, they couldn’t&nbsp;leave.”</blockquote> NA: So, what happened next, and talk a bit about your own experience with the system and incarceration. <p>RW: My mom and my family planted seeds, but no matter how deep the seeds are planted, there are still things you have to go through and experience as a young&nbsp;person.</p><blockquote>“My mom moved us into a townhouse in the suburbs, and I was like an ink drop in a glass of&nbsp;milk.”</blockquote><p>I was the only Black person on my block. It was exciting to have a townhouse, but we were poor. Middle class integration has always been the goal for Black families, but the truth is there was a contradiction that exists there. Things that other kids did in our community I would get arrested for. So, what was really a maladjusted reaction to that lifestyle turned into a two and a half year bid at the [Illinois Youth Center] state&nbsp;prison.</p><p>So, I was going to visit these places when I was six and seven years old, and now I’m in this place in my teens. It was a rude awakening for me. It became one of the core experiences that transformed my life. My service to the people began there. Incarceration was horrible, but the lived experience after incarceration was much&nbsp;worse.</p> NA: How was your current work with Equity and Transformation and its mission born out of your experience being incarcerated? <p>RW: There are thousands of collateral consequences to being incarcerated when you come home. Your citizenship has thousands of doors that are no longer open to you. You don’t have access to employment nor college because of your background. What that meant for me is that I had to hustle to&nbsp;survive.</p><blockquote>“Unemployed people are barred from the system on which they depend for subsistence. If you don’t stay in the system, then they dare you to find a means of subsistence for yourself.”</blockquote><p>In my work organizing the temp labor sector around issues of discrimination and exploitation, many of the immigrant workers faced higher rates of exploitation because of their undocumented status. Employers were able to extract higher value labor out of immigrant workers than Black workers. Meanwhile, Black workers would sit for hours before being chosen to go to the jobsite because the immigrant workers were always chosen first. So, there was a lot of tension between Black and Latino workers because of this notion of “privilege.” That said, immigrant exploitive wages of $4-$5 per hour would never have been accepted by Black workers, and that is why these groups need to be in solidarity.</p><blockquote>“Our folks are literally out here working and dying to survive.“</blockquote><p>They are standing in a temp line and often being passed over. Ironically, I can work for a Fortune 500 company in prison making 89 cents a day, but I come home, and I can’t work for that same Fortune 500 company. It’s the same in the temp labor sector. I can’t work for this institution for full pay and a union, but they can garnish my wages and charge me for transportation to and from&nbsp;work.</p> NA: EAT is the only organization working to support the Black informal economy and recently published the <a href="https://www.survivaleconomies.report/">Survival Economies Report</a>. You reveal that policymakers are light years behind in the development of alternatives to formal employment. What do you mean by that? What are people doing to&nbsp;survive? <p>RW: When we started EAT, I definitely thought there was a range of things we could do including building informal workers associations built out by trade. The reality is our people are doing a multitude of activities. They’re hair braiding, scrap metal trade people, and street vending, which is a wide range of activities from selling DVDs to clothes. They’re ride sharing. There’s just a host of activities our people are engaged&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>“One of the patterns we discovered is that occupations that exist in the informal sector aren’t fixed. They don’t stay there for perpetuity. They migrate from informal to formal, and in that process of migration there is a lack of retention of Black&nbsp;bodies.”</blockquote><p>Let me break that down. Bootlegging alcohol had a high rate of Black activity. People could enter it and leave it at their leisure. Then it is legalized, and it becomes hard to find a Black alcohol manufacturer. People point to celebrities like 50 Cent and P-Diddy, but they own the label. They put the label on the bottle. We’re talking about manufacturing the actual&nbsp;product.</p><p>When you think about ride sharing, you get Uber, but you don’t think about the people who are already doing ride sharing in our communities. It supported people who didn’t have the money to take a cab or to own their own care. So, it was really about shared resources. Then it becomes formalized and makes billions for the owner but very little for the drivers using their own cars. Once again, the pioneers are left out of ownership.</p><p>So, I believe there are innovations galore. This is a pattern when I say our folks are innovative.</p><blockquote>“When you really begin to see informality, you get some of the strongest expressions of Black culture.”</blockquote> NA: There is also a certain level of organization, planning, hustle, and work that goes into these informal activities. The report reveals what goes into someone selling loose cigarettes, for example. You have to be at a certain place at a certain time or you’re going to miss your main morning rush. Come rain or shine you still need to be there. Even buying those cigarettes at the cost that you need so that you can then sell them at the right markup. There is so much that the report broke down that I hadn’t even considered. We then start thinking about COVID and how these activities require people to be close by. How have these activities been impacted by&nbsp;COVID? <p>RW: In mid-March it dawned on us that COVID was here to stay. We immediately took a look at the CARES Act, and there are two provisions that boxed out informal workers from receiving any aid — the child support clause and paying taxes. If they hadn’t paid taxes in the past five years, they were ineligible, and if they owed child support, they were ineligible. So, nine out of 10 Black folks who were informal workers were ineligible when in fact these were the people who needed the resources the&nbsp;most.</p><blockquote>“There is a consistent bifurcation of resources so that these people are said to be deserving and other people are not. What does it mean to self-quarantine when you are homeless? What does it mean to tell someone to self-quarantine in a home that may be more violent than the streets&nbsp;are?”</blockquote><p>We developed COVID 19 life kits to educate people about COVID because we were battling the ghost of Tuskegee and also the digital divide. A lot of our folks don’t have IDs nor smart phones. So, while the average person is watching the news, where are homeless people getting the information that is alarming the rest of the world? So, we developed the kit to myth bust and also provide mutual&nbsp;aid.</p> NA: Thinking about philanthropy and systems of power, what role do you think philanthropy should&nbsp;play? <p>RW: We need philanthropy to get behind us and invest in our experimentations of alternatives. It’s one thing to dismantle the system but invest in us to rebuild. Rebuilding requires experimentation. It requires us sitting in a room with the community, freedom dreaming and then coming out and testing&nbsp;it.</p><p>My experience has evolved from direct action to electoral politics to policy to research and has come full circle. So, the investment around alternatives needs to be deepened. We don’t want to just dismantle. We also want to rebuild, and the resources need to be there so we can do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Learn more about Equity and Transformation via their <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/survival-economy-report">latest report</a>, <a href="https://www.eatchicago.org/">website</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ChicagoEat">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/thriving-or-surviving-a-conversation-on-the-black-informal-economy-with-equity-and-transformation-f4225e52651b">Thriving or Surviving?

<p>The OpenID Foundation is a non-profit international standardization organization of individuals and companies committed to enabling, promoting, and protecting OpenID technologies. Formed in June 2007, the Foundation serves as a public trust organization representing the open community of developers, vendors, and users. The Foundation assists the community by providing needed infrastructure and help in promoting and supporting expanded adoption of OpenID.</p>
<p>The strength and viability of the OpenID Foundation is predicated on its ability to earn the active support of both individual members and innovative global organizations. Every member in the Foundation is valued for what they contribute to the larger whole and this is why it is so important that the Foundation strives to maintain long time members while attracting new membership.</p>
<p>As the Foundation continues to grow globally, it requires an increasing investment to support the day-to-day operations while enabling the expansion of the Foundation to include the certification program, driving new outreach opportunities – such as Open Banking initiatives worldwide, and supporting new working groups. The OpenID Foundation has not increased membership dues in over 10 years; the board of directors recently revisited the topic of membership dues and unanimously approved increases to membership fees effective July 1, 2021:</p>



Individual Level
$50


Non-Profit Organization Level
$250


Organization with 1-25 Employees Level
$1,000


Organization with 26-100 Employees Level
$5,000


Organization with More than 100 Employees Level
$20,000


Sustaining Organization Level
$50,000



<p>The Foundation recognizes that individuals and organizations have to make difficult decisions when it comes to both financial and time commitments to organizations like the OpenID Foundation. The Foundation cannot exist without the ongoing support of both long-standing and new members alike so the board of directors would like to thank all members and those considering membership for their support of the increases in membership dues.</p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/04/openid-foundation-announces-increases-to-membership-dues-in-2021/">OpenID Foundation Announces Increases to Membership Dues in 2021</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a>.

 Energy Web and Volkswagen Jointly Investigate the Potential of Blockchains for Energy Market Integration <p>Zug, Switzerland and Wolfsburg, Germany — 4 March 2021 — Today, Energy Web and <a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/group/group-innovation.html">Volkswagen Group Innovation</a>, the research department of one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers, Volkswagen Group, announced a partnership to investigate digitalization and integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure in support of advanced electric vehicle charging programs and markets globally. Under the partnership, Volkswagen Group Innovation and Energy Web will jointly develop and test open-source software to enable seamless end-to-end electricity market participation for electric vehicles. The test will pair Energy Web’s open-source tech stack with existing EV charging standards, including the ISO 15118 Plug &amp; Charge standard in combination with the PKI of <a href="https://www.electrifyamerica.com/">Electrify America</a>, one of the world’s largest EV charging networks.</p><p>EVs are known for their powertrain efficiency, lack of tailpipe emissions, and ability to run on carbon-free renewable energy, making them a crucial component for decarbonizing the transportation sector. But they can also add tremendous value to low-carbon energy systems. With digital infrastructure in place, grid operators can use EVs to avoid electricity network congestion, absorb greater amounts of renewable energy, and increase the resilience of electricity networks. The market for electric vehicles to provide such services is slowly maturing, with <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ferc-orders-grid-operators-to-open-wholesale-markets-to-distributed-energy-resources">regulators increasingly requiring</a> customer-owned resources be allowed to compete in electricity markets on equal footing with traditional centrally managed and controlled thermal power&nbsp;plants.</p><p>“With this partnership, we want to accelerate electric mobility and deliver even more value to EV customers,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “One way is to make it easy for EVs to seamlessly participate in energy markets. If we’re successful, the moment an EV rolls off the lot of a dealership that car will be fully integrated into the energy system in the area. Customers can then be paid for their EVs to help balance the grid in near real-time.”</p><p>Volkswagen is a global driver of e-mobility. The newly developed, all-electric ID.3 was launched in 2020, leaping straight to the pole position on the sales chart in many countries in Europe. The ID.4 SUV will follow soon, hitting the market in Europe, China, and the United States. Overall, the Group will be investing about €35 billion in e-mobility in the next five years and launch about 70 all-electric models by&nbsp;2030.</p><p><a href="https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/">Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) forecasts</a> that annual global EV sales will rise from 1.7 million in 2020 to 54 million by 2040, accounting for nearly 60% of new vehicle sales. As power grids around the world accommodate more and more EVs, dynamic “managed charging” represents today’s state of the art for EV grid integration (such as modulating the timing of EV charging to avoid large spikes in peak energy demand if too many EVs begin charging at the same&nbsp;time).</p><p>“We are keen to explore the possibilities that blockchain technology can have for smart charging applications and how this can have a positive effect on the ecological footprint and thus an increase in value for our customers,” said Marvin Schroeder, the project leader at Volkswagen Group Innovation. “At this early stage of the EV industry we have a great opportunity to shape and improve standards on how EVs like ours integrate into markets around the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Energy Web has been working with grid operators globally and <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">announced a proof of concep</a>t with Austrian Power Grid to use distributed energy resources — especially batteries — for frequency regulation. The same architecture is now being developed by Energy Web to enable any EV to participate in any combination of energy&nbsp;markets.</p><p>For the pilot, a Volkswagen EV and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) will be integrated with the open-source Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) tech stack. The Volkswagen / Energy Web partnership is expected to provide a proof point that EVs and EVSE can be digitized and integrated cost efficiently, securely, and compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to electricity markets and grid operator operational systems.</p><p>About Volkswagen Group<br>The Volkswagen Group, with its headquarters in Wolfsburg, is one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers and the largest carmaker in Europe. The Group comprises twelve brands from seven European countries, including Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, SEAT, ŠKODA, and Porsche. Every working day, 671,205 employees around the globe produce an average of 44,567 vehicles, are involved in vehicle-related services, or work in other areas of business. The Volkswagen Group sells its vehicles in 153 countries. With its Together 2025+ strategy, the Volkswagen Group has paved the way for the biggest change process in its history: the realignment into one of the world’s leading providers of sustainable mobility.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. Our Energy Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS) enables any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors the EW-DOS tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>CONTACT<br>Peter Bronski, Energy Web<br>+1.201.575.5545 | peter.bronski@energyweb.org</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-and-volkswagen-jointly-investigate-the-potential-of-blockchains-for-energy-market-97e6bd687fee">Energy Web and Volkswagen Jointly Investigate the Potential of Blockchains for Energy Market…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree Spec V1.0.0</a> 
<p>Working Group approved status</p>
 
 Sidetree is a protocol for creating scalable decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) networks that can run on top of any existing decentralized anchoring system (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, HL Fabric, QLDB) and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The protocol allows users to create globally unique, user-controlled identifiers and manage their associated metadata, all without the need for centralized authorities or trusted third parties.

 Migration to GHOST 
 
 DIF staff decided to migrate its blog, newsletter, and other content-hosting capabilities to the open-source GHOST self-publishing <a href="https://ghost.org">platform</a>. Over the coming weeks we'll be migrating our archive over from Medium and mailchimp, in the spirit of making our content more standards-conformant and portable. One bonus is that ghost uses markdown natively, bringing github and this newsletter into closer alignment!

  🎈 Community updates 
<p>DCMS Trust Framework - UK Govt.<br>
The UK government has published its draft rules of the road for governing the future use of digital identities.  The new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">trust framework</a> lays out the draft rules of the road organisations should follow. It includes the principles, policies, procedures and standards governing the use of digital identity to allow for the sharing of information to check people’s identities or personal details, such as a user’s address or age, in a trusted and consistent way. This will enable interoperability and increase public confidence.  The framework, once finalised, is expected to be brought into law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport">DCMS</a> are seeking feedback on the trust framework until 11 March, through a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">survey</a> that is available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 banks in the <a href="https://yes.com/">yes®</a> scheme enable online banking customers to prove their identity to 3rd parties with existing bank-managed KYC data. This data can also be used to seamlessly create qualified electronic signatures conforming to the EU’s eIDAS directive.</p>
<p>The banks recently finished the migration of all Identity Providers (IdPs) in the yes® scheme towards OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance (<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC &amp; IDA</a>). From a technical perspective, this means over 1,000 different bank IdPs participating in the yes scheme were adapted to support requests for verified claims and are able to assert verified claims in ID Tokens, UserInfo, and Token Introspection responses.</p>
<p>yes partners undertook this major investment because OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance provides all the necessary bits and pieces to support strong identification, including regulated use cases, such as eIDAS or eKYC, while being simple to use, versatile, and privacy preserving.</p>
<p>yes firmly believes that open international standards benefit every industry and they are especially crucial for the fragmented banking market to compete with new entrants.</p>
<p>Since yes operates an ecosystem with multiple implementations of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance, it’s aware of the importance of interoperability and the key role conformance tests play to achieve it. yes therefore decided to provide <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-directed-funding-faq/">directed funding</a> to the OpenID Foundation to develop conformance tests for OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance as part of the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Foundation Certification Program</a>. yes will also contribute its existing test implementation to the Foundation as part of its contributions.</p>
<p>yes hopes to facilitate the further evolution of OpenID Connect for Identity assurance and its broad adoption in the market. Furthermore, yes is hopeful that other Foundation members that have a vested interest in the success of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance will follow with additional directed funding and contributions to support the development of conformance tests and the expansion of the OpenID Foundation Certification Program.</p>

<p>The community effort to bridge DID methods with a new data model</p> <p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism. Standards are starting to connect and move towards functional interoperability, regulated by testable protocols. Most of this work is happening on the level of VCs. However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”<br>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>, 2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”<br><br>Dr. Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_%28PKI%29_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root%28s%29_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_%28C%29_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>. He has also worked with Consensys, contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">Seed Quest</a> project among others, soon to be donated to DIF.</p><p>Berlin-based <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom GmbH</a> has been a major interlocutor in the early development of KERI, since before the creation of the working group at DIF. Jolocom’s Charles Cunningham is the working group’s lead Rust developer, who has written a highly interesting post about mental models of <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">How KERI tackles the problem of trust</a> from a developer’s point of view for the Jolocom logbook.</p><p>Representing <a href="https://www.spherity.com">Spherity GmbH are the working group’s lead </a>JavaScript developer and note-taker. Spherity’s founder, Carsten Stöcker, has written a detailed piece for his company’s blog which called KERI “<a href="https://medium.com/spherity/introducing-keri-8f50ed1d8ed7">a more performant ledger for trusted identities</a>.”</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, has been co-developing on the Rust side as well, working in parallel and providing input on the design considerations. The Human Colossus Foundation has also put substantial energy into promoting and socializing KERI in the Trust-over-IP Foundation, the MyData community and in the Sovrin community, including featuring an hour-long KERI <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">session</a> prominently in a half-day <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">mini-conference</a> it organized.</p><p>At IIW31, the KERI developers will be demonstrating their initial work to date while there is still the opportunity to get involved and determine the course of KERI as the project moves from direct mode (two-party) to witness mode (multi-party, distributed consensus). Many sessions are planned for IIW, ranging from introductions to technical discussions to use-case and requirements gathering for KERI-based ideas. Additionally there will be a live demo of the working direct-mode prototype.</p><p>Introductory reading and video materials are collected at the main DIF <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">repository</a>, but even if you don’t watch them in advance (or fully understand them if you do), there are many ways to get involved and make this community project stronger and more diverse.

<p></p>      Now with more focus on growing solutions to deliver privacy, security and trust, CULedger announces company name change. 
<p>Denver, CO (March 3, 2021) – CULedger, an industry leader in privacy- and security-enhanced solutions announces today the changing of its name to Bonifii. This rebranding strategy reflects both the evolution of the company and its vision for future solutions.</p>
<p>CULedger started in 2017 as a research to action project from CUNA’s National Credit Union Roundtable focused on the development of a proprietary blockchain/distributed ledger network and a product exclusively used for call center identification purposes. As the technology evolved, so did the services the company offers. One of the strongest established use cases for blockchain or distributed ledger technology is a decentralized identity that supports the use of best-in-class privacy and security technologies.</p>
<p>Its flagship product, MemberPass(R), is an example of the exchange of verifiable credentials leveraging a combination of distributed ledger, biometrics, and cryptography to protect credit unions’ consumers and small business members. MemberPass is a digital passport that allows members convenient access to their financial accounts while allowing control and privacy of their personal information. MemberPass, powered by Bonifii, will change the way consumers engage and interact with products, services, and information in a digital financial world, and soon in other industries like health care, travel, and government.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Bonifii announced the acquisition of CUFX (Credit Union Financial Exchange) from CUNA’s Technology Council. Under Bonifii, CUFX will be positioned as the exchange of data supported by a systems integration standard and will allow credit unions to increase the speed to become more digital.</p>
<p>“The brand, Bonifii, is a play on the word “bona fide,” which means genuine or authentic and is reflective of our flagship MemberPass product. The “ii” at the end of Bonifii is a symbolic reference to our mission which is to deliver a trusted and verifiable peer-to-peer exchange network,” explains Julie Esser, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bonifii.</p>
<p>Consumers trust their financial relationships. Now financial institutions can invest in and deploy trust-first technologies to give consumers confidence and peace of mind while reducing fraud and improving the member relationships.

<p>The leading electronic interchange format for business documents enters the 60-day public review that precedes the call for consent as an OASIS Standard.</p> 


<p>OASIS and the Universal Business Language TC [1] are pleased to announce that Universal Business Language Version 2.3 Committee Specification 01 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>UBL is the leading electronic interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes.</p>



<p>The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:</p>



  A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.  A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.  A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.  



<p>Version 2.3 is a minor revision to v2.2 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 91.</p>



<p>The TC has received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ClearView Trade, the Swedish Procurement Agency, and Philip Helger [3].</p>



<p>The candidate specification and related files are available here:</p>

<p>Standard advanced by Danish Business Authority, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, IBM, Norwegian Agency for Public and Financial Management, and Others</p> 


<p>2 March 2021 — OASIS Open, the global open standards and open source consortium, announced that its members have approved Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) v2.0 as an OASIS Standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. The SMP framework facilitates dynamic discovery and capability matching between participants in a business community and enables addressing and routing in an interoperable and secure network to connect trading partners.</p>



<p>SMP v2.0 describes a specification for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner network, where entities exchange business documents through intermediary gateway services, sometimes called “Access Points.” To successfully send a business document in a 4-corner network, the sending entity must be able to discover critical metadata about the receiving entity, such as which types of documents the trading partner can receive and process automatically and which transport protocols they support. Trading partners make this metadata available to each other in the network, depending on the business processes they implement, always through an SMP service.</p>



<p>“The SMP is a relatively simple, yet powerful specification for registering endpoint capabilities in an eDelivery network that supports many-to-many transactions,” said Professor Dr. Andriana Prentza of the University of Piraeus and member of the OASIS Open Europe Foundation Board of Directors. “It has been proven a very valuable building block in application domains such as eInvoicing and the wider supply chain integration, which require distributed, dynamic discovery and portable registration of end user capabilities.”</p>



<p>“SMP was developed by the OASIS Business Document Exchange TC as part of its mandate to define an open standards framework to support public eProcurement and eInvoicing,” said Kenneth Bengtsson, Chair of the BDXR Technical Committee. “This specification describes the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover endpoint information. Once connected, businesses and government agencies can easily and safely reach any other partner on the network. This makes trading partner onboarding a significantly smoother process, and removes a lot of friction from day to day electronic trade.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The international nonprofit association OpenPEPPOL includes the SMP service as a mandatory building block in the architecture of the Peppol Network. Buyers and sellers can publish their receiving capabilities, which facilitate communication in various stages of electronic procurement and other business processes between public and private entities, in a total of 32 countries across the globe.</p>



<p>IBM<br>“As a longtime supporter of both open source and open standards, IBM is proud to support the OASIS BDXR TC to help achieve true frictionless global electronic trade. IBM Sterling’s ongoing contributions to supply chain and e-invoicing technologies like the SMP are instrumental to ensure the needs of our clients and their trading business partners are considered as industry and regulatory standards are developed.”</p>

 Nigeria’s revised Cybersecurity Policy  Codifying Bug Bounty Programs in Cybersecurity practice <p>When Nigeria rebased its <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2014/04/12/step-change">GDP figures</a> in 2013, many observers assumed there would be doubts about the new figures that made Nigeria Africa’s largest economy, after South Africa. Indeed, it was the former figures that were deemed unreliable, because they largely ignored the tremendous contributions made by new sectors such as entertainment, services, and telecoms to the economy. The Economist magazine estimated that the telecoms sector alone accounted for more than <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2014/04/12/step-change">25% of the rebased GDP</a>. Thus, Nigeria began the transition from a monolith petroleum-based economy to a more diversified economy. And with the expansion of the entertainment industry (for example Nollywood, second only to Hollywood), the remarkable growth of the financial services, and the greater integration of digital in the public and private sector, intellectual property and cybersecurity assumed greater importance.</p><p>The increasing importance of cybersecurity in Nigeria is well laid out in industry publications such as Deloitte’s Nigeria <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ng/Documents/risk/ng_nigeria_cyber_security_outlook_2021.pdf">Cybersecurity Outlook</a>, which details what observers of the cybersecurity scene in Nigeria already know — cybercrime has become more sophisticated in Nigeria each passing year. The covid -19 pandemic has also increased the risk and incidence of cyberattacks in Nigeria, as people and organizations are forced to work in remote and less secure environments outside the walls of organizations. The impact of the pandemic which portends some lasting changes to the nature of work and the increasing waves of cyberattacks globally (amongst them the infamous <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/solarwinds-hack-explained-government-agencies-cyber-security-2020-12">Solarwinds</a> hack) makes the recent <a href="https://technologytimes.ng/buhari-inks-national-cyber-security-policy-strategy-nigeria/">signing</a> in February of Nigeria’s revised <a href="https://www.cert.gov.ng/ngcert/resources/NATIONAL_CYBESECURITY_STRATEGY.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy and Policy</a> even more poignant.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/cyber-security-hacker-security-3194286/">Pixabay</a><p>On paper, Nigeria’s Cybersecurity Policy, and its <a href="https://www.cert.gov.ng/ngcert/resources/CyberCrime__Prohibition_Prevention_etc__Act__2015.pdf">Cybercrime Act</a> both specify a detailed and well-thought-out cybersecurity regimen for the nation. Nevertheless, the #EndSars protests of October 2020, which saw hacktivists <a href="https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/10/25/when-govt-agencies-websites-came-under-threat-of-hackers/">compromise</a> a number of government and private digital assets, demonstrate that actual cybersecurity preparedness is different from what is specified in&nbsp;policy.</p><p>To be sure, Nigeria’s Cybersecurity Policy has provisions for a National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre (NCCC) and a Nigerian Computer Emergency Readiness Team (NgCERT) which together have oversight over cybersecurity incident management in different sectors both public and private in the country. Aspects of vulnerability testing and assessment are also codified in the policy (for example initiative 6, page 107, “implementing an Enterprise Application Security Testing regimen’’; initiative 9 page 109 “Developing Blue team and Red team capabilities among cybersecurity actors’’, amongst&nbsp;others).</p><blockquote>Could bug bounty programs improve cybersecurity preparedness in&nbsp;Nigeria?</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2020/10/25/when-govt-agencies-websites-came-under-threat-of-hackers/">activities</a> of the #EndSars hacktivists, however, showed just how vulnerable key national cyber-assets are, and perhaps suggests including another layer of defense in the nation’s cybersecurity framework. Could bug bounty programs improve cybersecurity preparedness in Nigeria? Evidence <a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/why-every-organization-needs-bug-bounty-program">elsewhere in the world</a> suggests they are a useful addition to the range of measures nations and organizations implement to strengthen cybersecurity. Bug bounty programs are often initiated to <a href="https://www.stubnet.com.ng/bug-bounty-hof/">supplement</a> internal code audits and penetration tests as part of a vulnerability management strategy. Codifying bug bounties in cybersecurity practice in Nigeria could positively impact the sector and improve cybersecurity readiness particularly in the private&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Despite the promise of bug bounty programs, however, they face at least two hurdles in Nigeria. One is the perceived reputation the country already has as a haven for cybercriminals. This reputation is held not just outside the country, but also within it. This lack of trust will limit the effectiveness of bug bounty programs — which typically work by ordinary citizens with cyber skills unearthing vulnerabilities in digital assets. This lack of trust in Nigeria leads to businesses entrusting cybersecurity penetration tests to other cybersecurity organizations, rather than institute bug bounties. Another hurdle seems to be <a href="https://www.cert.gov.ng/ngcert/resources/CyberCrime__Prohibition_Prevention_etc__Act__2015.pdf">Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act</a>. Part 3 of the Act, “Offences and Penalties’’ has clauses that might criminalize the work of bounty&nbsp;hunters.</p><p>These hurdles notwithstanding, a bug bounty program could invigorate Nigeria’s cybersecurity sector, channel the energy of a new generation of cyber-professionals, and help to plug the holes in Nigeria’s cyber-infrastructure — as so brazenly exposed during the #EndSARS protest of&nbsp;2020.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/nigerias-revised-cybersecurity-policy-codifying-bug-bounties-in-cybersecurity-practice-5a8836c31c46">Nigeria’s revised Cybersecurity Policy: Codifying Bug Bounties in Cybersecurity practice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 2021: A New Year of Hope.. Implementing the Lessons Learned from 2020, the Good and the&nbsp;Bad <p>By Beth Kanter, Strategic Communications and Jessica Kiessel, Learning &amp; Impact, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>2020: The Year of Zoom (and the fatigue is&nbsp;real)<p>We began last year eager to put our freshly minted brand, approach, and teams into action to build more inclusive and equitable societies. AND THEN, <a href="https://youtu.be/gOxh_COf2VY">2020 HAPPENED</a>. In the midst of the twin public health and economic crises, we witnessed a racial justice reckoning and watched as our US democracy came under attack. We found ourselves — like so many others — balancing multiple urgent priorities.</p><blockquote>We focused on supporting staff and grantees through these difficult times, pivoting our work where necessary to meet the moment, and realigning our teams to capture new opportunities.</blockquote><p>Thankfully, even before the pandemic rocked 2020, we had shifted our accountability processes to recognize that contributing toward healthier, more resilient systems is long-term, complex work. Annually, we focus accountability measures on our ability to work with our partners to determine the most promising paths forward, what we have learned, whether we are living our values, and how we steward firm health. Over the long-term, we remain accountable for meaningfully contributions to healthier systems.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagining Capitalism</a> <p>The pandemic’s disproportionate impact on frontline and essential workers shined a much-needed spotlight on how our current economic system fails to adequately provide for working families. We were proud to be among one of the first contributors to the National Domestic Workers Alliance Coronavirus Cares Fund, which distributed $30 million in cash assistance to domestic workers in the US who have struggled to get by during the pandemic.</p><p>We also supported the work of Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings Institute, who produced a series of reports that highlighted the stories of working people on the frontlines and the need for “hero pay.” Her research and reporting led to policy changes in several cities to support these working&nbsp;people.</p><p>But even as the cracks in our current economic system’s foundation became glaringly obvious during the pandemic, the residual power structures have remained in place, and overall inequality only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/pandemic-widens-the-gap-between-the-haves-and-have-nots-report-finds.html">widened</a>.</p><p>Meaningful, structural economic reforms will likely continue to be difficult given political incentives that fuel gridlock and polarization, but we remain optimistic. We launched our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">POV</a> this year to articulate our vision to Reimagine Capitalism, and we are thrilled to have so many like-minded allies in some states as well as the federal government (so far, more than a dozen of our grantees and close partners have taken positions in the Biden Administration!). We see the possibility of real change on the horizon supported by some members of the business community, and at the local and state levels (like the organizations supported by the <a href="https://carryonthefightfund.org/">Carry on the Fight&nbsp;Fund</a>).</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology-2/">Responsible Technology</a> <p>As many workers left office buildings and students left schools following stay-at-home orders, our deep dependency on technology only increased. As a result, the power of those technology companies grew even more, and became clear and concerning to both the public (<a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/the-film/">The Social Dilemma</a> was a global smash hit and featured several of our grantees) and policymakers.</p><p>Building on our work outlining Big Tech’s <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Omidyar-Network-POV_Platforms-and-Power_2.7.2020.pdf">Unchecked Power</a> earlier in the year, the team released legal roadmaps for antitrust cases against <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roadmap-for-an-Antitrust-Case-Against-Facebook.pdf">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Roadmap-for-a-Case-Against-Google.pdf">Google</a>. The recent lawsuits by the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and dozens of state attorneys general — along with upcoming legislative hearings — against these dominant tech platforms are critical steps to hold their outsized power to&nbsp;account.</p><p>We’re also seeing success with the Digital Services &amp; Markets Acts in the EU that ensures platforms behave in a more fair and competitive way, as well as the increase in uptake for <a href="https://www.mosip.io/about.php">MOSIP</a> (an open source, multipurpose foundation ID system) in Africa and across the Global&nbsp;South.</p><p>In a sense, the “techlash” came of age at the same time people embraced more tech.

But, in reality, we are still facing many of the same challenges as 2020. We are entering another year of uncertainty, which will require deep care for our staff and our partners. We will be bold, get moving, and seize this transitional moment to put what we have learned into action. Managing this tension between hope and pragmatism will require important, but difficult tradeoffs. It is in this spirit that we set the following learning questions:</p><p>· What are we learning about what it takes to develop an internal programmatic structure that supports dynamic, complex, social change&nbsp;work?</p><p>· What roles and tools are serving us well in our efforts to influence social&nbsp;change?</p><p>· How can engaging and listening deeply to a diverse set of stakeholders lead us to be more effective in contributing to social change? What forms of engagement work more/less well?</p><p>From today’s perch, we believe these questions are critical for us to continue to learn and evolve as an organization in ways that help us contribute to meaningful social change. That said, we are prepared to adapt to whatever 2021 may throw our way, and our first priority will always be the well-being of our staff and partners.</p><blockquote>In 2021, we will continue to evolve as we use lessons from the past year to shape our portfolio. We will also be answering critical questions that will help us to further refine our role and boundaries (e.g., we define and advance <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">pluralism</a>). These insights will help ensure we invest in partners, systems, and processes that will not only increase our efficacy, but also foster a culture that reflects our values and enables staff to&nbsp;thrive.</blockquote><p>After a year of dramatic shifts and significant organizational transition, our staff is proud of the work we accomplished and grateful for each other, the firm, our board — and especially our partners. We expect challenges to surface, but we are energized by the opportunity to contribute towards long-term change on issues that&nbsp;matter.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/2021-a-new-year-of-hope-ce640aaa3a1c">2021: A New Year of Hope…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has approved <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> as the latest of Hyperledger’s projects to graduate from incubation to active status.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries provides reusable, interoperable tool kits designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. The Aries project grew out of the need for protocols, open source tools and interoperability test suites that leverage networks enabling verifiable credentials, such as those supported by <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy.</a></p>



<p>This major milestone shows that Hyperledger’s technical leadership recognizes the maturity of the Aries community and project. The TSC applies rigorous standards to active projects including code quality, security best practices, open source governance, and a diverse pool of contributors. Becoming an active Hyperledger project is a sign that Aries has grown in both community and code and is a big step forward for the decentralized digital identity community.</p>



<p>“This approval is further evidence that Hyperledger Aries is a breakout success for the Hyperledger community,” said Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation. “Convergence on common libraries for the exchange of credentials will help speed the development of urgently-needed solutions and systems, ranging from education to finance to the fight against the pandemic. Aries is key to that convergence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The TSC’s endorsement of Hyperledger Aries as out of incubation and into active project status is particularly important as the world grapples with finding trusted ways for people to prove their COVID-19 vaccination or test results. Aries’ maturity and protocol-driven approach to issuing verifiable credentials and presenting verified proofs has meant that Aries is a part of every technical discussion in that domain, and a core component of many of the technical stacks being deployed.<br><br>Key components of an Aries solution are:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0004-agents/README.md">Agent</a> Frameworks: In the digital world, humans, organizations and things need a way to store, manage and exchange verifiable data, including the crypto that decentralized identity demands. Agents do this work in a decentralized environment, and Aries Frameworks make it easy for anyone to build agents tied to specific business needs.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0005-didcomm/README.md">DID communications</a> (DIDComm): Agent-like things have to interact with one another to get work done. How they talk in general is DIDComm. DIDComm was born in the Aries project, and work on the next version continues within a working group at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md">Protocols</a>: The Aries protocols run on top of DIDComm and enable peer-to-peer application-level interactions among&nbsp;agents, and shows how they should be designed and documented. The Aries community has developed an approach called <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/305">Aries Interop Profiles</a> (AIP) that formalizes specific sets of protocols that any agent-maker must use to be interoperable across the community, and a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">test harness</a> that verifies interoperability across disparate implementations using the protocols that make up an AIP.  



<p>A Wallet is a common term for a mobile agent used by a person. Wallets are the important link that enables people to manage their connections, credentials, and other aspects of involvement in the decentralized identity ecosystem. This important area of work has just recently received another boost with the community organization of work around creating an open source mobile agent using the Aries Framework Javascript and React Native.</p>



<p>Aries also has close community ties with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> project, which is also housed at the Linux Foundation. Both projects are working on the issuing, holding, and presenting of cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials without the necessity of intermediaries. While Aries is focused on the tools required for verifiable credential exchange, the Trust over IP Foundation is a project working to define a complete architecture, or stack, that combines both cryptographic trust and human trust relating to decentralized identity.</p>



<p>The TSC commended the Aries project during the meeting for the project’s highly diverse contributors. Achieving a high number of organizations contributing to a project at Hyperledger is often a challenge. Congratulations are due to those participating in and supporting the Aries Project.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>A headline theme of our <a href="http://digitalnation.scot">Digital Nation ebook</a>&nbsp;is the inspiring story of E-Estonia, and how Scotland may emulate their success. 
 Lesley Riddoch and filmmaker Charlie Stuart travelled to Estonia in late February 2020 to make a film about this story, about one of the most recent small north European states to become independent. 
<p>Tiny Estonia (pop similar to Wales) sees itself as a forgotten Nordic nation, sharing its language, forest and bog-covered topography and Baltic location with Finland.</p>
<p>And it’s widely regarded as Europe’s Digital Tiger economy, performing an incredible transformation from terrible poverty in the wake of reestablishing independence just 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, Estonia became the latest small European nation to declare independence. Faced with terrible winters, they struggled to even find petrol for ambulances and the supermarket shelves were empty. But today, Estonia is one of the most successful small countries in the EU. How did they do it?</p>
  
 Video Summary 
<p>The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence all their lives, and they actually planned a lot of this transformation ahead since they had a firm belief that they would become independent.</p>
<p>A wave of young people took over dismantling everything. So they said those people who have been working for the Soviet Union and have been supporting this kind of things have to leave now. They need to clean the entire state.</p>
<p>And by cleaning the state, it means everything. The first years were tough for this new Baltic nation. They literally had nothing on the shelves of grocery stores in Tallinn or elsewhere in Estonia. They were in a very difficult situation. But Estonia embraced the new digital world, and in just 20 years, its GDP has increased fivefold. It’s nothing short of extraordinary. This transition happened within a generation. The Estonians have adopted their independence day as the 24th of February. It’s a holiday, everyone gathers together on this day.</p>
<p>Estonia first proclaimed independence in 1918 after two centuries of Russian rule, but soon the country was occupied, first by the Soviets, then the Nazis, then the Soviets again, who ruled for almost 50 years. In March 1949, 20000 people were deported, most to Siberia by the KGB. Two thirds were women and children under the age of 16.</p>
<p>In 1986, there was a seismic shift at the Kremlin. President Gorbachev introduced Glasnost to modernize and refresh the communist bloc. But in the Baltic states, the newfound political freedom gave the chance for dreams of nationhood to be rekindled. The Estonian people were preparing themselves for independence, all their lives through whole time in Soviet Union and then especially, intensely, during those three years they had the singing revolution, they were prepared.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of repression, huge singing events continued, the choirs were a symbol of Estonia’s unique culture. As freedom can’t be achieved by only movements, they not only were singing and shouting and streets, but they were undertaking hard legislative work too. In August 1989, the movements of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania combined to form a 400 mile chain of two million people demonstrating their unity for freedom. This was to catch media’s attention to pressurize Gorbachev. After all this, Estonia got its independence.</p>
<p>Estonia set up its own currency pegged to the Deutschmark, but the country had traded almost exclusively with Russia and so the economy collapsed. It was a government in crisis from the start. In 1993, in the midst of a Baltic winter with daytime temperatures below minus 10, the state coffers are empty, businesses face bankruptcy, pensions might not be paid.</p>
<p>There was a struggle to find petrol for ambulances and the shops were empty. Mart Laar became the first formally elected prime minister at the age of just 32. The unemployment rate was 40-50%. No countries were buying anything from Estonia as their production was really bad. The changes were really very, very harsh because they didn’t have money. People were patient, expecting that the country will grow up, will improve. And after this harsh time, there will be better times. The Estonians people had hope that Estonia will again flourish someday.</p>
<p>Very soon help and investment came from Nordic neighbors. There was were even food and clothing parcels from abroad. Very quickly, Estonia began to grow as Europe’s newest democracy. It was a society shaped by a new generation without baggage from the communist era, with new ideas and a blank canvas.</p>
 E-Estonia 
<p>Estonia’s main claim to fame today is the Digital Economy. Estonian education has fueled 20 years of digital innovation, 90 percent of schools deliver subjects using digital technology by choice, not compulsion, and 70 percent of kindergartens have access to robotics. Scottish education was once the envy of the world. Now a different small country is turning educational heads.</p>
<p>The education system has spawned a nation of digital entrepreneurs and innovators. Three Estonian engineers have built Skype with almost 700 million worldwide users.</p>
<p>In Estonia, everyone must have a digital ID. This is a compulsary document for absolutely every person who lives in Estonia. The citizens of Estonia use this smart electronical id card as their driving license also. They also get discounts from various shops by using this id card. This card is also essential for medical care because they need this card at hospitals and health care centre for their medical prescriptions.</p>
<p>This card is also used by the citizens for tax payment system. With the aid of this card it takes only one minute in order to declare citizens’ taxes. The citizens of Estonia have a great faith on their state law authority as they provide their all information of themselves to one institution. Only one percent of entire state budget is used in order to keep up the system. The citizens’ get back two percent of their GDP by using this one single solution.</p>
<p>It took three years after independence for the last Russian military to leave. Now, Estonia has an army of its own and an international peacekeeping role. It has 3000 full time soldiers with 20000 in reserve and the support of its Nato Family since it joined in 2004. Joining the NATO has cultural, economic, social and mostly political consequences on Estonia.</p>
<p>In Estonia 2/3 of the population live in the traditional country. They tried to keep alive their cultural heritage even when they were part of the Soviet Union. The country celebrates its traditions and identity big time.</p>
<p>The country has been criticized for a flat tax regime that leaves the well off paying the same as the lowest earners, just 20 percent. And corporations can skip tax altogether if they reinvest. One man well-placed to make international comparisons is the Estonian TV journalist Johannes Tralla, he is a former EU correspondent.</p>
<p>According to him oligarchy does not exist in the Estonia every taxi driver here is an entrepreneur and the low tax system is really beneficial for the citizens. In Estonia there is no dramatic class gap in society. The taxation framework in Estonia is really appreciable in the whole Europe.</p>
 Inspiration for Scotland 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPJ7IVFNEhI">Another video</a> shares a short case study of E-Estonia from Freethink, interviewing Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of Estonia from 2006 – 2016, telling the compelling story of the global success of Estonia as a digital nation leader, boasting the most advanced digital government in the world.</p>
  
<p>Ilves recalls how Estonia faced massive economic challenges upon achieving the restoration of independence in 1991, a time that soon saw the emergence of the Internet.</p>
<p>Toomas realized the opportunity was that Estonia was no further behind than any other country in this field, and so began pioneering their adoption, with all schools being online by 1998 and the framework for E-Estonia in place by the early 2000’s.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and Estonia now enjoys an entirely digital society – Via a single digital identity everything except weddings and real estate can be transacted online, including voting.</p>
<p>Not only is it a convenience but it’s also the foundation for a prosperous and healthy society. Being entirely digital has meant Estonia has continued uninterrupted during Covid-19, and their ‘E-Residency’ program has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninaangelovska/2019/04/25/estonias-e-residency-contributed-e14m-to-its-economy-e-residency-2-0-will-be-a-true-forerunner/#5cef94179da5">contributed €14m to its economy</a>.</p>
<p>A keynote theme is that size and money isn’t the essential ingredient for success.</p>
<p>Toomas now lives in the heart of Silicon Valley in the USA, and despite their vast wealth and being surrounded by the behemoth tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook, American digital government is surprisingly poor. Processes are still paper-based, requiring photocopies be taken to government offices, whereas Estonians can file&nbsp;taxes in only six clicks in two or three minutes.</p>
<p>Scotland, a similarly sized small nation and with an unparalleled history of invention, absolutely could emulate Estonia and achieve and enjoy an equally advanced digital nation.</p>
<p>As SNP leaders like <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/18554995.scots-must-seize-future-build-strong-digital-nation/">Martin Docherty</a>, <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18515370.agenda-follow-estonias-lead-digital-revolution/">Doug Chapman</a> and <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/17353185.angus-robertson-we-should-introduce-a-scottish-digital-citizenship/">Angus Robertson</a> have written for The National, Scotland’s opportunity is to emulate the Baltic nation one fifth the size of Scotland but that has achieved the staggering accomplishment of becoming the world’s leading digital nation, following their own independence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18515370.agenda-follow-estonias-lead-digital-revolution/">Writing for The Herald</a> the SNP’s Spokesperson for SME and Innovation Douglas Chapman issues a rallying cry for Scotland to emulate the similarly sized digital nation exemplar, highlighting how their entirely online society has meant they could adapt easily to the challenges of Covid-19.</p>

 “Estonia dared to dream and took that leap of faith; Scotland should be next.”

<p>New Zealand Women in Identity members Tamara Al’ Salim and Andrew Weaver were featured on a panel discussing Contact Tracing and Data Ownership. They spoke to the members of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS), a nonprofit based in Washington, DC, whose members are vital records professionals across the U.S. as well as other countries. Tamara and Andrew discussed their view of New Zealand’s response to the pandemic and the impact it had on the community’s behavior when it came to contact tracing.</p>
<p>Andrew described how New Zealand took a pragmatic and expert led approach to the pandemic, driven by medical recommendations and based on statistics and scientific data modeling, wrapped up with the message of kindness. With the continuing change in the pandemic’s landscape, and quoting Maya Angelou, New Zealand took the approach of “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tamara walked the audience through graphs that told a story about the New Zealand COVID-19 Tracer App including how its early inception didn’t have much uptake as New Zealand left lockdown with no community cases. The perception was , no community cases meant no need to keep track of our movements. As travel increased into the country, cases at the border increased as well, still yet, people didn’t feel the pressure to keep track of their movements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara went on to describe how the trend shifted dramatically when a community case linked to a ship at the ports got into the community, with a household of four people testing positive, the whole country had restriction levels changes, and the city the cases were in went into even high restrictions. This saw a significant uptake and a consistent trend of use of the app since then. New Zealand continues to report daily to its community on the number of border and community cases with none in the community since November 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara observed that complacency is natural and will continue to happen as people feel safe and not have the need to keep track of their movements. If there is any trend that is guaranteed, it would be the one when cases are discovered in the community people become more vigilant and keep track of their movements. That is possible the new normal in New Zealand. In the meantime, the message, is that is a collective responsibility, we all want to safe and be able to celebrate holidays safely, act like you have the virus, wear your mask on public transport and stay home if you are unwell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tamara is one of the Ambassadors for New Zealand and Andrew as an active member and supporter of Women in Identity encouraged the NAPHSIS members and especially many of the men to join the organization and support our work.</p>
<p>In addition, Kay Chopard spoke in the closing plenary about the Women in Identity organization and encouraged the NAPHSIS membership to become part of the organization and the mission. The conference took place virtually on November 30 to December 2, 2020.</p>

 Coming soon: quality-of-service guarantees for decentralized technologies  Why escrow-based service-level agreements (SLAs) are the secret to enterprise adoption of blockchain <p>During my entire career I have been responsible for delivering, operating, and improving enterprise-grade services — telecommunications, IT, banking — to global customers. I have learned two important lessons when operating the services in more than 65 countries around the&nbsp;world:</p>  Although the consistent delivery of platform service levels globally is key, the service experience is always local to the country. What matters is the service experience that happens in the real world, not the virtual one that exists on paper in contracts. The real world is where people live their (working) lives and services are consumed.  Transparency in service reporting, the ability to learn and improve from under / over performance, and a fair penalty / reward system are all essential to a sustainable and successful long-term partnership in the enterprise environment.  <p>For decades, service-level agreements (SLAs) have been central to enterprise outsourcing to IT and network providers, including software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. Managed services in particular come in many shapes and forms: from managing the multi-vendor environment to providing service guarantees on a specific technology stack. Managed services governed by one or more SLAs can be unbundled and agnostic to any underlying tech or they can be bundled with a certain tech platform (in part of boost enterprise confidence and reduce risk in adopting that platform). Both of these approaches matter for blockchain.</p><p>SLAs are understandably popular, because they provide enterprise customers with guaranteed availability and performance at agreed cost levels, and vendors with a stable revenue stream. This is critical when it comes to widespread adoption of new technologies. Being a good vendor is one thing; being a good customer is just as essential. Both are investing and committing to a longer-term relationship, so it has to be fair and balanced.</p><p>Yet the conventional SLA-based procurement model is not without its drawbacks. Contracting cycles often range from months to years, requiring major upfront investment on the part of both customers and vendors into requests for proposals (RFPs), solution engineering, legal, and implementation. Once a contract is in place and services are up and running, customers and vendors frequently face change management processes due to the nature of ever-evolving technologies and business requirements. In the event of contractual disputes, compliance and enforcement also take up significant resources. The biggest challenge I have seen in my career is that often these longer-term contracts can become a burden to staying agile and innovative. With the rapid pace of innovation, it is just not possible to predict how the market will look years from now. At the same time, a provider of the services needs to make a fair return on investment (ROI) too and requires a multi-year lock&nbsp;in.</p><p>Fast forward to 2021. More and more enterprises are exploring blockchain and other decentralized digital technologies and their governance mechanisms. Many are willing to actively experiment with open, public networks for pilots and proof-of-concept applications. But when it comes to deploying business-critical systems in production, they tend to default to existing operational practices and&nbsp;habits.</p><p>I see many companies turn to the larger consultancies and service providers to step in and provide advice and potentially managed services around the technology of choice. It can be a good way to manage risk — career risk mainly, as the operational risks have not gone away. This is of course also true in the energy sector, where reliability is paramount and system failures can impact millions of customers and result in billions of dollars of damages. So availability and quality of service are essential. How to deliver on these requirements with an open-source decentralized platform is the next big challenge that needs to be&nbsp;solved.</p><p>The answer is not to put a third party in between an enterprise customer and the decentralized technology solution to monitor performance and guarantee uptime. Of course this may provide some benefits, but it is an odd way to approach fundamentally new technologies. Indeed, one of many appeals of open-source tech and open architectures is that it reduces or even obviates the need for third-party intermediaries that add cost, process complexity, and opacity to&nbsp;markets.</p><p>In this new dawning era of enterprise blockchain, two big questions are emerging that matter for the sector’s&nbsp;future:</p>  Can decentralized solutions actually deliver enterprise-grade services with high availability and guaranteed levels of&nbsp;service?  Could SLAs that don’t rely on single vendors or require bilateral contracts be the secret to bridging from limited pilots and proofs of concept to full-blown commercial deployments?  <p>At Energy Web we believe the answer is yes, to both questions, but we need to stretch our thinking into a new space though where we enter into decentralized service operations.</p><p>The rise of the escrow-backed decentralized SLA</p><p>Conventional SLAs work well because there is a single counterparty to a given contract. That counterparty is known and contracted (and therefore ‘trusted’) to deliver the services. By contrast, public networks <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/">like EW-DOS</a> run on a distributed network of nodes, operated by multiple organizations, that collectively run services and maintain data integrity via a common protocol. There is no single vendor with which an enterprise user can enter into an SLA contract, but rather a network of vendors that collectively provide services. So how should we rethink the idea of the traditional SLA? How can we make chief information officers (CIOs) of enterprises, including energy companies, as comfortable relying directly on decentralized technologies as they are with existing IT and network&nbsp;vendors?</p><p>The answer lies in a decentralized SLA. And the basis of this new type of SLA — for enterprises and vendors alike — is distributed, multilateral trust that the services will be delivered according to the agreed&nbsp;SLA.</p><p>We expect that engendering that trust in a decentralized environment should involve posting collateral (often called staking in blockchain circles). This idea isn’t new; anyone who has ever rented an apartment has likely experienced the concept in the form of a security deposit. In the context of public blockchains, staking keeps actors honest and provides strong assurances that the blockchain holds a shared truth, not a compromised version of the truth (since staked companies are incentivized to follow the rules to maximize their rewards and simultaneously disincentivized from bad behavior, for fear of losing their staked collateral in&nbsp;escrow).</p><p>When it comes to the idea of a decentralized SLA, a key mechanism is the staking of crypto tokens into a kind of escrow account. Particularly when native tokens are used (such as EWT), this can be easily done via blockchain-based smart contracts. Staking mechanisms are already being used to guarantee trust at the blockchain level. Why not use the same mechanism to define and enforce the terms that are typically found in SLAs at the services layer? While this is an arguably groundbreaking idea for enterprise IT procurement, it’s already becoming a standard practice for blockchain operational and governance mechanisms.</p><p>By extending the concept of token staking beyond the trust layer of blockchains (i.e., the maintenance of the distributed ledger database itself) into the services and application layers of the technology stack, it is possible to provide guaranteed uptime, latency, throughput, and other performance measures that are customarily defined in service levels. This approach has the potential to unlock the full potential of decentralized technologies for enterprise customers and service providers alike.</p><p>For enterprise customers: A decentralized SLA allows you to easily procure IT and network services by opting into a pool of services provided by multiple vendors at once, and automatically enforce contractual terms in a trusted way. Not only would this approach reduce procurement costs, but it can also improve overall performance and reliability relative to the status quo thanks to the inherent resilience of a decentralized network. Just as it’s generally better to invest in an index fund instead of picking individual stocks, why bet on specific companies (with vendor lock-in) when you can hedge your bet across the entire&nbsp;market?</p><p>For vendors: While in some respects an open-source protocol may commoditize certain IT infrastructure services, it also lowers the barrier for customer acquisition and simplifies service delivery. It’s hard to make a profit on managed services today due to the aforementioned upfront contract costs, fierce competition, and commoditization of IT infrastructure. In a decentralized SLA approach, vendors have much wider reach and fewer liabilities (e.g., you can stop any given service and focus on others, while the overall network keeps&nbsp;going).</p><p>Service providers would operate nodes that provision various services to enterprise users. They will get paid for the delivery of the services by the enterprise customers. In return these decentralized service providers would stake tokens against performance guarantees (e.g., uptime, latency) to the enterprises using their services. In the event of performance failures, network and service users impacted by degraded performance or outages would be paid out of the staked tokens through slashing part of the staked&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Bringing the decentralized SLA to the Energy Web tech stack and ecosystem</p><p>Our goal is to put this theory into practice with EW-DOS, starting with the Utility Layer services. This approach will deliver all the benefits of conventional SLAs (i.e., pre-defined performance requirements and penalties), while remaining vendor- and technology-neutral, highly flexible, more resilient, and lower cost (e.g., by reducing complexity and point-to-point integrations, automating compliance and enforcement) than conventional bilateral arrangements. The payment by the enterprise customer and the staking of the services providers will be done with native token EWT, which is seamlessly integrated into the open-source technology stack.</p><p>For example, consider a grid operator who builds an application that enables distributed energy resources (DERs) to participate in an energy market. The application leverages the power of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to not only streamline the enrollment of customers and assets, but also manage permissions and coordinate data exchange among market participants. Depending on the size of the market, there might be dozens to hundreds of asset types, and thousands to millions of customers and assets. In this scenario, the application might require multiple Utility Layer services like the Key Manager (for distributed key generation and recovery) and Identity and Access Management Cache Server (for high-performance data structuring and availability for DID verifiable credentials).</p><p>Instead of locking themselves into a single vendor or product up front (when there is perhaps uncertainty about uptake), the Utility Layer offers a pay-as-you-go solution that allows the grid operator to procure identical services (in terms of cost, performance, etc.) from multiple vendors at once without having to manage separate bilateral contracts — akin to universal roaming for mobile phones, but for enterprise applications.</p><p>A natural skeptic might ask: How is this possible? How do you provide multilateral, guaranteed service levels (in terms of both quantity and quality) without direct engagement and contracts between&nbsp;parties?</p><p>I think it is possible, and when it works it will address the two main challenges I referenced at the start of this article. This new type of architecture will enable very transparent reporting on actual service quality and be delivered extremely close to the customer who consumes the service in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Also remember the famous point that was raised in 1880 by Henry Morton, president of the Steven’s Institute of Technology on the Edison light bulb: “Surely, everyone that is acquainted with the subject will recognize it as a conspicuous failure?”</p><p>And so to those who stay skeptical I would say, join the trials and experience it yourself. Expect to hear more from Energy Web on this&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Walter Kok is the CEO of Energy&nbsp;Web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">It’s coming: quality-of-service guarantees for decentralized technologies</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Two AMQP specifications now ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that AMQP Request-Response Messaging with Link Pairing Version 1.0 and Message Annotations for Response Routing Version 1.0 from the OASIS Advanced Message Queuing Protocol AMQP TC [1] have been approved as OASIS Committee Specifications.</p>



<p>AMQP is a vendor-neutral, platform-agnostic protocol for passing real-time data streams and business transactions. The goal of AMQP is to ensure information is safely and efficiently transported between applications, among organizations, across distributed cloud computing environments, and within mobile infrastructures by enabling a commoditized, multi-vendor ecosystem.</p>



<p>About AMQP Request-Response Messaging with Link Pairing:<br></p>



<p>AMQP defines links as unidirectional transport for messages between a source and a target. A common messaging pattern is that of “request-response”, that is, two parties partaking in a bidirectional conversation using messages. This document defines a common pattern for pairing two unidirectional links to create a bidirectional message transport between two endpoints.</p>



<p>About Message Annotations for Response Routing:<br></p>



<p>Large scale messaging networks may consist of multiple distinct sub-networks where addresses visible at one point in the network are not visible at other points. Where messages are transferred across network boundaries, addresses contained within the message (such as those in the reply-to field) may no longer be valid. This document defines mechanisms to allow messages which transit such boundaries to be annotated with sufficient information to allow responses to be directed back to the intended recipient.</p>



<p>These Committee Specifications are OASIS deliverables, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The specifications and related files are available here:</p>

 Revised Charter 



 Section 1: TC Charter 



<p>(1)(a) TC Name<br>Code List Representation (codelist)</p>



<p>(1)(b) Statement of Purpose</p>



<p>Many communities (for example business sectors and public authorities) exchange and process information in which commonly accepted semantic concepts can be expressed using concise mnemonics or abbreviations called “codes”. Choosing a collection of these codes can constrain the expression of information to an agreed-upon set, requiring the exchange to reference one or more members from only a limited list of such codes, variously called “code lists”, “enumerations”, or “controlled vocabularies”.</p>



<p>Code lists then can be defined as controlled vocabularies or coded value enumerations.</p>



<p>Examples of standardized code lists include country abbreviations, currency abbreviations, shipping container descriptors, and airport codes. Examples of nonstandardized code lists used between trading partners include financial account types, workflow status indicators, and any set of values representing the semantics of related concepts known between the parties involved in information interchange. An advantage of using a controlled set of semantic concepts is in localization where the associated documentation for the coded values can include descriptions in different languages, thus not requiring the coded values themselves to be translated, or where translation is desired, the semantic equivalence of values can be described.</p>



<p>Code lists have been used for many years, and they have been published and disseminated in manners that have not been IT-enabled for ease of computer processing. To date no standardized IT-enabled representation exists.</p>



<p>The Code List Representation TC purpose is to develop IT-enabling standards that support the machine expression, interchange, documentation, management, processing, and validation of code lists for use in any information technology context.</p>



<p>Business Benefits</p>



<p>The standards developed by the Code List Representation TC aim to be beneficial for any community that needs to disseminate IT-enabled expressions of code lists for the exchange and processing of enumerated values.</p>



<p>Key stakeholders are standardization bodies that need to specify code lists and their representation for exchange and automatic process, registration and source authorities that publish code lists, business sectors and public authorities that use code lists in their business exchanges, and implementors of software and services that process code lists.</p>



<p>(1)(c) Scope</p>



<p>Define, develop and maintain a semantic library for code lists (genericode) and related syntax bindings to represent code lists in XML and other machine processable formats for their interchange, documentation and management in any machine-processing context.</p>



<p>Develop any related technical specifications to support the use of code lists.</p>



<p>Promote genericode as the international standard for the IT-enabled representation of code lists.</p>



<p>Should the TC decide so, submit genericode and any other standard developed by the TC as publicly available specification to external standard development organizations (SDOs) and, where possible, fulfill their associated responsibilities of being their designated maintenance authority.</p>



<p>The publication of code lists is out of scope of this TC.</p>



<p>(1)(d) Deliverables</p>



<p>The Code List Representation TC maintains the existing genericode Committee Specification and oversees its evolution to the following set of deliverables:</p>



  a semantic model / meta-model of genericode  an XML serialization of the genericode semantic model, with the intent of backward compatibility (or even no changes) to the existing genericode  prepare examples of the use of and the reference to genericode resources  possibly develop new specifications such as operations on a code list e.g. create, add, delete, update  possibly develop new syntax serializations and schemas, such as JSON  possibly include sample non-normative software for transliteration between syntaxes  possibly develop a Schematron value validation script  possibly document the use of genericode as a sparse-table serialization, including concepts such as joining tables and foreign keys  



<p>(1)(e) IPR Mode</p>



<p>RF on limited terms </p>



<p>(1)(f) Audience</p>



<p>Anyone who works with code lists and has a requirement to transmit and process an IT-enabled expression of the code list values and/or their metadata between systems.</p>



<p>Also source authorities and publishing authorities who create, publish, and disseminate code lists, based on specific business sector or public authority requirements, including those with pre-existing or 3rd party code lists.</p>



<p>Users and consumers of code lists, who may also find a standardized IT-enabled deployment format for such lists easier to employ.</p>



<p>Those who are responsible for defining XML vocabulariesvmay be interested in describing a constrained set of values to represent agreed-upon semantic concepts in order to control information items.</p>



<p>(1)(g) Language</p>



<p>English</p>



 Section 2: Additional Information 



<p>(2)(a) Identification of Similar Work</p>



<p>ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32 has developed ISO/IEC 15944-10 that defines the business operational view of and the need for code lists, without the functional services view of syntax serializations that are in scope of this TC.</p>



<p>(2)(b) First TC Meeting</p>



<p>The first meeting under the revised charter will be held Friday, 05 March 2021 at 15:00 UTC/10:00 EST/16:00 CET/02:00 AEDT via Zoom. The meeting will be sponsored by Crane Softwrights Ltd.</p>



<p>(2)(c) Ongoing Meeting Schedule</p>



<p>It is expected a weekly or bi-weekly meeting online and occasionally face-to-face meetings when needed and where a TC member can assume the responsibility for hosting the meeting.</p>



<p>(2)(d) TC Proposers</p>



<p>N/A</p>



<p>(2)(e) Primary Representatives’ Support</p>



<p>N/A</p>



<p>(2)(f) TC Convener</p>



<p>Andrea Caccia, andrea.caccia@studiocaccia.com, Individual member</p>



<p>(2)(g) OASIS Member Section</p>



<p>N/A</p>



<p>(2)(h) Anticipated Contributions</p>



<p>The current deliverables of the Code List Representation TC, feedback from existing code list Source Authorities and Publishing Authorities.</p>



<p>(2)(i) FAQ Document</p>



<p>N/A</p>

<p>By Jozette Allah-Mensah and Nicole Allred, Strategic Communications, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p>Illustration by Superside.<p>“When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow we do&nbsp;it.”</p><p>These are the words of 22-year-old Amanda Gorman — the first National Youth Poet Laureate in American history. The opening lines from her poem, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/amanda-gorman-inaugural-poem-transcript/index.html">“The Hill We Climb,”</a> were first heard at President Biden’s inauguration and inspired millions around the world. Amanda Gorman was one of several youth who participated in inaugural events that day. They represent the next generation of activists meeting today’s challenges head&nbsp;on.</p><p>This group has experienced and persevered through cataclysmic terrorist attacks, economic disruption, the ever-present threat of police violence against Black and brown bodies, and politics that further divides us with every news cycle. Add to all of this the accelerants of the internet and social&nbsp;media.</p><blockquote>However, young people leading the way is not a new phenomenon.</blockquote><p>In the latter half of the 20th century and the first two decades of the 21st, youth have been conscientious revolutionaries working to ensure the words of our nation’s Constitution apply to all within our borders. Indeed, Martin Luther King, Jr., a 25-year-old Baptist preacher at the time he led the bus boycott in Montgomery, would be considered a member of Generation Z today. King and his generation of civil rights leaders, the people whose names we hear most often during Black History Month, serve as an <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/children-who-marched-for-equal-rights-inspire-a-new-generation">inspiration to the current class of emboldened youth activists.</a></p><p>Viewed from this perspective, the voices of young people must be recognized and actively engaged in our fight for social justice in America and throughout the world. Those voices include the likes of <a href="https://time.com/longform/never-again-movement/">anti-gun activists</a> and Parkland school shooting survivors David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez, global environmental activists <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit">Greta Thunberg</a> and Flint, Michigan native Mari Copeny, known as <a href="http://Little%20Miss%20Flint">“Little Miss Flint,”</a> and now Gorman. It’s not only important to recognize their activism but to appreciate that without it, we will fail to reach the next rung on the ladder of equity, opportunity, and justice in&nbsp;America.</p><blockquote>Without the activism of Gen-Z, we fail to reach the next rung on the ladder of equity, opportunity, and justice in&nbsp;America.</blockquote> Generation Z: The Leaders We&nbsp;Need <p>Against the backdrop of the pandemic and economic devastation, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2020-12-07/us-saw-summer-of-black-lives-matter-protests-demanding-change">the summer of 2020</a> forced us to reckon with the horrific murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, George Floyd, and so many others at the hands of police. We marched, protested for change, and the surge of the Black Lives Matter movement spanned oceans. We called for legislative action to strike down the pillars of white supremacy undergirding the foundation of the United States. We forced the start of difficult conversations. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/06/08/the-nations-racial-justice-protests-are-a-pivotal-moment-for-millennials-and-gen-z/">And at the forefront of this cultural shift was Gen Z. </a><br> <br>This generation has called for expediency in eradicating inequities across the map. They have refused to accept silence from brands that have the platforms to speak up and make a difference, and pushed back against those whose words are solely performative. For Gen Z, a crucial requisite for justice is intention and purposeful action.</p><blockquote>As younger people continue to step up and speak out, we must ask ourselves: How can we learn and leverage their activism to effect change more broadly? What does letting Gen Z lead really look&nbsp;like?</blockquote><p>When we think of <a href="https://omidyarnetwork.medium.com/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">dynamic futurism</a> and the forward-thinking solutions to the ever-growing problems plaguing our world, Gen Z voices can be the most powerful ones at the&nbsp;podium.</p><p>And when Amanda Gorman spoke on inauguration day, her words acknowledged the past and inspired future possibilities. In referencing the “shadows” rather than the darkness, she may have been referencing the work of those freedom fighters for justice from generations ago. It’s not completely dark, but there still remains important work to be done. Her final refrain tells us inherently what Generation Z is already doing, and how we can emulate their example to bring about positive&nbsp;change.</p><blockquote>“For there is always light, if only we’re brave enough to see it. If only we’re brave enough to be&nbsp;it.”</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-dawn-is-ours-gen-z-the-fight-for-social-justice-9da40f48b54c">The Dawn is Ours: Gen-Z &amp; the Fight for Social Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the approval and publication of a new Committee Specification by the members of the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC [1]:</p>



<p>XACML v3.0 Related and Nested Entities Profile Version 1.0<br>Committee Specification 02<br>16 February 2021</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>It is not unusual for access control policy to be dependent on attributes that are not naturally properties of the access subject or resource, but rather are properties of entities that are related to the access subject or resource. This profile defines the means to reference such attributes from within XACML policies for processing by a policy decision point.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>There’s a renewed interest in a more contextual, associative, networked future for the internet. One that breaks us from restrictive digital gardens. One that’s healthier, freer and safer. This piece includes a curated set of provocations based on community discussions in a limited working group focused on why the internet is broken and what needs to&nbsp;change.</p><a href="https://www.newrafael.com/weavings/">Weavings</a> by <a href="https://www.newrafael.com/">Rafaël Rozendaal</a><blockquote>Today’s digital public spaces amplify the inequities of physical public space. It’s a game of the top 1% driven by who can generate the most “viral” content. Systems that rely on the virality of user-generated content fundamentally lead to an even more skewed and inequitable future.</blockquote><p>-Jad Esber</p><blockquote>Today’s content platforms have a back-catalog problem. The content is delivered in ephemeral formats and creators lose out on opportunities to monetize their back catalogs. Incentivizing more discoverability and search within the archives will lead to more evergreen content and less content designed for virality or disposability.</blockquote><p>-Sari Azout</p><blockquote>The web is not finished. We have forgotten that the web was built only yesterday by a small, bold group of privileged men. They are not magical men. They are not distinctly different to anyone reading this, despite the grand technological-saviour narratives we spin about them. They had access to the right information and resources at the right time. They were told they had the right to build whatever they&nbsp;wanted.</blockquote><blockquote>If you don’t look, sound, and act like them, it’s likely no one is going to tell you that you also have the right to build whatever you want. You don’t fit into our current cultural narratives. Until we start telling different stories about who gets to edit, revise, and expand the web, the right people won’t show up to do&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>-Maggie Appleton</p><blockquote>Metaphors have a deep impact on the interaction constraints between us and the technology we use. To evolve to more meaningful and equitable digital interactions, we must be cautious in choosing better ones, as a collective.</blockquote><p>-Prakhar Shivam</p><blockquote>Building a better relationship between the internet, computing and people presupposes an inner revolution. As in M. C. Escher’s “Drawing Hands,” the riddle guarding the threshold is: where is the creative agency? The internet is a tool that reflects us, its creators. It is a tool that reflects the current state of our (consensus) knowledge — of, for instance, the nature of the human being, the value and meaning of human existence, the role of institutions vis a vis the individual. Our creations reflect and reinforce a worldview in which the creative faculties of the human being are placed in service of the accumulation of power. Imagine a socio-economic architecture in which the potential of the human being is consecrated as the greatest asset! Our conception of the human being would need to be other than what it is. The creative agency must first be seen, and seen clearly. (“By whom?” asks Escher.) Otherwise, its creations will take on the status of&nbsp;idols.</blockquote><p>-Caroline Nguyen</p><blockquote>Today’s platforms practice UCD (User-Centered Design) — where the user is a consumer, not a creator. Platforms over-optimize around the consumer experience and force creators to adapt their work to cater to the platform. It should be the opposite. Creators often struggle with the extra work on top of their practice: visual artists should not have the burden to adapt their work to perform well on Instagram. We must shift from User-centered Design to Creator-First Design.</blockquote><p>-Kirill Noskov</p><blockquote>The future of the internet has the potential to determine the future of humanity. Our lives are increasingly shifting to digital realms and spaces. VR and AR are set to become mainstream in the coming decade. And so will the metaverse.</blockquote><blockquote>Like their physical counterparts, these virtual landscapes stand to influence and mold all of us. This is a big opportunity in many ways, but it is also a danger. Will the metaverse also be built to exploit our insecurities and promote divisiveness for financial and power gains? What is going to be our guiding principle?</blockquote><p>-Sai Arunachalam</p><blockquote>When Alice ventured into Wonderland, she was asked by a haughty Caterpillar, “Who are you?”. Hesitant in her reply, Alice struggled to explain herself. After consuming several reality-altering potions, she no longer was sure if she was her ‘true’&nbsp;self.</blockquote><blockquote>As venturers of the Internet, we similarly teeter along a shifting sense of our own identity. Our Internet-selves exist within various narrative threads from fake authenticity, herd logic to genuine connections. We oscillate along a precipitous path between being data-driven in the knowledge we find to a form of informational madness. Each byte of information we take in alters our thinking. We should be more careful about what we consume. We must find the equilibrium between chaos and rigidity, lest we find ourselves becoming the Red Queen we didn’t want to&nbsp;be.</blockquote><p>-Daniel Jiang</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/provocations-for-a-better-internet-b5ba53585717">Provocations for a better internet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Catalonian Grid Operator Electra Caldense, Energy Web, and Bamboo Energy Announce Grid Flexibility Project  Strategic collaboration will leverage open-source EW-DOS tech stack and Bamboo flexibility platform to enable battery energy storage, electric vehicles, solar photovoltaic plants, and industrial companies to provide flexibility services to the distribution grid. Electra Caldense will also join Energy Web as a new&nbsp;member. <p>Caldes de Montbuí, Barcelona and Zug, Switzerland — 23 February 2021 — Today Catalonian grid operator <a href="https://electracaldensedistribucio.com/es/">Electra Caldense Distribució</a>, energy retailer <a href="https://electracaldenseenergia.com/es/">Electra Caldense Energia</a>, <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web</a>, and <a href="https://bambooenergy.tech/">Bamboo Energy</a> announced the launch of the joint initiative ElectraFlex. The initiative will focus on the deployment of a digital platform that will allow Electra Caldense to utilize the flexible capacity of assets connected to their electricity network. Other project partners include energy storage company <a href="https://www.cegasa.com/en/">CEGASA</a>, electric vehicle charge point provider <a href="http://www.VegaChargers.com">Vega Chargers</a>, and industrial customers <a href="https://www.topcable.com/">Top Cable</a> and <a href="https://recamlaser.com/en/home/">Recam&nbsp;Laser</a>.</p><p>Oriol Xalabarder, CEO of Electra Group, stated: “We are very excited to join Energy Web and Bamboo Energy on this amazing project together with all other partners and are convinced that we will be generating the necessary innovation and knowledge in order to face energy transition challenges as both a 100% renewable energy retailer and a distribution system operator.”</p><p>For more than 100 years, Electra Caldense has been the distribution system operator for a region of the Spanish power grid just north of Barcelona. Today it serves more than 12,400 customers. In recent years, Electra Caldense has undertaken a number of innovation projects, including involvement in the <a href="https://ris3catenergia.wordpress.com/2017/06/08/el-projecte-naencat/">RIS3CAT Energy Community</a>. Electra Caldense is the lead coordinator for the NAenCAT project within RIS3CAT, which aims to be a smart grid benchmark by providing distributed sensor, remote control, and automation systems. The new ElectraFlex project announced today takes such efforts even further, by leveraging open-source, digital technologies.</p><p>ElectraFlex is the world’s first decentralized flexibility platform tailored for the specific needs of a distribution system operator (DSO). The multi-faceted flexibility platform will use Energy Web’s <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/ew-dos/">EW-DOS</a> technology stack to assign digital identities to all connected assets and flexibility market participants, allowing them to self-register in energy markets, and offer services to Electra Caldense as well as the Spanish transmission system operator (REE) on behalf of their&nbsp;owners.</p><p>Further, Bamboo Energy’s software solution for demand aggregation will also be deployed to manage and optimize demand flexibility for two industrial companies, Top Cable and Recam Laser, a PV farm with batteries from CEGASA, and, in a second phase, a bidirectional electric vehicle charging station from Vega Chargers.</p><p>“Electra Caldense is emerging as a beacon of innovation for European grid operators,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “They’re showing how residential, commercial, and industrial customers — as well as their grid-edge energy assets — can become truly integrated parts of a dynamic, low-carbon electricity system.”</p><p>Xavi Bou, Deputy Manager at Electra Group, added: “The combination of an energy aggregation platform with a blockchain technology will allow us to broaden the scope of our services by offering innovative solutions to our clients in Spain so that we can unlock the transactive energy concept not only through demand flexibility markets but soon also on peer-to-peer energy transactions within renewable energy communities or other ecosystems.”</p><p>In the context of the ElectraFlex project, Energy Web will develop and deploy the EW SunSpec Gateway, an open-source toolkit for industrial single-board computers that will allow any distributed energy resource (DER) compliant with the <a href="https://sunspec.org/sunspec-modbus-home/">SunSpec Modbus Specification</a> to have its own digital identity on EW-DOS. “These gateways will be integrated into Bamboo energy’s demand aggregation software to model the resilience of each energy asset to enable the best strategy to maximise the value of their asset portfolio,” said Alex Gomar, CEO of Bamboo Energy. SunSpec is a trade alliance of roughly 100 solar and storage companies spanning Asia, Europe, and North America. Energy Web and SunSpec Alliance <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/sunspec-alliance-joins-energy-web-announces-strategic-partnership-43c8438f199d">announced a strategic partnership</a> in August&nbsp;2020.</p><p>The ElectraFlex project started January 2021 and is expected to be completed by the end of July&nbsp;2021.</p><p>In addition, on 17 February 2021, Electra Caldense became the newest official member of Energy Web. Electra Caldense will be hosting an EW Chain validator node and be an active part of the world’s largest energy blockchain ecosystem together with other utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>About Electra Caldense (DSO)<br>Electra Caldense is a distribution system operator founded in 1917 and since then guaranteeing power supply to more than 12,400 users within 10 municipalities in the Vallès Oriental and Occidental regions (Barcelona), among other regions in Catalonia.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://electracaldensedistribucio.com/es/">https://electracaldensedistribucio.com/es/</a></p><p>About Electra Caldense Energia (Energy Retailer)<br>Electra Caldense Energia is an energy retailer within Electra’s same group of companies, which commercializes 100% certified green energy to more than 12,800 clients, including residential and industrial customers.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://electracaldenseenergia.com/es/">https://electracaldenseenergia.com/es/</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>As summer progresses we have much to be thankful for in Aotearoa, even as we are in the middle of another jarring disruption.&nbsp; The workers at the frontline of our prevention efforts are demonstrating incredible stamina as they remain vigilant, while our Health sector continues to deliver ever-improving contact-tracing capabilities and prepare for the massive logistical exercise that will come as supplies of the vaccine arrive. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Technology has the potential to be a powerful and inclusive enabler, if we develop and deploy it with those principles in mind.&nbsp; In that vein our work for 2021 is well underway.&nbsp; We have two active initiatives underway, each supported by working groups of members.&nbsp; One group is tackling the challenge of educating the non-technologists among us about digital identity (work that came out of our annual Trust &amp; Identity research), while the other is looking at making the complex world of trust and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance less so!&nbsp; Each is meeting via Zoom on a fortnightly basis to connect on progress and priorities.&nbsp; You can register to participate here:<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/trust-and-identity-digital-identity-nz-2020-research-findings/2021-02-17/">Education (Trust and Identity Research findings)</a><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/online-dinz-reliance-initiative-2/2021-02-24/">AML Reliance</a>Also on a fortnightly basis we have our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/weekly-dinz-virtual-coffee/2021-02-23/">Coffee Chat&nbsp;</a>– an unstructured drop-in session where you can learn more about what’s happening in digital identity, and/or come with a particular problem or issue you would like to explore.</p>



<p>This month sees the recommencement of our monthly webinar series.&nbsp; Tomorrow we’re delighted to be joined by an expert panel who will share their thoughts on the challenges and opportunities ahead of us in 2021.&nbsp; You can register for the event&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/the-year-ahead-insights-on-the-future-of-digital-identity-in-aotearoa/">here</a>. &nbsp; Our March session will be the Summer edition of our quarterly Member Showcase.&nbsp; We have five slots available for members to share a case study or present a collaborative opportunity.&nbsp; Please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">contact us</a>&nbsp;if you have a story to tell and would like to be featured. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, if you haven’t already, I encourage you to read the update from our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2021/02/11/executive-council-update-and-seeking-a-new-executive-director/">Executive Council</a>.&nbsp; I will be moving on from my role with DINZ at the end of March.&nbsp; I’m excited by the greenfield opportunities ahead for myself, and also the prospect of handing over to the person who will lead the next phase of DINZ’s journey.&nbsp; Details of the role are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seek.co.nz/job/51507981">here</a>, so please spread the word if it describes someone you know!</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC) <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">launched</a>. This initiative is intended to define, in the context of test results and vaccination records for opening up borders for travel and commerce, a high bar for implementations of identity and credentialing systems to meet with regards to privacy, ethics and portability. They will also work with the implementers of such systems to converge towards common standards and governance.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>A set of Linux Foundation organizations – <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TrustOverIP</a>, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a>, <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a>, and its <a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a> – have engaged as supporting organizations and were part of the announcement. We did this based on very encouraging signs during formation discussions that GHPC would not only help bring many of the organizations emerging into the self-sovereign identity space into alignment on platforms and standards we have long championed, but would also give us an external reference point for our position on the importance of privacy in the design and implementation of such systems.</p>



<p>Hyperledger has been home to the pioneering digital identity ledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> and agent toolkit <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a>, which form the basis of so many <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/culedger-case-study">production</a> <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/kiva-case-study">privacy-preserving</a> digital identity systems and, now, are serving as the basis for many of these emerging <a href="https://www.evernym.com/travelpass/">health pass solutions</a>. The TrustOverIP Foundation led the formal recognition of the need and role for governance organizations in the digital identity landscape – showing how we can get both optionality and interoperability when we weave global identity and credentialing systems together in a decentralized way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Covid Credentials Initiative, starting way back in March 2020, recognized the potential for credentials of all sorts in the fight against this and future pandemics, and have pulled together an amazing community of technologists and entrepreneurs working together on this. Now, as part of Linux Foundation Public Health, we are working to bring together a set of software projects that can implement credential systems and help accelerate adoption of these globally, centered on the needs of public health authorities.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49XvVxLMTLw&amp;feature=emb_logo">Thursday’s GHPC webinar</a>, Charlie Walton from Mastercard said GHPC is “in the business of describing what good looks like.” We will be working with GHPC to bring our own communities’ views of not just what good looks like, but how we’re already working together to standardize and implement this work. Furthermore we’ll see if our processes can directly support GHPC’s efforts to harmonize this domain.</p>



<p>We recognize there are quite a few of these initiatives now, reflecting just how broadly this issue is felt across society. We can play – we must play – a key role in channeling all this market activity and good-faith sharing of expertise into applications directly in people’s hands, so we can get back to travel and re-opening workplaces and schools in a safe and equitable way. Our key levers to move the world are open source software and open public engagement, and we will double-down on those tools to have a unique and substantive impact.</p>



<p>Look for more on this soon within our communities. We’re incredibly excited to be a part of this global effort.</p>

<p>Papaki kau ana ngā tai o mihi ki a koutou katoa.</p>



<p>As the Kiwi summer rolls on it brings with it a sense of optimism for 2021 and reminds us how truly blessed we are to call Aotearoa New Zealand home.</p>



<p>The year ahead for our digital identity ecosystem and DINZ is one of optimism and progress&nbsp; too – with our focus squarely set on leading a united approach to digital identity for the benefit of all New Zealanders.&nbsp; 2021 will be a significant year of progress as the work to formalise the DIA’s proposed Trust Framework is gathers momentum.</p>



<p>In the spirit of optimism and progress, I would like to let you know that Andrew Weaver will be leaving DINZ as our Executive Director at the end of March.&nbsp; Andrew has been a true rangatira and kaitiaki of DINZ since its establishment.&nbsp; Working together with our members and Executive Council, Andrew has set our association on the path to growth and success and developed significant local and international profile and respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew is leaving us to pursue other opportunities and we sincerely thank him for his contribution to DINZ and the ecosystem and wish him all the very best. Prior to the end of March we will take time to acknowledge his significant contribution to DINZ.</p>



<p>Our mission at DINZ is to create a digital identity ecosystem that enhances Kāwanatanga (honourable governance), Rangatiratanga (self-determination &amp; agency) and&nbsp;&nbsp; Ōritetanga (equity &amp; partnerships) for all people in New Zealand.&nbsp; We are on a journey to become more tiriti-honouring by enhancing our practice to embody Kāwanatanga, believe digital identity is a taonga and we collectively have a great responsibility as Kaitiaki to treat people’s identity with dignity, respect and care.&nbsp; We have started the process of looking for a new Executive Director who will drive this mission and kaupapa at DINZ.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.seek.co.nz/job/51507981">Learn more about the Executive Director role opportunity</a></p>



<p>I would also like to formally welcome our new <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Executive Council members</a> who joined in with our first meeting of the year on the 28th January.&nbsp; Welcome and we look forward to your wisdom and guidance on the Executive Council.</p>



  Sat Mandri, JNCTN  John Evans, TSB  Russell Craig, Microsoft NZ  Luke McIntyre, MATTR  



<p>In the Government seat on the Executive Council, the DIA will continue to represent the government and we are pleased to welcome Alan Bell replacing Tony Eyles as the government representative.<br><br>We look forward to engaging with you throughout 2021 as we shape a new future for digital identity in Aotearoa New Zealand.<br><br>He mihi mutunga kore</p>

 Why the resignation of the Dutch government is a good reminder of how important it is to monitor and regulate algorithms <p>On January 15, the Dutch government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/15/dutch-government-resigns-over-child-benefits-scandal">resigned </a>amid a scandal in which the tax authorities unjustly accused more than 26,000 families of mainly low socio-economic background of committing fraud. An overtly strict interpretation of government policy led to any minor inconsistency between data, or any <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/world/europe/dutch-government-resignation-rutte-netherlands.html">failure to sign </a>one of the pages of the form, to be classified as fraudulent. The government, which has pursued a policy of zero tolerance for tax fraud, required those families to return to the state huge sums pertaining not only to the period in which the alleged fraud was committed, but up to 5 years prior to when the alleged fraud was committed. It was later revealed that applications from candidates with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-politics-resignation-idUSKBN29K1IO">more than one citizenship </a>were also automatically flagged as suspects, and so most of the families erroneously accused of fraud were lower-class immigrant families, sparking additional controversy about institutional racism. The draconian way of locating cases and collecting debts has led many families to considerable financial difficulties, declaring bankruptcy, and collapsing the family unit under the&nbsp;burden.</p><p>A parliamentary report entitled <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2020/12/17/parents-faced-unprecedented-injustice-years-childcare-subsidy-scandal">Unprecedented Injustice</a>, examined the actions of the government and put the blame on tax officials, politicians, judges, and other government officials. Although the report does not mention the use of algorithms as one of the reasons for the failure, given the reliance of the Netherlands and many other countries on algorithms to determine certain benefits, it is plausible that the default would have happened because of an algorithm, therefore the consequences of such occurrence should be considered.</p><p>Just a few months ago, a court in The Hague <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/05/welfare-surveillance-system-violates-human-rights-dutch-court-rules">declared illegal </a>one of the algorithms used by the Netherlands Ministry of Social Services to detect and investigate cases of social benefit fraud. The algorithm, named SyRI (which stands for System Risk Indication), was implemented deliberately only in <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/syri-netherlands-algorithm/">the poorest neighborhoods </a>of the Netherlands where underprivileged and immigrant populations tend to make up a large share of the demographic. SyRI also incorrectly classified many families as involved in fraud and thus blocked their way to receiving social benefits to which they were entitled. In addition, the Dutch Public Broadcasting Company (NOS), in 2019 <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2286848-overheid-gebruikt-op-grote-schaal-voorspellende-algoritmes-risico-op-discriminatie.html">revealed </a>extensive use of algorithms by many government ministries for determining where criminal offenses are committed, assessing how much social support each person will need and what are the chances a certain student will drop out of school. Government ministries are <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2286880-privacywaakhond-overheid-moet-transparanter-zijn-over-algoritmes.html">not always transparent </a>about the use of algorithms and citizens do not always know that a particular decision in their case has been made by computer software. For this reason, the Dutch Data Protection Authority intends to tighten supervision of the use of algorithms in government ministries due to the danger that those algorithms will discriminate against underprivileged groups.</p><p>As mentioned, the Netherlands is not the only country that makes extensive use of sophisticated algorithms for ranking and evaluating citizens. A <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25156">report </a>written by Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, warns against “stumbling zombie into a digital welfare dystopia”. Alston highlights the fact that technology is often presented as a tool that will increase efficiency, benefit citizens, and provide them with better services. However, in practice, governments use technology mainly to surveil and track citizens, particularly the underprivileged, and also in order to reduce welfare budgets and the number of people eligible for government support.</p><p>When the decision to deny eligibility is made by an algorithm, public officials do not always have the option to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692792">understand exactly</a> what led to that disqualification and they cannot always intervene and change the decision. Of course, the algorithm directly reflects the policy dictated by the government. So if the overriding goal is to detect as many social benefit scams as possible, the algorithm is calibrated to achieve the same result, and the same decision to tag any failure to sign or fill in a particular field on the form will lead the algorithm to classify the case as fraud, just as tax officials did manually in the Dutch child benefits&nbsp;affair.</p><p>Fortunately, the parliamentary committee that examined the state’s conduct regarding the default of child benefits was able to understand precisely what led to many families being mistakenly classified as involved in fraud. The committee examined the procedures and criteria established for the purpose of classifying each case as a fraud, thus exposing the fact that failure to fill one field in the form in good faith, or lack of one signature among many led to the misclassification. As a result, it was possible to have a public debate on the legitimacy of each of the criteria that should lead to the classification of fraud cases and to come to the conclusion that these do not constitute a justifiable reason for denying the benefit and labeling families as fraudulent. If the decision was made by an algorithm, the concern is that due to the technological ambiguity surrounding the operation of the algorithm it would have been much more difficult to point out the government’s failure and to restore the damages done to the victims of the unjust&nbsp;policy.</p><p>Hence, the Dutch case clearly demonstrates why it is vital to maintain high standards of transparency and supervision in algorithms that influence individuals’ lives. Principles of transparency and control help in maintaining proper governance and particularly help in holding accountable those who decide to adopt a certain algorithm or those who built&nbsp;it.</p><p>This story has been originally published as an <a href="https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001359618">op-ed</a> in Globes Israeli Business Journal, 4 February 2021 (in&nbsp;Hebrew)</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-the-resignation-of-the-dutch-government-is-a-good-reminder-of-how-important-it-is-to-monitor-2c599c1e0100">Why the resignation of the Dutch government is a good reminder of how important it is to monitor…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>February 9,&nbsp;2021</p><p><a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">1.7 billion</a> adults and millions of organizations do not have access to essential financial services; billions more have bank accounts but are unable to use them. Despite initiatives such as the <a href="https://ufa.worldbank.org/">World Bank’s Universal Financial Access program</a> and governmental and industry encouragement, many remain underserved or entirely excluded from the global financial system. For many, the basic societal need to hold monetary value securely, transact for necessities, and transfer money to friends and family is still out of&nbsp;reach.</p> Regulatory Compliance Is an Enabler for Innovation in&nbsp;Fintech <p>Thankfully, financial services continue to evolve rapidly, providing new avenues for people and organizations to engage in essential services. Alternative financial technologies (fintech) are bursting into the marketplace, offering innovative products and services to banking participants through direct, smartphone-based, non-traditional channels. The digitization of monetary exchange has also experienced explosive growth, often proving to be faster, more convenient, more privacy-respecting, and more secure than physical transactions.</p><p>These trends expand the risk and compliance challenges of money transmission beyond traditional banks to startups, enterprises, and nonprofits/NGOs, which are typically unfamiliar with regulatory scrutiny or essential compliance controls. Global regulators are currently monitoring this transition and looking to ensure existing regulations apply to new fintech players. This transition includes virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and other non-bank financial institutions which act as a conduit for the financially excluded and underserved or those otherwise considered ‘high-perceived-compliance risk.’</p> Financial Inclusion Needs Identity for&nbsp;All <p>According to the World Bank’s ID4D, “<a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/953621531854471275/pdf/Global-ID-Coverage-Barriers-and-Use-by-the-Numbers-Insights-from-the-ID4D-Findex-Survey.pdf">People with an ID are more likely to own bank accounts and mobile phones, and financial and mobile services are among the most frequently reported uses of one’s&nbsp;ID</a>.”</p><p>Identity verification is at the core of essential financial regulations of Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT). Financial governance leaders are recalibrating their requirements to keep up with the pace of innovation to ensure that bad actors do not exploit the financial system and that intermediaries of all types have adequate financial crime compliance (FCC) programs in&nbsp;place.</p><p>The fundamental right for individuals to participate in society no matter their origins or circumstance has long been at the core of the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>’s vision. The Foundation promotes control of one’s own identity to utilize digitally stored credentials to access and engage daily services. While decentralized identity has been a barrier in traditional banking, fintech and regtech have introduced the constructs to leverage digital and self-sovereign identity to drive financial inclusion for tens of millions of outliers.</p><p>Indeed, these new technologies provide great promise in modernizing finance, payments, and identity management in tandem. But related regulatory compliance is in equal need of modernization. Traditional legal compliance relies on legacy banking infrastructure. Its growth has forced the sector into a false binary choice: provide incentives for universal access or protect financial system integrity with exclusionary compliance controls. This choice has disproportionately impacted those who are in most need of essential financial services, such as low- or moderate-income families, and access to vital services, such as international remittances. The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of such entry to small businesses reliant on support and financially underserved or excluded households looking for&nbsp;relief.</p> Innovation in Governance, Compliance, and Regulation <p>Since 2019, Sovrin has hosted the Compliance and Payments Task Force (CPTF), an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts. The CPTF has developed and promoted the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and VASP processes.</p><p>The Rulebook serves to ensure essential global banking compliance while accommodating fintech’s seamless experience and smooth flow of funds for members and reinforcing the application and intersection with traditional banking rails. The Rulebook defines technical standards for end-to-end transaction flows and service-level agreements between parties to reflect the operational realities of an increasingly decentralized and cross-border financial system.</p><p>As part and parcel of regulatory compliance to expand the operational focus of the CPTF to serve the Identity for All mission and advance inclusion, the Group has reimagined into the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit">Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a>. The CIFWG builds on the tactical efforts of the CPTF, with a robust and ambitious mandate: promoting financial inclusion as a critical enabler. CIFWG will monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and underserved, focusing on how economic and regulatory technologies, supported by self-sovereign identity (SSI), can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and the associative risks injected by innovation.</p><p>With the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Rulebook</a> as an anchor framework, the Group will facilitate the advancement of financial inclusion and a modernized application of established global banking requirements and the attendant and necessary FCC protocols. CIFWG is also engaging with other international organizations, initiatives, and regulatory-led groups that advance financial inclusion and modern regulatory compliance solutions. Its ultimate goal is to promote access to traditional and non-traditional financial services and highlight the resulting benefits of building economic resilience and prosperity.</p><p>CIFWG believes that SSI is a powerful enabler for security, compliance, and inclusion&nbsp;. “Our bedrock approach recognizes that any institution today can be a financial services provider; our job is enabling their full participation in the global banking system,” says Amit Sharma, CIFWG Chair. “Digital finance is not new, although the cryptographic creation and representation of value show promising applications to democratize finance truly. Innovative and modern FCC approaches must meet market innovation. We encourage all who are interested in joining us in the CIFWG to help facilitate a pathway to a more sustainable economic future for&nbsp;all.”</p><p>For more details about the Working Group and instructions on how to join, please see the Compliance and Inclusive Finance <a href="https://sovrin.org/inclusive-finance/">webpage</a> or contact <a href="mailto:cifwg@sovrin.org">cifwg@sovrin.org</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/promoting-banking-for-all-announcing-the-compliance-inclusive-finance-working-group-cifwg/">https://sovrin.org</a> on February 9,&nbsp;2021.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>At Equifax, I work with governments across Canada to help them utilize data, insights and analytics to make policy decisions more data driven. We also have fraud and authentication solutions that tend to work well for government departments administering social assistance programs. We are a member of DIACC and I am a Co-Chair of the Outreach Committee this year. We’re focused on getting lots of identity content out, on topics that might need more explaining like facial recognition technology, for example. It gets me out of bed in the morning because I enjoy the people I am working with and these are problems I really enjoy solving.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>That is a long story. My Dad was (and still is) the Mayor of the small town I grew up in, so I quite literally grew up in politics. In university, my desire to understand how governments worked was strong so I started doing internships. I got hired at Queen’s Park as my first job out of university and ended up in the Ministry of Finance. That led me to the financial services sector where I first got introduced to the world of identity and authentication as more transactions started happening online.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>My degree is in Environmental Policy so I always felt like I didn’t belong in financial services or technology. The most important lesson I have learned along the way is that hard work and a strong willingness to learn and execute is just as important as credentials. Work hard, have a growth mindset, and don’t be intimidated.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START /STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>There are a lot of solutions out there today and the sector is evolving so fast. What we are starting to do really well and need to continue to do is collaborate. I have been part of many co-pitches now<br>
and it is really fun.</p>
<p>What we need to start to focus on more is how do we better reach the general public and build trust? That’s not any one person or organization’s role, but it is a focus of the DIACC outreach committee because we believe that education will help adoption.</p>
<p>Communication is so important, and one thing I think we should stop doing is speaking too technically about product benefits and features. Let’s talk instead about values and solving customers problems. Identity solves so many customer problems and it will help people and organizations connect the dots.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>We need different perspectives around the table in order to make informed decisions.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>I recently read The Choice by Dr. Edith Eva Edger. She is a psychologist and one of the last remaining Holocaust survivors. It is one of those life changing books. Although the book is about struggle and suffering, it is an inspiration.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Don’t limit yourself to things that you know, accept failure as part of the skill development process.</p>
 Where can we find you on social media?

 Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global&nbsp;Economy <p>Today, <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> announced the launch of the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> along with more than 25 leading individual companies and organizations in the technology, health, and travel sectors — including the Airports Council International (ACI), Commons Project Foundation, COVID-19 Credentials Initiative, Evernym, Hyperledger, IBM, International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Linux Foundation Public Health, Lumedic, Mastercard, Trust Over IP Foundation, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is an open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative to create a blueprint for interoperable digital health pass systems that will help restore global travel and restart the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every segment of the global economy, but none as profoundly as<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/industries-most-and-least-impacted-by-covid19-from-a-probability-of-default-perspective-september-2020-update"> travel and tourism</a>. Last year, airlines lost an estimated<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-24-01/"> $118.5 billion USD</a> with related impacts across the economy in excess of <a href="https://www.unwto.org/impact-assessment-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-on-international-tourism">$2 trillion&nbsp;USD</a>.</p><p>In conjunction with the announcement, the Collaborative also released its first white paper, entitled, <a href="https://goodhealthpass.org/good_health_pass-a_safe_path_to_global_reopening">Good Health Pass: A Safe Path to Global Reopening</a>.</p> Collaboration Among a New Ecosystem of&nbsp;Players <blockquote>“There’s one thing the world agrees on — we need to address the health concerns today to support a return to normalcy,” said Ajay Bhalla, President of Cyber &amp; Intelligence at Mastercard. “Delivering a global, interoperable health pass system can only happen if we come together in a way that meets the needs of everyone involved. This Collaborative will be critical in helping to define how we connect the pieces that will bring travel back safely, spark job creation and jumpstart the world’s economic&nbsp;engine.”</blockquote><p>Various efforts are currently underway to develop digital health credentials systems — both vaccination and test certificates — for international travel. Yet, despite this race to market, it is unlikely that a single solution will be implemented universally — or even across the entire travel industry. Thus, it is critical that solutions are designed from the onset to be interoperable — both with one another and across institutional and geographic borders.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is not intended to supplant existing efforts but rather to help weave them together, fill gaps where they may exist, and facilitate collaboration among a new ecosystem of stakeholders, many of whom have never worked together&nbsp;before.</p><blockquote>“Fragmentation is a risk we simply cannot ignore,” said ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener. “To be valuable to users, credentials need to be accepted at check-in, upon arrival by border control agencies, and more. We can get there — even with multiple systems — as long as solutions adhere to open standards and participate in a common governance framework. But without these, fragmentation is inevitable, and travelers — and the economy — will continue to suffer needlessly as a&nbsp;result.”</blockquote> Global Travel &amp; Digital Health Credentials <p>COVID-19 test results are already required for entry at some airports and at international borders. But existing paper-based certificates are easy to lose, unnecessarily expose sensitive personal information, and are prone to fraud and counterfeiting.</p><p>By contrast, digital health credentials can be printed (e.g., as a QR code) or stored on an individual’s mobile phone. They enhance user privacy and “bind” an individual’s identity to their test result or vaccination certificate, thus enabling real-time, fraud-resistant digital verification.</p><blockquote>“Our health data consists of the most sensitive personal information, deserving of the strongest privacy,” said Dr. Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security By Design Centre. “Release of our health data must be under our personal control. The Good Health Pass does just that: With Privacy by Design embedded throughout, you control the release of your digital health data, and to whom; all de-identified and decentralized. Privacy and functionality: Win/Win!”</blockquote><p>The World Health Organization recently convened the Smart Vaccination Certificate Consortium to establish standards for vaccination certificates, but no analogous effort currently exists for test certificates. Given that it is expected to take years for vaccines to be universally available globally, widespread testing will remain an essential public health tool — and one that must continue alongside vaccination to ensure a safe and equitable return to public&nbsp;life.</p><p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative has defined four primary requirements that digital health credential systems for international travel must&nbsp;satisfy:</p>  Cross-border: Solutions must work at airports, airlines, ports-of-call, and borders worldwide and comply with international and local regulations.  Cross-industry: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors.  Secure &amp; privacy-protecting: Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. Solutions must comply with all relevant security, privacy, and data protection regulations and must be able to bind the presenter of the credential to the credential itself at the required level of assurance.  Frictionless: Solutions must seamlessly integrate into testing and travel processes, thus enhancing and streamlining the experience for individuals and airlines alike. Solutions must not add new material costs for travelers. Optimally, validation processes will be contactless to maintain or enhance&nbsp;hygiene.  <p>The Collaborative welcomes the participation of policymakers and representatives of government agencies; companies in the health, technology, and travel sectors; and civil society organizations who share a commitment to safely restoring international travel and economic activity while simultaneously ensuring that equity, privacy, and other civil liberties are protected.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more, please visit the Good Health Pass website at <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">goodhealthpass.org</a>.</p> Endorsing Organizations   Affinidi  Airport Council International (ACI)  Airside  analizA  AOKpass  Bindle Systems  BLOK Solutions  CLEAR  The Commons Project Foundation  Covid Credential Initiative (CCI)  Daon  Everynym  Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design&nbsp;Centre  Grameen Foundation  Hyperledger  IBM  idRamp  International Chamber of Commerce&nbsp;(ICC)  iProov  Linux Foundation Public&nbsp;Health  Lumedic  Mastercard  MIT SafePaths  National Aviation Services&nbsp;(NAS)  Panta  PathCheck Foundation  Prescryptive Health  SITA  STChealth  Trust Over IP Foundation  ZAKA   <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">Good Health Pass: A New Cross-Sector Initiative to Restore Global Travel and Restart the Global…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>In this video author and tech entrepreneur Mark Logan is invited by Glasgow Talks to provide the audience an overview of his recommendations to the Scottish Government to stimulate and accelerate the maturity of Scotland’s Technology Ecosystem, with a focus on education, infrastructure and funding. 
<p>Commissioned by Kate Forbes, Mark Logan former COO for Skyscanner, has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-technology-ecosystem-review/">published a report</a> identifying how Scotland might accelerate growth of its tech ecosystem. Mark joins the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce to share his thoughts on the strategy.</p>
 What is a technology ecosystem? 
<p>Before summarizing the video, let’s talk about what is technology ecosystem and what does it do?</p>
<p>The term “ecosystem” was first used by British ecologist Arthur Tansley back in 1935 to describe the relationship between organisms and their environment.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight years later, business strategist James F. Moore co-opted the word in the Harvard Business Review article to describe the interconnected business world. Moore suggested that companies weren’t members of a single industry, but rather part of a business ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ecosystems now include communities that use shared, scalable resources to pursue challenging objectives and common interests. Ecosystems are about dynamic interactions between people, software, data, systems and services.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>The First Minister announced that the people of Scotland must keep pace with digital innovation and by doing so they can help boost economic growth, drive innovation and protect businesses against any future crisis.</p>
  
<p>With over 25 years experience, Mark is focused on helping to nurture the start-up community in Scotland and the UK as an investor, non-executive director and advisor. Mark is also a Professor in the School of Computing Science at University of Glasgow.</p>
<p>He undertook a review of the Scottish tech sector and delivered a blueprint to raise it to world-class status. The people of Scotland are now working to take forward his ambitious recommendations including the establishment of a national network of hubs for tech startups offering world-class training program, intensive monitoring and access to funding opportunities.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem has inputs and outputs. The inputs are people, infrastructure, education and funding. The outputs are a stream of business and scaled tech business. To increase the rate of startups we can consider that inside the ecosystem box there is a distinct life-cycle of growth, there are pre-startups, startups, small scale ups and large scale ups.</p>
<p>There is an opportunity gap within this ecosystem box. The report is trying to identify the interventions and to support the inner lines to move forward towards the outer maturity. An ecosystem of a country reaches its tipping point where there’s sufficient critical mass of startups and scale ups that certain virtuous network effects start to operate.</p>
<p>There are three main drivers of this. The first one is attracting talent from outside the ecosystem, second creation of opportunities for them and the by-product is more commercial people. After the tipping point there is investment of money and expertise. The government of Scotland is very close to the tipping point as he sees more talent and ambition in the ecosystem.</p>
 Education 
<p>Currently Finland has the most high-tech ecosystem in the world, having been an early adopter of a technology ecosystem approach. In his report he has drawn out three foundations of technology ecosystem success, namely talent, education infrastructure and funding.</p>
<p>By increasing the supply of engineers and by creating potential tech entrepreneurs, the growth of tech ecosystem is accelerated. The education infrastructure relates to two core foundations – One is physical infrastructure and the other is social infrastructure. In the report he explains this through a definition of a market square, a place where people come together in different forums small and large and learn from each other and learn internationally and build a sense of community and identity and ability to find each other.</p>
<p>Funding covers different types of investment through different stages of requirements of a company’s growth. He has made 34 recommendations in his report to build these foundations of a tech ecosystem. Some of these recommendations have huge long-term leverage value.</p>
<p>Another key recommendation is to expand the involvement of children in Computer Science from an early age, so that they can be the potential future tech entrepreneurs. This is like planting the seeds for future growth, and&nbsp;Computer Science should be treated in education the same way that math and physics is treated for the growth of tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>It will take some time to teach students Computer Science at initial level and to increase the number of CS teachers at schools. Upscaling and reskilling of the teachers is also essential because CS changes rapidly. Inviting industry people to teach the classes, making room for programming projects and changing the syllabus will contribute to the growth of tech-ecosystem.</p>
 Incubators and Accelerators 
<p>Incubator and accelerator are the two terms that people have heard of most for startups. An incubator gives indefinite tenure subject to certain criteria and creates like a market square environment where people can learn from each other.</p>
<p>Accelerators tend to be different they tend to be relatively short-lived programs for like 12 weeks to 16 weeks and these tend to have an education element which shares lessons and success stories so.</p>
<p>The primary issue is that the government can do a better job of creating credible high-growth startups that can convince people that Scotland can repeatedly grow global scale up level businesses, and the challenge of education infrastructure, and availability of funding is essential for all stages of the startup life-cycle.</p>

<p>Team FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The second and final day of the Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead: Virtual Policy Forum event on Feb. 5 brought together government officials, tech experts and policy advocates in a packed agenda.</p>



<p>The two-day event was hosted by the FIDO Alliance together with the Better Identity Coalition and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and had over 1,000 registered attendees. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/identity-authentication-and-the-road-ahead-virtual-policy-forum-day-1/">first day</a> of the event saw sessions that outlined the clear and present need for the government and industry to make identity and strong authentication systems more pervasive, to help protect and serve individuals and businesses alike. The second day in contrast had a strong focus on the need for strong authentication and was highlighted by an expert panel that explained how FIDO authentication was able to help secure the 2020 U.S. election.</p>



<p>The day’s event kicked off with a keynote from Congressman John Katko (R-NY) who emphasized the critical need for secure digital identity.</p>



  



<p>“Our homeland security, national security, economic security and way of life are threatened in unprecedented ways by highly sophisticated adversaries and simply being vigilant is no longer enough,” Katko (pictured) said. “Today’s threat environment demands a posture of unwavering resilience. This is particularly true for ensuring the sanctity and resilience of our digital identities.” </p>



<p>How FIDO Helped to Secure the 2020 Election</p>



<p>The resilience of digital identity and strong authentication was called into question during the 2016 election cycle when hackers were able to infiltrate the email accounts of Democratic party staffers, notably the attack of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta’s gmail account.</p>



  



<p>The same type of event didn’t re-occur during the 2020 election cycle, in part thanks to FIDO standards and a concerted effort to make sure that both Democratic and Republican party officials had access to strong authentication. In a panel during the event, Michael Kaiser, President and CEO of <a href="https://www.defendcampaigns.org/">Defending Digital Campaigns</a> (pictured) explained that his organization was created to help solve the challenge of political campaigns not having the right cybersecurity resources to defend themselves. As companies cannot directly donate to campaigns, Defending Digital Campaigns was formed to act as an intermediary, that enables political campaigns to get cybersecurity services including FIDO based strong authentication resources, for free or low cost. </p>



<p>Kaiser explained that political campaigns are not like a typical organization in that they are short lived and don’t have long term thinking about a security maturity model. Despite that, political campaigns need to be protected as they sit on incredibly valuable and important information.</p>



<p>“I think we gave away more than 10,000 security keys in the political sector in the 2020 cycle,” Kaiser said. “That’s a lot of people and a lot of accounts as we gave away more than $1 million worth of products to 183 campaigns.”</p>



  



<p>Bob Lord (pictured), chief security officer of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) noted that after the events of the 2016 election, security was clearly under the microscope. </p>



<p>“Security is a real challenge and everybody really understands the importance of it, but the dollar figures really can get in the way,” Lord said. “Making sure that there was a reliable source for things like security keys was really instrumental in moving forward.”</p>



<p>Within the DNC and across campaigns, Lord and his team strictly implemented the use of FIDO based security keys to provide strong authentication capabilities and limit the risk of potential phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today 100% of the people at the DNC who need to get access to their email and&nbsp; access to their documents, they’re all using security keys – no exceptions, no executive privilege to opt out of this,” Lord said.</p>



<p>The DNC also benefited from Google’s Advanced Protection Program (APP) which provides additional levels of protection and assurance beyond what a basic gmail account enables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re big supporters and real big believers in the combination of FIDO security keys and the APP,” Lord said.</p>



<p>Why DNC Believes in FIDO</p>



<p>Lord noted that there are a number of reasons why he is a big supporter of FIDO standards. For one is the fact that FIDO standards are built into the Google Chrome browser. Lord explained that the DNC was pushing the use of Chromebooks to campaigns and the integrated FIDO capabilities made it easier to deploy strong authentication.</p>



<p>While there are multiple types of two-factor authentication available in the market, for Lord there are really only two categories.</p>



<p>“I think there are really two kinds of multi-factor that are available in the consumer space – I think there are FIDO security keys and then there’s everything else,” Lord stated emphatically. “When I refer to everything else, I refer to those other multi-factors systems as legacy and I do that because I want people to get the mental model that this is something to be contained, minimized and eventually moved out.”</p>



<p>Lord observed that other multi-factor approaches, while better than not using multi-factor at all, have shown weaknesses, which is why in his view as an industry it’s important to really be pushing people pretty aggressively to move down the path of FIDO strong authentication adoption.</p>



<p>While Lord is an advocate for adopting FIDO based strong authentication with security keys, he also noted that there were some usability challenges his team had to work through as well training that was needed to educate and onboard users. The learning from the DNC’s efforts are all now being publicly shared by Lord’s team at<a href="https://democrats.org/security/"> https://democrats.org/security/</a>.</p>



<p>“It’s a non-partisan thing so there’s nothing red or blue about these best practices, but you’ll see in there that we really push pretty hard on security keys and the APP in particular,” he said.</p>



  



<p>Mark Risher, Senior Director of Security and Identity at Google (pictured) emphasized during the panel that in general adding a second factor does still objectively decrease the chances of a user becoming the victim of a phishing attack. That said, he noted that for an attacker, phishing a password, or just phishing a password plus a One Time Password (OTP) PIN code basically just&nbsp; requires basically one more line of code for an attacker. </p>



<p>“It does not require the funding of the nation state,” Rischer said about the ability to bypass OTP for phishing attacks. “So we need to get the world to understand the distinction, and to move into and start requiring these much more stringent hardware based strong authentication technologies and standards.”</p>



<p>How FIDO is Moving Forward to Enable Digital Transformation</p>



<p>The afternoon keynote at the event was delivered by Andrew Shikiar (pictured) the Executive Director of the FIDO Alliance. Shikiar noted that passwordless authentication is an important cornerstone for digital transformation.</p>



  



<p>“The security and authentication aspects of digital transformation came to the fore as everything was accelerated due to the pandemic,” Shikiar said. </p>



<p>Shikiar noted that social engineering had kind of a renaissance in 2020 as phishing continued to be successful.</p>



<p>“Simply put, the only way to break this cycle is to eliminate our dependence on server side credentials and password,” Shikiar said. “Anything on a server can and will eventually be stolen so they’re easy to phish, harvest and replay.”</p>



<p>The need to create stronger authentication is why FIDO was born. Shikiar explained that the FIDO Alliance’s mission is to create open standards for simpler, stronger authentication with public key cryptography and asymmetric public key cryptography, which is something that the average consumer should never have to pronounce, let alone know what it means.</p>



<p>Shikiar also outlined some of the FIDO Alliance’s highlights from 2020 including Apple joining the group. He added that Apple joining served as a powerful signal to the industry that really everyone is coalescing around the FIDO Alliance as the organization to collaborate on the standards based user friendly and strong authentication. Another key highlight from 2020 for FIDO was the level of support across operating system and browser combinations with different transport mechanisms for the authenticator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over 4 billion devices can support FIDO authentication,” Shikiar said. “So in short, you know, we think FIDO is becoming part of the DNA of the web itself, which is a pretty audacious thing.”</p>



<p>“To summarize, FIDO is very much the present and the future of user authentication.”</p>



<p>The Solarwind #Solorigate Attack as an Identity Authentication Issue</p>



<p>A key topic that resonated throughout the second day of the policy forum was the impact of the recent Solarwinds attack which is also commonly referred to as Solorigate.</p>



<p>During a panel about what policies the Biden Administration should consider with regards to Identity, John Miller Senior Vice President of Policy and Senior Counsel at ITI, commented that the Solarwinds attack has been accurately described as a software supply chain attack but it really is also fairly characterized as an identity attack.</p>



  



<p>“Characterizing Solarwinds as an identity attack presents an opportunity to remind policy makers of how fundamental identity is to not only what we’re doing online as consumers but to, but an enterprise environment,” Miller said. </p>



<p>In the final keynote of the event, Alex Weinert (pictured) Partner Director of Identity Security, at Microsoft, outlined the gory authentication and identity details behind the Solorigate incident and why zero trust principles would help to mitigate many risks.</p>



<p>Weinert noted that the Solorigate attack was a fundamental attack on trust. He also emphasized the clear role that authentication played in the attacks and the need to move to strong authentication.</p>



<p>“What are we doing to encourage explicitly verifiable credentials, we all know passwords are crap, we know they’re incredibly vulnerable,” Weinert said. “Are we doing enough as an industry to push for the end of passwords?”</p>



<p>Today’s sessions (February 5) have been recorded and will be available soon.</p>

<p>MADISON, Wis., and WASHINGTON 02/04/21 – CUNA announced today a transfer of Credit Union Financial Exchange (CUFX) to CULedger.</p>
<p>“CUFX is the result of a grass-roots initiative,” said Chris Seneda, past CUNA Technology Council chair, CUFX steering committee member, and executive vice president and chief operations officer at Virginia CU. “It started with senior IT credit union executives who recognized a need for credit unions as they were trying to get their different systems to work together. The CUNA Technology Council leadership was instrumental in helping to get CUFX off the ground and continued to provide resources as it progressed into its position today. With the transition to CULedger, CUFX will get added support and continue to work with its users and CUNA Technology Council volunteers to assist with future improvements.”</p>
<p>CUFX continues to thrive and meet the necessities of its credit union users. The latest update, which went live this past fall, included the advancement to support non-unique account ID architectures. This newest advancement was driven and reviewed by three core system providers currently implementing CUFX.</p>
<p>“Since its inception, CUFX has been evolving to meet the needs of credit unions,” said David Rohn, vice president of CUNA Councils.</p>
<p>With its transition to CULedger and continued connection to credit union technology experts, we’re confident that this solution will continue to evolve, expand and assist credit unions.”</p>
<p>CULedger delivers a trusted peer-to-peer services network of verifiable exchange for financial cooperatives. Its solutions include MemberPass, a digital ID held by credit union members that protects credit unions and their members from identity theft and fraud in all banking interactions.</p>
<p>“CULedger is proud to incorporate CUFX into our product offerings for credit unions,” said John Ainsworth, President, and CEO of CULedger. “This solution is already being utilized with other solutions within our portfolio, so we understand its value and support its continued advancements.”</p>

 About the Lissi&nbsp;wallet <p>The Lissi wallet is a simple but powerful tool to manage digital interactions. It can be used to establish connections to third parties and to exchange information. You can find a more detailed explanation <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/introducing-the-lissi-mobile-wallet-b2af9bccaf03">here</a> or on <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">our website</a>. It’s currently available as an open beta version for <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">Android</a>.</p> The importance of multi language&nbsp;support <p>Within the identity community, we spend considerable time to ensure interoperability between different solutions. We engage in conversations in a variety of standardization bodies to enable a seamless user experience on a global scale. Frankly speaking, we are not there just yet. But we are on a good way to enable access to the services regardless of where an entity is based or which social background an individual has. While regulation as well as technical and educational hurdles remain, it’s crucial to increase the accessibility of products to different cultures and languages.</p><p>We have already received feedback from multiple stakeholders from the public and private sector saying that multi-language support is essential for the execution of various use cases. There are several nations, which have multiple official languages. If our end-user facing products are not available in the most common languages, it creates entry barriers so big that not even a piloting of these use cases would make sense. Hence, we took note and worked hard to ensure the Lissi wallet is available in the languages of communities, which currently explore the self-sovereign identity&nbsp;concept.</p><p>The Lissi wallet now supports the following languages:</p>  Arabic  English  French  German  Italian  Korean  Polish  Portuguese  Russian  Romanian  Spanish, and  Turkish.   Challenges remain <p>When designing a wallet, the language is only a small part of the whole user experience. The task is to design a universal cockpit, which people can navigate regardless of their social background. Similar to a dashboard in a car, which doesn’t look too different wherever you go. In order to achieve this, we have to standardize the icons, colours and user-flows to a certain degree. However, on the other hand, they need to be adjusted to the target audience. Let’s take the colour red as an example. In western cultures, red is associated with excitement, danger, urgency and love, whereas the same colour evokes danger and caution in the middle-east. In India, it’s associated with purity, while in China it symbolizes luck and happiness. Finding the right balance between standardization and necessary adjustments for the target audience will require knowledge about the cultural differences, feedback and time. When it comes to language it creates its own set of difficulties. Differences can be observed in the usage of genders, the left-to-right or right-to-left reading, the information density or the usage of tenses, just to name a few. Furthermore, there isn’t a common terminology used within the community, which makes a translation into different languages even more challenging.</p><p>Hence, our translation won’t be perfect. While we worked with native speakers, the context is often difficult to explain without demonstrating the user-flow and an actual use-case. Languages also change depending on the use-case or the subject in question. Nevertheless, we are looking forward to making the Lissi wallet even more accessible by adding additional languages and improving our current translation with your feedback. What language would you like to have us support next? We are always looking for translators for additional languages, so reach out to us to get our winter 2021 edition of Lissi Merchandise!</p><p>Cheers. The Lissi&nbsp;team.</p>

<p>Team FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The intersection of identity and authentication and how it can help to improve business as well as people’s lives was a core topic of conversation on the first day of the Identity, Authentication and the Road Ahead: Virtual Policy Forum event on Feb. 4.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance joined together with Better Identity Coalition and the ID Theft Resource Center (ITRC)&nbsp; to host the two day event running on Feb. 4-5, which has over 1,000 registered attendees who are gathering to learn more and discuss the current and future state of identity and authentication. The first day of the event had a strong focus on things the U.S. can and is doing to help improve the state identity, while recognizing the many challenges on the road ahead.</p>



<p>Identity is a National Security Issue</p>



  



<p>In the opening keynote, Michael Mosier (pictured), Deputy Director &amp; Digital Innovation Officer at the U.S. Treasury departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/">FinCEN</a>), outlined what’s at stake when it comes to digital identity. </p>



<p>“I view identity as a national security issue, and it will take the intellectual power and creativity of all of us to figure out how to secure identities and keep people from harm,”&nbsp; Mosier said.</p>



<p>Mosier emphasized that digital identity solutions are a key factor to help prevent fraud and financial crime. He added that in order to get payments right, there is a clear need to first get identities done right. The right way in his view, is an approach that preserves privacy while ensuring integrity in the system.</p>



<p>“The ability to detect and address risks is only as good as the ability to determine with whom you’re engaging,” Mosier said. “So the real question for identity related risk is, do you have the information necessary to reliably assess the risk of your counterpart or your customer.”</p>



<p>A key challenge FinCen is seeing is at the account opening stage, with identity proofing and verification. A July 2020 advisory from FinCen highlighted the issue reporting that criminals are undermining identity verification processes, through identity theft and synthetic identity fraud.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing a lot of identity authentication compromise, leading to account takeovers, as&nbsp; a lack of multifactor and multi step authentication is too prevalent across the financial sector,” Mosier said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The costs of those takeovers is far from trivial. FinCEN is seeing around 5,000 account takeover reports each month, reaching approximately $400 million per month over the last two months.</p>



<p>“The bottom line is that many account takeovers and fraud are occurring because of failures to enforce stronger levels of assurance and identity verification in authentication processes,” Mosier said.</p>



<p>Phishing is Top Source of Identity Theft and Cybercrime</p>



  



<p>The Identity Theft Resource Center (<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">ITRC</a>) is seeing the same trends as FinCEN with phishing and credential theft being the leading source of identity theft, according to the groups recent release 2020 Data Breach Report. In a keynote session, Eva Velasquez, President and CEO and James Lee, Chief Operating Officer (pictured) of the&nbsp; ITRC outlined the high level findings of the report and its impact. </p>



<p>“Credentials are the coin of the realm today, as opposed to what we have traditionally thought of as being the kind of information that threat actors wanted to collect.” Lee said.</p>



<p>While other failures and vulnerabilities including unpatched software can and do lead to data breaches, Lee emphasized that the majority of the root causes of cyberattacks rely primarily on user logins and passwords</p>



<p>How the Pandemic has Accelerated the Need for Strong Authentication</p>



<p>With tens of millions of Americans looking to the U.S. government for help during the pandemic, there has been a clear need for strong authentication and identity technology.</p>



<p>During a panel, Sanjay Gupta, chief technology officer for the US Small Business Administration (SBA) noted that the SBA has been able to ramp up during the pandemic thanks in part to the deployment of a strong authentication based single sign on technology that makes use of FIDO Alliance standards. The SBA uses the <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> platform from the U.S Government’s General Service Administration (GSA).</p>



  



<p>In a keynote session, Congressman Bill Foster (D-IL) (pictured) stated that the COVID crisis has laid bare many of the inadequacies of the identity system in the U.S. </p>



<p>Just to pick one example, Foster noted that over a million stimulus checks were sent to dead people and for millions of others, the stimulus checks were delayed because of challenges in verifying who is eligible based on where they live. While there are challenges, Foster noted that there has also been a lot of relevant technological progress, independent of government action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The use of a secure enclave on a modern cell phone as a FIDO second factor device is a huge step forward,” Foster said.&nbsp; “The increasing use of privacy preserving biometric sensors on smartphones as a means of providing digital online authentication for human identity is going to be transformative.”</p>



  



<p>In a panel following the keynote on where the government can help with identity and authentication, Paul Rosenzweig, Resident Senior Fellow, Cybersecurity and Emerging Threat at the R Street Institute commented that good identity is clearly one of those common public goods that economic theory teaches us, is best provided at a governmental level. That’s an idea that panelist&nbsp;Phil Lam (pictured), Executive Director of Identity for the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) agreed with. </p>



<p>“I think that we as a government are providing a lot of benefits to Americans today and in order to facilitate providing that benefit, we kind of need to know who you are and&nbsp; are you eligible for a benefit,” Lam said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lam re-iterated that the FIDO-enabled <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> portal is a critical part of the U.S. government’s authentication strategy and now serves over 25 million users.</p>



  



<p>The final panel of the day tackled the socially important topic of equity and inclusion when it comes to identity and the individual. Among the panelists was Reverend Ben Roberts (pictured) who runs the ID Ministry, which is an effort to help the underprivileged get their identity so they can qualify for government assistance or even just to get a bank account. </p>



<p>Roberts detailed a number of heart-breaking cases of individuals that have had extreme challenges in getting some form of verified identity. He had a strong message for government policy makers and technology developers alike for how to enable strong authentication and identity systems.</p>



<p>“As we’re bringing things online and as new policies and new systems come into play, really do your level best to ensure that people are not getting left behind,” Roberts said.</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee and Atsuhiro Tscuhiya, APAC Market Development Team</p>



<p>The reason to put passwords in the rearview mirror is more evident than ever. Our recent survey on consumer behavior says that 58% of abandoned online purchases are due to the difficulty of managing passwords. The Gartner Group’s research indicates that 20-25% of all helpdesk calls are password reset requests. The World Economic Forum (WEF) assessed that cybercrime costs the global economy $2.9 million every minute; about 80% of the attacks targeted passwords.</p>



<p>But the tide is turning. During our inaugural Authenticate conference, which took place in November 2020, Microsoft announced that they now have more than 150 million people are using their passwordless sign-in each month. That is a 50% increase from last year’s report at Microsoft Ignite back in November 2019.</p>



<p>We have all seen how the global pandemic has drastically accelerated the willingness of and the need for organizations to embrace passwordless FIDO Authentication. It is now a matter of how and with whom, instead of when.</p>



<p>Updates from APAC Marketing Forum</p>



<p>We are happy to share meaningful progress since the first FIDO AllianceAsia Pacific Marketing Forum (AMF) in July.&nbsp;Here are some updates from our members across the region:</p>



<p>Taiwan</p>



<p>Mentioned in our previous post was&nbsp; the introduction of FIDO’s standards in official documents developed by Taiwan Association of Information and Communication Standards (TAICS) and SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) Taiwan, as well as FIDO’s logo on the app of Taiwan-Cathay United Bank.</p>



<p>Recently, the government of Taiwan has also adopted FIDO’s authentication method for the purpose of citizen’s tax filing, a government service that supports more than 200,000 users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India</p>



<p>FIDO2 is now accepted by the CCA (Controller of Certifying Authorities), under India Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, as an alternative to SMS OTP.&nbsp; The guidelines have been published on the CCA website (<a href="http://cca.gov.in/eSignAPI.html">http://cca.gov.in/eSignAPI.html</a>).</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance member Singular Key’s FIDO Certified authentication service is being used by ReBIT, the cybersecurity subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India.</p>



<p>Additionally, a whitepaper on FIDO authentication for banking space has recently been submitted to ReBIT. Webinars designed to educate the public on FIDO’s standards are also in the works. These efforts will no doubt help to drive up FIDO awareness amongst the India population.</p>



<p>Hong Kong</p>



<p>In Hong Kong, the passion for horse racing continued even as people stayed home and betting branches closed because of the global pandemic.</p>



<p>For the first time ever, the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) kicked off the horse racing season with all-digital betting. Punters had to log on to HKJC’s mobile betting app, provided by FIDO Alliance member Tradelink.</p>



<p>The betting channels, which are secured by FIDO via biometric authentication on users’ mobile devices, provided a user-friendly and safe experience that helped to secure a record HK$1.376 billion turnover – 6.83% higher than the previous record set in the 2017/2018 season! This was made possible, despite the record low number of attendees at the races in year 2020.</p>



<p>Separately, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government rolled out a new initiative powered by Tradelink’s FIDO Certified authentication – the “iAM Smart” initiative, which enables Hong Kong citizens to authenticate their identities using mobile devices for access to financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Malaysia</p>



<p>There is a clear transition towards a passwordless future in Malaysia.</p>



<p>The FIDO Certified authentication service from SecureMetric is recently being adopted by a number of public services in the country as part of the government’s Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024. This means that FIDO authentication will play a role in services such as Malaysia Central Bank’s (Bank Negara) Electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC), the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) National Technology as well as Innovation Sandbox (NTIS) from the Ministry of Science.</p>



<p>Vietnam</p>



<p>In Vietnam, the shift away from passwords is accelerating. Currently, there are 32 licensed e-Wallet providers all vying to lead the charge to facilitate the country’s shift to a more cashless society. There is also a major focus on smart city, digital signatures and electronic ID developments.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, FIDO member VinCSS became the first company in the country to develop FIDO2 Certified authenticators. Since then, it has met the FIDO2 standard for the second time, announcing its achievement of FIDO2 Certification for its strong authentication server named VinCSS FIDO2 Server.</p>



<p>This achievement also means VinCSS is currently one of only 13 companies globally with a FIDO2 certified server that can accept any FIDO certified authenticator, irrespective of its manufacturer – an amazing feat!</p>



<p>Other Notable Updates in Asia</p>



<p>Additionally, Japan-based telecommunications operator KDDI recently deployed FIDO2 for its “au ID” and started FIDO authentication service. Instant messaging app LINE, introduced biometric authentication that utilizes FIDO standards for iPad users, eliminating the need to key in passwords. The FIDO Japan Working Group Chair was invited as an expert by the Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication on their discussions using My Number Card capabilities on smartphones.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in Korea, the Blue House, the executive office and official residence of the president of the Republic of Korea, deployed TrustKey’s login solution powered by FIDO’s standards for remote work and internal security access.</p>

<p>The 3Box Labs team will be back to EthDenver this year, though a lot is different this time around. EthDenver is virtual for 2021, of course, but our team will be manning the digital booth and roaming the virtual halls to meet and mentor hackers. We love this community and can't wait to see you and your projects, whether that's in the Sports Castle or GamerJibe.</p><p>The tech we have for hackers has changed too. Last year at EthDenver, our CTO Joel huddled in a corner of the castle to build the first POC of <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>. Almost exactly a year later, Ceramic Network has just <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">moved into beta on a live testnet</a>. <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, the open identity protocol built on Ceramic, is also in beta and ready for use. And 3Box is now <a href="http://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a>, with our full focus on <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/p/6c8da552-3900-472e-ad68-ded95ce3cbe0/">bringing these protocols</a> to builders across Web3.</p><p>Ceramic and IDX offer a massive improvement on previous 3Box products, and EthDenver hackers are the first to get a crack at the beta versions. To celebrate, we've got lots of content, tons of ideas, and nearly $10,000 in bounties up for grabs.</p> Workshops and Talks <p>We'll be all over the virtual stage over the next week talking about decentralized identity and data. (Add to your calendar from the <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/schedule">full schedule</a>).</p><p>Workshop: Using open identity with IDX <br>Saturday 2/6 at 9am MST/5pm CET</p><p>Tech Talk: Standards for encrypted and mutable data on IPFS <br>Sunday 2/7 at 11am MST/7pm CET</p><p>Evolution of Decentralized Identity: A history<br>Thursday 2/11 at 4pm MST, 12am CET</p><p>Identity Legos Panel: The composable Web3 identity stack <br>Thursday 2/11 at 4:30pm MST/12:30am CET</p><p>We'll also be on stage during bounty presentations and opening ceremonies to share more about our prizes and products, and we'll have an informal office hours at 10:30am MT each of Monday-Thursday for hackers who want to drop by with questions.</p> 10,000 DAI in bounties <p>We've got a huge trove of bounties to celebrate the beta release of 2 protocols: <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a peer-to-peer dataweb for publishing, linking, and querying verifiable information on the open web. <br><a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is an open identity protocol built on Ceramic that makes it simple to store, use, and manage decentralized identities and data across any network, platform or application.</p><p>We've split the 10,000 DAI in rewards across 5 categories.</p>  Best overall use of IDX (identity index): 3000 DAI across 4 winners  Best overall use of Ceramic Network: 3000 DAI across 4 winners  Best new tools for Ceramic Network: 1500 DAI to 1 winner  Best use of Ceramic for social features: 750 DAI to 1 winner  Partner bounties: use Ceramic with Textile (1000 DAI) and with NEAR (1000 DAI) – or go for all 3 together!   <p>The <a href="https://www.ethdenver.com/post/ceramic-network">full bounty details are here</a>. We'll be looking for submissions that tackle an original project idea, use Ceramic/IDX well and deeply, provide a wow-worthy demo, and contribute value to the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Hack ideas we'd love to see <p>If you are looking for a great idea or a good way to use Ceramic or IDX, here are a few things we know we'd love to see.</p> Use IDX to manage user identities and data <p>🧩Cross-chain profiles and identities</p><p>If your hack uses an L2 or non-Ethereum chain, make sure you aren't splitting users across multiple accounts. IDX lets you <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#3id-keychain">link multiple keys</a> to the same identity and profile, from any chain!</p><p>⚙Backup and sync DeFi settings on IDX</p><p>In most apps and exchanges, user settings including watched addresses, tokens, currency preferences, and contact lists are stored in local storage. A new device, browser or even cleared cache means everything is gone. Storing these in a user's identity index assures backup, multi-device support, and reusability across applications!</p> Use Ceramic as an open and auditable content store <p>🐤Mirror of Crypto Twitter onto Ceramic Network</p><p>Our community <a href="https://twitter.com/StefanDGeorge/status/1347861734716035074">has put up $15,000</a> (so far) in donations for a tool that mirrors tweets onto Ceramic Network, paving the way for a new Web3-native social conversation without the need for a mass migration off Twitter. Get started towards this at EthDenver!</p><p>🎨Mutable metadata for NFTs</p><p>NFTs are unique, but do they have to be static? Mint NFTs with metadata stored on Ceramic and the owner of the Ceramic document can change the properties of the NFT over time. &nbsp;An artist could keep updating the NFT metadata after it's minted, creating a unique evolving piece.</p><p>📝DeFi Annotations and Comments</p><p>Create a commenting system with Ceramic that lets users add notes to contracts, addresses, trades or anything else in DeFi. Managed by users directly, these notes could be accessible across any DeFi app. This could be a javascript library for apps to integrate, or a browser extension for users to add themselves.</p><p>📤Auditable discussion forums</p><p>Use Ceramic documents to create discussion forums that are auditable, flexible and decentralized. Each user can post to their own Ceramic document, with each aggregated and referenced to create the full forum. No server needed, and easy paths to a censorship resistant foundation with moderation layered on.</p> Use with other dweb tools to open up new use cases <p>✉P2P chat or comments</p><p>Use IDX with <a href="https://github.com/textileio/js-threads">Textile's js-threads</a> or another messaging protocol to build fully P2P social features that authenticate directly with a user's key and identity. You could create an embedded support bot, a DeFi trollbox, team chat tools, a "decentralized disqus", or a notification service.</p><p>🗄Ceramic as a CMS for content on IPFS, Textile or anywhere else</p><p>Ceramic's mutable documents with persistent doc IDs makes it great for managing dynamic information that is stored on IPFS or elsewhere. Use Ceramic to catalogue, index or generally manage the data used in your hack., wherever it's stored. You can publish the definition (schema, etc) of data stored in Textile or other DBs to make private data discoverable and interoperable.</p> Create tooling for decentralized identity and data <p>🗺Ceramic document explorer</p><p>Create a way to visualize and explore the documents that exist on Ceramic. This could focus on the available <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/glossary/#definition">definitions</a> that have ben created, all Ceramic documents, individual user identity indexes, or anything else. We'd love to see how you'd like to explore the network!</p><p>🖇New crypto or social account links</p><p>The 3Box Labs <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink service</a> provides verifications for Discord, Twitter and Github. Add one for Telegram, Matrix, Discourse or a KYC provider.</p><p>Or add support for a new blockchain. Ceramic can currently be authenticated by Ethereum, Filecoin, EOS, NEAR or Cosmos keys. It's <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/add-authentication-with-new-blockchains-in-3id-connect/">simple to add support</a> for your preferred chain.</p><p>🚛Import of Web2 social data to use on Web3</p><p>Many large Web2 apps now have APIs to export user data (with users' permission). Build a mass-export tool that puts valuable data into users' hands by adding it to a their identity index.

<p><br>
<a href="http://digitalgovernment.scot"></a>David McKinney, Managing Director of Local Government at Servelec, maps Scotland’s progress towards fully integrated health and social care, and discusses putting community at the heart of the country’s digital care journey.</p>
<p>In 2016, the Scottish Government legislated to bring together health and social care into a single, integrated system.</p>
<p>The legislation created 31 integration authorities who are now responsible for £8.5 billion of funding for local services. This brought about the most significant change to health and social care services in Scotland since the creation of the NHS.</p>
<p>Integration aims to ensure that services are provided in a seamless and co-ordinated way. Ultimately, it’s about securing better outcomes for people in Scotland, and the best way to achieve that is to make sure that everyone has access to the right information, in the right place, at the right time.</p>
 Serving the community needs 
<p>Public services are complex, so it’s important we work together to provide the best solutions. The very best digital care starts from a deep rooted interest in what communities need – the requirements of their citizens and the professionals and organisations who provide care for them. We must commit to joining up communities digitally by enabling connectivity between health providers, social services, education and charities, an approach with interoperable digital solutions at the heart.</p>
<p>Systems need deep domain knowledge, must be intuitive and easy to use and increasingly be as useful to citizens as they are to the professionals and organisations providing care. We need to strike the right balance between enabling access and protecting data, with a best of breed approach in an open environment where systems can talk to one another.</p>
<p>We’re pioneering this with the current implementation of the National Child Health Record in Scotland using our Rio platform. Our Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system for secondary care can be tailored to an organisation’s specific needs and supports the vision of every patient having one, fully integrated, health record. It operates across child health, mental health and community care settings and interoperates easily with other systems.</p>
 Support at a local level 
<p>The pandemic has required a rapid response from across Government, and has resulted in one of the most challenging years on record for local authorities. I’ve spent a lot of my time this last year meeting (albeit virtually) with local authority customers – learning about their challenges and common goals. It’s been remarkable to hear from teams who have implemented significant transformational change at record speed, in order to continue providing core public services during the pandemic.</p>
<p>We already provide social care systems to a number of local authorities in Scotland, via Mosaic, our case management software designed to give professionals the time and data they need to achieve more positive outcomes for people in their care. We’ve also been proud to support some of those authorities through our social value work – running digital skills workshops for young people in Dundee for example, as we recognise the importance of making a bigger societal contribution.</p>
<p>We’ve continued to support social workers by developing systems that provide them with all the information they need, at the point of care. Our Mobilise app provides the flexibility to update care records while in the community, providing frontline workers with the tools they need, wherever they are. It enables social workers to make more informed decisions, faster, helping to improve the overall quality of care and outcomes for vulnerable people. This way of working reduces duplication of effort and minimises unnecessary travel, by allowing social workers to complete work steps and update records wherever they are.</p>
 More effective digital channels 
<p>This last year, we’ve continued to work with clinicians and other care professionals in looking for improvements to health and social care systems to support communities. Especially solutions that enable citizens to increasingly take responsibility for their own care and wellbeing.</p>
<p>We’ve been developing person-centred, self-service systems, designed to help social care teams shift communication and engagement to more effective digital channels. Mosaic Portal allows people to engage with services more effectively, and offers a personalised, digital approach to social care delivery.</p>
<p>It’s a long and uncertain road ahead, but we’re excited to be part of Scotland’s digital care journey and we are committed to making integrated health and social care real by providing joined-up solutions that place people at the heart of public service provision.</p>

 Tell us a little bit about you and your role in identity?&nbsp; 
<p>I’m responsible for Identity and Access Management at GRTgaz the leading gas distribution company in Europe. As a product owner. I lead 2 teams: one for digital identity, looking after passwords, access controls, all that sort of thing. The other team works on active directories – whether it’s on premise or in the cloud. In total, we have about 5,000 people working for the company. We’re a business to business seller so our customers then distribute gas to their own customers. The global conversation about optimizing use of energy is really important, so we have a lot of innovative projects on going as we work out how to tackle climate change and become more efficient.</p>
 How did you end up in the world of identity? 
<p>I studied at university at Telecom Sud Paris. There were only a few girls in my year as, at that time, cybersecurity didn’t attract many women. I am so happy to see more and more women working in this field. Since then I’ve always worked in cybersecurity. I started out assisting our cybersecurity officers with IAM, and then got super interested in the technical side of Azure AD and how SAML and OIDC work. So I dived in and got to grips with them so I could then simplify it to teach back to my non-technical colleagues!</p>
<blockquote><p>At work, the most important thing is the people, the culture and how everyone works together, rather than the technology that you’re using to build your organisation</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone I worked with had a contagious enthusiasm for IAM. So, 4 years later here I am! When I started out here, there were loads of smaller teams that specialised in different areas of IAM – from multi-factor authentication to customer support to architecture. &nbsp;Everyone had their own objectives so it was hard to break down the silos and work together. My role was to get everyone to cooperate in delivery in order to get the maximum value for our customers. Introducing self-service was super challenging as we had to change user behaviour stopping them from always contacting the Service Desk! When I was offered the opportunity to lead a team here, I thought “Why Not??!” There are always new challenges, whether it’s new protocols or technologies, to keep me interested and busy.</p>
 What does a normal week look like? 
<p>Working across two teams I have a good mix of work. A big part at the moment is the global strategy to migrate to cloud from our on-premise infrastructure so I’m working out how to adapt our current processes, documentation and environments. I also create a lot of training videos for users and colleagues to help them use our products more efficiently. It also helps business leaders make informed decisions when investing in IAM.</p>
 Why is Women in Identity important to you? 
<p>Women are as competent as men so it’s not really a question why women are important in this field. We think through details in different ways and can challenge assumed user needs. Women in Identity provides a great opportunity to gather many voices and listen to the diverse range of experiences that women have in the IT and identity space. It’s so important to support girls to get access to training in IT – it enables them to take advantage of opportunities they wouldn’t have otherwise.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you most recommend to readers? 
<p>Whenever I have a problem I read this book 1 more time – 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey. It really helps with personal development and being more efficient in everything you do, whether it’s work or relationships. It’s not just about relations with colleagues but also maximising your time in all elements of your daily life. At work, the most important thing is the people, the culture and how everyone works together, rather than the technology that you’re using to build your organisation. You’ve got to understand that to be successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 If you were CEO of a company, what one thing would you make compulsory? 
<p>Aside from making Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) compulsory and banning shared accounts (they’re super risky!) I’d make sure I didn’t introduce change until I was sure we had explored all the alternatives. I would rather introduce changes progressively to end users. Covey’s habit “Seek first to understand than to be understood” would be my mantra: e.g. WHY do teams use shared accounts so that before banning, an alternative could be suggested.</p>

<p>Paris is such a beautiful city. I feel very lucky to live . I love cooking (and eating ). When we are allowed to do so again, I can’t wait to chill with friends in the many great bars and restaurants here in Paris. We can literally try food from kitchens from all over the world.</p>

 Key takeaways <p>👍 &nbsp;Our mission stays the same<br>🚀 &nbsp;<a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> are the future<br>3️⃣ &nbsp;3Box SDK and plugins will be deprecated, but...<br>👍 &nbsp;<a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box profiles</a> will still work and will be migrated to IDX<br>🛠 &nbsp;We support Ceramic with development, tooling, and ecosystem building<br>⚡️ &nbsp;Currently using 3Box? <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/migrating-from-3box-to-ceramic-and-idx/">Learn how to migrate</a></p> Mission <p>The mission of <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box</a> has always been to advance a more open and sustainable web by creating software that breaks down information silos and redefines relationships between users, apps, and data. </p><p>We believe that by giving users direct ownership over their digital identity, direct control over their personal data, and by liberating information from centralized database silos and putting it on the open internet, we can correct the asymmetric power structures of the current web and contribute to a more safe and equitable digital future for all. Experience has taught us that the most impactful way to advance this mission is by equipping developers with powerful tools that make it easy to build applications on this new paradigm.</p> Where we've been <p>Since early 2018, 3Box has been the leading provider of decentralized identity, user profiles, database storage and messaging capabilities for Ethereum applications. The flagship <a href="https://github.com/3box/3box-js">3Box SDK</a> has been used by 1,500+ projects including <a href="https://metamask.io">MetaMask</a>, <a href="https://gitcoin.co">Gitcoin</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.page">Snapshot</a>, <a href="https://rarible.com">Rarible</a>, <a href="https://gnosis.pm">Gnosis</a>, <a href="https://zerion.io">Zerion</a>, and countless others to create and manage 40,000+ decentralized identities and 200,000+ decentralized databases. Our products have helped make decentralized identity and dynamic application data an indispensable pillar of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p> Introducing, 3Box Labs <p>Today we're excited to announce that 3Box is evolving to become <a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> in order to more effectively deliver on our mission. Moving forward we will be shifting all efforts to developing the <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> ecosystem and protocols built on top of it such as <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>. Over the next few months, we will be sunsetting current 3Box products in favor of these new, more powerful alternatives.</p><a href="https://3boxlabs.com">  3Box Labs: Creators of Ceramic Network, IDX, 3Box.js  3Box Labs creates software that advances a more open, safe, and collaborative web. We’re hiring!      </a><p>Our evolution in brand and product focus does not mean that we're leaving the Ethereum ecosystem or that we're changing our mission. On the contrary, it enables us to improve our offerings, expand into new markets, further decentralize our technology, and dramatically scale our impact. With Ceramic and IDX, now all developers (not just ETH devs) get much more powerful and robust infrastructure that opens up a whole new set of use cases for decentralized identity and dynamic data management.</p> Evolving our approach <p>3Box was a simple, out-of-the-box solution to decentralized identity and data management. Our SDK bundled existing Web3 technologies such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org/">OrbitDB</a>, and <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> into an opinionated, but developer-friendly API that worked with users' existing Ethereum wallets for authentication.</p><p>We always knew that abstracting existing solutions at the API layer and not solving the problem at the base protocol layer would have its inherent limitations. Over time these limitations became bottlenecks to growth, decentralization, flexibility, and performance:</p>  Performance: "Why are data syncing and load times slow?"  Persistence: "How can I guarantee my data stays available?"  Decentralization: "Why are identities stored on 3Box Inc. servers?"  Consensus: "How can we anchor identities and data on-chain?"  Multi-DID: "How can I use a different DID method?"  Multi-chain: "How can I authenticate with a non-Ethereum account?"  Multi-account: " How can I connect multiple accounts to my DID?"  Flexibility: "How can I use a different database provider?"  Customization: "How can I extend the API to do custom things?"   Moving to the Ceramic Network <p>To address the questions above and support many new capabilities, we realized we needed a completely new technology stack from the ground up. This 18-month journey led us to develop <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> to be a much more robust and flexible combination of protocols for decentralized identity and dynamic data management. </p> Ceramic: A decentralized network for mutable content <p><a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a> is a public, permissionless, censorship-resistant network for managing mutable content on the open internet. By combining IPFS, libp2p, blockchain, DIDs, and authenticated data standards, Ceramic gives developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data. </p><p>Ceramic functions like a global-scale, permissionless NoSQL document database, but guarantees data integrity and ensures strict ordering of document updates by anchoring these updates in a blockchain. Ceramic does not require DB servers or trusted third-parties to host data and perform mutations on content.

 IDX: A protocol for cross-chain decentralized identity <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a cross-chain protocol and SDK for decentralized identity and interoperable user data. IDX allows developers to attach any kind of data to a user, discover all of a user's data in one place, and share data between applications. </p><p>Unlike 3Box which only offered OrbitDB storage and Ethereum-based authentication, IDX can be used with any kind of datastore such as Ceramic, Textile, OrbitDB, Filecoin, IPFS, Sia, Arweave, blockchain registries, or even centralized databases and supports authentication from any kind of Web3 wallet. </p><p>IDX is great for associating user profiles, portable social graphs, reputation scores, verifiable claims, user-generated content, application data, settings, domain names, blockchain addresses, and social Web2 accounts to a user in a decentralized way. </p><a href="https://idx.xyz">  IDX: Identity protocol for open applications  IDX is an open source multi-platform identity protocol that allows users to build up a unified digital identity and freely share their data between apps.      </a> Available on Testnet now <p>You don't have to wait to get started building on all of these new tools. Last week Ceramic officially <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">launched the Clay Testnet</a> and at the same time, IDX went into beta.</p><p>Mainnet will be progressively rolled out over the coming months, beginning with a soft launch for interested projects and then proceeding to a full public release some time after that. If you're interested in deploying your project on the Ceramic mainnet as part of the soft launch, <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">reach out on Discord</a>.</p> Supporting the Ceramic ecosystem <p>Ceramic and IDX are decentralized protocols which are independent from 3Box Labs. However 3Box Labs is committed to supporting the Ceramic ecosystem along three key pillars:</p>  Core protocol development  Standards, developer tooling, core applications  Ecosystem development   Core protocol development <p>3Box Labs develops and maintains the Ceramic <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">JavaScript implementation</a>. If you're interested in writing a client in a new language, reach out in the <a href="https://discord.gg/GXPrjW3qvF">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Standards, developer tooling, and core applications <p>The use cases for Ceramic are virtually endless. While this is a positive for the long-term prospects of the network, it is important that a few key use cases are built out early on so developers can immediately use Ceramic without needing to wait for use cases to organically emerge. 3Box Labs is committed to developing decentralized identity tooling on Ceramic, and here's what we've created so far.</p>  <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">IDX SDK</a>: 3Box labs maintains the IDX JavaScript SDK which makes it easy to add IDX to your application. The IDX SDK is the replacement to the 3Box SDK.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-method">3ID DID method</a>: A W3C-compliant DID method that uses Ceramic documents as decentralized, mutable DID documents. 3ID is great for end-user IDs. Ceramic-based 3IDs are the decentralized replacement to current 3Box 3IDs stored on 3Box servers.  <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a>: An authentication system for Ceramic that works with all blockchain wallets. 3ID Connect currently supports Ethereum, Cosmos, Filecoin, Polkadot, and EOS with others such as Near and Flow coming soon. This version of 3ID Connect is the cross-chain, Ceramic-compatible replacement to the 3ID Connect currently used in 3Box.  Community infrastructure: 3Box Labs provides free and open access to hosted Ceramic nodes so developers can interact with the network during prototyping and development without needing to run their own node. The <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/#setup">endpoints</a> for these nodes can be found in the Ceramic documentation.  Self.ID (coming soon): A web UI that allows users to manage IDX records for their DID, such as a basic profile, Web2 account links, and Web3 address links from different blockchains. Self.ID will be the sequel to the <a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box profiles hub</a>.   <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink</a>: A service that issues verifiable credentials which link a user's DID to their Web2 social accounts. 3Box Labs has funded the development of IdentityLink, and will run an instance of the service for anyone to use. Alternatively, you can also run your own IdentityLink.  <p>If you're interested in building out standards and tooling for identity or new use cases, reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Ecosystem development <p>As a nascent protocol, Ceramic needs a lot of support in developing a vibrant ecosystem. 3Box Labs is committed to: developing strategic partnerships, use cases, and collaborations between Ceramic and other projects and ecosystems; funding community development work in the form of bounties and grants; providing Ceramic with financial support until there are self-sustaining token economics on the network; supporting developers through documentation, examples, and educational materials; engaging web standards bodies (i.e. W3C, DIF, IETF, blockchain foundations); and of course, memes and marketing. 😻</p><p>If you're interested in any of the opportunities above, reach out in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.</p> Migrating from 3Box <p>If you're currently using 3Box in your project, you'll want to skim through this related post which outlines various upgrade paths for migrating to Ceramic and IDX.</p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/migrating-from-3box-to-ceramic-and-idx/">  Upgrading from 3Box to Ceramic and IDX  3Box Labs is sunsetting its current line of 3Box products. Learn how to migrate your integration to Ceramic and IDX.  The Ceramic BlogMichael Sena    </a> FAQs  How will Ceramic be governed? <p>Ceramic is already 100% open source, peer-to-peer software and anyone can participate in the network by simply running a Ceramic node. Formal governance of the network will progressively decentralize over time, eventually exiting to the community and a standalone foundation once a token is introduced.</p> Will Ceramic have a native token? <p>Ceramic does not currently have a native token, and one will not be present upon mainnet launch. In time, it is reasonable to assume token economics will be added to the network.</p> What is the relationship between 3Box Labs and Ceramic? <p>While 3Box Labs are the original inventors of the Ceramic Network and have been integral to bootstrapping the Ceramic ecosystem, we're committed to migrating Ceramic to an independently-governed foundation and stepping back to play a reduced role over time. In a way, 3Box Labs is just like any other contributor to an early stage protocol.</p> What is the corporate structure of 3Box Labs? <p>3Box Labs is a US corporation registered in Delaware with employees and contractors located across the US and Europe.</p> What is the business model of 3Box Labs? <p>There is no charge for the software that we produce. The 3Box Labs organization is able to sustain ourselves and fund development of the Ceramic ecosystem through the generous backing of some of Web3's most active and committed investors, including <a href="https://placeholder.vc">Placeholder</a>, <a href="https://www.coinfund.io/">CoinFund</a>, <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/crypto/">Collabfund Cryptocurrency</a>, <a href="http://consensys.com">Consensys</a>, <a href="https://dcg.co/">Digital Currency Group (DCG)</a>, <a href="http://venrock.com">Venrock</a>, <a href="http://northzone.com">Northzone</a>, <a href="https://underscore.vc/">Underscore</a>, <a href="http://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a>, and many more who have made equity investments into 3Box Labs. Once Ceramic has a token, 3Box Labs will maintain a modest percent of network tokens. Investors with equity in 3Box Labs will retain a proportion of the 3Box Labs allotment of network tokens. To date, there have been no direct investments in Ceramic Network but there may be an upcoming opportunity for that.</p> How can I get involved? <p>There are many ways to get involved. If you're looking to contribute code, write a client in a new language, run Ceramic nodes, write developer docs, help with community development and partnerships, or anything else, let us know in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a>.

<p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">3Box Labs is sunsetting 3Box products</a> in favor of the new and more powerful combination of <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a> and <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>. In this post we provide a timeline and various upgrade paths for projects currently using 3Box. </p><p>To learn more about Ceramic, IDX, and the reasons behind the transition, read our previous post:</p><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/3box-labs-a-future-on-ceramic-network/">  3Box is now 3Box Labs – A path forward on Ceramic Network  In this big announcement, we share that 3Box is becoming 3Box Labs to reflect a new focus on the development of the Ceramic Network ecosystem.  The Ceramic BlogMichael Sena    </a> Timeline <p>Ceramic and IDX are currently live on the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-network-clay-testnet/">Clay Testnet</a>, but since it's a testnet they're not yet suitable for production deployments. In the next month or two, we will open a soft launch of the Ceramic mainnet to select partners that require more immediate production deployments. This would include current 3Box integrations. Some time after that, mainnet will be opened to the general public.</p><p>We encourage all 3Box developers to begin their setting up and testing their migrations to Ceramic and IDX on the Clay testnet as soon as possible, and reach out to us on the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> if you would like your project to be included in the mainnet soft launch.</p><p>Starting today we will begin formally deprecating 3Box products, but we won't immediately turn them off. Some reasonable amount of time after Ceramic mainnet is opened to the general public, we will disconnect the 3Box servers to complete the transition. Your application will need to be migrated to Ceramic and IDX by that date (TBA) or risk losing access to current 3Box data.</p> Upgrade paths by 3Box product  Profiles API <p>All 40,000+ 3Box profiles will be migrated to IDX. Standard 3Box profile data will now be stored in three different <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/learn/overview/#record">IDX records</a>. Basic profile fields such as those available in the 3Box Profiles app (<code>name</code>, <code>image</code>, <code>background</code>, <code>emoji</code>, etc.) will be stored in a <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#basic-profile">basicProfile</a></code> record. Social verifications (<code>twitter</code>, <code>github</code>) will be stored in an <code>aka</code> record. Links to blockchain accounts will be stored in a <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/default/#crypto-accounts">cryptoAccounts</a></code> record.</p><p>If your application is only reading data from the 3Box profiles API, your migration is very simple. The existing 3Box profiles API will continue to work for both legacy profiles stored on 3Box and also for new and/or migrated profiles stored on IDX with no change needed. Eventually though, you will want to upgrade to <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">js-idx</a></code> and use the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/reading/">idx.get()</a></code> method for reading basic profiles, social verifications, and crypto account links stored on IDX. This pattern will be mandatory once we disable the 3Box API service.</p><p>The migration of the three profile data sets mentioned above will automatically occur behind the scenes the first time a user logs in to any application that uses <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a>. For this reason, we recommend adding 3ID Connect to your sign-in flow even if you do not need to write data to IDX. This will ensure that the profiles for all of your users are migrated during the migration window.</p><p>If your application is setting or modifying standard data in a user profile, then you should upgrade from <code>3box-js</code> to <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">js-idx</a></code> and use the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code> method to write to any of the profile data sets mentioned above.</p><p>If your application is storing custom, non-standard data in a user profile or if you created an app-specific profile in a 3Box Space, you will need to manually perform a migration for this data set. First, you need to create a <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/creating/">custom definition</a> for your data set. Then, the next time a given user logs in to your site (ideally using <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet">3ID Connect</a> so their standard profile data gets automatically migrated), you need to query their profile from the 3Box API, extract your custom data from their profile, then store this data in an IDX record using <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code>.</p> Profiles App <p>The <a href="https://3box.io/login">3Box Profiles app</a>, which provides a simple UI for creating and managing profiles, will eventually be replaced by Self.ID built on Ceramic and IDX. In the meantime, 3Box Hub can continue to be used since all data will be migrated to IDX. Once Self.ID is live on Ceramic mainnet and using 3ID Connect for authentication, we will launch a marketing campaign to get users to sign in which will migrate their standard profiles to IDX.</p> Spaces and Threads APIs <p>Projects using 3Box spaces and threads APIs for storage and messaging will now need to replicate this functionality in their application using a combination of IDX for identity and either Ceramic documents or other datastores (such as Textile, OrbitDB, SkyDB, etc.) for content storage. </p><p>If you are storing simple JSON content in your space, then we recommend creating a <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/guides/definitions/creating/">custom definition</a> for your data model, and using the <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/writing/">idx.set()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/reading/">idx.get()</a></code> methods for interacting with it. For migrating existing data, you should query the data using the 3Box spaces API, then write it to an IDX record after the user has authenticated.</p><p>If you are storing large volumes of data in a space, have high transaction throughput, require encryption, or are using messaging, then there are many nuances and directions your integration could take depending on your specific use case. We'd recommend joining the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> for assistance with your migration.</p> Plugins <p>3Box UI plugins including Comments, Chatbox, and Profile Hover will be deprecated without replacement. We understand this is less than optimal for existing projects, but we as a team have limited capacity to continue maintaining these with a high bar for quality. Since these components are just a thin UI, these functionalities can easily be replicated by adding IDX and Ceramic to your project and coding some simple HTML/CSS.</p> Hosting <p>3Box Labs has provided free hosting and persistence for data stored in 3Box. Moving forward, things will be a bit different due to the decentralized nature of Ceramic.</p><p>For historical 3Box data, 3Box Labs will continue to host and persist this content until some reasonable amount of time (TBA) after Ceramic mainnet has launched. This gives you a chance to upgrade your application and replicate the data of your users to Ceramic and IDX. After the migration window is over, we will be turning off our 3Box servers.</p><p>For new data stored in Ceramic and IDX, 3Box Labs will offer a few free hosted node options:</p>  3Box Labs node: A full Ceramic node that persists the profile data of users who automatically perform their profile migration via 3ID Connect (from any app) and users who manage their profile data in the Self.ID app.   Community gateway: A read-only Ceramic node.  Community dev node: A full Ceramic node used for prototyping and development, but does not guarantee data persistence. It will be wiped from time to time beginning at mainnet launch.  The endpoints for the gateway and dev node can be found in the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/#setup">Ceramic</a> and <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/#set-your-ceramic-node">IDX</a> docs.  <p>If you are building a production application and need to persist data on Ceramic and IDX, it is recommended that you either run your own Ceramic node or utilize a third-party node hosting service for persisting your data. We are engaging with various hosting providers to offer Ceramic nodes, and we expect these to be available over time.</p> What to expect from 3Box products during this transition <p>We are quickly working towards a mainnet release of Ceramic so you can begin to utilize this new powerful infrastructure as soon as possible. However it is likely that you may experience various issues with existing 3Box services in the meantime, such as slowness, loading, syncing issues, or log-in/browser compatibility. We deeply apologize for these inconveniences. The reality is many of these issues are out of our control and are caused from underlying technology dependencies. Normally, we would be working to fix these as soon as possible, but in this case the most impactful thing we can do is ship Ceramic mainnet faster. These are some of the reasons we're excited to move to this new Ceramic-based architecture.</p>  Questions or support? <p>We're always available to answer any questions and help you through this transition. Reach out to us in the <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord</a> for assistance.</p>

<p>Declaring that blockchain has “gone mainstream,” Forbes today released its 2021 “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/02/02/blockchain-50/">Blockchain 50</a>,” featuring companies that have at least $1 billion in revenues or are valued at $1 billion or more and “lead in employing distributed ledger technology.” And, once again, half of the companies on the list are using Hyperledger technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twenty five companies on the list name at least one Hyperledger technology as part of their solution platform. Hyperledger Fabric, specifically, is cited as a platform by 24 of the companies, topping the list as the most widely used technology. Hyperledger Aries, Indy, Grid and Sawtooth are all also deployed by companies on this list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The annual list, now in its third year, reflects the growing global impact of blockchain technology with 25 members from the U.S., 13 from Europe and a record 12 from Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. All in all, there were 21 companies that were new to the list, and 15 of them, including ones from Australia (BHP), India (Tech Mahindra) and Africa (Sappi), use Hyperledger-based platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of the 12 companies that have made the list every year, six (Ant Group, Cargill, DTCC, IBM, ING and Walmart) use Hyperledger technologies.</p>



<p>More than just a basic list of companies and technologies, the Forbes Blockchain 50 provides a snapshot of the market-changing deployments these blockchain leaders have deployed. Accompanying <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2021/02/02/forbes-releases-3rd-annual-blockchain-50-list-of-companies-paving-the-way-using-blockchain-technology/?sh=32e070482e63">stories</a> add even more analysis and context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This annual look at the market is a good reflection point for the traction our technologies have in the current market but also a guidepost to what needs to come next. The increasing global adoption of blockchain – public, private, hybrid – and coming shifts in currency adoption and payments as well as uptake in markets as diverse as mining, telecom, pharma and shipping all point to the growing reach of distributed ledger technology. And, in the face of such challenges as the pandemic, climate change and income equality, it is important to put the focus on what we can accomplish building on blockchain as a cornerstone.&nbsp;</p>

 Arup Chatterjee &amp; Puthiya Purayil&nbsp;Sneha  Session <p>The last decade has seen a slow but steady emergence of online literary spaces in India, marked by the ubiquitous nature of the internet and digital technologies, growing mobile phone penetration and increased access to devices such as tablets and e-readers. By literary spaces we refer to online journals, magazines and blogs, as well as reading groups and discussion spaces focused on writing in English and Indian languages. These range from those exclusively focusing on contemporary literature to others that feature writing on news, culture and arts. These spaces raise some intriguing questions about the growth a new online or digital literary culture, which may be mapped through the evolution of reading and writing practices as very explicitly technologized practices, and the changes in the notion of text and textuality, scholarship and pedagogy, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Some examples of such spaces that have come up in the recent years are The Little Magazine [1], Muse India [2], Kritya [3], Coldnoon: Travel Poetics [4], Kindle [5], Almost Island [6], The Indian Quarterly [7] and among several others. Many of these journals have both an online and print presence, while some are purely online and seek to reach a diverse audience featuring different genres of writing. While many carry an eclectic mix of creative and critical writing, perceptions about readership on the internet often dictate the form and manner of writing that is featured. The much anticipated and debated ‘disappearance’ of long form writing is one of the questions that may be asked of the emergence of these literary journals, which have in some way re-imagined this form in the digital sphere and have been instrumental in its growth. So even as there are books on twitterature [8], there are interesting ways in which online literary journals have tried to define the space of contemporary writing on the internet in&nbsp;India.</p> Plan <p>This panel discussion proposes to examine this phenomenon of the growth of online literary journals to understand the imagination of the ‘digital’ in their practices of writing and publication, whether as medium, content or context, as a way to explore how writing and reading practices today have been shaped by these changes. This also includes questions on methods of literary analysis that may have changed with the advent of the digital, and from a broader perspective, the production of literary scholarship and pedagogy in India. Some questions that could be points of discussion are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  What is the pedagogical role, if any of digital/online journals? Are they simply cost-effective modes of production of knowledge or are they indicative of some other form discrimination? Perhaps a discrimination between what gets read and what does not? Is a voluminous archive of nineteenth century writings of the same pedagogical merit as a list of 100 Hollywood romantic comedies? If the former is arguably much more educational, why then is the latter the source of the greatest traffic? Is pedagogy then a misnomer, and a non-entity in the world of online magazines?  Can the rise of online magazines be related with the rise of print culture and the subsequent rise of the novel? The novel was educational and, while English was still a very evolving language in the 17th and 18th centuries, the form helped both shape the language and educate the masses, bourgeoisie, and the aristocracy about the nuances of the still-nascent English language. Can a similar function be said to have been fulfilled by online journals? Or have they failed in playing this radical role of disseminating new language and new vocabulary, which is required to articulate new modes and conflicts within modernity — sexualities, queerness, televised elections, middle-eastern (Syrian, Palestinian, Israeli, Iraqi) mayhem in times of democracy, globalization, urbanization, travel, genocide, partition, terrorism, and so on? Are there any exceptions among the journals in being able to somehow fulfil the criteria of engendering a new language? What are the examples, if any? How popular are&nbsp;they?  Is online literature less literary than print? Is it more amenable to news, while print continues to be literary? Or is this only a misconception? Is online literature prone to non-serious, or populist sources of pedagogy, which serve more to titillate through trolling, humour, half-baked information, gossip, or is it playing a serious role too in portions? Apart from those newspapers and journals/magazines which also have print components, which are possibly the portals that create viable, meritorious, and universal categories of knowledge? Or, invocation of ‘merit’ and ‘universal’ essentially a flawed mechanism to judge online literatures?  <p>Addressing some of above questions through a study of two or more online journals, this session will attempt to open them up to a broader discussion on the nature and growth of an online literary culture in India, and the need for and significance of research in this&nbsp;area.</p> Readings <p>None.</p> Notes <p>[1] See: <a href="http://www.littlemag.com/">http://www.littlemag.com/</a>.</p><p>[2] See: <a href="http://www.museindia.com/">http://www.museindia.com/</a>.</p><p>[3] See: <a href="http://www.kritya.in/">http://www.kritya.in/</a>.</p><p>[4] See: <a href="http://coldnoon.com/">http://coldnoon.com/</a>.</p><p>[5] See: <a href="http://kindlemag.in/">http://kindlemag.in/</a>.</p><p>[6] See: <a href="http://almostisland.com/">http://almostisland.com/</a>.</p><p>[7] See: <a href="http://indianquarterly.com/">http://indianquarterly.com/</a>.</p><p>[8] See: <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307055/twitterature-by-alexander-aciman/9780143117322/">http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307055/twitterature-by-alexander-aciman/9780143117322/</a>.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day3.LiterarySpaces">IRC 2016: Day 3 #Literary Spaces : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Arup K Chatterjee is a doctorate in English from the Center for English Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University.

<p>The ID2020 Alliance is delighted to welcome U.K.-based Nuggets as the newest member of its vibrant community. The Alliance is made up of public and private sector organizations who share a common commitment to good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>The Nuggets proposition could not be clearer, proclaiming boldly that “privacy is a fundamental human right” and signaling an immediate alignment with the ID2020 Manifesto — the statement of principles that guide the Alliance’s work.</p><blockquote>“We are always excited to welcome organizations who so wholeheartedly embrace our values,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “When we talk about complex issues, such as identity and data ownership, we know that transparency is essential to building trust — with customers, partners, and users. We could not be more excited to welcome Nuggets to the Alliance as we work together toward a future with good digital identity for&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>Nuggets offers a robust decentralized self-sovereign ID and payments platform, that enables consumers to retain control of their personal information and businesses to protect their customer’s data. Their solution leverages biometrics for verification, strong customer authentication, and cryptographic proof of identity to facilitate customer onboarding (KYC &amp; KYB), single sign-on with biometrics, omnichannel payments, age verification, contactless delivery and verified two-way communication transactions through a scalable, decentralized digital&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Founded in 2016 by Alastair Johnson and Seema Khinda Johnson, Nuggets is available in Europe and Australia and is expanding its platform into new verticals including financial services, which has been advanced by a significant partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions, one of the largest protectors of private and confidential data in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Nuggets has already won numerous awards for its industry-leading FinTech offerings, including most recently from Deutsche Bank. As part of their recent growth, Nuggets has established commercial partnerships with global companies such as LexisNexis Risk Solutions, LatPay, QFPay, and a variety of other organizations.</p><blockquote>“Frustratingly, 2020 was the worst year on record for data breaches, signaling a seismic shift in consumer attitudes towards privacy,” said Alastair Johnson, CEO &amp; Founder of Nuggets. “On this Data Privacy Day — held annually on January 28 to create awareness about the importance of respecting privacy, safeguarding data, and enabling trust — it feels particularly timely for Nuggets to join forces with ID2020 and the other brand leaders that are helping to make protecting customers’ data a top priority in this increasingly data-driven digital&nbsp;world.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Alliance also continues to grow at a healthy pace, welcoming organizations from the public and private sectors that share our commitment to user-managed privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID. As an Alliance, we are only as strong as our members and we are thrilled to add Nuggets to the partnership as we move — together — towards providing good ID for&nbsp;all.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p>About Nuggets</p><p>Nuggets is an award-winning, decentralized, self-sovereign identity and payment platform. It helps organizations to protect customer data while giving customers a frictionless, seamless experience. Nuggets is the only platform of its kind that truly brings together payments and ID, utilizing self-sovereign data principles.</p><p>Nuggets was founded on the belief that each of us should own and control our personal information. No one else. Privacy is a fundamental human right, and a fundamental change is needed in the way personal data is&nbsp;stored.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/uk-based-nuggets-joins-the-id2020-alliance-aa984893fa48">UK-Based Nuggets Joins the ID2020 Alliance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Starting today you can experiment, prototype, and develop applications on top of the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">Ceramic protocol</a>. </p><p>To get started, try the <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">demo app</a> and jump into the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/">docs</a>.</p> What is Ceramic? <p>Ceramic is a public, permissionless, censorship-resistant network for managing mutable information on the open internet. Ceramic combines a stack of cutting-edge web3 technologies including <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://libp2p.io">libp2p</a>, blockchain, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, and <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/how-to-store-signed-and-encrypted-data-on-ipfs/">standards for authenticated (signed/encrypted) data</a> to give developers the ability to build completely serverless applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data.</p><p>Ceramic functions like a global-scale, permissionless NoSQL document datastore, but ensures strict ordering of document updates and data integrity without relying on database servers or trusted third-parties to perform mutations and transforms on content. Since Ceramic is built on a completely peer-to-peer network, all documents are openly discoverable and can be queried by any participant on the network or referenced in other documents.</p> Smart documents <p>In Ceramic all content is stored in smart documents, which are append-only IPFS logs where each commit (update) is signed by a decentralized identifier (DID) for verifiability and then subsequently anchored in a blockchain for consensus. Each smart document basically functions as its own independent doc-chain (a document blockchain). Here are some key features of smart documents:</p>  Mutable content: Store information in collections of mutable documents like your favorite NoSQL document database.  Immutable identifiers: Every document gets a globally unique persistent identifier, called a <code>DocID</code>. This DocID will never change regardless of how many updates are made to the document.  Verifiable signatures: Every update to a document must be signed by the DID of its owner, providing verifiability to its content.  Schema-enforced content: Documents can have schemas which will be enforced by the protocol. This allows for data integrity and simple cross-platform interoperability.  Strict versioning: Every update made to a document is anchored in a blockchain, so its commits follow a strict order. This allows the protocol to guarantee the state of a document at every commit and allows its content to be auditable and trusted at all times.  Programmable logic: Define custom rules for state transitions to enforce who, how, and when your document is updated without centralized servers. Rules can react to direct events such as a signature from the owner, or indirect events such as an update in another document.  Configurable persistence: Nodes can back up documents to any centralized or decentralized data storage platform.   How'd we get here? <p>Clay is the result of the tireless commitment by many in the community to the mission of creating an open dataweb free of silos. Since we first debuted a proof of concept of the Ceramic protocol in early 2020, the Ceramic codebase has had 1300+ git commits, 650+ releases, and dozens of top-tier projects in the Web3 ecosystem have been hard at work testing integrations and providing us feedback along the way.</p><p>This release is the final major milestone on a long journey to launching the Ceramic Fire mainnet, which is slated for the end of Q1 or early Q2 2021. Want to start building on Ceramic today? Continue reading to dive into the specifics of what's possible on Clay.</p> What's new for Clay?   A live, fully-functioning public test network that simulates mainnet as closely as possible  Three JavaScript clients: <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/clients/#core-client">Core client</a>, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/clients/#http-client">HTTP client</a>, and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/quick-start/">CLI</a>  Loads of new protocol features, improvements, and performance optimizations  The final breaking API changes before mainnet 🤞  Document anchoring on Ethereum's Ropsten (<code>EIP155:3</code>) and Rinkeby (<code>EIP155:4</code>) testnets  A dedicated p2p gossip network using the libp2p topic <code>/ceramic/testnet-clay</code>  A new <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">documentation site</a>   Things to keep in mind   The Clay network is experimental and should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It's great for getting your application ready for mainnet.  Documents created on Clay will not be portable to mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum's testnets and mainnet.  Clay does not yet have a purely decentralized peer discovery mechanism for nodes, and instead uses a curated <code><a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/peerlist">peerlist</a></code> for node discovery. This is because the <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-kad-dht">DHT</a> functionality in <code><a href="https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p">js-libp2p</a></code> is not yet sufficiently performant for production, however it will be ready by the time mainnet launches.  <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a protocol for cross-platform decentralized identity built on top of Ceramic. The IDX SDK is a useful tool for adding decentralized identity functionality to your already existing application, and is an easy entry point to get started with Ceramic. IDX runs on the Clay testnet and is currently in beta, so it has the same guarantees as Ceramic and will move to production when mainnet launches.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We've done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but this is still a testnet. Please report any issues by <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/issues">opening a ticket on Github</a> so we can fix them as soon as possible.  We're always available in <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> to answer questions and help you out along the way. We're excited to see what you build on Ceramic!   Getting started   <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network">Jump into the developer docs</a>  <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Try the Playground demo app</a>   What's next? <p>After Clay, our efforts will be 100% focused on releasing mainnet as quickly and safely as possible. We're targeting the end of Q1 or early Q2 2021.</p><p>The Fire mainnet release will include additional performance optimizations, fully decentralized peer discovery, a new pubsub topic <code>/ceramic/mainnet</code>, document anchoring on the Ethereum mainnet (<code>EIP155:1</code>), network monitoring, public analytics, bug fixes, and more.</p><p>The community is also gearing up for mainnet with many announcements, launches, and partnerships to go live. We will be sharing more information on those as they are available.</p>

<p>Come for the summaries, stay for the clip reel, bookmark for the&nbsp;links!</p><p>DIF held its semiannual “Face-to-Face” community’ event this week, and man what an event it was! For obvious reasons, it was virtual for the second time, and for the first time, it spanned both Zoom and the interactive social platform <a href="http://gather.town">gather.town</a>, giving a more intimate atmosphere and allowing for more organic networking than often happens at “tele-conferences.” If you missed it in part or in full, you’ll find below summaries and recordings of the main&nbsp;events.</p> 1# Opening remarks, and an update on DIF-OIDF Collaboration <p>Executive Director Rouven Heck got us started on a warm and welcoming note, bringing the largely unfamiliar audience up to date on DIF’s member-driven nature and its goals for 2021. These include a more engaged membership, more co-development at various scales, and more work items reaching stable specifications and publicly going from community incubation to commercial production.</p><p>Then, presenting from Tokyo (actually a little before the opening remarks, as is our asynchronous way here at DIF) Kristina Yasuda (<a href="https://online2020.mydata.org/presenter/kristina-yasuda/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://mydata.org">Mydata</a>) gave an update on her new role as the liaison between DIF and the OpenID Foundation. Joined by DID Authentication WG chair Oliver Terbu (<a href="https://mesh.xyz/">Consensys Mesh</a>), Kristina gave an overview not only of the ongoing SIOP work in the AB/Connect WG at OIDF, but also other identity-related efforts that might be of interest to DIF members, including the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/mobile/">MODRNA</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">KYC-IDA</a> working&nbsp;groups.</p> 2# Interoperability and DIDComm working&nbsp;group <p>The “main stage” working group presentations started with the Interoperability Working Group, which has taken a break from its test-harness/test-suite role under its new chairs to concentrate on educational materials that support broader interoperability among verifiable credential protocols… and a better understanding of those protocols among decision-makers on the business side of the decentralized-identity business.</p><p>The chairs (Pam, Kaliya, and Juan) gave an overview of the last 6 months of their group, its publications and maps, and other products, an overview of their invited guests (and handy recordings), as well as the “parking lot” for future discussion/research topics for&nbsp;Q1.</p><p>The DID Communications Working Group, energetically presented by Chair Sam Curren (<a href="http://indic.io">Indicio</a>, <a href="http://mattr.global">Mattr</a>), got the ball rolling with a swift and accessible overview of the group’s rapid progress from ambitious roadmap to the sophisticated draft specification since the last conference. In addition to the specification reaching its final rounds of editorial clean-up, many “nice to have” protocols that were put out of scope while the group focused on the specification alignment process (specifically a Bluetooth implementation and an NFC implementation) have spun out into parallel work items, which are already underway. In other DIDComm news, DIF member <a href="http://jolocom.com">Jolocom</a> announced this week a DIDComm v2 sample implementation in Rust, built for the company’s [otherwise completely non-Aries!] wallet. It seems 2021 will be the year of&nbsp;DIDComm!</p> 3# Claims and Credentials, Presentation Exchange, and&nbsp;Sidetree <p>The Claims and Credentials group’s co-chair Wayne Chang (<a href="http://spruceid.com">Spruce Systems</a>) took a quick stroll through the new work item initiation process (currently being extended to other WGs DIF-wide) and the other major work items: the paused Credential Taxonomy, the work item formerly known as Credential Manifest, the new VC Marketplace.</p><p>DIF’s first Executive Director, Daniel Bucher (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a>), gave a quick overview of the Presentation Exchange spec, an ambitious specification for scaffolding credential requests and presentations between unfamiliar systems. After months of collaboration with core architects of the Aries ecosystem from DIF member <a href="https://www.evernym.com/">Evernym</a>, the presentation and request mechanics have been aligned with the upcoming iteration of the relevant Aries “Present Proof” RFCs, making this a major interoperability win that bridges the largest production ecosystems the decentralized identity space has yet seen. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">specification</a> is in the very home stretch of reaching 1.0 status and in the last weeks of a period of public comment, so give it a read and leave some <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange/issues">issues</a> soon if you have&nbsp;any!</p><p>Daniel also presented the other specification he has been tirelessly driving for even longer than the Presentation Exchange work item at Claims and Credentials — the Sidetree specification, which reached v1.0 this week. In this quick, extemporaneous video, Daniel runs through some common misconceptions and relates the overarching Sidetree Layer-2 architecture to Microsoft’s specific Ion implementation, the work of DIF members <a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> on a Hyperledger Fabric implementation, DIF members <a href="https://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>’s Ethereum implementation, and even the affinities with DIF’s next working group to spin out of I&amp;D,&nbsp;KERI.</p> 4# Secure Data Storage WG, Identifiers and Discovery WG, and&nbsp;KERI <p>From potentially universal specifications for presenting credentials, we jumped straight to potentially universal specifications for storing credentials and other confidential data. The Secure Data Storage working group co-chair Dmitry Zangadulin (<a href="https://digitalbazaar.com/">Digital Bazaar</a>) talked about the group’s first and flagship specification, <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a>, which is designing a modular and DID-controlled storage protocol that would allow so-called “encrypted data vaults” (with or without a coupled authorization server called an “identity hub”) to create a portable, secure, redundant, and replicable storage layer for the decentralized identity world. In addition to bringing the audience up to speed on the current status of the specification work and prototyping, the group also gave a quick overview of the many <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">guest presentations</a> since the last F2F, spanning the cutting edge of decentralized storage and next-generation database projects.</p>The architecture of the Confidential Storage draft <a href="https://identity.foundation/confidential-storage/">specification</a><p>Identifiers and Discovery WG, the oldest continuously-active group at DIF, gave a detailed overview of its impressive roster of donations, work items, and updates since the last F2F. Chair Markus Sabadello (<a href="http://danubetech.com">DanubeTech</a>) ran through this long list. These include research on WebID and key recovery/roll-over systems, the evolving WebID pre-standard being discussed in some browser groups of W3C, new common libraries in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-dotnet/branches">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-key.rs">Rust</a>. Markus also explained to those new to the space the group’s broader mission of supporting the DID ecosystem and DID methods in particular as they experiment with decentralized governance and infrastructure. (Of particular interest to close watchers of the space was his update about the Universal Resolver project offering up very high-level analytics (privacy-preserving, of course!) about resolution activity on the public “testnet” service.)</p><p>Markus’ co-chair, Sam Smith (<a href="https://prosapien.com/">ProSapien</a>, <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>) talked about his passion-project, soon to become its own DIF WG: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure, or “KERI.” <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/keri">KERI</a> offers a new way of thinking of the “layers” of decentralized identity infrastructure, focusing doggedly on the “bottom half” of the concerns of a traditional DID method and separating itself entirely from the “top half,” including method-specific namespacing and all [clear-text] data. After months of honing the skill, Sam impressively conveys a considerable portion of the core concepts in this complex and nuanced system in a record-setting fifteen&nbsp;minutes!</p> 5# Special Interest Groups: Product Managers, Banking and Finance, and Healthcare <p><a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>’s Margo Johnson, co-chair of the Product Managers’ community of practice, gave a quick overview of their very generative and generous non-technical working group. In addition to producing a useful <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/product-managers/blob/main/agenda.md">open-source corpus</a> of discussion notes, presentations, and UX blotters, and the like, the group is also an important watering hole for product and user interface design thinking, covering such topics as accessibility, ethics, and adoption strategies, for products but also for new concepts of software (and better user interface patterns) more generally.</p><p>Co-chairs Paul Dunphy (<a href="http://onespan.com">OneSpan</a>) and Isaac Patka (<a href="http://bloom.co">Bloom</a>) gave a fascinating overview of the activity of their fast-moving and diligent Banking and Finance open group. Paul introduces the philosophy, focus, and working methods of the group, then Isaac overviews the invited guests to date. In addition to hearing reports from SSI researchers in the financial services space, the group is also building out a wiki of relevant regulatory events in the space, as well as opportunities in the space like the UK’s financial regulatory sandbox, the subject of their next meeting with <a href="http://evernym.com">Evernym</a>’s Andy&nbsp;Tobin.</p><p>Interim Chair Juan Caballero (<a href="http://learningproof.xyz">LearningProof</a>) gave a brief overview of the discussion group’s intentions and format. These could respectively be summarized as exploring the opportunities and access points for innovations in the healthcare space, and a recorded invited-guest series where researchers from the space offer “reverse pitches” about pain points and problems that decentralized identity might be uniquely suited to solve. As with all of DIF’s special-interest groups, the group is open to DIF non-members and interested parties can reach the chairs through the group’s <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/healthcare/blob/main/agenda.md">repository</a>, where they can also find notes and recordings of all guests to&nbsp;date.</p> Stay Tuned and Get&nbsp;Involved <p>As you can see, the DIF community has grown considerably since the last F2F, and keeps expanding into new terrains and modalities. If you work in the decentralized identity space or are trying to move your work into it, please consider <a href="https://identity.foundation/join">joining </a>the foundation, joining one of these working groups and special-interest groups, or even bringing a future project into DIF as a work item. <br>Or <a href="https://foundation.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7d1001f187a746b68d2ea0d28&amp;id=866a6c17be">subscribe </a>to our monthly newsletter.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-face-to-face-jan-2021-highlights-89e78cb80f54">DIF Face to Face Jan 2021 Highlights</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Markus also explained to those new to the space the group’s broader mission of supporting the DID ecosystem and DID methods in particular as they experiment with decentralized governance and infrastructure. (Of particular interest to close watchers of the space was his update about the Universal Resolver project offering up very high-level analytics (privacy-preserving, of course!) about resolution activity on the public “testnet” service.)</p><p>Markus’ co-chair, Sam Smith (<a href="https://prosapien.com/">ProSapien</a>, <a href="https://digitaltrust.vc/">Digital Trust Ventures</a>) talked about his passion-project, soon to become its own DIF WG: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure, or “KERI.” <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/keri">KERI</a> offers a new way of thinking of the “layers” of decentralized identity infrastructure, focusing doggedly on the “bottom half” of the concerns of a traditional DID method and separating itself entirely from the “top half,” including method-specific namespacing and all [clear-text] data. After months of honing the skill, Sam impressively conveys a considerable portion of the core concepts in this complex and nuanced system in a record-setting fifteen minutes!</p>  5# Special Interest Groups: Product Managers, Banking and Finance, and Healthcare <p><a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a>’s Margo Johnson, co-chair of the Product Managers’ community of practice, gave a quick overview of their very generative and generous non-technical working group. In addition to producing a useful <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/product-managers/blob/main/agenda.md">open-source corpus</a> of discussion notes, presentations, and UX blotters, and the like, the group is also an important watering hole for product and user interface design thinking, covering such topics as accessibility, ethics, and adoption strategies, for products but also for new concepts of software (and better user interface patterns) more generally.</p><p>Co-chairs Paul Dunphy (<a href="http://onespan.com">OneSpan</a>) and Isaac Patka (<a href="http://bloom.co">Bloom</a>) gave a fascinating overview of the activity of their fast-moving and diligent Banking and Finance open group. Paul introduces the philosophy, focus, and working methods of the group, then Isaac overviews the invited guests to date. In addition to hearing reports from SSI researchers in the financial services space, the group is also building out a wiki of relevant regulatory events in the space, as well as opportunities in the space like the UK’s financial regulatory sandbox, the subject of their next meeting with <a href="http://evernym.com">Evernym</a>’s Andy Tobin.</p><p>Interim Chair Juan Caballero (<a href="http://learningproof.xyz">LearningProof</a>) gave a brief overview of the discussion group’s intentions and format. These could respectively be summarized as exploring the opportunities and access points for innovations in the healthcare space, and a recorded invited-guest series where researchers from the space offer “reverse pitches” about pain points and problems that decentralized identity might be uniquely suited to solve. As with all of DIF’s special-interest groups, the group is open to DIF non-members and interested parties can reach the chairs through the group’s <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/healthcare/blob/main/agenda.md">repository</a>, where they can also find notes and recordings of all guests to date.</p> Stay Tuned and Get&nbsp;Involved <p>As you can see, the DIF community has grown considerably since the last F2F, and keeps expanding into new terrains and modalities. If you work in the decentralized identity space or are trying to move your work into it, please consider <a href="https://identity.foundation/join">joining </a>the foundation, joining one of these working groups and special-interest groups, or even bringing a future project into DIF as a work item.&nbsp;<br>Or <a href="https://foundation.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7d1001f187a746b68d2ea0d28&amp;id=866a6c17be">subscribe </a>to our monthly newsletter.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>2021 is going to be a significant year in Identity and Data Privacy. Since the GDPR went into full enforcement in 2018, we’ve seen&nbsp; many countries rapidly change or update their Data Privacy laws. Although intended to protect the individual, the number of Data Privacy Rights has increased dramatically. And, this is compounded by the fact that emerging technologies are putting a huge burden on identity and Identity systems.</p>
<p>The world is also experiencing an acceleration of technologies that rely heavily on Identity and Identity systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, I predict there will be a need to use Identity systems to facilitate new ways for people to access services:</p>
 
 carry out financial transactions with cryptocurrencies, 
 validate vaccination and health status due to Covid-19, 
 help big tech better moderate objectionable content. 
 
<p>These are my predictions for the year ahead – share your feedback below!</p>
<p></p>
 Immunity Passports will become ubiquitous 
<p>As a result of Covid-19, many countries are looking to how they can relax travel restrictions. A cruise company recently confirmed that they will not be accepting passengers unless they have been vaccinated. &nbsp;This is very likely to be the case for many other travel companies in 2021. &nbsp;This raises the issue of Data Privacy because some of these companies will now be collecting confidential, protected health information from the customers which they need to manage going forward.</p>
<p>Technologies are being developed right now to create things like Identity Passports through which travellers can present a negative COVID test result or proof of vaccination.&nbsp; This will then be tied to their identity to determine the right to travel. This will put a significant burden on identity systems as we seek to combine health information with travel information. Identity is going to be critical in making sure that organizations can have confidence in any tests results or new data provided.</p>
 Links between Cryptocurrencies and Identity 
<p>An essential part of bringing cryptocurrencies to people worldwide is the ability to have users create and maintain digital wallets. A fundamental purpose of digital wallets is to allow the unbanked or underbanked access to digital currency systems. As a result of this, Identity and Identity verification systems will grow in significance to cryptocurrencies. &nbsp;Identity and cryptocurrencies will be tightly bound together and initiatives aimed at getting people to use digital currency in the digital wallet will depend very much on adoption of the underpinning identity systems. Data Privacy and Data Protection will become the central point for developing trust in these digital money systems.</p>
 Emerging technologies and Identity 
<p>Emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality will require more information about individuals as they move around, interacting with these systems. It will be vital that users are correctly identified and ‘marked’ appropriately so that, for example, their access to certain types of services can be restricted if needed. Identity plays a big part in this, and we will see increasing amounts of data collected about individuals which need to be protected to ensure their privacy rights.</p>
 Big Tech, Identity, and Content Moderation 
<p>Content moderation by big tech companies has become a hot issue in the US and the EU. Governments are looking very closely at ‘Big Tech”s role in moderating content and support for law enforcement when investigations relate to their customer base. As a result of this, and as we’ve seen recently in the US Capitol attack, the big tech companies are being asked not just to moderate conversations but also to track people that are causing harm or planning harmful events.</p>
<p>This is likely to result in more regulation around the responsibilities of ‘Big Tech’ in this area. In many different scenarios, I can see that this will cause a considerable uptick in how tech organisations identify users – particularly if it is to be used for law enforcement reasons.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how 2021 evolves. But whatever happens, it is likely that Identity and Data Privacy will play an increasingly significant role.</p>

 ASA Automation, a German automation manufacturer that supplies companies including Walmart and Pfizer, leverages Energy Web Zero to decarbonize international supply&nbsp;chain <p>Mainhausen, Germany and Zug, Switzerland — 26 January 2021 — Today, ASA Automation and Energy Web announced a renewable energy project leveraging the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">EW Zero</a> application to help ASA source renewables for its production facilities in Germany and Chile. ASA Automation is a leading global automation and robotics manufacturer that supplies equipment and solutions to multinational companies including Walmart, Nestle, Volkswagen, and Pfizer. Companies like these with strong sustainability policies require that suppliers such as ASA use low-carbon energy throughout their supply chain. EW Zero will enable ASA to provide a verified proof that low-carbon energy was used in its facilities throughout the world to produce its products. This pilot builds on the first technical and commercial demonstration of EW Zero — <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripple-and-energy-web-announce-worlds-first-decarbonized-blockchain-5c3cecbff31a">Energy Web’s partnership with Ripple and XRP Foundation</a> to decarbonize the XRP&nbsp;Ledger.</p><p>“We are thrilled to welcome ASA Automation as an early adopter of EW Zero to reduce the carbon footprint of its production facilities. We hope that this pilot will set an example for how small- to medium-sized companies, often excluded from participation in renewable energy markets due to their relatively low electricity consumption, can now contribute to sustainability efforts. As ASA Automation is showing, EW Zero makes it much easier to decarbonize global, complex supply chains as required by some of the largest corporates,” said Walter Kok, CEO of Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>EW Zero enables energy buyers of any size to efficiently locate and purchase renewables around the world. The first version of EW Zero leverages energy attribute certificates (EACs). In this transaction, ASA Automation will use EW Zero to cover electricity consumption in Germany and Chile using renewable EACs. Zero will also act as a discovery tool to view available renewable supply in the markets of interest and choose the suppliers that match specific demand criteria (such as location, generation type, and installation year). In this way, ASA Automation will reduce its electricity-related emissions (Scope 2 under the GHG Protocol), which in turn decreases supply chain Scope 3 emissions for ASA’s customers. Zero will also integrate with renewable energy suppliers to showcase how local renewables platforms can leverage open-source standardized APIs to connect to EW&nbsp;Zero.</p><p>“We’re proud to become a member of Energy Web and an early adopter of such an innovative project that will allow us to make a first step towards renewable energy procurement,” said Mario Krämer, CEO of ASA Automation. “I am convinced that this is only the first step in the strategic cooperation with Energy Web and we are thrilled to become a frontrunner in blockchain-based innovation for the automation sector.”</p><p>The project will be completed in early 2021 and inform the continued open-source development of EW Zero. In the meantime, ASA and Energy Web are seeking renewable energy developers with a footprint in Europe and Latin America to participate in the project. Interested companies are invited to contact <a href="http://meerim.ruslanova@energyweb.org">Meerim Ruslanova</a> to get involved.</p><p>About ASA Automation <br>ASA Automation is engineering, building, and installing high-tech automation solutions custom tailored to suit our clients’ specific needs and their products, working from our German facility at Mainhausen, in the vicinity of Frankfurt/Main.

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director &amp; Aniyia Williams, Principal, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Back in 2018, we started funding the <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/why-were-investing-in-the-rise-of-the-responsible-tech-worker-a96e74661cdf">rise of the responsible tech worker</a>. This is our effort to help tech workers and founders step into their power, and build a world in which technology makes good on its promise of improving everyone’s lives for the better: fueling an ecosystem that is equitable, ethical, and inclusive in addition to innovative.<br> <br>2020 marked a monumental shift for the movement as the techlash came of age. A<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">t Omidyar Network, we were proud to provide a roadmap</a> for the US Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, and dozens of state attorney generals to file <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/antitrust-case-against-google-roadmap-paper/">antitrust cases</a> against the largest tech companies; there was an escalating debate (and, finally, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/big-tech-did-the-right-thing-for-the-wrong-reasons-51610737986">some action</a>) around acceptable online speech; and millions of people worldwide gained a deeper understanding of the dark patterns in the devices they use everyday watching the hit documentary, A Social Dilemma. <br> <br>We’ve come a long way since US senators<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/10/17222062/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-graham-facebook-regulations"> asked Facebook how it makes money,</a> but there’s so much more to do. <br> <br>Here are the biggest lessons we’ve learned so far, and where we hope this year will take us.<br> <br>The people we’re told are “leaders” will not lead us where we need to go.<br> <br>We can’t expect technology executives to self-regulate because they have no incentive to do so. In a world in which <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">technology is inextricably bound with capitalism</a>, CEOs are beholden to their shareholders to maximize profit. <br> <br>But within those companies, there’s hope. <br> <br>Tech workers, from engineers to cafeteria staff, are pushing back and speaking up; and new founders are testing out new kinds of business models and products. Together, they are holding their employers and the industry accountable to do the right thing, not just say it.<br> <br>Yet too often these people face retaliation and get branded troublemakers. We see them as heroes. We believe these are the early stages of a massive tech labor movement, and the number of tech workers who understand the connection between their day-to-day job and its impact on society is growing. <br> <br>To help unlock their power, we’re creating space for workers and founders to come together, funding the tools and resources they need, and developing new mechanisms for accountability. <br> <br>In 2020, we launched <a href="https://ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer</a>, a tool that gives people working on tech products (including designers, engineers, or their collaborators) a practical guide to navigate and lead on complex topics such as bias in AI or outsized power.<br> <br>We helped launch the <a href="https://www.tspa.info/">Trust &amp; Safety Professional Association (TSPA)</a> to build the field and continue to elevate those working on the frontlines of content moderation. It is the first membership organization designed for trust and safety specialists, from contract content moderators to in-house engineering teams at big tech companies.<br> <br>For tech workers yearning to upskill and meet like minds, we funded<a href="https://school.logicmag.io/"> Logic School</a> to teach them about creative protest, as well as a course at Stanford for professionals on Tech, Ethics, and Public Policy.<br> <br>In addition, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ifeomaozoma/">Ifeoma Ozoma</a> joined our team as an advisor to help us consider how to strengthen tech workers’ ability to whistleblow when they see or experience something wrong in the workplace.<br> <br>The industry is missing a common vision and narrative about responsible technology.<br> <br>Last year, we discovered that “ethical tech” means<a href="https://sarahdrinkwater.medium.com/the-responsible-tech-movement-is-held-back-because-we-dont-know-what-to-call-it-9a674e867054"> different things to different people</a>. The lack of common narrative is a core challenge for the movement because it means that people haven’t gelled around a shared identity, have a hard time finding each other, and aren’t speaking the same language.<br> <br>How can you rally without something to rally around? We have to identify the harms as well as the common goals, interests, and passions to build the path forward. <br> <br>As the pandemic hit, we funded <a href="https://mobi.us.org/">Mobius </a>to bring technology leaders together and determine collective work. To help deepen our knowledge of how race and technology intersect, we funded the <a href="https://www.c2i2.ucla.edu/">Center for Critical Internet Enquiry </a>to bring on an artist-in-residence (an incredible filmmaker, <a href="https://www.invisibleportraits.com/about">Oge Egbuonu</a>). And Civic Signals, now renamed<a href="https://newpublic.org/"> New_ Public</a>, kicked off 2021 with a festival that brought together a diverse crowd of activists, technologists, artists, academics, and urban planners to consider what healthy digital public spaces should look like. <br> <br>We win together, or not at all.<br> <br>For too long, tech has moved too fast and, at that high speed, broken things. An African proverb says “if you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” Beyond needing less haste and more conversation, we strongly believe in solidarity and collective approaches.<br> <br>If this past year has taught us anything, it’s how interwoven our lives are. Wearing a mask protects ourselves, as well as others. We exist as a society and we thrive in communities.<br> <br>That’s why last year we helped launch <a href="https://coworkerfund.org/">Coworker’s Solidarity Fund</a>, the first ever mutual aid fund designed specifically to assist employees and independent contractors who have faced retaliation for organizing in the workplace. The launch is timely given both our <a href="https://omidyar.com/news/omidyar-network-announces-worker-power-vision-35-million-investment/">commitment to worker power</a> in all forms of business under our Reimagining Capitalism banner and the continued progress of tech organizing, and we hope to see more progress in 2021 with the formation of the Alphabet Workers Union and Amazon employees voting for its first-ever union in the US.<br> <br>Acting with integrity can and should become business as usual.<br> <br>We think that doing the right thing for as many people as possible (whether you call it behaving with responsibility, integrity, or ethics) will be how the business world — including the technology sector — weaves together topics such as diversity, equity, belonging, and sustainability. <br> <br>2020, and the years before it, taught us that tech’s unethical behavior leads to incredible harm. It also results in reputation, regulatory, and talent risk. The largest tech companies are seeing experienced employees as well as young graduates (like those in our <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/awards/responsible-computer-science-challenge/">ResponsibleCS</a> program) turn away from the cultures they’ve built. <br> <br>Articulating and living by strongly held values will be how future leaders make their companies appealing to customers, investors, and the most sought-after employees.<br> <br>We’re already seeing this in the startup scene, with a new class emerging, led by organizations such as <a href="https://zebrasunite.coop/">Zebras Unite</a>,* who have created a powerful identity for founders who want to build companies grounded in values and defined in opposition to some of Silicon Valley’s most harmful norms. <br> <br>That’s why our teammates on the Reimagining Capitalism team are working to shift the current corporate governance rules away from shareholder primacy towards a world that recognizes broader stakeholders, including employees and consumers. It’s why we funded <a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/apply/">Ethical Source</a> and the <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab</a>, elevating their existing work which challenges the notion that open source is “values neutral” by deploying tactical, practical licensing and legal frameworks to allow developers to center values in their work. We also funded <a href="https://projectinclude.org/">Project Include</a> to investigate how the shift to working remotely has impacted harassment and toxicity in the virtual workplace, and how tech companies can create better and fairer working conditions for all. <br> <br>What Comes Next<br>Looking ahead, we see our work as enabling a diverse community of tech stakeholders to connect, collaborate, and co-create. To fuel the next stage of the movement, we need to focus on both the aspirational (envisioning together what we want) and the adversarial (pushing back against what we don’t). After all, communities are defined as much by what they aren’t as what they are.<br> <br>In doing so, we hope examples will emerge of what we — as an industry and society — want to reward, as we so often see examples of what we want to correct. Working together, we believe a new surge of people, ideas, and examples will shift tech culture. <br> <br>We’re still navigating what Omidyar Network’s role should be in the movement towards responsible tech. We aren’t here to own, we’re here to listen, empower, and contribute. We feel strongly that people who are most marginalized in our communities are critical to developing effective solutions — they have deep lived-experience and can see a clear path forward.

 Reimagining Capitalism Series: An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and&nbsp;Economy <p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p>Photo by <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/field-of-flags-at-national-mall-represents-americans-unable-to-attend-inauguration-day/2545279/">Eric BARADAT</a> /&nbsp;AFP<p>Over the coming weeks, Omidyar Network will expand on our theory of change around ideas, rules, and power and connect it to the five pillars outlined in our recently released <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">Point of View</a> on Reimagining Capitalism, and the work being done by our grantees. This is the first contribution to that&nbsp;series.</p><p>Democracy &amp; Capitalism <br>This week, Joseph R. Biden was inaugurated as America’s 46th president, standing on the West Front of the US Capitol that was attacked earlier this month. With that picture still vivid in the minds of many, President Biden swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. In that moment, people across the country let out a sigh of relief; though our democracy has been bruised and battered, it continues. And so too can the American people continue to pursue a more perfect union. <br> <br>At Omidyar Network, we recognize that the strength of our democracy is deeply entwined with the strength of our economy. We believe that we all have a collective responsibility to defend our democracy, and we are recommitting ourselves to ensuring that our economy supports our democratic society in providing opportunity, dignity, and security to all.<br> <br>Democracy and capitalism have long stood as twin pillars under-girding American society. Their modern incarnations were both born in 1776 out of the same intellectual movement, and advance the same vision: for decision-making power to rest with the people. Just as we are united, as Americans by a common faith in the democratic values of equality, justice, and liberty, we value the capitalist promise that those who innovate, compete, and take risks will be fairly rewarded. Ultimately, capitalism is what has made possible American democracy, with its promise of shared prosperity and opportunity.<br> <br>A key debate across American history has been of how to balance the competing rights and freedoms guaranteed in each system. Adjusting this balance has allowed our government and economy to adapt to the changes in our values across centuries. However, it is clear to so many of us that the balance between democracy and capitalism is now in a dangerously precarious position. <br> <br>For years, we have prioritized the protection of capitalist rights to seek growth and profit at the expense of democratic commitment to general welfare, as enshrined in our Constitution alongside liberty and prosperity. We now find ourselves with an economy that is obviously structured in ways that exacerbate inequalities at every level. Despite a soaring stock market and rising GDP, the fundamentals of our economy are as broken as the windows smashed by the angry mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th. Already profound gaps in income, wealth, and opportunity are widening, especially between white and Black families. <br> <br> Most of us are deeply dissatisfied with the status quo, yet feel that we lack the power to change our circumstances. This powerlessness is fundamentally undemocratic and, by extension, un-American. We must change it. <br> <br>Omidyar Network has called for a reimagining of capitalism so that we can once again strike a balance between our democratic and capitalist systems that creates an economy grounded in democratic values. Our goal is to achieve systemic change so that our society is centered on the well-being of individuals and communities, and allows for full economic, democratic, and social participation for all. Our strategy is to transform how economic systems support our society by investing in organizations and individuals working to reshape economic ideas, rules, and power.<br> <br>Replacing Old Ideas<br>Throughout America’s history, we have lived in accordance with a variety of ideas that reflected society’s values at the time — many of which were rightfully discarded as our values evolved. Over the last 50 years, a set of ideas based on individual liberty, the primacy of markets, and a limited role for government have guided our economic policies, and our views of what is possible. Those ideas were built on an even longer history of economic thinking that has perpetually excluded and devalued people because of their race, class, gender, or disability. They are not only outdated, but demonstrably false. <br> <br>We have entered a period of great uncertainty and change, in which ideas and the values that inform them are shifting toward a re-balancing of markets, government, and communities. Our New Economic Paradigm work is experimenting with new ways of thinking and talking about the economy, while seeking to align stakeholders around a coherent new vision for equitable, inclusive, and sustainable capitalism. <br> <br>Rewriting the Rules<br>At its core, our capitalist economy and the ideas that shape it are a reflection of our common values. These ideas are translated into rules which give the economy structure and which govern who can participate in markets, and how. These rules include laws and regulations, as well as norms that govern everything from contracts and property rights, to competition, to employer-employee relationships. Ultimately, the rules that govern and shape markets matter, and they desperately need a rewrite. <br> <br>Our democracy, policies, politics, and markets must be protected and shielded from manipulation and capture by those with the most money,. These rules must be rewritten to direct capitalism toward greater societal outcomes, not the interests of economic or political elites. To that end, we are also exploring ways to rewrite the rules that shape economic structures so that they can support the well-being of everyone in our society. As part of that work, we are looking at opportunities to strengthen market infrastructure, financial systems, and corporate governance norms so that companies and investors can account for their impact on people, communities, and the planet.<br> <br>Reshaping Power <br>Ideas and rules are important, but they become concrete with power. Those who wield power are most likely to see their ideas reflected in the world, to design the economic and social norms governing markets and society, and determine which rules are enforced. This is why democracy, and its ideal of equal power, is so crucial to a capitalist society. Capitalism can certainly exist without democracy, but cannot, alone, guarantee that everyone will have access to opportunities to build a dignified life. We see this around the world, and increasingly in the United States: capitalist, oligopolistic markets are manipulated by the powerful to enrich themselves while exploiting the powerless. Democracy is the critical factor that allows all people equal rights and power to have a say in how capitalism impacts their lives and, more importantly, is the only system ensuring that any person can advocate for change when the capitalist economy is not delivering the basic well-being that is their right.<br> <br>Any true reimagining of capitalism must include checks to balance the power between markets, government, and civil society. So, Omidyar Network is working to reshape how power is distributed across society and the economy. One of our key priorities is to increase worker power and strengthen grassroots movements, since we believe that the economy will only increase the well-being of everyone — businesses, working people, and communities — when working people have individual and collective agency and voice. On the flip side, we are working to ensure that those who have benefited from existing economic structures do not use their economic power to distort either markets or democratic processes. To this end, we are working to curb concentrated corporate power and monopolies, especially in the tech sector, and are exploring strategies to counter corporate influence in our government. <br> <br>Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>The interplay of ideas, rules, and power are ultimately what determine which iterations of capitalism and democracy are possible. Ideas (which reflect our values) guide how we build our society. Rules determine distribution of wealth and power. Power then determines which ideas and rules shape society, and how. It is impossible to create a better form of capitalism or democracy without tackling each at the same time. In doing so, we aim to create a reimagined capitalism that empowers all people to realize their fullest potential as our economy flourishes.</p><p>Last year, we outlined five core pillars that we believe could best support a modern and equitably economy, one committed to values that reflect the inalienable rights of all; built to be not only inclusive, but explicitly anti-racist; capable of exercising true counterweights to economic power; dedicated to fostering a rebalanced relationship between markets, government, and communities; and responsive to the unique challenges we face in the 21st century. <br> <br>We know that we cannot build this alone. It will require deep partnership with a cadre of advocacy organizations and grassroots leaders, intellectuals and academics, business leaders and shareholders, philanthropies, policymakers and concerned citizens alike. We are humbled by the work that has already been done, encouraged by the growing chorus of voices calling for change, and proud to be a part of this effort. <br> <br>Throughout our history, American capitalism and democracy held promise for upward mobility and shared prosperity. Despite the many challenges that lie ahead, we believe we can expand that promise by seizing this moment to reimagine what we can&nbsp;be.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">Reimagining Capitalism Series: An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director, Responsible Technology and Tracy Williams, Director, Reimagining Capitalism</p><a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/business/11/02/18/google-workers-around-the-world-protest-its-corporate-culture">Photo by Jeenah Moon</a>,&nbsp;Reuters<p>In less than three weeks, nearly 6,000 workers at a fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama will begin voting on whether or not to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. If they vote yes, they will make history as the first American union in Amazon’s&nbsp;history.</p><p>The tech giant, which employs more than 1.1 million people around the world, has so far thwarted all attempts to unionize workers in the United States. The results? “The working conditions are horrible is all I’m willing to say,” <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/amazon-warehouse-workers-in-alabama-they-work-you-to-death/">said one Bessemer employee</a>. “I support a union coming aboard, we need them&nbsp;badly.”</p><p>The efforts to organize the Bessemer warehouse are the latest in a spate of activism by Amazon employees. <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/20/20874497/amazon-climate-change-walkout-google-microsoft-strike-tech-activism">In 2019,</a> more than 1,500 Amazon workers staged a walkout to push the company to lower its carbon footprint. That was followed by a virtual walkout this <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-avoided-unions-25-years-heres-labor-leaders-think-soon-change/">past June</a>, in protest of the firing of several tech workers and warehouse associates who were organizing around social justice and climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>And Amazon workers are not alone. Last summer, software engineer Raksha Muthukumar also found herself in the midst of a battle with a giant tech company. Her offense? She sent her colleagues a GoFundMe list of criminal justice reform groups in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. “The fear of retaliation has always been great, and we’ve seen retaliation, so this is our chance to protect ourselves,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954710407/at-google-hundreds-of-workers-formed-a-labor-union-why-to-protect-ourselves">said Muthukumar</a>.</p><p>On January 4, Muthukumar joined several hundred Google employees in the formation of the <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/">Alphabet Workers Union</a> (AWU) with support from the Communications Workers of America (CWA). Since the announcement, more than 500 additional people have joined the union, and will now be able to protect themselves with a union&nbsp;card.</p><p>Google’s employees aren’t demanding higher pay. They are fighting to overturn the fundamental concept of shareholder primacy — that Google’s primary goal should be to make as much money as possible. “We will use our reclaimed power to control what we work on and how it is used,” <a href="https://alphabetworkersunion.org/principles/mission-statement/">AWU wrote in its mission statement</a>. “We will ensure Alphabet acts ethically and in the best interests of society and the environment.”</p><p>This latest development comes after years of frustrated attempts by workers to unite and confront Google management on critical issues, including sexual harassment in the workplace, ethics and the responsible deployment of technology, and partnerships with controversial customers like the US Department of&nbsp;Defense.</p><p>Successful organizing drives don’t just happen. The formation of the Alphabet Workers Union is the culmination of many earlier efforts by Alphabet employees. In December, Dr. Timnit Gebru, a scholar in the race and Artificial Intelligence (AI) field and co-leader of Google’s Ethics in AI team, was ousted ostensibly due to a disagreement over her team’s research after previously speaking out on behalf of minoritized employees. Dr. Gebru’s termination was a defining moment that galvanized many Google employees on their path to forming the&nbsp;union.</p><p>This is all part of a growing movement to organize in the tech industry. Employees at tech firms Kickstarter and Glitch were able to unionize last year, and hundreds of other workers at large tech companies ranging from Microsoft and Facebook, to Salesforce and GitHub, have increased their activism.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-gm-score-25-billion-for-stockholders-vs-0-for-uaw-members-24fbd959331e">Omidyar Network</a> stands in solidarity with these workers who are organizing for their rights — and what’s&nbsp;right.</p><p>We believe that increased worker power provides an essential counterweight to the rising dominance of corporations. Over the past several decades, we have seen the economic power of major companies spill over into the political arena, leading to a lopsided power imbalance that has damaged not only the fundamentals of capitalism, but of our democracy as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The solution? Empower workers — from warehouse associates to software engineers — with greater power, agency, and voice at work, both individually and collectively. That goal lies squarely at the intersection of two of Omidyar Network’s key priorities: expanding Worker Power and supporting Responsible Tech Workers. In doing so, we can create a much healthier economy, one that is better for employees, businesses, consumers, and&nbsp;society.</p><p>Through our <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology/">Responsible Tech</a> work, we’re helping to <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/why-were-investing-in-the-rise-of-the-responsible-tech-worker-a96e74661cdf">provide tech workers</a> with the tools, resources, and space to ask thoughtful questions about responsible tech so they can focus on building solutions that avoid the potential downsides of technology. To that end, we have invested in organizations ranging from <a href="https://home.coworker.org/">Coworker</a>, a mechanism to helps tech workers organize, both within their companies and more broadly to the <a href="https://www.tspa.info/">Trust and Safety Professional Association</a>, to New&nbsp;Public.</p><p>As part of our efforts to <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagine Capitalism</a> and increase Worker Power, we’re fighting for labor reform policies that increase the power of all workers, and supporting new organizing models that expand worker power to a broader set of working people, whether in the gig economy, in homes, in fields, or in a conventional workplace. Some of our grantees in this area include the <a href="https://www.cleanslateworkerpower.org/">Clean Slate for Worker Power project</a> at Harvard Law School, United for Respect’s <a href="https://www.workitapp.org/">WorkIt app</a>, which uses artificial intelligence to answer workers’ questions about their rights and helps workers organize, and a new coalition focused on advancing worker power in California through policy and advocacy, narrative change, and strengthening organizing, led by the <a href="https://kiwa.org/">Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA</a>). We also work with the <a href="https://www.forworkingfamilies.org/">Partnership for Working Families</a>, and the <a href="http://www.warehouseworkers.org/">Warehouse Workers Resource&nbsp;Center</a>.</p><p>The actions taken by working people to organize at some of America’s most influential tech companies represent a significant step forward in restructuring the social contract between tech giants, the people who work for them, and the society they serve. We’re cheering them&nbsp;on.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/omidyar-network-applauds-tech-employees-who-are-demanding-a-voice-through-unionization-ebbe3bf2b26d">Omidyar Network Applauds Tech Employees Who Are Demanding a Voice Through Unionization</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Jessy Kate Schingler and Primavera de&nbsp;Filippi</p><p>Extitutional theory is an emerging field of scholarship that provides a set of conceptual tools to describe and analyse the underlying social dynamics of a variety of social arrangements, such as communities, companies, organisations, or any other types of institutions.</p><p>Extitutional theory posits that the institutional framework is just one specific lens through which we can make sense of social behaviour. Social dynamics that are not part of an institution are not unstructured, just differently structured. Specifically, institutions focus on the static and inert elements of social structures — the aspects that persist over time — whereas extitutions focus on the dynamic and mutating elements of social structures — the aspects that continuously evolve over time. Both serve as filters to observe different aspects of the underlying social arrangements. This means that if we look at structured social dynamics only and exclusively through an institutional lens, we are only seeing one part of the larger picture. Extitutional theory provides an alternative lens — and the choice to use it is a normative decision to look at another part of the&nbsp;picture.</p>Unknown author; <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=80222262">Public&nbsp;Domain</a>.<p>It is important to note that the extitutional lens is not claiming that there are social dynamics “outside” of an institution, in the Here be Dragons sense of extrapolated but as-yet-unexplored territory; it simply observes the same social dynamics of an institution from another conceptual angle. By relying on the idea that institutions and extitutions are two different interpretations of the same set of social dynamics, we can formalize the characterization of each lens, and begin to examine the underlying structuring logics that distinguish them. Since they represent two different points of view into the same social arrangement, we can also explore the structural relationships that link these two lenses. Extitutional theory attempts to formalize these different ordering logics and the interplay between&nbsp;them.</p><p>For instance, a company is generally composed of a structured set of roles: a board of directors, a series of shareholders, a CEO, a treasurer, etc. — each with their corresponding rights and duties. Instead of these formal roles, the extitutional lens focuses on the social dynamics that animate this structure, which necessarily evolve over time as individuals join or leave the social structure, and as their reciprocal relationships change. The hiring of a new CEO doesn’t mutate the structure from an institutional perspective, yet it could have a significant impact on the social dynamics of the company as whole, because of the different capacities and relationships that the CEO will establish with the other company members. These extitutional dynamics are crucial to the life of institutions, and may impact operational behaviour through culture and more informal principles and&nbsp;values.</p><p>Given that both lenses are looking at the exact same social arrangement — although focusing on different aspects of it — a proper understanding of the underlying social dynamics requires a holistic view, combining both the institutional and extitutional perspective. Indeed, one does not exist without the other: while the operations of a company or organisation are ultimately constrained by the specific rules and roles that constitute the institution, they are fundamentally fueled by the individuals assuming these roles and the corresponding relationships that make up the extitution. Accordingly, the interplay between institutions and extitutions is all the more crucial to explore in the context of complex social arrangements because the two are constantly shaping and influencing each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Extitutional theory is interested not only in the ways that individuals interact and engage with one another through relationships and rhythms, but also in how different practices of institutionalization can create conditions that stabilize and amplify, or erode and suppress, certain extitutional dynamics — and vice versa. Central to the process of institutionalisation is the concept of enclosure: the mechanism through which an institution implements increased control (or coding) relative to a particular domain. Conversely, extitutional theory contrasts enclosure with the concept of exclosure, which recognizes that certain types of enclosures appear to play a different role — that of protecting the activity within it from control and coding. Providing tools to better understand the interplay between these two mechanisms is one of the key contributions of Extitutional theory.</p><p>Extitutional theory does not assign any moral value to institutions or extitutions: neither are good or bad; yet, because of the performativity of these lenses, choosing to look at a particular social arrangement as an institution or an extitution will impact the way we interact with it, as well as the manner in which it will evolve over time. Networked technologies in particular have created dramatic new exclosures giving rise to extitutional dynamics which can’t be understood through the institutional lens alone. Hence, extitutional theory is important not because it is better than institutional theory, but because extitutions are an under-studied phenomena. Understanding extitutional dynamics, and their interplay with the more familiar tools and logics of institutions, can help us respond to the specific, unprecedented demands of human coordination in our&nbsp;era.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/an-introduction-to-extitutional-theory-e74b5a49ea53">An Introduction to Extitutional Theory</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>For the 1.7 billion unbanked adults around the world, access to financial services is extremely limited. Without even a basic savings account, economic opportunity is often limited to informal offerings such as local shopkeepers who extend credit to their customers, microfinance institutions that work to serve the last mile, and community savings and credit associations that are setup by individuals living in the same village.</p>



<p>In the unbanked world, individuals borrow a few hundred to a few thousand dollars at a time, paying back over a relatively short time frame of 12-18 months. But despite excellent credit records, they are unable to receive even similar credit facilities at local banks. This is because the data from their informal transactions is essentially invisible: the banks either do not trust the data sources, or are otherwise unable to verify the provenance of the data. </p>



<p>While this is the state of the world today, it does not have to be our future.  Kiva, a US-based nonprofit organization focused on financial inclusion, has built Kiva Protocol to bridge the data disconnect and help enable universal financial access. In 2019, Sierra Leone, a West African nation of about 7 million, launched the National Digital Identity Platform (NDIP) that used Kiva Protocol to enable fast, cheap, and secure identity verification for its citizens. </p>



<p>Kiva Protocol is built using Hyperledger Indy, Aries, and Ursa, and as implemented in Sierra Leone, allows citizens to perform electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) verifications in about 11 seconds, using just their national ID number and a fingerprint. With this verification, it is possible for the nation’s unbanked to open a savings account and move into the formally banked population.</p>



<p>To find the right platform, Kiva assessed more than 20 software stacks, both centralized and decentralized. Blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies quickly emerged as good solutions for the developing world as they enable data provenance at the protocol level and stakeholders can act relatively independently to enable their various activities in the formal and informal sectors.</p>



<p>After deep consideration, Kiva decided to use Hyperledger’s stack for identity: Indy, Aries, Ursa. While all three projects are closely related, each has a distinct mandate:</p>



  Hyperledger Indy is a distributed ledger purpose-built for decentralized ID with transferable, private, and secure credentials;  Hyperledger Aries is infrastructure that supports interactions between peers and between blockchains and other DLTs; and  Hyperledger Ursa is a modular, flexible library that enables developers to share time-tested and secure cryptography.  



<p>In August 2019, Kiva launched the beta of Kiva Protocol with a public event opened by the president of Sierra Leone. Since that launch, global regulators have made significant progress in terms of how they are considering digital identity and eKYC verifications. There is a growing global movement towards user-owned and -controlled data, better privacy, and more universal access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of today, Kiva is focusing on building additional ecosystem applications and services to make it easier for all stakeholders to access and use Kiva Protocol. Much of this is being contributed upstream into the Hyperledger Indy and Aires projects, with the remaining components hosted in Kiva’s repository.</p>



<p>Hyperledger teamed up with Kiva on a detailed case study covering the challenges of the unbanked, requirements for a solution that delivers fast, cheap and secure ID exchange, and plans for expanding Kiva Protocols’ use to other countries and other applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital identity is now a fundamental requirement to function in a world that has shifted to remote-first. To empower individuals and to protect their self-sufficiency, the concept of self-sovereign identity (SSI) was developed. It grants the individual agency over their interactions and data by putting the data-subject back into the driver-seat.</p> Self-sovereign identity and its use-cases <p>There are plenty of potential use-cases. Our identity isn’t something we can easily explain or which can easily be summarized by single data sets. It highly depends on the context in which it operates and is different depending on the person with whom we interact. One category of use-cases is the proof of certification or qualification of an individual. This proof is required for applications for jobs, grants or the participation in special events. Depending on the requirements, an individual can collect all necessary certificates and present them directly to the relying party. Another big category of use-cases is to enable access to information, buildings or resources. When e.g. information is labeled as “internal only”, the authorized people should be able to access it. Organizations can issue credentials to the right target audience and only approve access for those individuals, which have a valid credential.</p> Wallets and&nbsp;Networks <p>Two elemental components of an SSI-ecosystem are the wallets for end-users and the networks for organisations on which issued credentials are anchored to. In this article, we will explain how these relate to each other, what their specific goals are and how they interact with each other by providing the example of the Lissi wallet and the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet <p>In order to store and possess the credential, an individual requires an application with a graphical user interface to receive, store and present these credentials to third parties. A wallet is a key management application, which hides all the complicated technical aspects from the user and provides the required guidance to securely interact with trusted contacts. The Lissi wallet offers an intuitive interface and provides the necessary information and flexibility to navigate through an increasingly complex digital environment. Furthermore, it automatically recognizes the network, which an organisation used to verify the authenticity of the credential. Hence, while organizations can choose a suitable network, the user is informed about the network, but doesn’t need to do anything to receive the credential or interact with the organisation. Lissi is your smart agent, which takes unnecessary workload from you, provides you with the information to make informed decisions while always offering a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>While the Lissi team is also involved in the formation of the <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion network</a> with its main focus in Europe, we recognize that organisations around the world have different needs. The networks, which are necessary to verify the authenticity of issued credentials, need to be adjusted to different regulatory requirements and the specific demands of their target audience. The network is a distributed and publicly readable database, which contains the public identifier of a legal entity. Therefore, we are committed to not only provide individuals with the choice of their favourite wallet, but also organisations with the choice of their network. We are delighted to announce that the latest version of the Lissi wallet also supports the Indicio&nbsp;Network.</p> About the Indico&nbsp;Network <p><a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio.tech </a>created the Indicio Network to meet the needs of companies and organizations that want a reliable and robust network to build, test, demo, and launch their identity solutions — all the while supported by a team of engineers with extensive experience in decentralized identity, its architecture, and its use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Indicio believes that this “concierge” approach to running a network will accelerate the development, adoption, and use of verifiable digital credentials. This&nbsp;means:</p>  Professional staffing: Indicio’s engineers are among the most experienced in the decentralized identity field and are ready to answer questions, support network operations, and help to get products ready for&nbsp;launch.  Stability for demonstrations: Indicio supports developers at every step of the way from building to testing and public demonstrations.  Cross-network test readiness: Indicio sees the future as one of interoperable credentials and networks. Its network is the perfect platform for testing interoperability by issuing and verifying on multiple networks.  Easy Node Operator onboarding: For those interested in joining a network as a node operator, Indicio has simplified the process, offers training for all levels, and a suite of network tools and resources.  <p>With the Covid pandemic driving urgent need for decentralized identity solutions, Indicio is committed to delivering superlative infrastructure and technical support, and to making decentralized identity as easy to use as possible, whether as a node operator, a developer, an issuer or a verifier.</p> About Indicio <p>Indicio.tech is a professional services firm specializing in decentralized identity architecture, engineering, and consultancy. Indicio provides expert guidance to a global community of clients on the use of verifiable credentials to build digital identity solutions. The decentralized networks and tools created by Indicio make verifiable credentials easy to adopt, simple to deploy, and reliable to use. As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized identity as a public good that enables people to control their identities online and share their data by consent. Indicio believes in privacy and security by design, interoperability, and supports the open source goals of the decentralized identity community.</p><p>This article was co-written by the Lissi and Indicio team.<br>Cheers</p>

 Key Event Receipt Infrastructure to expand the reach of DIDs&nbsp; <p><br></p> Introduction <p>Work under the <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> hood continues on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. This new type of digital identifier enables the verification that a DID comes from an authenticable source under the control of a governing entity. A DID is always coupled to a unique DID document that describes how to (i.) interact with a governing entity in a trustable way and (ii.) authenticate a DID controller.</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>This association is defined by a DID method, which can be captured directly through a dedicated namespace in the syntax of the DID. Each method defines the basic chaining and processing requirements - CRUD (create, read, update, deactivate) - for the immutable coupling of the DID and its associated DID document. A DID method specification defines both the DID method and the process of DID resolution, describing how a DID document is to be written and subsequently edited. DIDs come with a unique set of characteristics to provide a prominent solution for digital identifiers in decentralised networks, but there are cons.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID Working Group</a> has already registered <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">84 different method types</a>, which raises questions about interoperability, scalability, and security of the current DID methodology, such as (i.) How secure are DIDs and specific DID methods?, and (ii.) Can all DID methods be trusted?</p><p>In this blog post, these questions are addressed from the viewpoint of <a href="https://keri.one">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure), a novel, simple, and improved DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) solution for digital identifiers. KERI provides a uniform solution to DID document authentication and resolution that will prove invaluable to use cases where security and interoperability are essential (e.g., for global supply chains and humanitarian applications).</p> Interoperability  DID resolution process, a security weakness <p>Each DID method aims to solve the same problem in a nuanced way by responding to a specific problem or use case uniquely by design. However, from the perspective of the user, this compromises the integrity of the network with a variance of digital assurance for each method implementation.</p><p>From the inclusion of standard Central Authorities (CAs) to the implementation of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), each solution comes with its own set of pros and cons when it comes to tackling digital security. Some rely on the human trust factor, while others rely on cryptographic assurance and, through these nuances, the DID resolution process, inadvertently, becomes a “magic box” with each specific implementation relying on different security measures.&nbsp;</p><p>If interoperability is a core requirement for a specific use case, assessing and maintaining an optimal level of security and assurance may become difficult. To achieve strong security between the DID and its associated DID document, regardless of who controls and stores the DID Document, interacting actors must assume that the result can always be cryptographically assured and, therefore, trusted. If a specific method is ever compromised, the negative connotations could be detrimental to the SSI community as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>With the ever-increasing number of DID methods, Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA) and digital wallet implementations would have to support all methods for full interoperability to be maintained.</p> Security  DID resolution process, the rise of the “Magic Box” <p>Digital security is only as strong as its weakest link. The process of obtaining a DID document for a given DID is called DID resolution and, when it comes to the DID, it is the weakest link. To create a DID, a user must first generate a public / private key pair. The DID can then be coupled to a DID document and usually within an infrastructure to enable that process. The cryptographic link enables a strong binding between the key and the DID. However, when it comes to the DID resolution process, most DID methods either rely on external sources of information or provide a limited scope on the capability and content of the DID document. There is no standard way of creating a strong binding between a DID and DID document, which compromises the security of the identifier. An example of weak binding is demonstrated by the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web method</a>, which simply points to a DID document in the public domain with a DNS (Domain Name System) resolver used for the retrieval process, e.g.:</p><p>did:web:w3c-ccg.github.io:user:alice</p><p>The DID method, a dedicated namespace in the DID syntax, currently defines the DID resolution process. As mentioned in this post’s introduction, the number of registered DID methods continues to rise exponentially.&nbsp;</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>With the rapid rise of decentralised authentication solutions appearing on the market, many different DID methods are currently active under the hood of applications and services which, for the most part, remain invisible to the end-user. Thus popularity, rather than security, has become the driving factor behind chosen DID methods. Due to this fragmentation, identifying and resolving weak security points of deployed DID methods continues to be cumbersome. Some of the method types, such as the <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DID method</a>, enable the derivation of a DID document directly from the DID itself. However, most rely on external processing to resolve the document, with the source providing a hidden "magic box" that masks the DID resolution process. To maintain system integrity, any DID method that requires external processing via a “magic box” requires trust from all interacting actors. Trust is a human trait. Cryptographic assurance, a machine trait, can often be overlooked in the presence of trust.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital security stems from the resolution process but, with the current DID methodology, a uniform standard is not available across all implementations, which can lead to fragmentation and security risks across the network.</p> How to maintain interoperability &amp; security <p>The weak binding issue between a DID and DID document can be resolved by a technological solution that provides an immutable link between the two objects. In doing so, a DID document can be cryptographically verified for correctness as there is an immutable coupling to a specific DID.&nbsp;</p> Cryptographic hash&nbsp; <p>Cryptographic assurance is provided by generating a hash of the DID document, to be used as the actual identifier. The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key method</a> works in this way. However, this approach is limited as there is no way of rotating the keys, revoking the identifier, or adding additional information to the DID document.</p> Key Event Receipt Infrastructure 








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p><a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) is a protocol that provides a simple set of rules on how to achieve strong bindings between the controller, identifier, and key pair, without sacrificing the functional capabilities of the identifier. It achieves this through solid security principles in its base architecture. KERI generates a type of “DID document” in the form of an appendable private micro-ledger that contains cryptographically-linked sets of events for transaction verification purposes. In doing so, KERI facilitates sapored data supply chains providing an append-only chained <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0000.md">key-event log</a> (KEL) of signed transfer statements, which account for the source of the identifier and all transactions related to it.</p><p>In current KERI implementations, the genesis state of the identifier is “active” as defined by the Human Colossus model of <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/active-and-passive-identifiers">Identifier States</a>, meaning that a signing key is required to authenticate the controller. As a self-certifying identifier with an event log, KERI provides a strong binding between the DID and DID document, thereby enabling all DID identifier operations (e.g., key rotation, delegation, and interaction) to be tracked and cryptographically verified by any recipient of the identifier information. For instances where a controller's keys are compromised, a pre-rotation mechanism for key recoverability is also available. These security-rich enhancements suggest that a magic box, along with any associated weak binding issues, can be benched in favour of KERI, which promises to provide a simple, yet improved, alternative DKMS-solution for digital identifiers.</p><p>In the current version of the DID specification, location is identifiable via the method space. For example, the <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">did:sov method</a> assigns a DID to the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin</a> MainNet ledger. Other DID methods define the resolution rules for other unique implementations. In terms of security, this level of tailor-made differentiation between use cases can become an attack vector. Having to maintain an ever-growing registry of DID methods and implementation specifics suggests a scalability issue in the current methodology. These issues are disadvantageous to the whole SSI community.<br><br>To solve these issues, KERI introduces a component called Resolver, which provides a mechanism to discover identifiers. Resolver simply maps identifiers to URLs or IP addresses where users can either obtain (or be directed to) auditable identifier event logs. The resolver relies on a distributed hash table (DHT) algorithm, known for its beneficial characteristics in autonomy, decentralization, fault tolerance, and scalability, a good example being <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (InterPlanetary File System) or <a href="https://gnunet.org/en/index.html">GNUnet</a>.&nbsp;</p> Simple and concise <p>The beauty of&nbsp; KERI is that the user can nominate locations through the event log with full autonomy to make edits or location transfers as they wish. To highlight a prevalent issue with the current DID methodology, a DID method may assign an identifier to the Sovrin MainNet but, after a few months, the controller may wish to move it to a new location such as the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> network or an IPFS location. As it currently stands, there is no restriction on the number of identifiers that can be issued to identify the same object. The generation of duplicate identifiers for the same content despite the encoded part of the DID remaining unaltered is problematic. By removing the method space, the identifier can be used on any network, thus providing a truly interoperable solution for decentralised identifiers.</p><p>With KERI, a cryptographically-verifiable DID document is available to a recipient without requiring prior knowledge of the exact location of the object. In the absence of having to define a specific network or alternative storage location in the DID syntax, the namespace for any “magic box” method becomes redundant, along with any fragmentation issues that have arisen from the current DID methodology. In the future, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax">DID syntax</a> as defined in the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> specification, could evolve from …</p><p>did:&lt;method&gt;:&lt;identifier&gt;</p><p>to</p><p>did:&lt;identifier&gt;<br></p><p>The road ahead may be long, but the effort worthwhile, as the revised syntax could bring about an adoption factor where (i.) security is a primary concern (e.g., humanitarian sector) or (ii.) stakeholders for a given business process are numerous and operate in different jurisdictions (e.g., global supply chains).</p> Conclusion &amp; Further developments <p>The current generation of DIDs has introduced an innovative approach to digital identifiers, which has triggered the SSI movement. However, the inclusion of the method space in the DID syntax has led to fragmentation and weak security properties of the identifier type. These known method-space issues give the community impetus to redress them. In light of these innovative developments, now is the time to embrace KERI as an improved interoperable and secure solution for digital identifiers.</p><p>KERI is a truly secure network-agnostic decentralised infrastructure for digital identifiers.</p><p>Within <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, a Linux Foundation Project, trustees of the Human Colossus Foundation have convened an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+and+Semantics+Working+Group">Inputs and Semantics Working Group</a> (ISWG), subdivided into an <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+Domain+Group">Inputs Domain Group</a> (ISWG-I) and a <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Semantic+Domain+Group">Semantic Domain Group</a> (ISWG-S). The mission of the ISWG-I is to define an Internet-scale decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI) where the primary cryptographic root-of-assurance is self-certifying identifiers underpinned by one-way functions. KERI is the core public utility technology of choice in the ISWG-I. <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Health+Care+Task+Force">Health Care</a>, <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Notice+and+Consent+Task+Force">Notice &amp; Consent</a>, <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Privacy+and+Risk+Task+Force">Privacy &amp; Risk</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Storage+and+Portability+Task+Force">Storage &amp; Portability</a> task forces have also been convened under the ISWG to integrate the technology into a <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-first-contact">Dynamic Data Economy</a> (DDE).</p><p>Check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">Part 2: Inputs Domain</a> of the webinar “Core public utility technologies for a ‘next generation’ internet”&nbsp;where Sam Smith, Founder of ProSapien LLC, explains how KERI is set to become a breakthrough solution for authenticable data entry and brings with it the promise of a unified DID method for all signed inputs in a digital network.</p><p>The core development work for the KERI project is taking place at <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a> under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, where collaborators continue to build and test the solution in a production environment.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about the rationale behind did:&lt;identifier&gt;, including any use cases that may benefit from the revamped syntax, follow our upcoming blog posts, join the Human Colossus Foundation <a href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#hcf:matrix.org?via=matrix.org">Matrix room</a>, or email us directly at info@humancolossus.org.</p><p>Official KERI website: <a href="https://keri.one">keri.one</a></p>

<p>The term Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is rapidly growing in popularity, bit what is it?</p>
<p>SSI is a concept was created as a result of a long quest to find the new way to help create an electronic identity for the Internet that would on one hand allow individuals (and things) to share details on their identity with various websites and applications and, on the the other hand, ensure that this identity doesn’t leak more information than required (e.g. I’m over 18 years old) and can’t be tracked across services (e.g. my employer doesn’t know that I’m talking to several banks to get a mortgage).</p>
<p>SSI as a term can be tracked to the works of Devon Loffretto (“individuals have an established right to an identity” – <a href="https://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html">see here</a>). Christopher Allen, a cryptographer known for his contribution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> , chose the term Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp; as the name for a new manifesto of 10 foundational principles for digital identity, which he published in a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">post</a> titled&nbsp; “The Path to the Self-Sovereign Identity” on April 25, 2016. In this Blog post, he has outlined the history of on-line identity and described how these principles should guide the creation of the new identity system.</p>
<p>In his own words</p>
<blockquote><p>These principles attempt to ensure the user control that’s at the heart of self-sovereign identity. However, they also recognize that identity can be a double-edged sword — usable for both beneficial and maleficent purposes. Thus, an identity system must balance transparency, fairness, and support of the commons with protection for the individual.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result the following principles were formulated :</p>
 
 Existence 
 Control 
 Access 
 Transparency 
 Persistance 
 Portability 
 Interoperability 
 Consent 
 Minimalization 
 Protection 
 
<p>The ideas from the article and the principles served SSI community well and helped foster progress on implementing various technical approaches and define initial standards (e.g. W3C DID).</p>
<p>Fast forward to Dec 2020.</p>
<p>Sovrin Foundation, the leading global organizations that created the first functioning global utility network for SSI, <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">publishes</a> a revised set of principles that builds on the original vision created by Christoper Allen in 2016.</p>
<p>The updated set of principles include the following 12 items:</p>
 
 Representation 
 Interoperability 
 Decentralization 
 Control &amp; Agency 
 Participation 
 Equity and Inclusion 
 Usability, Accessibility, and Consistency 
 Portability 
 Security 
 Verifiability and Authenticity 
 Privacy and Minimal Disclosure 
 Transparency 
 
<p>The main differences to the 10 SSI principles include decomposition of some of the original ones into separate categories, so that it’s easier to reason whether or not a service really adheres to the key ideas and goals of SSI. There is also emphasis on applicability of the SSI systems and Identities that can represent not only humans, but also legal entities and machines. The latter is very important for the future use-cases&nbsp; that will include fully digital, automated business processes, services and products produced and consumed by&nbsp; individuals, their AI driven agents, IoT devices and legal entities, which can can have completely new forms of ownership, such as Decentralised Autonomous Organisations.</p>
<p>This is a very welcome contribution to the emerging body of knowledge and best practices in the SSI space. From our viewpoint, these principles should be the foundation of the future eID Law and ecosystem in Switzerland, as they create a strong and sustainable foundation for the transformation of all key everyday processes for the digital future, without endangering the key values of federalism, democracy, freedom and pluralism that make Switzerland what it is today.</p>

<p>We have exciting news to share: CCI has a home&nbsp;now!</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI)</a> was formed in April 2020, we were a self-organizing group of companies and individuals, held together by a few mailing lists and working groups, to explore how Verifiable Credentials (VCs), an open standard and an emerging technology, could be used for the public health crisis unfolding with COVID-19. Recognizing our limits early on as an informal group, we quickly pivoted from developing a solution together to supporting each other to build for their local contexts. Over the course of nine months, we have seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dbWvs1m8uziTsbhUQv_nPofTXAyDSkxI5CZtoo1SlRY/edit?ts=5e85430a#heading=h.eu5hdldar29h">over 20 projects present their work</a> to the CCI community and developed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7oEESllR9pa4ecXNGfougaHmDBzDBh1KHKvIsy0dPw/edit?usp=sharing">an MVP governance framework</a> that can be adapted to specific COVID-19 use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>As our work evolved and as vaccine development showed promising progress, the need to align efforts around VCs for COVID-19 and educate decision-makers on the use of VCs for COVID-19 became clearer and stronger. However, the limits of not having a formal organizational home hinder us from engaging with key stakeholders and conducting necessary development efforts. So, we began exploring options for a home in&nbsp;summer.</p><p>Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) emerged in the middle of the pandemic, right after we started our search. There was a natural alignment between LFPH and CCI on building on open standards to ensure interoperability and developing open-source code bases of minimal-viable privacy-preserving software components to make interoperability easier and cheaper to implement. So here we are today; after achieving success with privacy-preserving exposure notification apps, LFPH officially took CCI in before the end of 2020, kicking off our journey to advance the use of VCs for public health with vaccination record as a&nbsp;start.</p><p>At the tail end of holiday spirits, we hope to spread our joy by sharing with you the invitation letter (below in italics) from Brian Behlendorf, the Executive Director of LFPH. You can find the official press release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lfph.io/2020/12/16/press-release/">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Dear CCI Community,</blockquote><blockquote>We are excited to extend this invitation to you to join <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> and work together with us to advance the use of Verifiable Credentials and data and technical interoperability of Verifiable Credentials in the public health&nbsp;realm.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) was founded in July 2020 as a collaborative effort to combat COVID-19 and future epidemics through building, securing, and sustaining open- source software to help public health authorities (PHAs). We started with exposure notification apps and have achieved success with <a href="https://github.com/covidgreen/covid-green-app">COVID Green™</a> and <a href="https://www.covidshield.app/">COVID Shield™</a>, which are being deployed in 4 US states and 7 countries around the world. The early achievements were made possible within such a short time frame through our merger with <a href="https://www.lfph.io/tcn-coalition/">TCN Coalition</a>, a global community promoting privacy-preserving and interoperable exposure notification apps.</blockquote><blockquote>As COVID-19 tests mature and vaccines are around the corner, we have identified an increasing demand for responsible and interoperable credentialing solutions to issue and manage COVID-19 credentials, especially vaccine records, from PHAs. Therefore, we would like to work with the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI), supporting you to build on your existing work and enabling open-source development for vaccine records or key components of it, which can be implemented widely by PHAs with the help of the CCI community. We view this as a starting point of a long-term partnership to advance the adoption of verifiable credentials for wider public health use cases, such as patient ID and patient centered information exchange.</blockquote><blockquote>At LFPH, we have been following CCI’s work; we value the resources and assets created by the community and the tight relationships you have developed with small, grassroots solution providers. We foresee the scope of our partnership to go beyond open-source software development. The nature of the problem we are solving requires us to build solutions that are interoperable, so we are committed to supporting CCI in leading work around open standards, e.g. definitions and schemas for public health credentials. We also will provide CCI resources to strengthen community and knowledge building, broaden and deepen engagement with key stakeholders (e.g. PHAs, commercial entities, software vendors, relevant identity and technical communities) and conduct public and strategic advocacy.</blockquote><blockquote>As the next step, we will join the CCI Group Update call on December 11 from 10 to 11 am ET to answer any questions you have. In the meantime, we plan to commission the following three members of the CCI Community Guidance Team to lead the migration of CCI into LFPH once the community is&nbsp;ready:</blockquote><blockquote>- Lucy Yang, Co-Lead of the Coordination and Communications Workstream of&nbsp;CCI</blockquote><blockquote>- John Walker, Co-Lead of the Coordination and Communications Workstream of&nbsp;CCI</blockquote><blockquote>- Kaliya Young, the Identity Woman, an active contributor at CCI and a super-connector in the credential community.

 2020 — How SSI Went Mainstream <p>January 12,&nbsp;2021</p> An introduction to SSI and where it came from.<br>2020 as a growth catalyst and where SSI is going.<br>A <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> perspective. <p>Written by:<br>Chris Raczkowski — Sovrin Foundation, Chairman of the Board of Trustees<br>Drummond Reed — Evernym, Chief Trust Officer; ToIP, Steering Committee Member</p><p>It goes without saying that last year was transformational for the world. Along with pains felt by many, the challenges of 2020 were also a catalyst for positive growth. The global SSI community, dedicated to privacy-respecting digital identity, has risen to these challenges. Digital identity solutions have been called into action by governments and companies large and small to help mitigate pandemic-related public health challenges. This call to action has accelerated adoption of SSI across many use cases where it brings new standards of truly privacy-respecting digital identity control to all peoples of the&nbsp;world.</p> But first, what is&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI is an acronym for self-sovereign identity, representing the secure, privacy-respecting digital identity model developed around blockchain technology starting in 2016. During the last five years acceptance of this model has grown rapidly. SSI utilizes best practices in open-source cryptography and decentralized computing in tandem with humanistic governance. It also helped drive development of new technology open standards such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>. While SSI incorporates a wide range of complex technology and detailed governance, its essence is captured in the opening chapter of a book that will be published during&nbsp;2021:</p><blockquote>“The best overall analogy for the decentralized identity model (SSI) is in fact exactly the way we prove our identity to each other every day: by getting out our wallet and showing the credentials we have obtained from other trusted parties.&nbsp;... With decentralized digital identity, we just do this with digital wallets, digital credentials, and digital connections.” ¹</blockquote><blockquote>SSI has emerged as a, “simple, neutral, memorable name for this new model for digital identity.” ²</blockquote> Open Source and Open Standards: Growth Engines of&nbsp;SSI <p>SSI is rooted in core principles of privacy-respecting Internet-scale identity architecture first laid out by individuals like Kim Cameron with his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352/#lawsofiden_topic3">Laws of Identity</a>, which were published in 2006. Such governance principles, combined with open-source technology advances in blockchain, cryptography, supporting software and standards, ultimately gave rise to reliable SSI infrastructure starting in 2017. Open-source development of digital identity technology, standards and principles is truly the engine of SSI&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, a not-for-profit corporation, was established in 2016 to promote global adoption of SSI as an open standard for digital identity. Over the past five years the Foundation has operated the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a> as the best-known SSI identity network, helped advanced the most widely used SSI open-source software (Hyperledger Indy, Ursa, and Aries), published the most widely used <a href="https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/">SSI governance framework</a>, and drives SSI thought leadership in areas including data protection, financial inclusion, IoT, and government-issued ID. In its role as an originator and disseminator of open-source SSI concepts and code, the Sovrin Foundation is dedicated to supporting SSI development in cooperation with companies, organizations and governments around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>One of the most important products of this work is the “Sovrin Stack,” shown in Figure&nbsp;1.</p>Figure 1: The Sovrin Stack, developed by the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community, was created in early 2019 and is curated as part of the open-source Sovrin Governance Framework.<p>The Sovrin Stack was the first conceptualization of SSI infrastructure as a four-layer stack, where the lower two layers provide cryptographic trust needed for machine-to-machine communications and the upper two layers provide human trust needed for business, legal, and social interactions.</p><p>The Sovrin Stack also represents the first recognition of the critical role governance frameworks play in bridging the technological innovations of SSI with real-world policy requirements of governments, industries, businesses and individuals. In fact, as the importance of governance frameworks became more widely acknowledged, the SSI community recognized that specialized governance was needed at all four layers of the stack. During early 2020 the Sovrin Stack evolved into the Trust over IP (ToIP) stack, shown in Figure&nbsp;2.</p>Figure 2: The ToIP stack, showing how governance frameworks apply to all four layers of the stack, and also how Layer 4 can support entire digital trust ecosystems.<p>As a model for decentralized digital trust infrastructure at Internet-scale, the ToIP stack was compelling enough that in May 2020 it became the cornerstone of a new Linux Foundation project called the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP Foundation</a>. Rapid growth of ToIP Foundation membership is a testament to how core concepts of SSI architecture are strongly supported by respected governments and companies.</p><p>Emergence of entirely new organizations promoting SSI adoption is evidence of the effectiveness of the Sovrin Foundation’s open-source approach to advancing technology and thought leadership. The Foundation’s success is measured not only in by results it delivers, but in the progress of derivative and novel SSI products and services created by organizations which build on contributions of Sovrin and the global SSI community.</p> 2019: Early success ahead of unexpected crisis <p>Prior to the global public health crisis of 2020, SSI was progressing along a steadily increasing adoption curve. Start-up companies, global corporations, digital identity privacy organizations and a variety of national and regional governments (Canada, UK, US, Germany, British Columbia, Ontario, etc.) were all expanding SSI infrastructure and launching initial use cases. This advancement was based on vigorous technology development (open-source software architecture, code and standards), a robust global public identity utility (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sovrin Ledger</a>), the first comprehensive decentralized digital identity governance framework (the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance Framework</a>), and proof of concept use cases produced by a variety of governments and companies.</p><p>Woven throughout this activity, the Sovrin Foundation acted as a convener, facilitator and beacon for the global SSI community. The Foundation’s commitment to the <a href="https://sovrin.org/principles-of-ssi/">Principles of SSI</a>, open-source technology and identity ecosystem governance, combined with efforts to sow the ethos of SSI across a spectrum of use-cases, helped to create fertile ground for emergent applications. During this course of activities Sovrin and the SSI community unknowingly primed the world for tremendous acceleration of SSI adoption during a most unexpected year.</p> 2020: The SSI Springtime <p>As the world embarked on a new decade at the start of 2020, almost no one could have guessed what their lives and societies would look like 365 days later. Public health challenges of 2020 brought tremendous stress and grief to most corners of the world. Yet, the situation also created opportunity for unprecedented growth of technologies that could address urgent social needs. For SSI, this meant compressing what could have been a five-to-ten-year adoption process for sensitive use-cases into a period of 12&nbsp;months.</p><p>During normal times, new technology standards for critical services such as medical information credentials, travel credentials and critical worker credentials often face regulatory review and approval marathons spanning years or even decades. Fortunately, prior to 2020, the core components of SSI had already been assessed and accepted by respected companies and governments. These organizations understood that trusted digital identity must be privacy-respecting, which is a central requirement for SSI technology and governance. With solutions needed immediately for verifiable proof of medical test results, vaccination status, etc., the standards and technology developed with the support of the Sovrin Foundation and the global SSI community have been fast-tracked into&nbsp;service.</p><p>Just a few of the SSI implementations that were launched in 2020 or are pending launch in early 2021&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/publications/travel-pass/">IATA Travel Pass</a> will be the first verifiable credential capable of providing proof of COVID-19 test and vaccination status at airports around the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/covid-19-nhs-to-trial-digital-passports-to-free-up-staff-movement/">NHS Staff Passport</a> is the first portable digital identity credential for doctors and nurses in one of the largest public healthcare networks in the&nbsp;world,  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about/this-is-gleif">GLEIF</a> (the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation), based in Switzerland and the only global online source that provides open, standardized and high quality legal entity reference data, is <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/lei-corporate-digital-identity-verifiable-credentials-did/">committed to following the SSI model</a> for digital identity credentials for companies.  <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/DE/Standardartikel/SchaufensterSichereDigIdentProjekte/sdi-projekt_ssi.html">SSI4DE</a>, co-funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs, supports showcases for secure digital identities in Germany, and <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/e-personalausweis-alternative-zu-google-und-facebook-merkel-macht-digitale-identitaet-zur-chefsache/26684942.html?ticket=ST-22324660-c75hUhsrgC4moLTe3uGj-ap3">Chancellor Angela Merkel declared digital identity as a priority</a> matter during December&nbsp;2020.  <a href="https://www.memberpass.com/">MemberPass</a> brings SSI to financial services with Credit Union customer identity verification,  <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/">Farmer Connect</a> is realizing is vision to “Humanize consumption through technology” by enabling and empowering individual coffee farmers to more easily work with global enterprises, and reducing costs and inefficiencies for large companies to work directly with small and often remote&nbsp;farmers.  <a href="https://www.lumedic.io/perspectives/introducing-lumedic-connect">Lumedic Exchange</a> is the first network designed exclusively for patient-centric exchange of healthcare data using SSI-based verifiable credentials.  <p>While scientists and professionals in the fields of biology, genetics, immunology, medicine and public health are the superstars of 2020, SSI is also in a position to make a major contribution. Reliable digital credentials for medical test results and vaccination status, in the form of W3C Verifiable Credentials backed by privacy-respecting governance, can help societies more safely return to normal levels of social interaction and restart economies. At the same time, the SSI model will be establishing new standards and expectations for person identity data management and control by individuals.</p> 2021: Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>Unexpected urgencies that accelerated broad acceptance of the SSI digital identity model during 2020 will continue into 2021. Ongoing challenges of the global pandemic can be mitigated by expanded use cases and public acceptance of trusted digital identity. In the most forward-thinking and dynamic jurisdictions, SSI progress is anticipated in the following areas:</p>  Verifiable digital vaccination credentials to facilitate safer operations at some workplaces, medical facilities and senior care&nbsp;centers,  International travel enabled by vaccination and medical test results quickly and easily proved with the power of verifiable digital credentials,  Rollout of government-issued ID such as driver licenses in the form of digital credentials conforming to SSI standards and securely stored in privacy-respecting digital wallets on smart&nbsp;phones,  Expansion of SSI digital identity networks, along with demonstrated interoperability of digital credentials and their verification across multiple networks using smart phone apps (digital ID wallets),  Laws and regulations implemented at state, provincial and national levels which support the use of digital Verifiable Credentials for medical, financial and other&nbsp;uses.  <p>While the wellbeing of individuals and societies during this historic time rests largely on the clear thinking and actions of responsible scientists, business leaders and government leaders, SSI is also playing a significant role. The Sovrin Foundation is dedicated to supporting global adoption of SSI to help mitigate challenges of this pandemic, while advancing its mission of Identity for&nbsp;All.</p> Notes   Alex Preukschat, Drummond Reed.

<p>Release Date: January 5th 2021</p>



<p>Today, the IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) and FIDO Alliance announced that they are collaborating to improve the status of IoT security.</p>



<p>The main aims of the collaboration are to raise awareness on the limitations of passwords for IoT devices and provide practical alternatives for product manufacturers. The goals of the collaboration will be achieved by joint messaging and providing publicly accessible materials to help industry implement password-less authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s the problem with passwords?</p>



<p>Passwords are a traditional and simple method for authenticating a user and allowing access to resources. In the past this may have been sufficient, but passwords dramatically fall short in many ways when billions of devices are expected to be connected to networks to collect and share data or provide automation – the era of IoT.</p>



<p>Although this is not a new problem, users are still finding it a challenge to manage and keep track of different accounts and app login credentials. The result is that many take shortcuts – using easy to remember (and guess) passwords, or using the same password across many accounts1. This weakens security. Now consider the growing number of home, business, medical, industrial and national infrastructure uses of IoT which bring efficiency, innovation and user benefits. IoT devices are everywhere and the trend is set to continue as <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-iot-devices-are-there/">this article</a> illustrates. For IoT-class products such as routers and webcams, traditionally manufacturers have opted to have factory universal default passwords2 and whilst these can be changed, a significant number remain set to the default. This makes them prime targets for botnets which weaponize devices for DDOS attacks such as the famous Mirai and its many variants.</p>



<p>This means that the sheer volume of devices is only going to exacerbate the issues experienced with passwords today. In summary, passwords are not a good solution to the requirements of IoT authentication now, or in the future.</p>



<p>How can this be addressed?</p>



<p>New standards and forthcoming regulation are helping to drive change. The ETSI 303 6453 baseline requirements for consumer IoT cyber security standard published mid 2020, has a provision for “no universal default passwords” and this standard is now being used as a basis for regulation and certification schemes internationally4.</p>



<p>Whilst “no universal passwords” is a good start for regulation5, it does not go far enough. The good news is that there are good alternatives to passwords, so they can be eliminated, and they are also better and simpler to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How are IoTSF and FIDO Alliance working together?</p>



<p>Both organisations will work together to promote the awareness and use of password-less forms of authentication and link working group activities to ensure industry can access publicly available materials when designing new products.</p>



<p>The IoT Technical Working Group of the FIDO Alliance aims to build a comprehensive authentication framework for IoT devices which provides detailed technical specifications for password-less authentication.</p>



<p>The IoT Security Foundation publishes best practice cyber security advice for product manufacturers and users of IoT systems. Its IoT Security Compliance Framework Working Group is dedicated to the creation and maintenance of the framework which guides developers through a structured process of questioning and evidence gathering. This helps companies make better products with security by design. It is in this area where both organisations intend to collaborate at the technical level to complement the advocacy of passwords alternatives.</p>



<p>John Moor, Managing Director IoTSF said, “The use of passwords for security is an outdated and outmoded security practice for the digital age. There are solutions which are stronger from a technical perspective and better from a user’s perspective. We are delighted to be working closely with the FIDO Alliance to help eliminate the use of passwords and drive better practice for our manufacturing members.”</p>



<p>Christina Hulka, executive director and COO of the FIDO Alliance said, “The FIDO Alliance mission is to reduce the world’s reliance on passwords with simpler and stronger authentication, including in IoT which unfortunately continues to rely on default or weak password authentication. We look forward to working with the IoT Security Foundation to accelerate our path toward bringing passwordless authentication to IoT.”</p>

				 <p>In 2020 aNewGovernance, Onecub, and Visions have participated with Capgemini in a report for the French Banque des Territoire on the state of the art for Self-Data, and personal data sharing:</p>
<p>In the context of strong digitization of activities and services, the question of control and protection of personal data is a key issue. With this in mind, in 2018 the DPMR was created to provide a framework for the collection and use of data. Also, for a trusted digital world, a new concept is beginning to emerge: self-data.</p>
<p>Self-data can be defined in a few words as «&nbsp;the production, exploitation, and sharing of personal data by individuals, under their control and for their own purposes&nbsp;» (definition given by the New Generation Internet Foundation).</p>
<p>At the crossroads of data governance and digital trust, the control of personal data by each individual is a challenge for the digital projects of European public and private players. However, the construction of such a model also depends on the ability to remove obstacles on the technical, political, legal, and economic levels. This is why the Bank of Territories is publishing a study that proposes an inventory of the ecosystem of self-data actors.</p>
<p>This document aims to provide a clear and updated vision of the actors who propose solutions to implement self-data, the brakes and levers that need to be taken into account, and initiatives that can serve as an example to embark in turn on such a project.</p>

 Rinku Lamba, Rajarshi Dasgupta, Mohinder Singh, Valerian Rodrigues &amp; Shefali&nbsp;Jha  Session <p>Indian politics had witnessed the entry of new social movements in the 1970s, adding a whole set of new issues, actors, and ways of activism to the older nationalist tradition. We suggest a similar change is now taking place, as different ways of governance and interventions aided by latest technologies are emerging in the social media. Websites, blogs, tweets, emails and online petitions are creating a new virtual space for politics, through information, propaganda, debates, appeals and mobilizations.</p><p>The proposed session will discuss this emerging field of power, critically considering its democratic potential and interrogating the political issues and ideas at stake in it. The aim is to tackle the new forms of civic and public-political engagements witnessed in the domain of social media, and analyze their implications for the theory and practice of democracy. In the process our papers would explore conceptual notions such as agency, political act and participation as well as notions of selfhood and subjectivity.</p> Plan <p>We will present four papers, with a question-answer and discussion session at the end. The papers will be addressing broadly three kinds of concerns.</p>  The first concern is to identify novel understandings of the political and political acts in the social media. We ask the following questions in this regard: What are the political issues and ideas at stake and how do they affect conventional understandings of democracy? Who are the new actors outside the fray of party-centered politics and how do they see what is political in the acts of internet-users? How are political institutions including parties reacting to the phenomena?  The second concern relates to probing the new forms of political subjectivity that are emerging in this process. The questions here include: What kind of political actor is getting shaped by the forms of political participation engendered by the social media? How does the virtual nature of practice impact on questions of location and identity as determinants of political membership and political action? Is this nature of virtual participation too fluid for the state to&nbsp;control?  The third concern relates to the forms of exclusion and inclusion that virtual participation entails. This involves questions like: What kind of social capital is necessary for talking part in the process and does it cut across cultural and economic divisions? What kinds of interest drive the social media? How does it shape the meaning of political concepts like representation and rights, accountability and political agency?  <p>It is likely that we will raise more questions than we can answer at this point. However, we think it is important to raise them all the more in keeping with the questions that make up the focus of the conference, especially, the first question of how do we conceptualize, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India.</p> Readings <p>None.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2.PoliticsOnSocialMedia">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Politics On Social Media : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Rinku Lamba is Assistant Professor at the Centre for Political Studies in<br>Jawaharlal Nehru University.

<p>In Fall 2020, Blockchain Commons continued to work on creating architectures, specifications, and applications to support blockchain infrastructure.</p>

<p>This has included:</p>

 
   Releasing a trio of Gordian Cosigner apps; 
   Advancing wallet interoperability specifications in the Airgapped Wallet community that we host; 
   Researching new multisig specifications; 
   Releasing a third platform for our seedtool application; 
   Publishing Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line 2.0; 
   Debuting our new torgap architecture; 
   Organizing our reference crypto libraries and applications; 
   Starting a DID architecture review; 
   Working on Digital Identity laws; and 
   Starting our 2021 blockchain internship program. 
 

<p>Here’s a bit more information on everything:</p>

<p>Gordian Cosigner Releases. We have released alpha versions of the entire Gordian Cosigner family of apps, for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Android">Android</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst">iOS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-macOS">MacOS</a>. These applications support the signing of multisig transactions in an airgapped manner, creating a new level of support for what we see as the future of Bitcoin transactions. Though the iOS and MacOS apps were created in-house, the Android app was developed by Bitmark, who is both a sustaining and contributing sponsor to Blockchain Commons. We are expecting public Testflights of the apps in January, but before we have a full public release, we need to work with the Airgapped Wallet Community on related specifications.</p>

<p>Wallet Community Expansion. We are continuing the successful collaboration with our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community">Airgapped Wallet Community</a>, which has also given us a seat at the table for discussions of wallet standardization. Our Universal Resources (UR) specification and its animated QRs are increasingly being adopted, with our UR library now available in C++, Java, Python, Rust, and Swift. We’ve also been doing extensive work with Bitmark on their Autonomy wallet release, which is built on our Gordian architecture design.</p>

<p>Wallet Community Multisig Research. Our early work with multisigs has shown that critical elements like the m/48’ derivation, PSBTs, and descriptors are all underspecified given modern bitcoin architecture. In addition, current multisig usage doesn’t include schemes to prevent xpub reuse or to secure internal metadata in support of cosigning. In conjuction with our wallet community, we are working on standardizing the methodology for creating account maps for multisig cosigning; investigating ways to store full wallet descriptors and metadata for multisigs without creating new privacy problems; and defining the different roles of multisig cosigners. Some multisig issues are UX-focused, and so we are also defining user interfaces that can help humans to make meaningful decisions when cosigning. This research has included a new release of our Swift-based <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHashTool">LifeHashTool</a>. We hope to do more in Q1, to further enable Gordian Cosigner as our premiere multisig release.</p>

<p>Seedtool Expansion. Our seedtool apps, which offer best-practices examples of offline seed generation, continue to expand. We’d previously released a seedtool as part of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit">LetheKit</a> and upgraded the separate <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli">command-line version</a> to beta last quarter. At this point our initial iterations of our seedtools are fully feature-complete, though we’re also planning for future versions with camera support. This quarter we also released an alpha for a third platform: an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Fehu">iOS seedtool</a>, currently code-named Fehu.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin 2.0 Release. As planned we released <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/README.md">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line 2.0</a> at the end of October. Our popular Bitcoin tutorial is now a complete 19-chapter course that starts with the fundamentals of Bitcoin Core usage and continues on through using Lightning and programming in seven languages.</p>

<p>Torgap Architectural Focus. Blockchain Commons is not just about specifications, tutorials, and applications, but also architectures. We want to prototype and exemplify the best methods for creating safe, secure, and private Bitcoin and blockchain systems. This quarter we went public with our work on Torgap, which is a new methodology to ensure separation of interests (<a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md#what-are-the-adventages-of-the-torgap-architecture">and lots of other advantages</a>) by using Tor to segregate neworked services. Not only have we created a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md">Torgap</a> repo as a nexus for the work, but we’ve also been looking at varied Torgap possibilities, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-sig-cli-rust">DIDs over Torgaps</a> using a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/did-method-onion">did:onion method</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap-opentimestamps/blob/master/README.md">open timestamps over Torgaps</a>.</p>

<p>Crypto Commons Reference Code. We’ve created a large amount of content at Blockchain Commons, and so one of our challenges is making it accessible. We did this in Q4 not just through our core Torgap repo, but also through a similar <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons">Crypto Commons repo</a>. It links up all of our crypto reference libraries (which went beta in Q3) as well as the various apps and command-line programs that exercise them, including the new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bytewords-cli">bytewords-cli</a>.</p>

<p>Architectural Review Begun. Blockchain Commons also does more direct work with companies to improve the usage and trust for blockchain systems. This quarter we have begun a security architecture review of a major Decentralized IDentifier (DID) deployment that should reach one million or more people. We’ve been involved with DIDs since they were incubated at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/papers.html">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, so we’re proud to do the first major review of such a system.</p>

<p>Decentralized Identity Evangelization. Christopher Allen is continuing his work with the Wyoming legislature, where he is now a member of Digital Identity and DAO subcomittees. He’s been working on what will be the first laws anywhere to recognize personal digital identity (as opposed to digital data, which is the focus of many current laws). This legal definition is intended to work with legacy identity systems, but also to support future decentralization. He also has been leading another bill to give special legal protection for private keys.</p>

<p>Trusted Processor Research. We are always researching and analyzing the newest cryptography and blockchain innovations. This quarter that included an examination of trusted processors. We hope to advance that toward interoperable specifications for trusted hardware in the future.</p>

<p>Internship Planning. Finally, we are planning for new intern cohorts for 2021. We have posted a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/32">complete announcement</a>.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Fatema Pirone, Senior Director, Enterprise Innovation for CIBC
<p>I have the privilege of leading the Enterprise Innovation team at CIBC, shaping and transforming our bank’s stance on how we approach emerging trends and technologies. Our team is built of data scientists, designers, UX researchers, strategists and collectively we have created comprehensive projects, frameworks and a culture of innovation across our lines of business at CIBC. My role is to ensure we do not overinvest or underinvest in emerging technology and have built our innovation frameworks to tackle the banks most compelling opportunities and problems. I also have the privilege to elevate the people on my team to recognize their strong skills, provide opportunities for them to continue to grow and develop those skills, all while being able to set the vision and develop strong partnerships and sponsors from leaders in our organization.</p>
<p>I am constantly motivated by the various mindsets of the people around me, the depth of experience that everyone is able to bring to the table, and the great work that is the outcome of all of that combined! What gets me out of bed every morning is a strong cup of coffee, but also the curiosity of seeing what that day brings. The only standard on this team is that you can guarantee no two days will be the same. And that is what I love most about it.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I follow a couple of key principles:</p>
 
 Be open to new experiences. This career path was never in my plans but I happened upon it and took various roles and training to figure out what I was passionate about and where I wanted to apply myself. 
 Align yourself with great people, leaders that are willing to share their experiences and give you advice, and colleagues and employees you will take along on the journey. 
 Lastly, never turn away from a complex project – I have grown the most doing the work others found unattractive. There are always lessons to learn which I embrace. I think this is at least part of the reason why I received WXN Canada’s Top 100 Most Powerful Women’s award this year. 
 
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>It’s got to be the value and importance of advocating for yourself. I’ve been fortunate to have leaders who have supported and mentored me as I have developed throughout my own career, and I think that because of this I have seen the outcomes that are possible when you trust yourself. It can be easy to get caught up in imposter syndrome, but if I have learned anything, it is that if you can learn to believe that you have earned where you are today, that will transpire into better tangible outcomes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important lesson I have learnt is the value and importance of advocating for yourself.</p></blockquote>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>Digital Identity is the single most important emerging tech that will allow us to provide end to end digital servicing for our clients in the most secure and transparent (to the client) way. We need to start ensuring we embed Digital ID into every flow where client’s data is moving – internally or externally. We need to stop creating siloed solutions and rather take an holistic approach. We need to continue to make the client the center of our solutions and services.</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity matters to me because it is the only way we create a future that is unique, that is better for all and is simply not like our history. Diversity is truly representations of all, that includes ethnicity, sexual orientations, belief systems, experience, skills, education and so on. When you have representation of all with a diverse group of people, the best outcomes are possible ~ that is where the magic lies.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
“From the Ashes” by Jesse Thistle
<p>I am an avid reader so its really hard to just recommend one – so I’ll go with one recently read called “From the Ashes”&nbsp; a memoir by Jesse Thistle. I think this book is a heart wrenching memoir and testament to inter-generational trauma that Indigenous people of Canada have experienced and are still battling. It is not the duty of the marginalized to drive the change that our society needs, rather the job of the privileged. So it is all of our duty to gain better understanding of what has happened, what the different experiences of the Indigenous communities and people are and advocate to do better. This book is a good start.</p>
 
 
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“There is no need to grow up so fast!” I jumped in the deep-end of adulthood really quickly, I was working full-time by the time I was 17 and got married when I was 19.&nbsp; Although I do not regret any decision I made,&nbsp; I would tell my younger self to be kinder to myself and enjoy that short time one has a teenager.</p>

				 <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>We all agree 2020 is not a year we’ll regret. Still, we shall all remember it!</p>
<p>This pandemic has been devastating for individuals, families, health professionals,&nbsp;cities, countries, the world at large. Still, we found the way to adapt our lives through&nbsp;technology and data, while keeping human relations alive, sometimes reinforcing&nbsp;them. It led to imaginative solutions and technical leaps in many areas. It enabled&nbsp;an unprecedented mobilization on a global basis which delivers as we speak<br>efficient vaccines in a record time. This pandemic has silver linings!</p>
<p>Let’s push it further and make 2021 the year fair, human-centred and&nbsp;trusted data becomes a reality and the norm.</p>
<p><br>Happy Holiday Season and together we shall build the best in the New Year in&nbsp;Europe and beyond!</p>
<p>the team @ aNewGovernance</p>

<p>Yuriy Ackermann, Certification Technical Manager, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>With the advancement and modifications to specifications and program requirements, certification processes and policies will need to be modified from time-to-time. With the recent changes and publication of the FIDO Authenticator Certification program as they relate to V1.4 of the Security Requirements, and the current FIDO Registry of Values specification, we are recommending currently certified servers make necessary changes.</p>



<p>It is strongly recommended that you update your FIDO2 and UAF servers in order to correctly process current and future metadata statements based on the latest updates to the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/common-specs/fido-registry-v2.1-ps-20191217.html">FIDO Registry of Predefined Values</a>.</p>



<p>The spec changes are as follows:</p>



  All previous USER_VERIFY methods have been post-fixed with _INTERNAL to identify them explicitly as INTERNAL user verification methods&nbsp;  Example: USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE → USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE_INTERNAL.<br>    New USER_VERIFY methods have been added: USER_VERIFY_PASSCODE_EXTERNAL (0x00000800) and USER_VERIFY_PATTERN_EXTERNAL (0x00001000)<br>  RS1 or ALG_SIGN_RSASSA_PKCSV15_SHA1_RAW (0x0010) IANA ALG_KEY_COSE “alg” identifier has been changed to -65535  



<p>Servers should make the following updates to support these changes:</p>



  FIDO2 servers: Update pubKeyCredParams to contain -65535 alg<br>  FIDO2 and UAF servers: Change old user verification methods values to the new post-fixed values. Example: USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE → USER_VERIFY_PRESENCE_INTERNAL<br>  FIDO2 and UAF servers: Run the conformance tools to verify support for these changes  



<p>The latest FIDO Registry of Predefined Values is now available in <a href="https://github.com/fido-alliance/conformance-test-tools-resources/blob/master/snippets/registry.js">JavaScript</a>.</p>

<p>The 2020 FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge has come to a close – a big thank you to the FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members and event sponsors. The Korean video versions of the entire 2020 FIDO Hackathon journey and presentations by the top 5 winners are available through <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-seoul-virtual-seminar-day-1/">FIDO Videos Library</a> and a <a href="https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20201202205414">ZDNet Korea interview</a>. We hope this blog will help English readers to understand these winners’ projects, and how their ideas showcase the myriad possibilities for FIDO Authentication in the future.</p>



<p>Here is an overview of the winners and their projects:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moses’ Miracle – Gold Award</p>

<p>Moses’ Miracle is a team consisting of three students majoring in computer engineering and industrial design. They developed a gate access control system based on FIDO Authentication. The smartphone-based system helps people access different security areas much faster and more conveniently without remembering passwords, physical keys, or smart cards. From a management perspective, this solution consumes less time, cost, and labor. For more technical information and a demo of the system, <a href="https://youtu.be/G8IM00U2oa8">please watch their video presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Protect Homes – Silver Award</p>

<p>Protect Homes is a team that consists of two developers and two designers, half studying in university and the rest working for venture companies. The team integrated FIDO Authentication to strengthen a smart home ecosystem’s security, coming up with a management app for IoT devices. By going passwordless, the system demonstrated that security and usability are both enhanced. For more technical information and a demo of the solution, <a href="https://youtu.be/jIvJIzWL0Ss">please watch their video presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Who – Silver Award</p>

<p>Dr. Who is a team consisting of one project manager, two developers, and one public healthcare specialist from WHO (World Health Organization). The team came up with a Proof of Concept project, introducing smart health insurance card services that link Distributed IDentity technology and FIDO Authentication. They wanted to solve the problem with the existing physical health insurance card, which is an inferior way of identifying a patient’s actual identity. For more technical information and a demo of the service, <a href="https://youtu.be/Zj44RIwgidY">please watch their video presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Fingerprint 486 – Bronze Award</p>

<p>Fingerprint 486 is a team that consists of seven university students; two app developers, two front-end, one backend developer, and one computer graphic designer. They developed a FIDO Authentication-based document sharing system, which grants file access rights more securely and conveniently without sharing passwords. For more technical information and a demo of the system, <a href="https://youtu.be/EGVBhBfNp_I">please watch their video presentation</a>.</p>



<p>AWS (Add Wi-Fi Security) – Bronze Award</p>

<p>AWS is a team that consists of two backend, two front-end developers, and one computer graphic designer coming from the same woman’s university. The team developed a FIDO Authentication-based passwordless Wi-Fi router control system, which does not disclose an administrator’s information. For more technical information and a demo of the system, <a href="https://youtu.be/FbxEvnAn2Bw">please watch their video presentation</a>.</p>

<p>Building upon the success of the FIDO Hackathon in Korea over the last two years, we are looking at possibilities for APAC-wide (or global) Hackathon in the year 2021. We believe such a Hackathon (or challenge program) helps us engage and empower developers to accelerate service deployment with out-of-box ideas.</p>
