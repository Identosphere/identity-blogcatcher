<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/03/27/weekend-update-a-weekly-look-at-remote-blockchain-learning-resources">Weekend Update</a>. Our goal with this weekly post is to share quick updates about online education, networking and collaboration opportunities and resources for the open source enterprise blockchain community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have suggestions for resources or events that we should spotlight in a future Weekend Update, let us know <a href="https://twitter.com/Hyperledger">here</a> using #HLWeekendUpdate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five Years of Hyperledger</p>



<p>Hyperledger first launched in December 2015 with founding members IBM, J.P. Morgan, Accenture and DTCC, among several others. Fast forward to today and, 16 projects later, Hyperledger is one of the fastest growing projects at the Linux Foundation.</p>



<p>We have a special lineup of activities, events, and news to help us recognize five years of Hyperledger that kicks off on November 16 and will last through mid December. Five weeks, five discussions, gathering the brightest in our community to address and debate some of the biggest opportunities, challenges, and issues facing enterprise blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See all the details <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/5-years-2?utm_medium=hl&amp;utm_campaign=5yearsHL&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_content=">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Webinar: Securing your open source blockchain project with IBM Blockchain Platform</p>



<p>IBM’s Lukas Staniszewski will present an overview of the latest trends in the market, an update on the growth and impact of industry leading blockchain solutions and observations about emerging use cases and new network topologies. He’ll share lessons learned from working with hundreds of clients and outline the key challenges in operating networks/solutions at scale. During his talk, he will provide an overview of the: development and network management tooling, resiliency and security solutions, and how you can distribute and decentralize your network.</p>



<p>Tune on Wednesday, November 18, at 10:00 am EDT. For more information and to register, go <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-member-webinar-securing-your-open-source-blockchain-project-with-ibm-blockchain-platform-ibm">here</a>.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Telecom Special Interest Group Guest Speaker: Nima Afraz, CONNECT Center, Trinity College Dublin</p>



<p>Dial into the Telecom SIG meeting to learn more about Decentralized 5G Marketplaces based on Hyperledger Fabric. The fifth generation of cellular networks or 5G promises revolutionary improvements compared to the previous generation that reaches beyond merely multiplying the bandwidth and reducing latency. 5G is expected to enable a wide range of new internet-based services such as vehicular communications and Smart City infrastructure that, in addition to connectivity, require on-demand fine-grained infrastructure and resource access to operate. This talk will cover how Hyperledger Fabric could facilitate the implementation of a distributed marketplace for 5G network infrastructure sharing that does not rely on a central source of trust.</p>



<p>For more information on the meeting, which is Thursday, November 19, 2020, at 9AM PST, go <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TCSIG/2020+November+Event+with+CONNECT+Center">here</a>.</p>



<p>Recent Research – Deep Dive into Blockchain Accountability</p>



<p>For an academic analysis of Hyperledger Fabric’s accountability, read the paper <a href="https://publ.sec.uni-stuttgart.de/grafkuestersrausch-eurosp-2020.pdf">Accountability in a Permissioned Blockchain: Formal Analysis of Hyperledger Fabric</a> published by researchers from the Institute of Information Security at University of Stuttgart in Germany.</p>



<p>Virtual Meetups</p>

 The Potential of Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed Reality Experiences for Remote Teaching and&nbsp;Learning <p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melyssa-eigen-37b51889/">Melyssa Eigen</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/scortesi">Sandra Cortesi</a>, &amp; <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ahasse">Alexa Hasse</a><br>In collaboration with Pedro Maddens Toscano, Maya Malik, Leah Plunkett, &amp; Urs Gasser (PI). Illustrations and animations by Euan Brown, Rebecca Smith, Melanie Tan, &amp; Claudia&nbsp;Thomas</p><p>Due to the global pandemic, the past several months have been a whirlwind of changing norms and lifestyle modifications, as well as an increase in impact of the digitalization of our day-to-day lives (highlighting the importance of high-quality access to digital technologies and areas where such access might be improved). With the inability for life to “return to normal” anytime soon, we are bound to see more change, especially in the educational context. For some of us, remote teaching is the only option to continue school. There are some <a href="https://edarxiv.org/437e2">guidance</a> documents, but each state, school district, and individual educator has been asked to assume significant leadership in shaping their own remote learning space and defining the technologies available towards creating a successful online experience.</p><p>For educators and students with high-quality access to digital technologies and the skills and agency to use these tools and platforms (the pandemic has <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/16/as-schools-close-due-to-the-coronavirus-some-u-s-students-face-a-digital-homework-gap/">shed new light</a> on the persistence of digital divides and participation gaps in the learning space and the urgency to close these gaps), there are a number of opportunities available to enhance their remote teaching and learning experiences to help them in their transition. The tools range from learning platforms such as KhanAcademy; social media platforms like Facebook; video sites such as YouTube; storing and sharing platforms like Google Classroom or Dropbox; and more playful platforms like Minecraft and Scratch, or our own <a href="https://dcrp.berkman.harvard.edu/about">Digital Citizenship+ (Plus) Resource Platform (DCPR)</a>, that hosts an evolving collection of free and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons</a>-licensed learning experiences, visualizations, and other educational resources (many of these resources are available in over 35 languages).</p>Illustration by Claudia&nbsp;Thomas<blockquote>The XR environment includes multiple technologies, like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR). It allows users to integrate a variety of creative technologies in order to expand both their real-world and virtual surroundings. With <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/augmented%20reality">AR</a>, users can overlay virtual effects in their real-world environment, whereas with <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virtual%20reality">VR</a>, users can act in a completely virtual environment. Further, MR gives users the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/551/1/012049/pdf">ability</a> to use real-world objects when interacting in virtual environments. All in all, there are a lot of possibilities for users under the “umbrella” of XR technologies. In some instances, users may need VR headsets, but in other cases, individuals can access the technologies with just a mobile device or computer and access to the Internet.</blockquote><p>One emerging set of tools in this space falls under the category of extended reality technology (XR), which is becoming increasingly prevalent in the lives of young people. For example, as part of an <a href="https://www.weforum.org/communities/global-future-council-on-virtual-and-augmented-reality">ongoing project</a> by <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media</a> at the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University</a>, we are exploring the potential roles XR may play in the youth context while also recognizing the various access and usage barriers. A forthcoming publication — sign up for our team’s mailing list <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">here</a> to receive an early copy — addresses XR as it relates to domains such as education, physical and mental health, and social issues, as well as the potential roadblocks that stand in the way of these technologies becoming widely available. Additionally, the publication introduces the reader to over 30 XR experiences that have the potential to enhance teaching and learning across these domains in the youth&nbsp;context.</p><p>There are a variety of XR tools that can be explored in remote environments that may help improve the teaching and learning experience, enhance students’ motivation and engagement, or simply make a learning activity more novel or fun. It’s important to note, however, that while there is an increasing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131513002108?via%3Dihub">evidence base</a> around using AR and VR to teach different subjects, a great deal of the literature focuses on using these technologies to teach a certain course or topic area. As the following <a href="https://library.educause.edu/-/media/files/library/2019/10/2019hpxr.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=306474918AA2F101DDDCABD59E4366AD7244D572">report</a> indicates, however, far fewer studies examine the efficacy of XR technologies compared to the use of non-XR tools in the educational space. As such, we envision XR technologies as one possible tool educators might consider integrating in the classroom — depending upon the affordability and accessibility of these technologies, which we elaborate upon further in this&nbsp;piece.</p><p>Preliminary evidence indicates <a href="https://library.educause.edu/-/media/files/library/2019/10/2019hpxr.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=306474918AA2F101DDDCABD59E4366AD7244D572">three key areas</a> with respect to potential ways XR technologies may be integrated in the classroom. First, XR technologies can be used to foster skill-based learning, such as learning a language. <a href="http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jgc/research/ssla_intro/collentine_freed_ssla_2004.pdf">Research</a> demonstrates that immersion may be helpful in learning a second language, and that <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/4/1/13/htm">VR, for example, can effectively simulate an immersive language experience</a>. Second, XR can expand the possible activities youth can learn from in a hands-on manner. Such technologies can, for example, allow young people to <a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/klopfer-thompson-implement-collaborative-games-vr-learning">travel inside the human body and explore cells</a> for a biology course, or, for a physics class, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/vr-physics-lab/overview/">examine how charged particles can interact with each other</a>. Thus, XR has the potential to increase the topics young people can learn from by turning abstract concepts into concrete experiences. And third, XR can allow for new functionalities, or affordances, that allow for young people to learn in ways that have not yet been possible with other technological tools. For students taking vocational classes interested in architecture or construction, for instance, XR can <a href="https://idvl.syr.edu/">simulate architectural designs</a> that are <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24751448.2017.1292794">more realistic that computer-aided designs</a> — allowing individuals to walk through a space and explore various objects in&nbsp;it.</p>Illustration by Claudia&nbsp;Thomas<p>In addition to these three areas, there are several other areas connected to the educational space that appear promising in the context of XR. For example, XR technologies may be able to help fill in some of the gaps created by transitioning from in-person to remote learning. Against the backdrop of the global pandemic and disrupted education in regions around the world, field trips, which are often one of the most exciting aspects of formal education, are unlikely to occur in the coming months. While not equivalent to an in-person experience, XR technologies, <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/uploads/pdfs/csm_vr101_final.pdf">such as VR</a>, can create the opportunity to explore places that have not been possible for many to travel to. For example, students could <a href="https://theoceanagency.org/googleoceaneducation">explore the depths of the ocean</a> or even <a href="http://missioniss.magnopus.com/">take a rocket to outer space</a>. Instead of in-person field trips to museums, students can use XR technologies to explore exhibits — some museums have their own XR-based apps, such as the Louvre’s <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/leonardo-da-vinci-0/realite-virtuelle">“Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass”</a> VR app or the “<a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/about-us/what-we-do/publications/anne-frank-house-virtual-reality/">Anne Frank House VR</a>” experience. Additionally, some XR technologies allow young people to <a href="https://arvr.google.com/tourcreator/">create their own</a> AR and VR exploration experiences.</p>Illustration by Claudia&nbsp;Thomas<p>XR technologies have also been designed with the aim to cultivate skills that are relevant in (and out) of the classroom, both for educators and students. For example, there are XR experiences that allow educators to practice their <a href="https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/19/09/virtual-reality-teachers">pedagogical skills</a> and those that seek to strengthen students’ <a href="https://arvredtech.com/blogs/news/using-augmented-reality-for-student-presentations">presentation skills</a>. In addition to skill-building, XR technologies can simulate different scenarios to prepare educators and students alike for emergency situations. For example, in a remote health class, one could use an XR app to teach students <a href="https://ahahealthtech.org/augmented-reality-ar-hands-only-cpr-trainer/">CPR</a>. Other use cases could involve different forms of disaster prevention as well as vocational training.</p><p>Another promising application of XR technology centers around addressing social issues in the educational setting, such as how to prevent and respond to bullying. In the context of remote learning, while students may not be in physical contact with one another, this does not eliminate the potential for <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2019/youth-and-cyberbullying/another-look">bullying</a>. Given the isolated nature of remote learning, anti-bullying programming remains vital to the educational setting. In response, there are a number of different XR technologies that help students learn about one another’s differences in an effort to prevent and mitigate bullying, which educators may implement in a remote curriculum. These platforms use a variety of techniques to promote empathy, ranging from <a href="https://harmonylabs.org/vr-action-lab">stand-up comedy</a>, to <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/virtual_reality_games/">placing the user in the role of the bully or bullied</a>, to focusing on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7495417">training teachers to identify bullying</a>.</p>Illustration by Rebecca&nbsp;Smith<p>With respect to the adoption of XR technologies in the educational space, <a href="https://library.educause.edu/-/media/files/library/2019/10/2019hpxr.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=306474918AA2F101DDDCABD59E4366AD7244D572">research</a> in the context of higher education suggests two key factors are important. First, the XR technologies need to fit into current curriculum standards and educators’ instructional methods. This finding aligns with research around the diffusion of innovations more broadly. For any innovation to be implemented in a given setting — from the workplace to the classroom — <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Diffusion_of_Innovations_5th_Edition.html?id=9U1K5LjUOwEC">it must fit within systems currently in place</a>. Second, as with the diffusion of other innovations, the adoption of XR is influenced by the cost of these technologies — not only in terms of the monetary value, but, for instance, the cognitive load of learning how to use&nbsp;XR.</p><p>While this brief overview focuses on the opportunities that XR technologies may present in the educational space, it’s also important to highlight that these technologies come with <a href="https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/22485/ETHICAL%20IMPLICATIONS.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y">challenges</a> related to accessibility, privacy, and safety. In order to take advantage of the affordances of XR, as with other digitally networked technologies, <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/05/14/poverty-race-linked-to-lack-of-internet-for-students.aspx">Internet connectivity</a> is needed. This may prevent a significant number of people from leveraging the technology — even more so during the pandemic with many schools and libraries closed. Further, we often associate XR with expensive VR headsets, which can be financially burdensome and inaccessible to many. These barriers are real. At the same time, <a href="https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article/17/3/031013/370980/A-Review-of-the-Capabilities-of-Current-Low-Cost">less costly VR headset options</a>, such as Google Cardboard, as well as free and low-cost VR and AR apps have become available, which students can use on their phones without further equipment.</p>Illustration by Rebecca&nbsp;Smith<p>Additionally, as with many other networked technologies, such as <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2019/youth-and-artificial-intelligence/where-we-stand">artificial intelligence</a>, there are concerns around the extent to which the design of XR incorporates the voices and perspectives of underrepresented groups — whether in terms of age, ethnicity, race, gender and sexual identity, religion, national origin, location, skill and educational level, and/or socioeconomic status. In terms of additional issues around inclusion, XR is more reliant (compared to other digital technologies) on individuals’ ability to control their physical motions (e.g., quickly moving one’s hand). How can these technologies be made <a href="https://ablegamers.org/thoughts-on-accessibility-and-vr/">more accessible for those with limited mobility</a>?</p><p>Second, there are numerous challenges around privacy, data and data protection, and commercial risk, some of which are resonant with general concerns that come with digitally networked technologies, while others are specific to XR. For example — like many digitally connected systems — XR has the ability to collect, aggregate, analyze and monetize users’ data — data which is “<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/my-privacy-uk/Assets/Documents/Childrens-data-and-privacy-online-report-for-web.pdf">durable, searchable, and virtually undeletable</a>.” Given that <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/my-privacy-uk/Assets/Documents/Brief-teachers.pdf">children and youth are often pioneers in exploring emerging technologies</a>, they may experience XR-related privacy and data protection risks before adults enact strategies to mitigate such concerns. Moreover, the unprecedented amount of data that networked technologies such as XR are able to collect can be sold to third parties, including companies that can target marketing to youth. These targeted messages may <a href="https://www.unicef.org/globalinsight/media/1111/file/UNICEF-Global-Insight-data-governance-covid-issue-brief-2020.pdf">put youth at risk</a> for commercial exploration and exposure to content that may impact their perspectives and behaviors in ways not optimal for healthy development.</p>Illustration by Rebecca&nbsp;Smith<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/assets/documents/research/projects/childrens-privacy-online/Evidence-review.pdf">research shows</a> that young people (like many adults) generally lack an <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/my-privacy-uk/Assets/Documents/Childrens-data-and-privacy-online-report-for-web.pdf">adequate understanding</a> of the processes of data collection and resultant commercial profiling and marketing to which they can be subject. The risks associated with commercial profiling are only worsened in the context of COVID, with young people spending increased amounts of time in the digital environment and commerce currently being driven online. In addition to collecting information such as young people’s product preferences and location, XR technologies also have the potential to <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2018/protecting-nonverbal-data-tracked-in-virtual-reality/">gather large amounts of data about nonverbal behavior</a>, such as gestures, facial expressions, and eye gaze — even if one is only using the system for short periods of time. Indeed, spending a mere 20 minutes within a VR simulation may capture slightly under <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2018/protecting-nonverbal-data-tracked-in-virtual-reality/">two million recordings</a> of one’s body language. In the context of education, researchers have used nonverbal data gathered through VR to predict <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/mm/2014/won-ieeeac-nonverbal-predicts-learning.pdf">test scores</a>, and <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2011/automatically-analyzing-facial-feature-movements-to-identify-human-errors/">estimate the number of mistakes</a> made while learning a specific task. A young person’s future — from the university they are admitted to, to their employment opportunities and quality of working life — could be (positively or negatively) <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2018/protecting-nonverbal-data-tracked-in-virtual-reality/">impacted</a> by the nonverbal data that XR technologies collect. The data captured through XR will also strengthen companies’ efforts to target advertising to youth — a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02116/full">study</a> shows that data about one’s head movements in VR is associated with how positively someone rates the content in a simulation. Legal protections against these and related privacy risks vary across jurisdictions and application areas. When it comes to student privacy issues in the context of formal education in the U.S., <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/youthandmediaalpha/files/2017/03/PrivacyStudentData_Companion_Learning_Tools.pdf">this publication</a> (pages 4–5) by authors from the Youth and Media team and the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/teaching/cyberlawclinic">Cyberlaw Clinic</a> at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard offers both a general point of entry into the privacy analysis, as well as a roadmap for exploring additional information and engaging with decision-makers who might be involved in determining whether, how, with which students, and for what purposes XR technologies can be employed, and what privacy safeguards need to be put in&nbsp;place.</p><p>And third, there are safety risks connected to XR technologies. As with many other networked technologies, such as computers and mobile phones, some users may experience eye strain using XR. Unlike many other Internet-enabled technologies, however, XR may induce side effects such as nausea, dizziness, seizures, and discomfort wearing the needed equipment. Recently, there have been efforts to make VR headsets, for instance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1HIxQIOTds&amp;t=1s">more comfortable to wear for those of different racial and ethnic backgrounds</a>. Additionally, XR offers another online space for young people to be cyberbullied in. Research shows that harassment in XR, such as VR,<a href="https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Harassment-in-Social-Virtual-Reality-Challenges-for-Platform-Governance.pdf"> may take different forms</a>, such as environmental (e.g., throwing virtual objects) or physical (e.g., unwanted physical contact). Given the immersive nature of XR, will these types of harassment be experienced as more intense compared to bullying via text message or chat? And how can educators, parents, and other stakeholders most effectively reduce and prevent these forms of online harassment?</p><p>With time, we hope that we as researchers will be even more equipped to understand the impact the global pandemic may have on learners from all backgrounds. By all indications, however, there are <a href="https://edarxiv.org/437e2">several reasons</a> to be concerned. On a global level, students — particularly those from underrepresented communities — are facing serious disruptions in accessing learning opportunities, particularly those that are online. Projects such as <a href="https://www.voicesofyouth.org/campaign/studying-home-due-coronavirus-how-young-people-around-world-are-keeping-their-mood">UNICEF’s Voices of Youth</a> and <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse/learningneverstops">UNESCO’s COVID-19 Education Response</a>, which are examining some of the challenges youth are facing in the context of learning, have found that, over the coming months, it will be increasingly crucial to ensure that young people can connect learning with their needs and interests. Engaging in interest-driven learning online with a community of supportive peers and mentors — or, <a href="https://clalliance.org/publications/the-connected-learning-research-network-reflections-on-a-decade-of-engaged-scholarship/">connected learning</a> — can help inspire young people to be more creative and <a href="https://edarxiv.org/437e2">foster their ability to learn online</a>. As with any other educational technology, the value of XR depends on many contextual factors and will require careful assessment before it is introduced in any learning environment — whether online or in-person. However, the technology comes with the promise to provide educators with additional options in terms of remote student engagement, and ways to support and complement efforts to equip youth with the skills to participate and thrive in an increasingly digitally connected economy and&nbsp;society.</p>Illustration by Claudia&nbsp;Thomas <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/extended-reality-e5038b38d628">Extended Reality</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Why is SSI better? - A secure and digital peer-to-peer channel is established between ID Issuer, ID Owner and ID Verifier. When credentials are exchanged not even the Self-Sovereign Identity system provider knows what is being exchanged. Credential issuing becomes simpler and faster. - SSI Credentials are tamper-proof through the use of cryptography. - They are private and under your control. SSI u

  <p>When on paper it could be easily lost or destroyed. When digital it can be breached, hacked or leaked online. Sold on the black market and used for fraud. Vulnerable people like refugees are just the first to suffer the problems of identity.</p>

  <p>A third of the refugees in Europe are children, and while they are lucky to get documented, hundreds of thousands in Syrian Refugee camps do not have birth certificates, and newborns in camps are unable to complete the birth registration process, due to economic, geographical and complex administrative barriers.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>When talking about leveraging blockchain technology for identity management, it’s important to note that there are three different actors in play: identity owners, identity issuers and identity verifiers.</p>

      <p>The identity issuer, a trusted party such as local government, can issue personal credentials for an identity owner (the user). By issuing a credential, the identity issuer attests to the validity of the personal data in that credential (e.g. last name and date of birth). The identity owner can store those credentials in their personal identity wallet and use them later to prove statements about his or her identity to a third party (the verifier).</p>

      <p>A Credential is a set of multiple identity attributes and an identity attribute is a piece of information about an identity (a name, an age, a date of birth).</p>

      <p>Credentials are issued by second parties whom attest to the validity of the data inside the credential. The usefulness and reliability of a credential fully depends on the reputation/trustworthiness of the issuer.</p>

Not only are the best people in the identity field working on developing it but also because it’s part of a transparent consortium, a transparent foundation.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Why should a member of the government care about digital identity?<br>
[…]<br>
What the DIACC is working on is a framework of industry standards and practices to enable “interoperable networks that will have verifiable data requesters ask for particular attributes to be verified and attribute verifiers to provide that verification” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahsWWTWI2HM">3</a>)</p>

      <p>Canadian companies claim they waste more than $10 billion every year on unnecessary bureaucracy (<a href="https://www.cfib-fcei.ca/en/media/nearly-one-third-36-billion-cost-regulation-canada-unnecessary-red-tape">4</a>). Each Canadian business owner has to use three different tax numbers and navigate three different levels of governmental bureaucracy: local, provincial and federal.</p>

      <p>This interoperable framework – The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework – could enable citizens to start businesses and not deal with so much bureaucracy and have trustworthy transactions online.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It’s important to note that a private key can be used for multiple cryptography purposes. The same private key that generates my identity for Indy (for SSI, for Sovrin) can be used, for example, for a GPG signature for Github. It could be the same key that can be used for Ethereum or Bitcoin to generate an address.</p>

      <p>If the technical infrastructure where you are trying to use your keys accepts the same type of encryption – like Elliptic Curve Cryptography – you could use your Hyperledger Indy private keys there. Structures like HTTPS, Ethereum, Sovrin or Corda, for example, all accept this encryption. Right now it’s not possible to use those Hyperledger Indy’s private keys to establish connections with other parties of a user’s choice.</p>

<p>The Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/announcements/2015/12/17/linux-foundation-unites-industry-leaders-to-advance-blockchain-technology">announced</a> the Hyperledger project on Dec 17, 2015, which means that Hyperledger is on the brink of turning five. This milestone seems a fitting time to take stock of what we’ve done, the impact we’ve had and where we want to go from here. So we’ve asked a number of our community members to join us for a series of webinars covering the past, present and future of Hyperledger and enterprise blockchain.</p>



<p>We invite you to be part of this five-week-long event that will open on November 16 with a Fireside Chat between Forbes associate editor Michael del Castillo and Brian Behlendorf and end with a 5th Anniversary Networking Celebration session on December 17.&nbsp;</p>

<p>​Chainlink, Morpheus.Network, Nethermind, Provide, and Unibright Also Sponsor Baseline Open Source Project &nbsp;</p>


<p>9 Nov 2020 – Industry leaders across the globe are coming together to support the new <a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org/">Baseline Protocol</a>, part of the Ethereum <a href="https://oasis-open-projects.org/projects/">OASIS</a> open source initiative. The Baseline Protocol&nbsp; defines a method for using the Ethereum Mainnet or other public blockchains to coordinate complex, confidential workflows between enterprises–without moving company data out of traditional systems of record. In today’s announcement, Accenture, Chainlink, Morpheus.Network, Nethermind, Provide, Splunk, and Unibright join Baseline’s founding sponsors, the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, Ethereum Foundation, and ConsenSys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re seeing a groundswell of excitement for using the Baseline method, as more and more organizations and developers realize the simplicity and security it offers,” said Guy Martin, executive director of OASIS Open, the nonprofit consortium that hosts the project. “The support of Accenture, Splunk, and all the other Baseline sponsors shows how ready the market is for a low-cost blockchain solution that doesn’t compromise data integrity and that can be used by everyone.”</p>



<p>Support for Baseline<br>“Our clients have significant operational demands of multiparty systems like blockchain,” said Michael Klein, director of blockchain technology at Accenture. “We continue to see innovations in and around blockchain technologies that are rising to meet those demands. For Accenture, the notable work happening around the Baseline Protocol is an example of the next wave of evolution in this space. We see tremendous potential in the Baseline Protocol’s ability to maintain the integrity and uniqueness of privately-held assets— providing ‘double-spend’ protection without compromising confidentiality—and believe this will expand the applicability of blockchain technology to a broader range of enterprise use cases.”</p>



<p>“As a founding sponsor to the Ethereum OASIS Open Project, the EEA is very pleased to see global leaders rallying around the Baseline Protocol to drive Mainnet business use cases,” said EEA Executive Director Dan Burnett, the Ethereum OASIS Open Project Governing Board Chair. “Baseline is enabling the Ethereum Mainnet to be a new tool for enterprise solution development from automation, business integration, finance to supply chain and sustainability efforts. EEA members alongside the EEA Mainnet Working Group will continue to collaborate on how tools like Baseline can deliver value to consumer-facing industries through peer-to-peer transactions and services.”</p>



<p>“Morpheus.Network is really pleased to be a sponsor of the Baseline Protocol! Baseline is an ideal complement to our supply chain SaaS middleware platform. One common challenge within the supply chain industry is encouraging the open flow of communication and information to help facilitate the movement of goods around the world, while balancing that with the need to keep sensitive and confidential information strictly private. Baseline enables this flow of information by allowing companies to use the data in their existing databases and ERP systems, and ensure that it remains synchronized and consistent with other third-party databases, in a completely private way while using the always-on, distributed, censorship-resistant and tamperproof Ethereum mainnet as a common frame of reference,” said Noam Eppel, Morpheus.Network Co-Founder &amp; COO.</p>



<p>“Nethermind is proud to be a sponsor of the OASIS Open Project alongside industry peers. As maintainers of, and the first Ethereum client embracing Baseline, we are excited that the solutions delivered by Nethermind and Provide enable rapid adoption, allowing enterprises to reinforce their integrations with the unique notarization capabilities and liveness of the Ethereum mainnet. There has never been a better time for enterprises to harness its power,&nbsp; nor has the mainnet ever been as ready as it is now.” said Tomasz Stańczak, Nethermind Founder &amp; CTO.</p>



<p>“The dawn of the Data Age has created monumental business and societal shifts, while forcing businesses to digitize faster than ever before,” said Nate McKervey, Head of Blockchain and DLT, Splunk. “Data is no longer a nice to have, it’s an essential component of nearly every business worldwide. Organizations that can confidently synchronize their data in real-time and empower themselves through their data insights will leap ahead. The Baseline Protocol enables automation of business processes by leveraging data in new or traditional systems while maintaining integrity and confidentiality. This unlocks data in ways previously impossible, which coincides with Splunk’s vision of helping organizations turn data into doing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>About Baseline and Ethereum OASIS</p>



<p><a href="https://www.baseline-protocol.org">Baseline</a> is part of <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/">Ethereum OASIS</a>, an <a href="http://oasis-open-projects.org/">OASIS Open Project </a>that provides a neutral forum for supporting open source projects and specifications that advance interoperability for blockchain applications worldwide. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the Baseline Protocol, and suggestions for new Ethereum OASIS projects are encouraged.</p>

 Identity 

 
   <a href="https://docs.blockstack.org/technology/naming-system">Blockchain naming system (BNS)</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>BNS is a network system that binds names to off-chain state without relying on any central points of control. The Stacks V1 blockchain implemented BNS through first-order name operations. In Stacks V2, BNS is instead implemented through a smart-contract loaded during the genesis block.Names in BNS have three properties:</p>
       
         Names are globally unique. The protocol does not allow name collisions, and all well-behaved nodes resolve a given name to the same state. 
         Names are human-meaningful. Each name is chosen by its creator. 
         Names are strongly-owned. Only the name’s owner can change the state it resolves to. Specifically, a name is owned by one or more ECDSA private keys. 
       
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/blob/stacks-1.0/docs/blockstack-did-spec.md">Blockstack DID Method Specification</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Blockstack is a network for decentralized applications where users own their identities and data. Blockstack utilizes a public blockchain to implement a decentralized naming layer, which binds a user’s human-readable username to their current public key and a pointer to their data storage buckets. The naming layer ensures that names are globally unique, that names can be arbitrary human-meaningful strings, and that names are owned and controlled by cryptographic key pairs such that only the owner of the private key can update the name’s associated state.</p>

      <p>A decentralized application and the Blockstack App communicate during the authentication flow by passing back and forth two tokens.

      <p>Enabling Blockstack Authentication on a centralized app potentially enables a range of functionality:</p>
       
         single sign on - users with a Blockstack ID don’t have to register again or sign up for your app 
         an instant profile system - users can bring their existing profile to your app 
         client-side encryption - you can encrypt user data on your users’ client devices before sending it to your server. This is great for user privacy and may offer legal and security advantages for your business. Both hackers and law enforcement aren’t able to access user data that has been encrypted with keys generated from a Blockstack ID. Hopefully this means they leave you alone!

  Handshake is a UTXO-based blockchain protocol which manages the registration, renewal and transfer of DNS top-level domains (TLDs). Our naming protocol differs from its predecessors in that it has no concept of namespacing or subdomains at the consensus layer. Its purpose is not to replace DNS, but to replace the root zone file and the root servers.

   <a href="https://medium.com/amentum/the-case-for-handshake-9b0af0d989fe">The Case for Handshake - A Compelling Bid to Decentralize Domain Names</a> by Steven McKie
    <blockquote>
      <p>Handshake is public blockchain that will serve as a global list of top-level domain names. By pointing your browser to resolve requests via the Handshake network instead of at your local DNS resolving server, you’ll essentially be looking up websites’ IP addresses on the Handshake blockchain, instead of those maintained on DNS resolvers that are centralized.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Many fail to realize that DNS is already decentralized, with the exception of a single, critical component, of which trust is centralized: the root zone, or simply, a collection of top level domains (TLDs). And this trust anchor is kept by a small federation of authoritative bodies, where ICANN is currently the ultimate authority.</p>

      <p>Certificate Authorities in the DNS network constructed the way it is today are the trusted stewards for the operation of the Internet. These stewards, as explained in the project paper, are profit-maximizing entities. Meaning, ICANN has no altruistic incentive to act honestly, yet has every incentive to maintain its natural monopoly over the riches that come with governing a critical layer of the Internet.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   <a href="https://namebase.io/handshake-whitepaper/">Handshake Whitepaper</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The foundation for the internet’s security has relied upon trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) which attest that a user is connecting to the correct server or node.1 This has created a reliance upon a handful of trusted actors, many of whom are for-profit corporations or other actors who may not have long-term incentive towards stewardship of the internet. The net-effect is a “1-of-m multisig” whereby if any one of the trusted CAs fail, the entire security of the internet fails. This failure has occurred and will continue to occur with the trusted-CA design, with catastrophic risks as more and more infrastructure becomes networked.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The DNS database is large but the distributed nature of the blockchain could store information on millions of devices globally. With the information being stored and with the right consensus mechanism, we can avoid the reason to trust back-end servers to resolve queries. From a security perspective, we could mitigate most attacks by resolving to the immutable blockchain.</p>

<p>Collaborating on next-generation standards</p><p>DIF is proud to announce that it has entered into a liaison agreement with the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>). This provides a mechanism for both parties to work together on areas of mutual interest, allowing working groups to align and coordinate through dual-members. The first major collaboration, which has already been underway for weeks, is a process for revising the Self-Issued OpenID Connect (SIOP) <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">specification</a>. This revision takes place in the AB/Connect working group of OIDC, which focuses at any given time on extending the core OIDC specification.</p><p>Given the foundational nature of this collaboration (and the potential for breaking changes or mental-model shifts in the next major version), the work on DIF’s Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider DID Profile working draft, referred to colloquially as “did-siop,” has been paused. It is expected to resume, still housed as a work item in DIF’s DID Authentication<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html"> Working Group</a>, after the work on the new SIOP specification in AB/C is finalized.</p><p>DIF members from the group are actively contributing to the new version of SIOP specification through OIDF’s structure and channels. If you are interested in advancing or contributing to this work substantially, you are very welcome to join the calls, details of which you can find <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">here</a>. If you are not a member of OIDF, you may contact the chairs of the DID Auth working group, or the DIF’s Liaison Officer to OIDF, which are listed at the bottom of the working group’s<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">&nbsp;webpage</a>.</p><p>NOTE: The latest version of the “did-siop” specification has not been approved by the DIF steering committee; it is currently paused at v0.1 and remains an unofficial Working Group Draft at time of&nbsp;press.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">DIF &amp; OIDF</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/facts.html">Facts</a> 

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (see the original proposal). He coined the term “World Wide Web,” wrote the first World Wide Web server, “httpd,” and the first client program (a browser and editor), “WorldWideWeb,” in October 1990. He wrote the first version of the “HyperText Markup Language” (HTML), the document formatting language with the capability for hypertext links that became the primary publishing format for the Web. His initial specifications for URIs, HTTP, and HTML were refined and discussed in larger circles as Web technology spread.</p>
</blockquote>

 <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">Standards</a> 

<blockquote>
  <p>W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are creating, including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Identifiers - what is identified?<br>
When XML is used to represent a directed laballed graph which is used to represent information about things, then one must be able to make statements about parts of an XML document, parts of the DLG (such as RDF nodes) and of course the objects described.

    <blockquote>
      <p>TimBL’s diagram at TPAC2012Over the years many different authentication systems have been developed. Each one proposes a method for an agent to prove his relation to an identifier - called a Principal. A Principal is a string that can be mapped to a URI, that usually refers to some network resource, which itself can then be linked to a subject. An LDP authorization system may authenticate agents that are allowed access to a resource using different types of Principals. This page lists a number of ways Authorization agents can prove identity of an agent using one Principal, with an ACL that may be using a different type of Principal. The aim is to gather such examples together in order to find an general theory that underpins these proofs.</p>

      <p>This is the specification of the Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.1 (P3P 1.1). This document, along with its normative references, includes all the specification necessary for the implementation of interoperable P3P 1.1 applications. P3P 1.1 is based on the P3P 1.0 Recommendation and adds some features using the P3P 1.0 Extension mechanism. It also contains a new binding mechanism that can be used to bind policies for XML Applications beyond HTTP transactions.</p>

      <p>Abstract: While decentralized, user-centric identity systems provide hope that useful, secure identity systems may be possible on the Internet, ensuring that user data is protected in these system requires more than a technical solution. In this paper, we describe a project underway at Identity Commons to create a framework within which users can express their protection preferences (called identity rights agreements). Part of this project will establish a reputation system for identity providers and relying parties that engenders trust and lowers user risk.</p>

   <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/identity-ws/report.html">W3C Workshop on Identity in the Browser</a> 24/25th May 2011, Mountain View (USA)
    <blockquote>
      <p>Over the last ten years, for most end-users there has been no visible progress beyond cookie-managed usernames and passwords entered via HTML forms. Current password-based logins offers little value to the end-user, as they are forced to bear the onerous responsibility of remembering too many passwords or simply re-using low-security passwords. As passwords and cookies are easily compromised, both web-site operators and users then expose themselves to massive security breaches. Despite the large amount of valuable standardization work on identity, it is unclear how user agents such as Web browsers can interact with both identity-consuming applications and server-side federated identity services, and many current identity specifications either assume or underspecify secure authentication in the browser. The key missing component to enable trusted identity on the Web is likely then to be found in user-centric cross-browser standards for secure authentication and session management.</p>

   <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/w3id/">USER IDENTITY ON THE WEB COMMUNITY GROUP</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Currently, more and more services are created on the web and require information about you, me, all of us. Therefore, users have to give away a lot of information about themselves to many different services. The point is that the users lose control of their identity on the web, by filling a lot of forms (e.g., through subscriptions). Privacy on the Internet is extremely important and must remain. Personal information is used by services we, sometimes, don’t even know about, and it is a real problem. The aim of this group would be to think about new ways to identify individuals over the internet using trusted web based identities embedded directly into the core protocols of the web. At the same time it is important to maintain equilibrium between total privacy and providing information when needed, which means, when the user wants to.</p>

      <p>When desktop computers came into the workplace 25 years ago, the problem of paper remained. How could print layouts be shared and displayed across a variety of electronic machines and operating systems? The most prominent solution that emerged was Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF), a proprietary solution released in the 1990’s as a way to share documents that included text formatting and in-line images. Even though more features were added over time, in essence, PDFs operated as a paper analogue for computers.</p>

      <p>One of the earliest challenges of statecraft was developing a legible view of its populations. Translating local complexities into simple and summary descriptions was necessary to enable traditional state functions like taxation and planning. This need to describe impelled various standardization efforts, including permanent last names, land registries, and population surveys, which gave society a visible shape that could be centrally recorded and used within legal frameworks to wield state power.</p>

      <p>Education and training providers have long been wrestling with the legacy of the credit hour and how to adapt credentialing to a modern world that values skills more than time spent in the classroom. This is in part why the industry has seen an explosion of traditional and alternative providers that are experimenting with new credential formats appropriate for the information age. One of the questions we most frequently encounter at Learning Machine from these providers is: What are the differences between different credentials formats? The implicit question behind that one is: When should I use different types of digital credentials, and why?</p>

Learning Machine has made the strategic choice to disrupt paper documents with verifiable digital records (software), rather than competing directly within the traditional identity space. The following analysis explains why. Note that some startup challengers will be named as exemplars in their categories, which is not meant to imply any criticism of those companies. In fact, many of these companies are collaborating behind the scenes on data standards that will form a common foundation for future interoperability.</p>

      <p>Top-down initiatives to reconstruct entire sectors like digital identity are too brittle to succeed. Flexible systems require a different mindset.<br>
[…]<br>
 unlike every other sector (media, communications, engineering, finance, etc.), official records largely rely on old formats like paper, wax, and PDF for certification, all of which are hard to verify and easy to fake. This is big reason why public blockchains are exciting, because they have the power to prove the authenticity, ownership, and integrity of a natively digital record. The combination of strong cryptography and public blockchains provide a new technical infrastructure that gives people the ability to manage their own records of achievement in a format that is digital, easily shared, and instantly verifiable using a global verification network.</p>

      <p>Everyone wants digital records to be shareable and verifiable, but it is only now that we have the technical infrastructure to reliably accomplish that goal. The innovation that makes this possible is blockchain-enabled networks that synchronize around a single truth. While digital signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI) are important pieces of a secure credentialing solution, it is the addition of a decentralized verification network that adds the highest level of security, longevity, and recipient ownership to digital records.</p>

      <p>Have you ever seen a person’s certification listed on LinkedIn, and then followed the link to the actual credential? It typically resides on the domain of a software vendor, or on the domain of the issuing institution, with the intention of communicating authenticity. While hosted credentials provide convenience for both credential holders and verifiers, hosting is not enough to provide a secure basis for verification.</p>

   <a href="https://trinsic.id/interactive-connections/">Trinsic Introduces Interactive Connections in Trinsic Wallet &amp; Platform</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Current digital wallet implementations fall short of the vision of self-sovereign identity (SSI) because they only allow wallet holders to respond to, not initiate, interactions with institutions. This reduces wallet holders to a passive role, which at best delivers suboptimal utility to the holder, and at worst can reinforce the unhealthy power asymmetries between institutions and people that exist today.</p>

      <p>Interactive connections solve this problem by creating a two-way street between a wallet holder and an institution. Instead of a passive responder, the wallet holder is a peer who can initiate actions of their own. In addition, wallet holders can interact not only with institutions, but also with other wallet holders, to communicate securely and share verified information.</p>

<p>The DEON project focuses on the application of blockchains to secure data sharing in private networks and was initiated in 2018 in the wireless and sensor networks laboratory at the Yale Institute for Network Science. The use case of off-grid communication networks was identified with the goal of enabling their full decentralization in terms of data management and identity management. Off-grid (communication) networks are peer-to-peer networks that are autonomous, without super nodes and not dependent on the Internet’s physical infrastructure. Several recent developments like goTenna[1] and the Beartooth[2] offer standalone wireless devices that could be used to form local peer-to-peer networks. Other developments like the well-known Guifi community network[3] in Catalonia, Spain, are community-led paradigms in that space. Although these networks promote decentralization, openness, and fairness, they rely on legacy, centralized technologies for specific parts of their architecture like data and identity management. The integration of blockchains into off-grid networks appeared promising since blockchain provides attributes like transparency, privacy, distribution of governance and decentralization that are highly desirable in off-grid networks.</p>



<p>We chose Hyperledger Fabric as the framework to build our architecture because of its flexibility, performance and the potential we saw behind this huge community of enthusiasts and developers to further advance the technology. After we got familiar with the framework, we identified a key missing aspect: a decentralized identity management component. Unlike the rest of Fabric’s architecture, its native identity management is centralized and based on Certificate Authorities. So we came across the following questions: “which of the nodes in the network is going to host and manage the CA?”, “can we stick with the initial plan of having equal nodes?”and “how can we preserve the decentralization of off-grid networks if we rely on centralized nodes?”</p>



<p>Looking at the rest of the Hyperledger ecosystem, we found that Hyperledger Indy and Aries enable decentralized identity management. We could transform the centralized CAs of Fabric to a distributed CA entity, aka the Indy ledger, so that they are accessible by all nodes but not hosted by a specific one. This approach would work like a distributed oracle of trust in the network but necessitated some changes in Fabric and other extensions in the entire stack to bring DIDs into the “Fabric world.”</p>



<p>Approach and proposed architecture</p>



<p>The first Fabric extension identified as necessary for the integration was an Indy-based MSP to verify identities, signatures and transactions signed by DIDs. In addition, we had to enable the Fabric SDK (Go) to sign transactions using DIDs. For the Indy/Aries part, we leveraged the Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent (aca-py) [4], which is deployed in each node of the network and serves as both the verifier and the issuer in the network. On one hand, it signs Fabric transactions using DIDs and issues credentials to the users of the network, and on the other it verifies proofs and transactions signed by DIDs. The DEON Core Service leverages Fabric private data collections and an interface to IPFS to expose a REST API for secure, transparent, fast and privacy-preserving data storage. An overview of the integration is shown in the figure below. The proposed architecture can be employed by off-grid networks of any kind, from IoT to communication and inter-enterprise consortia networks, for enabling self-sovereign identity and user-centric data sharing.</p>




Figure 1: HL Fabric-Indy/Aries integration




<p>Project outcomes and future work</p>



<p>The work started as a joint effort between the wireless and sensor networks lab of Professor Leandros Tassiulas at the Yale Institute for Network Science and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which put its expertise in decentralized identity to work in the development of the identity parts. Part of the work and initial benchmarks of the architecture deployed in off-grid settings are presented in the paper “A Blockchain-based Decentralized Data Sharing Infrastructure for Off-grid Networking[5].”</p>



<p>Currently the Yale team is working on improving the code to make it more usable by others as a standalone solution for integrating Fabric and Indy/Aries. The team is also working on feature enhancements for the DEON platform, such as supporting Fabric v2, updating DEON identity agents to the latest version of the aca-py agent, extending the DEON REST API with admin functionalities and finally looking for new applications of the platform.

<p>This release includes new versioning and mainnet-focused advancements</p>



<p>The Hyperledger Besu team is excited to announce today’s Hyperledger Besu 20.10.0 release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might have noticed that the versioning for this quarterly release is a little different than prior Hyperledger Besu releases. The Hyperledger Besu community recently decided to switch its versioning to calendar versioning, known as <a href="https://calver.org/">CalVer</a>. Instead of the historic semantic versioning used by Besu and other Hyperledger projects, the Besu team decided to use CalVer moving forward. In all future releases, you will notice the project versions will start with the year and month (YY.M) of the last major release candidate, followed by a patch number for incremental releases, which results in a YY.M.patch, or 20.10.0 for this release. The Besu team believes this will better track the project’s changes and it follows many other successful open source projects that use Calver, including Splunk and Ubuntu.</p>



<p>Check out the old vs. new versioning in the table below.</p>



ProjectReleaseOld Release VersioningNew Calver Release VersioningHyperledger Besu&nbsp;Hyperledger Besu Q4 Release Candidate 11.6.0-RC120.10.0-RC1Hyperledger Besu&nbsp;Hyperledger Besu Q4 Release Candidate 21.6.0-RC220.10.0-RC2Hyperledger Besu&nbsp;Hyperledger Besu Q4 2020 Quarterly Release1.6.020.10.0Hyperledger Besu&nbsp;Hyperledger Besu subsequent bi-weekly release&nbsp;1.6.120.10.1



<p><br>Now to share what is included in the latest release. The Besu community is excited about the continued advancements of the Hyperledger Besu project featured in this release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few highlights for this release include:</p>



  Flexible Privacy Group Performance tests  Mainnet Support Work, including preparing for the Berlin Network Upgrade and EIP-1559 support  



 Flexible Privacy Group Performance Tests 



<p>The ‘add and remove members for privacy groups’ feature was released <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/07/16/announcing-hyperledger-besu-1-5-available-now">earlier this year</a> as an early access feature. With privacy groups in Hyperledger Besu, you can add and remove members from a privacy group, creating an improved user experience for private transactions. Privacy groups are built using a private transaction manager, called <a href="https://docs.orion.consensys.net/en/latest/">Orion</a>, to help send private transactions in a permissioned network.</p>



<p>In the 20.10.0 version, privacy groups have been further improved to ensure robust performance. The team performed various tests to ensure the flexible privacy group feature is not a performance bottleneck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flexible privacy groups are now supported when using <a href="https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Concepts/Privacy/Multi-Tenancy/">multi-tenancy</a>. In addition, the team created more library examples and documentation of use cases.&nbsp;</p>



 Mainnet Support Work 



<p>Since Hyperledger Besu runs on the public Ethereum mainnet, the Besu community also sought to improve its public chain settings. As a reminder, Hyperledger Besu is the only Hyperledger project that runs on a public chain and in permissioned network settings. This optionality makes it unique and a popular project for trying out both public chain or permissioned network options for a use case.</p>



 Berlin Network Upgrade 



<p>In this release, the community prioritized work ensuring Hyperledger Besu is ready for the next Ethereum hard fork, Berlin, scheduled to happen in the next few months. You can learn more about Ethereum’s hard forks <a href="https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-history-of-ethereum-hard-forks-6a6dae76d56f">here</a>. For the Berlin hard fork, the Besu and Ethereum communities are broadly focused on implementing EIPs, or Ethereum Improvement Proposals, that will help with the UX of the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract, add new functionality to the EVM and change gas costs to reflect their execution time more accurately.&nbsp;</p>



 EIP-1559 



<p>In addition to its work on the Berlin network upgrade, the Besu team has also been leading efforts to implement <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md">EIP-1559</a>. EIP-1559 is a highly anticipated upgrade to Ethereum’s transaction fee market. This EIP’s goal is to make the Ethereum fee market more efficient. You can read more about the current status of EIP-1559 <a href="https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/1559-updates/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40timbeiko%2F1559-update-001">here</a> in a post written by Tim Beiko, one of our Besu team members.</p>



 What’s Next? 



<p>The Hyperledger Besu community remains committed to improving its project and making it fit for production blockchain use cases. Watch for new features addressing node hibernation and Bonsai Tries database improvements in our next quarterly release.</p>

      <p>Ceramic is a new permissionless protocol for creating and accessing unstoppable documents that serve as the foundation for a connected, interoperable web without silos. Joel Thorstensson is the founder and CTO of 3Box and the primary author of the ceramic protocol as well as several Ethereum standards for identity and will provide a conceptual and technical intro to Ceramic.<br>
[…]<br>
Ceramic uses DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers), IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data), signed messages, and blockchain anchoring to create a trusted and shared graph of verifiable documents. While flexible, these documents are especially well-suited for self-sovereign identity systems, user-centric data ecosystems, and open web services.\</p>

   <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md">Technical Specification</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Ceramic is a decentralized protocol that enables the creation of mutable, tamper-resistant, smart documents on a worldwide public network. Smart documents are achieved through a combination of digital signatures, document update rules, and blockchain anchoring. A Ceramic document is a flexible data structure that can be used to represent a wide variety of things such as self-sovereign identities, specific pieces of data or content, media files, schemas, policies for data access control, verifiable credentials, agreements between multiple parties, etc. The protocol doesn’t rely on any particular blockchain system, instead it utilizes <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a> to encode document changes into a hash linked data structure, called a Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), and anchors those updates into a blockchain which provides strict ordering to the content of a given document. As a result, Ceramic can be conceptualized as network of individual “doc-chains.” Verifying the state of a particular document only requires a user to sync the data of the given document, and the user does not need to sync the state of the entire network as is the case with all blockchain networks that maintain a global state (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum). A node in the Ceramic network can thus choose to only pin the documents it cares about. This means that there is no global ledger of documents.</p>

<p>Second opportunity for public review. Ends November 18th.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that XACML v3.0 Related and Nested Entities Profile Version 1.0 CSD02 from the OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC is now available for public review and comment. This is the second public review for this work.</p>
<p>The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) defines categories of attributes that describe entities of relevance to access control decisions. XACML rules, policies and policy sets contain assertions over the attributes of these entities that must be evaluated to arrive at an access decision. Principal among the various predefined entities are the entity that is requesting access, i.e., the access subject, and the entity being accessed, i.e., the resource. However, it is not unusual for access decisions to be dependent on attributes of entities that are associated with the access subject or resource. For example, attributes of an organization that employs the access subject, or attributes of a licensing agreement that covers the terms of use of a resource.</p>
<p>This profile defines two ways of representing these associated entities in the request context – related entities and nested entities – and defines additional mechanisms to access and traverse these entities.</p>
<p>About the TC</p>
<p>The XACML TC specifies access control standards, based on the Attribute-based Access Control model (ABAC). The core of this work is the specification of the syntax and semantics of a policy language called XACML. Current work in the TC consists mostly of defining additional profiles of various types which build on version 3.0 of the XACML core specification.</p>

 Tanveer Hasan &amp; Rahmanuddin Shaik  Session <p>Wikipedia is a group project, and people in the group need to have separate pages to discuss changes and improvements to Wikipedia’s content, be that an article, a policy, a help page, or something anything else. Reading these discussion pages is a vastly rewarding, slightly addictive, experience. Sometimes reading Wikipedia can ruffle feathers.</p><p>E.g. 1:</p><p>The song, Jana-gana-mana, composed originally in Bengali by Rabindranath Tagore, was adopted in its Hindi version by the Constituent Assembly as the National Anthem of India on January 24, 1950. It was first sung on December 27, 1911 at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress. [1]</p><p>Whereas Wikipedia entry of National anthem mentions&nbsp;thus:</p><p>“Jana Gana Mana is the national anthem of India. Written in highly Sanskritised (Tatsama) Bengali.” [2]</p><p>E.g. 2:</p><p>Are these beautiful waterfalls on the Kaveri River located in Tamil Nadu — or on the border between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka — or in Tamil Nadu on its border with Karnataka? Or is it really the Cauvery river, and Hogenakal Falls?&nbsp;[3]</p><p>Whatever you believe, be sure to bring a (Google) map to the debate, and point out that your opponent’s sources are not RS or&nbsp;NPOV!</p><p>E.g. 3:</p><p>Born of Serbian parents in a part of the Austrian Empire, which a short time later became a part of the Hungarian half of Austria-Hungary and is now in Croatia. He eventually became a naturalized citizen of the US.&nbsp;[4]</p><p>So was he Serbian? Croatian? Austrian? Austro-Hungarian? Istro-Romanian? Jewish? American? Martian? You decide! But don’t forget to leave an edit summary saying how pathetic it is to choose any other version. (Guess who are we talking about?) Clue: He is inventor par excellence.</p><p>In this day and age where information is often a touch and go process, a forgotten mode, a solitary quest towards creating knowledge sounds romantic (almost). Networked collaborations (such as Wikipedia) which have created knowledge sites have led to democratic interpretation and assimilation of such knowledge. They also as a basic necessity have sprung up various modes of annotation, verifiability of the Knowledge thus produced and utility quotient of the same. After all, why create and hold on to information that no body really cares&nbsp;about.</p> Plan <p>In this discussion session, the co-leaders of the session shall attempt to peel out the benign face of the visible Wikipedia page(there is a hidden world out there) and discuss the political, technological and social contours of information available on Wikipedia. We shall take the participants through the various stages of discussion about a Wikipedia page and how discussions tend to alter the course of an article. How false consensus is proposed, consent is manufactured and how these efforts are usually defeated by ‘Answer People’ and ‘Vandal Fighters’. It is no less of a war than the one between information and mis-information. The discussion on, calculus, for instance, was host to some sparring over whether the concept of “limit,” central to calculus, should be better explained as an “average.”</p><p>This discussion session brings to the table questions of legitimisation of knowledge and the inherent hierarchies that operate even within open networks of collaboration and offers a critique on consumption oriented knowledge production. The session also aims to ask questions around knowledge as an agent that has levelled some of the earlier existing contours but has introduced some of its own and how that has changed our usages and shapes our experiences.</p><p>The session will involve an edit-a-thon on a topic that will be selected by the co-leaders of the session and live commentary on the discussion pages will be tracked for further analysis. The session intends to build a dialogue towards attempting to problematise the questions of the starkly hierarchical and segmented experiences that have played a significant role in production of knowledge in the era of new knowledge practices. The session also will question the ‘best practices’ in building consent in the present global techno-economic contours of the internet, and its effect on academic spaces, creative practice and intervention.</p> Readings   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_talk_pages">Using Talk&nbsp;Pages</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines">Talk page guidelines</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial/Talk_pages">Tutorial on Wikipedia talk&nbsp;pages</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_talk_pages/1">Introduction to talk&nbsp;pages</a>  <a href="https://cis-india.org/raw/www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/%237reader_Wikipedia.pdf">A Wikipedia Reader (pdf, 6.6&nbsp;MB)</a>   Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2WikiShadows">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Wiki Shadows : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Tanveer Hasan works with the Wikimedia Foundation.

<p>We are pleased to announce that Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) Version 1.0 CSD03 from the OASIS Business Document Exchange (BDXR) TC is now available for public review and comment. This is the fourth public review for this work.</p>
<p>The Exchange Header Envelope (XHE) specifies an XML vocabulary for expressing, in machine-processable syntax, the semantics of describing either a header to or an envelope for a set of payloads of content. This is distinct from any transport-layer infrastructure header or envelope that may be required to propagate documents from one system to another. The metaphor of a paper envelope in which one places business documents for transport or management is an apt way to describe the role of an exchange header envelope. Concepts of routing, authentication, non-repudiation and concealment all apply in both the metaphor and the electronic equivalent.</p>
<p>XHE is developed jointly by UN/CEFACT and OASIS. It is the successor to the UN/CEFACT Standard Business Document Header (SBDH) Version 1.3 and the OASIS Business Document Envelope (BDE) Version 1.1. The vocabulary is modeled using the UN/CEFACT Core Component Technical Specification Version 2.01 [CCTS 2.01].</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee and Atsuhiro Tscuhiya, APAC Market Development Team</p>



<p></p>



  



<p>[Snapshots of AMF Inauguration Members]</p>



<p>As the world struggles to contain the global pandemic, cybercriminals are launching their attacks and taking advantage of the anxiety and uncertainty that people are feeling. They impersonate trusted authorities or brands to mislead their victims. This is not surprising as cybercriminals are always on the lookout for opportunities and vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity ranks amongst the top ten global risks, and reducing cyber-risk exposure has become a priority for business leaders, according to the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risk_Report_2020.pdf">World Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Risks Report</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, cybersecurity and technology experts overwhelmingly agree that reliance on passwords should be reduced if not totally scrapped: <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">80 percent</a> of all data breaches involve weak or stolen passwords, and <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Passwordless_Authentication.pdf">29 percent</a> of all attacks leverage the latter.</p>



<p>The use of passwords poses many challenges. As we increasingly live our lives and perform mission critical work online, safe access to connected devices and online services is more important than ever. The need to raise authentication standards and reduce reliance on passwords is now more urgent than ever.</p>



<p>APAC Marketing Forum</p>



<p>Since 2012, the FIDO Alliance has been working with organizations across Asia Pacific (APAC) to reduce the reliance on passwords and encourage the adoption of simpler and stronger approaches to authentication. Today, we have close to 40 members from both the public and private sector in this region.</p>



<p>Recently, more than 30 representatives from these member organizations got together for the very first FIDO Alliance APAC Marketing Forum (AMF). The AMF, held virtually, was an informal marketing related discussion.</p>



<p>The event provided a platform for members to connect, learn about each other’s markets and share best practices. It facilitated communication and cooperation amongst members, and the authentication industry as a whole.</p>



  



<p>Recent Initiatives in APAC</p>



<p>FIDO members in APAC also have made tremendous progress in recent months.</p>



<p>Companies that deployed FIDO authentication include PrivyID in Indonesia, and Japan-based NTT Docomo and KDDI. Furthermore, VinCSS became the first company in Vietnam to develop FIDO2-certified strong authentication servers.</p>



<p>FIDO also was included in official standards documents developed by the Taiwan Association of Information and Communication Standards (TAICS) and SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in Taiwan, the Taiwan-Cathay United Bank has added the FIDO logo to the latest version of its app, which was released to customers in August.</p>



<p>Additionally, we had successful events like the FIDO Security Key Support Campaign, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jnhklee_in-the-afternoon-of-july-1st-2020-a-mid-term-activity-6684348243301822464-d8Rv/">2020 FIDO Hackathon</a> – Goodbye Password Challenge that offered member organizations opportunities to interact with each other despite physical distancing.</p>



<p>Activities in the Pipeline</p>



<p>Moving forward, we aim to organize more of both digital and onsite collaborative marketing events where members can promote their innovations and share case studies. Currently, planned initiatives include:</p>



  FIDO Alliance virtual AMFs to be organized once every quarter, where post discussion updates will be shared through the FIDO Blog  FIDO Alliance quarterly member newsletter&nbsp;  Updated FIDO Alliance orientation material with contents customized for the needs of APAC members  



<p>We look forward to seeing you at the next virtual meeting in October!</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>If you wish to take part in these exciting new initiatives, or have any inquiries, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:tsuchiya@fidoalliance.org">tsuchiya@fidoalliance.org</a>.</p>



<p>By joining AMF, you will not only get to connect with key authentication players in APAC, but also gain benefits of participating in FIDO branded awareness and promotional activities together with global champions.</p>

<p>Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that provides a shared, immutable, and transparent history to the participants in the network of all the actions that have happened. Currently, different types of blockchain technologies exist, including private permissioned implementations that allow governance of the network participants and secure management of sensitive data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain has already demonstrated its potential in numerous POCs and implementations in production in Switzerland and abroad. Deployments are live in various business areas such as supply-chain management, finance (e.g., payments in crypto-currencies, tokenization), healthcare data management, ticketing services, eVoting, cars and planes configuration and maintenance, among others. Increasingly, companies are moving past the initial stage of&nbsp; testing whether&nbsp; blockchain is a good solution to a specific business problem (i.e., developing a POC) and are starting the work of adopting this technology in production networks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move from a successful POC implementation to a production deployment brings many added challenges such as ongoing management, integration (on both the technology and business process fronts), security and budgeting. Here are some key areas where advanced consideration and preparation can smooth a production implementation:</p>



  Deployment options for running and maintaining the blockchain nodes and other components of the blockchain network.  



<p>Blockchain technology is often employed to ensure transparent and secure transactions executed between parties without fully aligned interests. Instead of relying on a centralized “trusted” party, which can become a target for the internal and external cyber-attacks, parties opt to set up a distributed network. This blockchain network consists of replicated nodes that execute smart contracts – programs defined by the business logic of the application. Depending on the business requirements, a specific type of blockchain implementation (i.e., permissionless/permissioned, private/public, or hybrid) shall be chosen. This choice also impacts the network configuration and maintenance. When the nodes are located on premises, execution of smart contracts can be verified by the parties directly. However, infrastructure maintenance costs and shortage of specialists “in house” can complicate such an approach. The nodes can also be deployed in the cloud; multiple companies provide such services. Working with service providers simplifys management. However, it also requires careful selection of the provider(s) based on the sensitivity level of data that are being processed by the smart contracts, regulations, and physical location of the hosting data centers.</p>



  Set up or integration of identity management approach.  



<p>For the permissioned blockchain technology implementation, identity management service plays a crucial role. Often, even as a part of distributed ledger frameworks, identity management services are implemented in a centralized manner, which poses serious security threats and can become a single point of failure. Setting up a distributed identity management service, using blockchain-based approach for identity management (such as self-sovereign identity solutions) and implementing privacy-preserving approaches (using advance cryptographic primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs) are the approaches that must be considered for the real-world implementation.&nbsp;</p>



  Transformation of&nbsp; business processes into chaincode (smart contracts)&nbsp;  



<p>Transforming paper-based contracts and business processes into computer programs can be challenging and may require compliance with domain-specific regulations (i.e., Drug Supply Chain Security Act in US, Falsified Medicines Directive of the European Union in the pharmaceutical sector). Making sure the business processes are properly transferred and are available for&nbsp; verification and audits are cornerstone requirements for the successful integration of the blockchain. To understand and translate specifics of a company’s business area into smart contracts, collaboration between the company and blockchain specialists with the specific domain knowledge and legal expertise is required.</p>



  Data management approach.  



<p>Replication of the code execution between multiple parties brings transparency into blockchain implementations. At the same time, more parties may access the sensitive data that is required for the execution of the smart contracts deployed on the nodes. In the course of development of the blockchain, a number of approaches for hybrid data management have been proposed. These approaches assume that only part of the data is managed within the blockchain network, and most of the data, especially of a sensitive nature, is stored and processed locally. Private data collections, hardware security modules, data encryption are examples of approaches that aim to ensure data security and user privacy.</p>



  Estimation of the infrastructure and maintenance costs.  



<p>Once the above points are considered, and preliminary choices are made, it’s easier to estimate the effort and costs of implementing and maintaining a system. It is important to ensure integration and interoperability with other non-blockchain-based components. Detailed specifications of SLAs and timelines in the dynamic blockchain environment must not be overlooked.</p>



<p>Working with customers, we have found that Hyperledger Fabric, one of the most mature permissioned blockchain technology platforms implementations, is well architectured to help companies to make the leap from POC to a successful production deployment.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Fabric networks can be set up on the customer premises and in the cloud, including multi-vendor cloud environments. Deployment and maintenance of the robust and secure blockchain-based POCs and real-world systems can be achieved in close collaboration between the company and a vetted service provider that has deep experience helping enterprises successfully adopt Fabric.</p>



<p>With Hyperledger Fabric, business logic can be “translated” into the chaincode using one of the following general-purpose languages: Go, node.js, or Java. Fabric also provides a set of built-in tools for sensitive data management, such as private data collections and channels, as well as flexibility in the choice of identity management approach, such decentralized identity management and anonymous credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being aware of the challenges, knowing how to address them, and working together with a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hcsp">Hyperledger Certified Service Provider</a>, like Swisscom, are key components to the successful deployment of a blockchain-based project in production.</p>

<p>By Mike Kubzansky, CEO, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>2020 has challenged and consumed us — as individuals and as a society. From the pandemic to politics, to the severe economic downturn and the desperate cries for Black lives to matter; too many across the country and around the globe are struggling — financially, physically, and mentally.</p><p>We are at times scared, or angry, or resigned, and a pervasive sense of helplessness underpins so much of current daily life, across whole swathes of society. Yet so many people have remained remarkably resilient and resolute. We have donned our masks and taken to the streets to peacefully protest, help at food banks, or simply serve as poll watchers. We have prayed, meditated, eaten (and then tried to exercise) our way through this year of chaos and uncertainty. Several of us even got new kittens or&nbsp;puppies.</p><p>While everyone has different coping mechanisms, there is one thing I hope we all do:&nbsp;vote.</p><p>As political scientist Larry Sabato said, “Every election is determined by the people who show up.” Whether it’s by mail, drop box, in person, early, or on election day (masked, of course), we must all show up. We believe deeply in democracy. It is the bedrock of this nation, and it will only be of, for, and by all the people if we all vote. That’s why Omidyar Network signed <a href="http://adayfordemocracy.com/">A Day for Democracy</a> pledge to give our staff in the US time off to vote and do their civic&nbsp;duty.</p><p>And when voters do their civic duty, their votes must be counted. We are proud of the work of our sister organization, <a href="http://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, and many of our grantees like <a href="http://communitychangeaction.org/">Community Change Action</a>, <a href="https://demosaction.org/">Demos Action,</a> <a href="http://citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://jwj.org/">Jobs With Justice</a> for their ongoing efforts to dismantle barriers to voting, so that everyone who is eligible can vote with ease — <a href="http://www.protecttheresults.org/">and can trust that election outcomes are legitimate</a>, so that we have genuine majority rule by a full and fully empowered electorate. It’s also why I signed on to <a href="https://medium.com/world-justice-project/a-joint-appeal-to-protect-the-rule-of-law-in-the-2020-u-s-elections-1f1f6876b351">World Justice Project’s letter</a>, along with a number of other foundation presidents, demanding that the rule of law is protected to ensure the security and integrity of the elections.</p><p>We cannot let expediency outweigh accuracy. We must be patient as election officials do their jobs and count every vote, even if it takes extra time before a winner is declared. Ensuring that every vote is counted will enhance the legitimacy of the election and strengthen our democracy.</p><p>While democracy is not a focus area for Omidyar Network — nor is improving its functioning our mission — it weaves through much of our work to strengthen technology and the economy. And pluralism, if true to its ideals, should have spillover benefits that improve democracy.</p><p>In Responsible Technology, we know that online platforms with outsized power can ravage our democracy by allowing unfettered hate, bigotry, racism, antisemitism, and disinformation to run rampant. We support organizations leading the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">#StopHateforProfit</a> campaign to call on Facebook to change its policies that inflame intolerance and undermine democracy. We also support <a href="https://graphika.com/">Graphika’s</a> investigations into domestic disinformation and potential foreign interference in the 2020 election, as well as its partnership with the <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/">Election Integrity Partnership</a>, which identifies instances aimed to “prevent or deter people from voting or to delegitimize election results.”</p><p>In our call to <a href="https://omidyar.com/our-call-to-reimagine-capitalism-in-america/">reimagine capitalism</a>, we recognize that democracy and the economy are fundamentally intertwined. We cannot address one without taking into account the other. Concentrated economic power too easily spills over into political power. That has resulted in policies that prevent the economic interests of the many from being fulfilled. We are working to address these imbalances, and support communities, working families, and small businesses to have greater power and voice in the economic decisions that impact their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>We also cannot reflect on American democracy without reflecting on race. The US is still not living up to its democratic ideal in which all people are created — and treated — as equal. In addition to the continued horror of the 164 Black individuals who have been killed by police through August, we see every day continued work <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/poll-prri-voter-suppression/565355/">to disenfranchise and suppress voting by Black and brown voters</a>. So it’s not surprising that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/election-nonvoters.html">some voters drop out of the system and choose to simply not participate</a> — real change has been too slow to&nbsp;come.</p><p>We know that change won’t always happen as quickly as we would like — or many times need — but it will happen. Voting is the first step on this journey toward a more just and equal&nbsp;future.</p><p>As President Obama said in Philadelphia at a rally last week, “Voting’s about using the power we have, and pooling it together to get a government that’s more concerned, and more responsive, and more focused on you and your lives and your children, and your grandchildren, and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we’ve got to vote, and then get some change, and then vote some more, and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it&nbsp;right.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/keep-voting-until-we-get-it-right-88e3cb4611ab">Keep Voting Until We Get it Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What Digital Contact Tracing Can Teach Us About Public Trust, Health Equity, and Governance in the United&nbsp;States  Reflections from over a dozen Digital Pandemic Response Working Group meetings hosted by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University. <p>By Adam Nagy with contributions from Hilary&nbsp;Ross</p>Screenshot from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0tD98B4SBM&amp;ab_channel=TheBerkmanKleinCenterforInternet%26Society">visual tutorial on digital contact tracing </a>narrated by DPR Working Group Co-Chair Professor Jonathan Zittrain and produced by the BKC Digital Pandemic Response staff team. This animated sequence illustrated how Bluetooth enabled exposure notification systems function.<p>As of October 2020, COVID-19 cases are continuing to climb across much of the world. The global economy is in tatters. Education, commerce, worship, and all things in between remain disrupted. Over a million people are&nbsp;dead.</p><p>The overall situation was resoundingly similar five months ago when the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society launched its Policy Practice focusing on <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-digital-pandemic-response">Digital Pandemic Response</a> (DPR), along with a Digital Pandemic Response Working Group (“Working Group”). With generous support from the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, and MacArthur Foundation, the DPR Program and Working Group emerged as the linchpins of BKC’s response to the crisis. As members of the BKC staff supporting this project, we’ve had the opportunity to join the Working Group as observers, scribes, and contributors: the following is a snapshot of what we considered to be some of the significant learnings, unturned stones, and ongoing debates of the Working Group over the past several&nbsp;months.</p> About the Working&nbsp;Group <p>Amidst clouds of uncertainty, group members saw an opportunity to attenuate this unprecedented crisis — if not in whole, at least in part — using the equally unprecedented capabilities of the digital age. We wanted to examine those opportunities together, building bridges and regularly convening experts and policymakers from across sectors to dig into the complex social, technical, and political questions, and sharing learnings as we went. To start, the Working Group focused on contact tracing, an essential pillar of an effective public health response and a key locus for significant human and technological investment.</p><p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-digital-pandemic-response">Composed of representatives from public health, technology, and state government, alongside civil liberties advocates, legal experts, and academics</a>, the Working Group has operated as a weekly venue for issue-spotting, collaboration, and candid, Chatham House Rule discussion with invitees. The group’s attention has largely focused on the use of information and communications technology (ICT) to support or supplement traditional contact tracing efforts. Over the course of this work, the group gravitated towards several key questions around how technology and access to data can support contact tracing — and surfaced important concerns related to technical limitations, public health efficacy, and civil liberties risks. Succinctly, these interrelated domains are the essential relationship between public trust and digital interventions, the risks of uneven costs and benefits of digital interventions, and the urgent need for increased coordination between and among the private sector, public health professionals, researchers, and political leadership.</p> The Essential Relationship Between Public Trust and Digital Interventions <p>The pandemic struck at a time when Americans’ trust in government, institutions, in experts, and in information is at <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/09/14/americans-views-of-government-low-trust-but-some-positive-performance-ratings/">near-record lows</a>. And it is precisely among some of the hardest-hit communities where these deficits are most well-founded — why should an undocumented immigrant trust a government-employed contact tracer? Why should people of color, especially Black Americans, trust that an app won’t use their data to harm them in the future? Why should anybody trust a tech company not to sell, misuse, or otherwise fail to protect their&nbsp;data?</p><p>This is an enormous problem, and barring enforced mandates, tools in the public health kit hinge on the public’s willingness to use them.<a href="https://medium.com/@ugasser/trust-and-digital-contact-tracing-initial-insights-from-the-swiss-proximity-tracing-system-27291eae1c"> Trust is a key enabler when it comes to the efficacy of different pandemic responses</a> from population-level interventions such as wearing masks and social distancing, to downloading an app or picking up the phone to share information with a contact&nbsp;tracer.</p><p>More Privacy or More Data — Debating Difficult Trade-Offs:</p><p>Given this environment, many digital solutions, most notably the Apple and Google Exposure Notification system (GAEN), prioritized preserving user privacy at the expense of providing contact tracers with more comprehensive contextual data. Reasonable minds may (and do) disagree about whether any individual approach gets the balance of trade-offs right.<a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-apple-google-contact-tracing-ee3432c8-a150-4f71-a190-67dbdc2157b6.html"> GAEN is considered the ‘gold standard’ from a privacy standpoint</a>, but there are a host of non-GAEN digital contact tracing apps in development or in use around the world. What is clear is that robust privacy protections are intended to make adoption more palatable for wary governments and populations. But a privacy-preserving app is certainly not a sufficient condition for high adoption among a population — <a href="https://apnews.com/b05e442f8d1bc23252b872c289a2b063">adoption rates differ significantly across countries even when the underlying technology is identical </a>— and adoption rates, while a crucial metric, are not a perfect proxy for efficacy and actual public health&nbsp;impact.</p><p>Even once someone has downloaded a digital contact tracing or exposure notification app, opportunities for attrition abound. First, users must activate the app and keep it on. Upon receiving a positive test result or an exposure notification users must be proactive — either uploading their result to warn others or heeding the instructions accompanying the exposure notification. In other words, it is not enough for people to simply download the app. As Working Group member Mary Gray has written<a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/colorblind-tech-is-killing-us-why-covid-19-tech-must-focus-on-equity-9cd2b67cf84c"> elsewhere</a>, solving the “wicked hard tech problem” of notifying exposed individuals in a privacy-preserving way does not solve the critical last mile problem of routing them to trusted care workers and ensuring they self-quarantine with the necessary support to weather COVID-19. Accomplishing that task — under the privacy-protective constraints of GAEN — will require creative, non-technical solutions such as employing trusted local institutions or community members to serve as extensions of public health agencies to encourage participating in contact tracing programs — digital or otherwise — and to connect people who’ve tested positive to necessary resources.</p><p>Trust, but Verify: Evaluating Efficacy</p><p>Aside from users, there is an additional, crucial layer of trust: do public health authorities have confidence in the contact tracing app? A major unresolved barrier to buy-in concerns the lack of large-scale, replicated studies measuring the efficacy of these digital interventions. While developers have expressed concern with ‘analysis paralysis’ and the slow pace at which jurisdictions adopt these apps — arguing in favor of deploying quickly and making improvements down the line — it is difficult to expect jurisdictions to invest time and resources into still under-proven products. There are significant concerns around the costs of releasing technologies that are not proven as efficacious in terms of spent political capital, eroded public trust, and overall reduced adoption rates. Striking the right balance will remain challenging until there is more data available on the efficacy of these interventions.</p><p>In the interim, technologists and developers must work diligently to reduce other areas of uncertainty and pain points for public sector implementers. These include the potential for privacy and security breaches, overall cost, and lack of input from subject matter experts during the design process. Organizations like the<a href="https://www.lfph.io/"> Linux Foundation for Public Health (LFPH)</a> have attempted to reduce these challenges by channeling the attention of the OS community and substantial resources to the increasingly widely adopted GAEN-enabled COVID Shield and COVID Green apps, vetting developers and firms for jurisdictions to work with, and producing useful guidance documentation. Google and Apple’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/01/apple-google-exposure-notification-express/">Exposure Notifications Express</a> — turn-key solutions to building and launching a contact tracing app — will expedite adoption while allowing local authorities to customize certain key elements. The willingness of organizations to serve as ‘air-traffic’ controllers — certifying third-party vendors, scaling testing, creating replicable best practices, and working closely with local officials and public health authorities — will be critical drivers of trust and&nbsp;buy-in.</p><p>Takeaways and Calls to&nbsp;Action:</p>  State and local public health leaders and policymakers should urgently invest in building and strengthening relationships with locally trusted community groups, which are critical to helping individuals and communities collectively support each other and understand strategies to weather COVID-19. In states that have adopted exposure notification apps, community groups could help members understand privacy-preserving exposure notification tech as part of a suite of holistic supports.  As exposure notification and digital contact tracing technology is so new, we need further research on its efficacy. Who is responsible for evaluating efficacy, potential adverse effects, and the impact of these technologies across a variety of communities? What monitoring structures ought to be put into practice? (For example, Ireland established a <a href="https://github.com/HSEIreland/covidtracker-documentation/blob/master/documentation/privacy/Data%20Protection%20Impact%20Assessment%20for%20the%20COVID%20Tracker%20App%20-%2026.06.2020.pdf">COVID Tracker App Advisory Committee</a> to continually assess the efficacy of the app alongside a mechanism to wind-down the app in 90 days if they find it ineffective.) What might cross-sector evaluation of these technologies look like, with companies, researchers, policymakers, and community groups working in collaboration? A complete cost-benefit analysis for policymakers will require research into a variety of questions — many of which are outlined in this <a href="https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20324">robust research agenda from the University of Zurich</a>. Some of this work is <a href="https://github.com/digitalepidemiologylab/swisscovid_efficacy/blob/master/SwissCovid_efficacy_MS.pdf">already underway</a> — and it might be a useful exercise to catalog the existing literature.   Health (In)Equities: Uneven Costs and Benefits of Digital Interventions <p>The impacts of COVID-19 are not distributed equally — its devastating effects fall most heavily along pre-existing lines of socioeconomic and racial inequality. <a href="https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race">COVID-19 death rates are disproportionately high across communities of color</a>, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2020/20_0255.htm">especially among Black Americans who are more likely to contract COVID-19, be hospitalized for it, and die of the disease in comparison to other racial groups</a>. Longstanding disparities in access to health insurance, employment, education, quality healthcare, environmental justice, and other rights, increase the prevalence of comorbidities in Black, Latino/Hispanic, Native Americans, and Pacific Islander populations making them more vulnerable to COVID than other racial groups. In addition to causing compounding pre-existing medical conditions, social determinants can make transmission events more likely. For example, racial minorities in general and Black Americans in particular, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-racism-is-shaping-the-coronavirus-pandemic">are more likely than non-Hispanic White populations to use public transit as a primary mode of transport, to live in densely populated areas and in multigenerational households, and to work in essential frontline jobs that preclude isolating at home.</a> The Working Group has grappled with how digital public health interventions account for these disparities and can risk exacerbating them&nbsp;further.</p><p>Data Disparities</p><p>A major issue of concern raised to the Working Group pertains to gaps in state and federal public health agency data collection regimes, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0033354917745503#bibr14-0033354917745503">particularly with respect to important demographic information such as race, ethnicity, language, and other factors</a>. In the absence of this data, <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/07/a-data-driven-approach-to-addressing-racial-disparities-in-health-care-outcomes">doctors and epidemiologists have had to build improvised solutions</a> in order to better understand the disparate impacts of COVID-19 and create response strategies. These innovations, while highly impressive, are ad hoc and cannot substitute for improvements in collection, universal data standards, and best practices. Of course, the collection of demographic data is fraught — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/09/743296249/why-is-the-census-bureau-still-asking-a-citizenship-question-on-forms">take, for instance, the legal fight over the inclusion of a citizenship status question in the 2020 Census</a> — and without robust safeguards and public trust in how the data will be used there are risks such as stigmatization or suppressed response among vulnerable populations. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2012910">Scholars Merlin Chowkwanyun and Adolph Reed Jr. recently explored the risks of relying on demographic data without also considering socioeconomic status data in The New England Journal of Medicine</a>, arguing inter alia that on its own demographic data can erroneously feed perceptions that a social problem is actually a “primarily racial” one, which in turn can be “used to rationalize neglect and funding cuts.” They go on to argue in favor of incorporating data on socioeconomic factors alongside demographic information to help preempt these dangers, discover how risks intersect across different racial and social lines, and also draw attention to racial disparities. Data collection that ignores these key areas limits healthcare professionals’ ability to develop a complete hierarchy of risk on which to base the prioritization of care and resources.</p><p>The Working Group also discussed the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340108912_Aggregated_mobility_data_could_help_fight_COVID-19">potential of aggregated mobility data</a> from mobile operators and sources like <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid19/">GPS trace data from social media applications</a> to inform epidemiological models and to provide policymakers with important insights regarding movement patterns and a way to evaluate the efficacy of different strategies. But this data must be interpreted in context: urban and rural populations behave differently, as do communities of differing socioeconomic status. Further, data quality gets worse in rural areas. Each of these factors must be considered in interpreting data, finding and correcting for biases, and comparing across datasets.</p><p>Digital Divides</p><p>App-based digital contact tracing solutions risk leaving disproportionately vulnerable populations at a further disadvantage due to unequal access to smartphones. Furthermore, false alerts from inaccurate digital contact tracing tools will have greater impacts on essential workers — disproportionately people of color — who cannot work from home more than white-collar workers. Because the costs of a false-positive exposure notification are not borne equally, policymakers ought to consider necessary legal protections and social benefits to support individuals alerted that they should quarantine for 14-days. Overall, there is inadequate investment of key resources to protect communities of color; this lack of investment has both contributed to and revealed inequalities that make populations of color more susceptible to the&nbsp;virus.</p><p>Takeaways and Calls for&nbsp;Action:</p>  In order to understand people’s lived experiences of the pandemic and develop equitable mitigation strategies to protect communities, data-collecting organizations — both government agencies and academics — should be collecting relevant disaggregated health data on race, ethnicity, language, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors that contribute to inequities, such as ventilation and levels of crowding in living conditions.  Policymakers, the private sector, and academics should consider how mobility data moves across sectors and ensure that government actors use datasets in a manner that is proportionate and necessary to achieve a legitimate aim. Social media data, adtech data, and data from third-party aggregators are particularly sensitive, and in some jurisdictions privacy regulations are far less rigorous than those imposed on mobile operator&nbsp;data.  People need support to be able to effectively self-isolate and quarantine, but lack of resources prevents many people from being able to do so. Policymakers, community groups, and other relevant institutions should strongly consider offering funding and other community-based support to those who need to self-isolate and quarantine and therefore are unable to work. Policymakers should implement legal protections to protect those who need to self-isolate and quarantine from a broad range of adverse impacts at work, at home, and in their communities.   Domestic Disarray: The Urgent Need for Increased Coordination in the United&nbsp;States <p>In the United States, the COVID-19 response has been stymied from the start due to the Trump administration’s decision to delegate many decisions to industry, state, or local leaders. The lack of a national strategy on everything from mandatory mask requirements to the allocation of protective equipment has proven disastrous. Federal leadership and coordination of contact tracing efforts — digital or otherwise — continues to be lackluster. Expanding the contact tracing workforce, creating technological components, and bolstering public trust in contact tracing has been left to the states, albeit with guidance, assistance, and funding available from the Center for Disease Control and other agencies. What have been the consequences of limited federal coordination of contact tracing efforts across jurisdictions and the lack of standardized tools and practices? What is filling in the gaps? And looking outwards, are there lessons to be learned from international contexts?</p><p>Weighing the Costs and Benefits of a Decentralized Approach</p><p>Most countries engaged in digital contact tracing adopt a singular, national app. The United States has taken a decentralized approach. Currently, a growing number of states and territories use GAEN enabled apps, South Dakota, Utah, and Rhode Island use GPS-based apps, and the majority of states do not have an app. Meanwhile, employers, universities, and other private entities are steadily developing or adopting their own hyper-local solutions.</p><p>Decentralization gives the public health authorities actually engaged in contact tracing more flexibility with respect to the allocation of their funds and energies, enables them to customize apps according to their needs, and crucially, affords them the freedom to decide between GAEN and competing approaches.</p><p>But there are obvious trade-offs to this heterogeneous approach. These include the uneven adoption of digital contact tracing (most states still don’t have an app), interoperability problems, and a disjointed outreach/communications strategy. Thankfully, different GAEN enabled-apps can now communicate exposure events to one another across state lines if they are configured to use the <a href="https://www.aphl.org/programs/preparedness/Crisis-Management/COVID-19-Response/Pages/exposure-notifications.aspx">Association of Public Laboratories national key server</a> — but not all of them are configured to do so, non-GAEN apps do not work with the server, and it took months (and the generosity of private actors) to get the system up and&nbsp;running.</p><p>Lessons from&nbsp;Europe</p><p>A state-by-state model did not, however, force the Federal government to the sidelines. The European Union, which also adopted a decentralized approach, is instructive. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic/mobile-contact-tracing-apps-eu-member-states_en">Nearly every EU member state has a digital contact tracing app</a> with far higher adoption rates than seen in the United States — and there are significant ways in which the EU has been more proactive than the Federal government.</p><p>Standardizing and clarifying privacy protections and requirements is one such aspect. Congress has proposed several COVID-19 privacy bills, but none have passed, so currently<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10511"> no single federal law creates consistent and clearly-applicable privacy protections with respect to contact tracing</a>. The European Commission and the European Data Protection Board, on the other hand, have issued legal guidelines and decisions to EU Member States regarding digital contact tracing (See, <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-042020-use-location-data-and-contact-tracing_en">1</a>, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020XC0417%2808%29">2</a>, and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/covid-19_apps_en.pdf">3</a>), aggregated mobility data (See, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reco/2020/518/oj">1</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/modelling_mobilitydata_en.pdf">2</a>) and <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.LI.2020.227.01.0001.01.ENG">interoperability</a>.</p><p>Providing detailed technical guidance and assistance is another. The CDC guidelines to states around digital contact tracing are<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/guidelines-digital-tools-contact-tracing.pdf"> high-level and cursory</a>. Federal assets such as 18F or the U.S. Digital Service, which could have been deployed to assist states with the design and roll-out of their own apps, have not been empowered to do so. Meanwhile, EU organs have produced <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/mobileapps_interoperabilitydetailedelements_en.pdf">significant technical guidance to Member States</a> as well as concrete technical solutions — most notably creating a single European Federation Gateway Service to make GAEN apps interoperable.</p><p>Other entities have attempted to fill the leadership vacuum left by the Federal government. Private non-profit organizations such as the <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> or <a href="https://pathcheck.org/">PathCheck Foundation</a> are providing jurisdictions with technical assistance and solidifying best practices. Organizations such as the National Governors Association, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, and many others are using their coordinating power and expertise to issue recommendations to members and concentrate efforts.</p><p>Takeaways and Calls to&nbsp;Action:</p>  Fully launched in October, the “Federation Gateway” enables European Union Member States with properly configured GAEN-apps to interoperate. Launched in July, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) National Key Server and Verification Server allows properly configured GAEN-apps in U.S. states and territories to interoperate. While the end results are similar the associated processes were markedly different. In the EU, the European Commission led work with member states to coordinate on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/contacttracing_mobileapps_guidelines_en.pdf">interoperability guidelines</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/key_documents_en#anchor0">technical specifications</a>, and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.LI.2020.227.01.0001.01.ENG">adoption of a legal basis for the service</a>. In the United States, the APHL, a non-governmental non-profit, partnered with Apple, Google, and Microsoft to create and host a national exposure key server (as well as a unified verification server). The APHL-led approach brought an interoperable server online more quickly than the European Commission’s effort, but is it possible that the EU’s holistic approach will offer more enduring lessons? Our goal — if not for this pandemic, than at least the next one — ought to be a globally interoperable system for digital contact tracing. Accomplishing this will require tremendous synchronization across diverse legal and policy architectures. The EU’s effort, which confronted not only the technical question but legal questions as well, is a step in that direction.  Uneven state-level adoption of contact tracing apps opened the door to hyper-local test and trace solutions by private institutions, namely universities and employers. Labeled the “<a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/is-digital-contact-tracing-over-before-it-began-925c72036ee7">company-town model</a>” by Working Group Co-Chair Prof. Jonathan Zittrain, this approach has had some unsavory real-world consequences.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/coronavirus-albion-security-flaws-app/"> In one extreme example, Albion College deployed a mandatory app with around the clock location surveillance that was discovered to have several security flaws, endangering the privacy of their students</a>. As the chief enforcers of privacy protection laws, state attorneys general must remain vigilant about the privacy impacts of these apps — and would do well to issue guidelines to developers to help ensure safeguards are met. In instances where a private institution has both a large footprint in a community as well as the resources to conduct a rigorous testing and tracing program — as is the case with Harvard University — decision-makers ought to consider how to mitigate any negative community effects reopening may&nbsp;cause.   Concluding Thoughts <p>The early success of digital contact tracing in countries like South Korea — <a href="https://undark.org/2020/10/05/south-korea-covid-19-success/">which had a critical combination of high levels of public trust, a legal framework that enabled sweeping public health surveillance using a variety of data sources, and a robust pandemic response infrastructure</a> — inoculated belief in mobile technology as a critical tool to fight the spread of COVID. That belief persists in many corners, as evidenced by the slow but steady rollout of different contact tracing apps throughout the US and globally, but it has been tempered.</p><p>A silver bullet solution was always unlikely. An app cannot solve for an impoverished public healthcare infrastructure, for inadequate support of the sick and the possibly sick, or for leaders that actively spread misinformation and undermine trust in scientific authorities. But ‘no-app’ doesn’t solve these issues&nbsp;either.</p><p>Digital contact tracing solutions are arrows in our quiver, silver or otherwise, and ones that are increasingly affordable and accessible to public health authorities. The challenge now is making them as effective as possible and also, as with any weapon, working to prevent unintended harms. Invested stakeholders can re-invigorate enthusiasm for these solutions by supporting research that investigates the effectiveness of ongoing efforts and ways to improve their effectiveness. There are legitimate concerns that ineffective or insecure tools will erode the public’s trust in government-sponsored technological solutions or that the impacts of false positives will be unequally distributed. Authorities need to have a transparent plan for not only monitoring the effectiveness of these interventions in breaking transmission chains but also to guard against unintended consequences, particularly for already vulnerable or disenfranchised populations.</p><p>Until a vaccine is developed and widely dispersed, our work will continue. Despite the fact that many schools and workplaces are reopened (at least partially) and that states are easing restrictions on various activities such as indoor dining, we are still deep in this crisis. As the Working Group looks towards engaging in new topics — such as vaccine distribution schemes — it’s crucial to take stock of what we’ve learned during our examination of digital contact tracing, why we wrestled with these questions, and how we can best use what we’ve learned moving&nbsp;forward.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/what-digital-contact-tracing-can-teach-us-about-public-trust-health-equity-and-governance-in-the-510ce5f2c6f6">What Digital Contact Tracing Can Teach Us About Public Trust, Health Equity, and Governance in the…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; In which sector(s) and country(ies) do you operate?</p>
<p>Airside’s privacy-based digital identity solutions help individuals and organizations share, verify, and manage personal information. While Airside started with the goal of using mobile technology to drive convenience throughout the travel experience, we believe no one should have to choose between convenience and privacy in any digital exchange of personal information. Our products and services are available and operational globally across a variety of sectors, such as travel, tourism, health, financial services, and more.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; What is your current market focus and what needs and areas of concern does your service/product address?</p>
<p>Our new Airside App is facilitating an easy and safe way for airline travelers to share their verified IDs from their mobile device, then self-check their luggage with facial recognition technology at the airport. Our app may also be used to enable other seamless, touchless, biometric experiences in the travel sector. For instance, our interoperable solution allows airports and airlines to implement the ID verification process without asking travelers to re-enroll information for each trip or sacrifice the privacy of sensitive information, enabling airports and airlines to provide the best experience for customers and employees.</p>
<p>Coming soon, Airside will also enable the sharing of verified COVID test results. Individuals can easily add their verified results to the new Airside App directly from a certified lab and securely share the results with an employer, travel operator, venue, and more. These organizations gain confidence that test results have not been tampered with and are compliant with local public health requirements, and worldwide privacy regulations.</p>
<p>Since 2014, our award-winning Mobile Passport App expedites a safe process through U.S. customs by U.S. and Canadian passport holders. Mobile Passport is the first app authorized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (U.S. CBP) and is trusted by over nine million people.</p>
<p> 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; In what ways does your service/product push beyond the state-of-the-art? </p>
<p>Privacy and security are at the core of everything we build, and now, more than ever, the integrity of our virtual selves is of the utmost importance. We see how identity theft and identity fraud have skyrocketed with the rapid need for technology during COVID-19. While there may be other ways to verify and share IDs and other personal information, Airside does so in a way that is user-controlled and consent-driven, putting the individual in control of their data. This mitigates health and security risks that come with tedious and often inconsistent paper processes, human intervention and low-grade technology.</p>
<p>Our products and services build a connection of digital trust between people and the organizations with whom they share their ID(s). What’s more, Airside cannot access, does not own, and will not sell the information transmitted using our network. We only keep transaction records (which do not contain any personal information) for audit purposes.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Where do you see the market trending in the mid/long term and how do you see your product/service playing into it?</p>
<p>The paradigm for digital identity has shifted and Airside is uniquely built in such a way to lead the industry with the highest levels of security and privacy standards. Digital identity now serves a critical function for everyday tasks. People are digitally sharing everything, from driver’s licenses and passports to school records and gym memberships. At the same time, the general public is becoming more aware and empowered by well-known privacy regulations, like GDPR and CCPA. Biometrics, for instance, is no longer a topic for tech-savvy early adopters. There is an immediate need for it and the secure transaction of all personal information. So, while people will continue to seek more virtual opportunities to conduct certain transactions, they’ll increasingly look for organizations or businesses that keep them safe, physically and digitally.</p>
<p>A lot of industries hit by COVID-19 are going to rebound and those who commit to personal data rights will do so faster than others. We’re eager to work with industries seeking to keep their employees and customers safe and healthy using our secure, scalable solutions to manage personal information with transparency.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Why were you motivated to join Kantara Initiative and how do you see it helping your organization specifically, and the digital economy as a whole?</p>
<p>Airside has great respect for Kantara Initiative’s work to make our complex, connected lives ones that are user-centric, consent-driven, and ultimately, built on trust. We were motivated to join Kantara Initiative to help us establish an architecture where a clear, unambiguous information exchange can take place. Using Kantara’s Consent Receipt specifications, we are able to offer our partners a service that eliminates the need for centralized databases of personal information and greatly simplifies their compliance requirements. This also provides our network members with clarity of the scope of their personal information and control as to when, how and with whom to share it in a focused, deliberative manner.</p>
<p>It’s a huge step when we can bind our secure and convenient technology with first-class privacy and data protection principles, as standardized by Kantara and echoed in various data protection laws, regulations and international standards. Being together in the global, thought-leading digital economy with Kantara means that Airside’s digital identity privacy network has put the highest levels of privacy assurance and interoperability into real-life practice.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; What other significant aspects about your organization (service/product) should our global community know about?</p>
<p>Airside has always believed that privacy is a human right and builds secure and convenient digital identity technology in a manner that protects personal information and meets privacy regulations around the world accordingly. We promise to lead and innovate with our core principle, “Privacy First. Human Always.” Everyone deserves to be treated with equality, respect, and dignity because, ultimately, our true identity is as a human always.</p>

<p>As 2020 has shown, supply chains are both vital and vulnerable, underscoring the need for trust and transparency. To meet that need, blockchain is playing an increasingly prominent role in many supply chains, and Hyperledger technologies underpin most of the biggest and best known networks, including FoodTrust and TradeLens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there are many other examples of Hyperledger technologies in action in the supply chain space. Read on for details about a range of #HyperledgerSupplyChain solutions that are powering supply chains and the businesses that rely on them:</p>



<p>Accenture’s True Supplier Marketplace</p>



<p>Inaccurate supplier master data and incomplete risk assessments cost businesses an average of 15 million dollars per year. What if onboarding a vendor and managing their data could be done more effectively to ensure compliance? Imagine a solution where onboarding times drop from weeks to hours, while adherence to risk assessments improves.</p>



<p>With this supply chain transformation in mind, Accenture used Hyperledger Fabric to develop a double-sided procurement marketplace to source, onboard and maintain supplier relationships. By giving suppliers ownership of their own data, the solution creates a shared source of truth between parties that improves risk compliance, speeds time to onboard, and removes the manual effort required to maintain siloed systems. <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/blockchain/true-supplier-marketplace">Accenture’s True Supplier Marketplace</a> is live and available now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DL Freight</p>



<p>Developed by <a href="https://dltlabs.com/">DLT Labs</a>, DL Freight is the national standard for freight invoice management for Walmart Canada and its national network of third party transportation companies or carriers. The system tracks deliveries, verifies transactions, and automates invoices in real time across the network of up 70 different carriers in Walmart’s supply chain.</p>



<p>DL Freight is built on Hyperledger Fabric, an open source platform that allows Walmart to bring together the carriers within its multi-partner freight operations under one architecture to automate and implement universal workflows across the network. At the same time, through Hyperledger Fabric’s unique “channels” feature, the solution allows independent and protected relationships for each organization directly between itself and Walmart, and the information is not accessible to other members.</p>



<p>Within DL Freight, carriers are the peers, and the governance of the platform is controlled by the applicable contracts, as in any conventional business. The difference is that the freight, legal, and finance departments of Walmart, as well as all the carriers, have all agreed that the solution fairly and accurately represents those agreements so it processes them automatically. As a result, it has removed the guesswork and any real potential for dispute over the interpretation of agreements.</p>



<p>Telefónica’s e2e Supply Chains</p>



<p>Today’s supply chains are increasingly global and complex with hundreds of companies involved in the manufacturing and distribution of products and with logistics that expand across borders. In this context, collaboration has become key to streamline operations. To manage the complexity, <a href="https://www.telefonica.com/en/">Telefónica</a> launched a project to transform the way it collaborates with third parties by blockchain-enabling its e2e Supply Chain solution to make it faster, simpler and more efficient.</p>



<p>Trust is at the heart of that collaboration, and, to build that trust, Telefónica selected Hyperledger Fabric as the underlying technology that serves as a secure and transparent single source of truth for all.</p>



<p>Telefónica started using the blockchain-based supply chain solution to support one of its core products – CPE (Customer Premise Equipment) – the routers, decos, and other devices that provide connectivity and services at home to their customers. The company manufactures over 15 million serialized devices a year that are then distributed and installed by a field force of over 30,000 technicians.</p>



<p>Telefónica put this blockchain platform for operations into production in 2019 in Brazil, where the program delivered ROI in under six months.Telefónica is planning to extend the use of its blockchain-enabled e2e solution to the rest of its Fixed Operations and other products in the coming months.</p>



<p>Trust Your Supplier</p>



<p>Just named as the 2020 Winner of Blockchain Revolution’s Innovative Entrepreneurship in Blockchain Award in the Supply Chain Applications category, <a href="https://www.trustyoursupplier.com/">Trust Your Supplier</a> is an innovative solution developed in a partnership between IBM and Chainyard to address the inefficiencies and risks associated with supplier information management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this time of a global pandemic, many buyers are procuring goods and services in the context of a supply constrained situation. This has resulted in substantial challenges in vetting and onboarding new suppliers.</p>



<p>Built on Hyperledger Fabric, Trust Your Supplier provides both a cross-industry network and a blockchain secured platform to speed onboarding and minimize risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain provides cryptographic security that allows suppliers to control access to their single digital identity. Buyers are able to view profiles of their connected suppliers, as well as a timeline of all the various activities that have taken place with this supplier.

 An agenda for meaningful connectivity in&nbsp;Africa <p>The World Bank’s annual World Development Report 2021 themed “Data for better lives’’ will be launched in Q1 2021. In our modern world where the impact of data and digital technology has never been more keenly felt, the focus of the World Bank — a major international developmental partner — on improving lives through data and technology could not have been more&nbsp;timely.</p><p>This is particularly true for Africa, the least <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/stat/default.aspx">digitally connected</a> continent. Africa lags behind the rest of the world in Internet access, digital device access, and digital skills. The World Bank’s focus on data and technology in 2021 should rally governments, industry, academia, and civil society to push for the actualization of developmental targets focused on digital penetration and adoption.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/system-web-network-globe-europe-3699552/">Pixabay</a><p>An important facet of the theme “data for better lives’’ is an acknowledgment that in developing countries, the collection, collation, and analysis of development data which forms the basis of national planning is done infrequently and often lacks the granularity required to achieve its objectives. Many developing countries have <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/dcr-2017-9-en.pdf?expires=1603460038&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=1C3E254DD96B72F0CDD1A182615F3839">poorly supported government statistical offices</a>. Within these contexts, digital signals such as from mobile phone usage and Internet use can be useful, when expertly marshaled, to fill in gaps in developmental data needed to inform developmental outcomes. The most recent blog by the World Development Report 2021 team highlights the poignant example of the use of social media activity to <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/finding-missing-data-creating-actionable-information-solving-development-problems?cid=dec_tt_data_en_ext">improve traffic safety</a> in Nairobi&nbsp;Kenya.</p><p>What is obvious in the profitable and scalable use of these new sources of data is the need for a critical mass of Internet and digital device users in Africa. Applications of these emerging Big Data sources are most efficient and reliable when there is an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oreillymedia/2012/01/19/volume-velocity-variety-what-you-need-to-know-about-big-data/#33f03a161b6d">abundance of data</a>. The World Bank’s focus on the role of technology and data in national development is another opportunity for national governments, industry, academia, and civil society to rally for increased digital penetration and adoption.</p><p>A useful framework for thinking about what constitutes real digital progress for nations is the concept of “meaningful connectivity’’. According to the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), we have <a href="https://a4ai.org/meaningful-connectivity/">meaningful connectivity</a> when we can use the internet every day (regularly) using an appropriate device (smartphone) with enough data (unlimited broadband) and a fast connection (minimum 4G). Only under these conditions of user experience can the durable benefits envisaged by the World Bank’s “Data for Better Lives’’ theme be realized.</p><p>From applications ranging from traffic management, mobile money, e-commerce, e-health, software development, and many others, opportunities for individual and national development are opened up when there is a critical mass of digitally connected citizens. “Data for Better Lives’’ thus serves as a rallying point for countries to work towards achieving <a href="https://a4ai.org/as-internet-access-proves-critical-we-are-missing-targets-to-connect-everyone/">international developmental goals</a> related to digital connectivity.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/data-for-better-lives-an-agenda-for-meaningful-connectivity-in-africa-baa3970d2bf9">Data for better lives</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Election interference and platform interventions in the lead-up to November&nbsp;3 Oumou Ly (left) interviews Naima Green-Riley (right) for The Breakdown from the Berkman Klein&nbsp;Center.<p>Concerns about election interference and disinformation are rampant in the weeks before the U.S. presidential election on November 3. In this episode of The Breakdown, Assembly Staff Fellow <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly </a>interviews <a href="http://www.naimagreenriley.com/">Naima Green-Riley</a>, a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University.</p><p>Ly and Green-Riley review recent foreign interference, the weaponization of social issues, and various platform interventions to mitigate the spread of mis- and disinformation ahead of the election.</p><p>Read the transcript, which has been lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity:</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to The Breakdown. My name is Oumou. I’m a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center on the <a href="https://www.bkmla.org/">Assembly: Disinformation </a>program. I am really excited to be joined today by Naima Green-Riley. Naima’s a PhD candidate at the Department of Government at Harvard University, with a particular focus on public diplomacy and the global information space. She also was formerly a foreign service officer and a Pickering fellow. Welcome, Naima. Thanks so much for&nbsp;joining.</p><p>Naima Green-Riley (NGR): Well, thank you so much for having&nbsp;me.</p><p>OL: So our conversation today centers on foreign interference in the upcoming election, which is drawing close as of the time of this recording. We’re about two weeks out from November 3rd. One big topic on my mind today is the big threat actors this time around… We know that 2016 was sort of a watershed moment in terms of foreign interference for American democratic processes.</p><p>In terms of social media manipulation in particular, how do foreign influence efforts in 2020 look in contrast to active measures we saw in 2016? Have the primary threat actors changed, optimized their methods a little bit, or adopted overall new approaches to influencing public&nbsp;opinion?</p><p>NGR: Well, you’re definitely right that 2016 marked the first time that the U.S. started to really pay attention to this type of online foreign influence activity. And during that election year, we saw a series of coordinated social media campaigns targeting various groups of individuals in the United States and seeking to influence their political thoughts and behavior. The campaigns were focused on sowing discord in U.S. politics, mainly by driving a wedge between people on very polarizing topics, so they usually involved either creating or amplifying content on social media that would encourage people to take more extreme viewpoints. So some examples might be that veterans were often targeted. There was this one meme that was run by Russian trolls, basically, that showed a picture of a U.S. soldier, and then it had the text, “Hillary Clinton has a 69% disapproval rate amongst all veterans,” on it. Clearly intended to have an impact on how those people were thinking.</p><p>They might also give misleading information about the elections, like they might tell people that the election date was maybe several days after the actual election date and therefore try and ruin people’s chances at using their right to vote. Some disinformation campaigns told people that they could tweet or text their vote in so they didn’t have to leave their&nbsp;homes.</p><p>And also there was exploitation of real political sentiment in the U.S., often encouraging divisions and particularly divisions around race. And so there were YouTube channels that would be called things like Don’t Shoot or Black to Live that shared content about police violence and Black Lives Matter, and some racialized campaigns that were linked to those types of sites would then promote ideas like, “The black community can’t rely on the government. It’s not worth voting&nbsp;anyway.”</p><p>So that’s the type of stuff that we started to see in 2016, and many of those efforts were either linked to the GRU, which is a part of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, or the Internet Research Agency, the IRA, of Russia. And many characterized the IRA as a troll farm, so an organization that particularly focuses on spreading false information online.</p><blockquote>Since 2016, unfortunately, online influence campaigns have only become more rampant and more complicated.</blockquote><p>So since 2016, unfortunately, online influence campaigns have only become more rampant and more complicated. We’ve seen a more diverse range of people being targeted in the United States, so not just veterans and African-Americans, but also different political groups from the far right to the far left. We’ve seen immigrant communities be targeted, religious groups, people who care about specific issues like gun rights or the Confederate flag. So, basically, the most controversial topics are the topics that foreign actors tend to drill deep on to try and influence Americans. And so it’s just gotten more and more&nbsp;complex.</p><p>OL: I want to pick up on this point, because so often particularly racial issues form the basis of disinformation and influence campaigns because, like you said, they are the most divisive, contentious issues. In what ways have you seen foreign actors work to weaponize social issues in the United States just this year, since the death of George&nbsp;Floyd?</p><p>NGR: Well you know, it’s interesting, because we focus a lot on disinformation as targeted towards the elections, but a number of different types of behaviors and activities have been targeted through disinformation, so we’ve seen people try to manipulate things like Census participation or certain types of civic involvement. And the range of ways that actors are actually different platforms is changing too, so we’re seeing text messages and WhatsApp messages being used to impact people in addition to social&nbsp;media.</p><p>But after George Floyd was killed, as you might expect, because it’s a controversial issue that affects Americans, absolutely there was sort of this onslaught of misinformation and disinformation that showed up online. So there were claims that George Floyd didn’t die. There were claims that were stoking conspiracy theories about the protests that happened after his death. And I have to say, not all dis- and misinformation is foreign, so that’s why this is such a large problem, because there are many domestic actors that engage in dis- and misinformation campaigns as well. So the narratives that we’ve seen across the space just come from so many different people that sometimes it can be hard to target the problem to one particular actor or one particular motive.</p><p>OL: So in 2016, the Russian government undertook really sophisticated methods of influence, certainly for that particular time and for that election, including mobilizing inauthentic narratives via inauthentic users, leveraging witting and unwitting Americans and social media users. How would you contrast the threat posed by Russia’s efforts with other countries known to be involved in ongoing influence efforts?</p><p>NGR: Well, I have to say that Russia continues to be a country of major concern. We saw just recently, this week, the FBI announcing that Russia has been shown to have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-russia-voter-registration-data-2020-election-national-intelligence/">some information</a> about voter registration in the United States. And Russian disinformation campaigns have definitely re-emerged in the 2020 election cycle, but those campaigns only make up a small amount of the overall activities that Russia is engaging in today, all with the goal of undermining democracy and eroding democratic institutions around the world. That being said, we’ve seen other actors emerging in this space. Within the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese agents were shown to be pushing false narratives within the U.S. saying that President Trump was going to put the entire country on lockdown.</p><p>Iran has increasingly been involved in these types of campaigns as well. Recently, they used a mass of emails to affect U.S. public opinion about the elections. And one more thing I want to mention is that this is really a global phenomenon. So these actors, these state actors, often outsource their activity through sort of operations in different countries. So for instance, there are stories of a Russian troll farm that was set up in Ghana to push racial narratives about the United States. And there have also been troll farms that are set up by state actors in places like Nigeria, Albania, the Philippines. And so what’s interesting here is that the individuals who are actually sending those are either economically motivated, they’re getting paid, or they might be ideologically motivated, but they’re acting on behalf of these state actors. And that makes this not just a state to state issue, but a real global problem that involves many people in different parts of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>OL: So turning to the platforms for a second, what are your thoughts on some of the interventions platforms have announced so far? Like limiting retweets and shares via private message, labeling posts and accounts associated with state-run media organizations… The list of interventions goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>NGR: Yeah, all of the things that you mentioned are a good start, I would say. At the end of the day, I think it’s got to be a major focus on, how can we inform social media users of the potential threats in the information environment? And how can we best equip them to really understand what they are consuming? So I think that part of the answer is for these tech companies to, of their own accord, continue to create policies that will address this issue, but we also need better legislation, and that legislation has to focus on privacy rights, has to focus on online advertising, political advertising, tech sector regulation. And then we need policies that will enforce this type of thing moving forward. So it can’t all be upon the tech companies without that guidance, because I don’t know that they necessarily have the total will to do all that’s necessary to really get at this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Social media companies have already started to label content. They’re also searching for inauthentic behavior, especially coordinated inauthentic behavior online. But I think that there is particular work to be done in terms of the way that we think about content labeling. So when platforms are labeling content, they are usually labeling content from some sort of state-run media. And if it’s a state-run media, much of the state-run media that they’re looking at is not completely a covert operation. It’s not a situation where this media source just doesn’t want anyone to know that it’s associated with the state, but it might be pretty difficult for the audience to actually determine that that outlet is from a state-run site.</p><p>So an example would be our RT, formerly known as Russia Today. There’s a reason, I think, that it went from Russia Today to RT. If you go to the RT website, you will see a big banner that says, “Question more, RT.” And then there’s lots of information about how RT works all over the world in order to help people to uncover truth. And then if you scroll all the way bottom to the bottom of the website, you’ll see RT has the support of Moscow or the Russian government… So it’s difficult for people to actually know where this content is coming&nbsp;from.</p><blockquote>At the end of the day, I think it’s got to be a major focus on, how can we inform social media users of the potential threats in the information environment?</blockquote><p>And this summer Facebook made good on a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/labeling-state-controlled-media/">policy</a> that they had said that they were going to enact for some time, where they now label certain types of content. And basically, they say that they’ll label any content that seems like it’s wholly or fully under editorial control that’s influenced by the state, by some state government. And so lots of Chinese and Russian sites or outlets are included in this policy so far. And according to Facebook, they’re going to increase the number of outlets that get this label. And basically what you see is, on the post, you see, “Chinese state-controlled media,” “Russian state-controlled media,” something to that effect. That’s helpful because now a person doesn’t have to click and then go to the website and then scroll to the bottom of the page to find out that this outlet comes from&nbsp;Russia.</p><p>But at the same time, I still think we need to do more in terms of helping Americans to understand why it’s an issue, why state actors are trying to reach them, little old me who lives in some small city or some small town in the middle of America, and how narratives can be manipulated. And so only if that’s done in connection with labeling more of these types of outlets on social media, I think you’d get more&nbsp;impact.</p><p>YouTube does something else. In 2018 they started to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46139189">label their content</a>, but the way they label the content is, they basically label anything that is government-sponsored. So if some outlet is funded in whole or in part by a government, there’s a banner that comes up at the bottom of the video that tells people that. And so you’ll see RT labeled is Russian content, but you’ll also see BBC labeled as British content, so it doesn’t have to do with the editorial control of the&nbsp;outlet.</p><p>One final thing on this, because I think this is really important. So I have heard stories of people who, let’s say, for whatever reason have stumbled upon some sort of content from a foreign actor. And so this content might come up because somebody shared something and they watched the video, right? So they watch a video. Let’s say they watch an RT video. Maybe they weren’t trying to find the RT video, and maybe they also aren’t the type of person who would watch a lot of content from RT, but they watch that one video. They continue to scroll on their newsfeed, and then they get a suggestion. “You might enjoy this.” Now the next thing that they get comes from Sputnik. It comes from RT again. So now they’re getting fed information about the U.S. political system that is being portrayed by a foreign actor, and they weren’t even looking for it. I think that’s another thing that we’ve got to tackle, is the algorithms that are used in order to uphold tech companies’ business models, because in some cases those algorithms will be harmful to people because they’ll actually feed them information from foreign actors that might have malicious intent.</p><p>OL: Naima, this week the FBI confirmed that Iran was responsible for an influence effort giving the appearance of election interference. And in this particular episode, U.S. voters in Florida and, I think, a number of other states received threatening emails from a domain appearing to belong to a white supremacist group. Can you talk a little bit about what in particular the FBI revealed, and what its significance is for the election?</p><p>NGR: Right. So there was a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/20/proud-boys-emails-florida/">press conference</a> on October 21st in which the FBI announced that they had uncovered an email campaign that was orchestra orchestrated by Iran. The emails purported themselves to come from the Proud Boys, which, as you mentioned, is a far-right group with ties to white supremacy, and it was also a group that had recently been referenced in U.S. politics in the first presidential debate. But actually, now we know that these emails came from Iran, and some of the individuals who received the contents of the email posted them online. So they were addressed to the email users by name, and they said, “We are in possession of all of your information, email, address, telephone, everything.” And then they said they knew that the individual was registered as a Democrat because they had gained access to the U.S. voting infrastructure. And they said, “You will vote for Trump on election day, or we will come after&nbsp;you.”</p><p>So first of all, they included a huge amount of intimidation. Second of all, they were purporting themselves to be this group that they were not. And third of all, they absolutely were attempting to contribute to discord in the run-up to the elections. It’s dangerous activity. It is alarming activity. It’s something that I think will have multiple impacts for a time to come, because even though the FBI was able to identify that this happened, that goal of shaking voter confidence of course may have been a little bit successful in that instance.</p><p>And so one of the things that is good about this is that the FBI was able to identify this very quickly, to make an announcement to the U.S. public that it happened, to be clear about what happened. Unfortunately, what they announced was not just that the Gmail users were receiving this email and there was false information in it, but they also said that they had information that both Russia and Iran have actually obtained registration information from the United States, and that’s concerning as&nbsp;well.</p><p>There appears to be good coordination between the private sector and the government on this issue. Google announced the number of Gmail users that are estimated to have been targeted through the Iranian campaign. Unfortunately, the number is about 25,000 email users, which is no small amount. And so this is just another instance of how not social media but the internet realm, email, can be used as a way to target American public&nbsp;opinion.</p><p>OL: Thank you. Thank you so much for joining me, Naima. I really enjoyed our conversation. I know our viewers will&nbsp;too.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-foreign-interference-and-the-u-s-2020-election-69b91ca64220">The Breakdown: Foreign Interference and the U.S. 2020 Election</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>On October 21, Capital One hosted the 2nd Women in Identity DC Area Meetup. Speakers from both Women in Identity and Capital One brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the (virtual) table. The entire meetup was moderated by Melissa Heng, Senior Director of Digital Product Management at Capital One. &nbsp;It included a number of great discussions on the issues of identity and privacy as well as the tools women need to succeed in the industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Leadership and Identity</p>
<p>Sara Strauss, the Senior Vice President for US Card at Capital One, kicked off with a look at why it is important to have diversity in leadership positions in general – and specifically within the identity space. Because everyone has implicit bias, it is crucial that all perspectives are represented when developing new technologies. As unique individuals, we all need an environment that encourages us to share our perspectives openly – they are critically important in the identity space.</p>
<p>Sara also shared some tips from her own experience</p>
 
 Embrace that you are different. Your perspectives matter and what you bring to the table is unique and valuable. 
 Don’t try to look the same and think the same as everyone else because your uniqueness is what will set you apart. 
 When you are speaking up, speak what you believe not what you think you are supposed to say. 
 Find allies. Knowing that you have someone in the room who will support you, can give you the courage to stand out. 
 
<p>Networking for Professional Development</p>
<p></p>
<p>Career Development Facilitator Jennifer McCluskey then moved the discussion into a networking and professional development session. Attendees were able to share their anxieties and struggles with networking and Jennifer highlighted that these are common to ALL of us. What we need to do is shift our perception of networking from a negative, necessary, evil to a positive tool that can help us foster connections in our careers and everyday lives. Networking can help build our professional capital by giving us access to resources, information and influencers. It can give us the competitive edge we need to succeed. Attendees then took the opportunity to put those tools to the test, networking actively in several smaller breakout groups.</p>
<p>The Intersection of Identity and Privacy Panel Discussion</p>
<p>A panel discussion followed featuring Dr. Jenn Behrens, Becky Heironimus, Maggie Martin, Kimberly Sutherland and Sara Farmer. Panellists addressed several questions about privacy and identity and underscored the importance of communication and transparency when collecting and retaining data. Customers and users have a right to know what their information is being used for and,as a sector, it is our responsibility to make sure that they are informed and comfortable with the security of their data. Dr. Behrens suggested that more user friendly language around what is happening to our data in real time will help create an atmosphere of transparency.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, we need to provide customers with different authentication options. We can gradually increase the complexity of requirements as consumers become more comfortable with increasingly sophisticated technology.</p>
<p>The Power in YOU</p>
<p>Aparna Sarin, Vice President of Small Business Card at Capital One, then finished our conversation with an inspiring message: “As women, we have strengths that are hugely valuable.” Her personal journey of discovery includes overcoming bad, self-deprecating habits. She referenced How Women Rise by Sally Helgesen and Marshal Goldsmith and described several common bad habits including a reluctance to claim our achievements, putting your job before your career, falling into the perfection trap, and many more. Overcoming these habits will allow us to focus in on our strengths and give us the courage to be confident, assertive, fearless and empowered leaders.</p>
<p>We finished with an overview of Women in Identity including our mission, goals and member activities. This includes an invitation to all participants – and our readers (men and women) – to sign up!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/become-a-member.">https://www.womeninidentity.org/become-a-member.</a></p>
<p>We had such excellent conversations on identity, privacy and our role as women within the industry. And we thank the many inspiring women who provided attendees with practical and accessible tools to succeed in the identity space.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who participated and made this event such a success!</p>

<p>The WiD Leadership team was out in force at KuppingerCole’s CusTech 2020 from 20-22 October.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a series of sessions across the event, we shared practical tips to encourage better leadership around DEI and considered ways to identify and control unconscious biases when building identity systems that work for ALL customers.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights included 2 great workshops both of which prompted follow up activity. we are actively looking at how we can get more of these sessions out into the public. Watch this space!</p>
 
 Identifying and Breaking Potential Bias in Identity Systems
 
 
 
 A great interactive session led by Colette d’Alessandro and Esther Hoeksema where attendees interacted with the WiD leadership team in small group discussions to share ideas on how to remove bias in identity systems. 
 
 
 
 
 Learning Path to Identity Diversity
 
 
 
 This session, led by Kay Chopard-Cohen, Diane Joyce and Karyn Bright focused on practical ways to make change. We concluded that change needs to start with our individual personal behaviour. From there we can grow into looking at the way our work groups and organizations operate.&nbsp; Try simple tactics like stopping yourself from speaking (if that is what you do!) and asking for the opinion of someone who often goes unheard. Or physically setting down your pen as a reminder to listen! Often the most subtle acts are the most powerful when building an inclusive environment. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>The positive response from audiences was a great indicator that we are seeing a general shift from simply understanding why diversity is important to understanding how we can create diverse environments and champion those that are underrepresented.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Designing for Diversity
 
 
 
 The keynote session with Canadian team leaders, Chanda Jackson and Nicole Landry, gave a great foundation for understanding the impact of bias and what it means when you’re looking to develop identity systems that are genuinely intended to work for everyone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Customers and the Identity Experience
 
 
 
 This final panel brought things full circle, reminding us all that ultimately we are trying to build systems that work for ALL our customers – regardless of their race, gender, financial status or their physical or technical ability. Ably moderated by Nicole Landry, Dia Banerji, Diane Joyce and Louise Maynard-Atem reminded us that while employees may be ‘stuck with’ a bad user experience (UX), our customers have a choice! The past year has seen the identity sector move faster than ever thought possible with products rolling out to meet new sector demands. The team challenged that we may not always fully consider UI/UX needs across the full intersectionality of humanity when doing so. KuppingerCole dubbed this session a “Powerhouse panel!” 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>This gave the Women in Identity team a great opportunity to work with colleagues across different geographies and time zones – a truly global event.</p>
<p>We look forward to more great opportunities and encourage ALL our members to get in touch if you’d like to be part of future discussions. Interested? Why not update your <a href="https://womeninidentity.org/members/">Women in Identity profile</a> with the topics that interest you most – we’ll be in touch!</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This month, the Hyperledger technical community voted in the annual election for new Technical Steering Committee (TSC) members. Since the inception of Hyperledger, the number of projects, labs, members, and working groups within Hyperledger increased. The 2018-2019 TSC <a href="https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/message/2504">started the discussion</a> of increasing the size of the TSC in order to bring representation for the full breadth of the community to the TSC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the 2020-2021 TSC expanded from 11 to 15 members. With this increase, seven new voices* were added to the TSC. The TSC is led by a chair and, new as of this year, a vice chair. These leaders, elected by the newly installed TSC, are Arnaud Le Hors, Senior Technical Staff Member, Blockchain &amp; Web Open Technologies, IBM (chair), and Tracy Kuhrt, Senior Technology Architect, Accenture’s Blockchain and Multiparty Systems Group (vice chair).</p>



<p>As the new TSC year kicks off, we asked Arnaud and Tracy to weigh in on what’s to come as well as their views on the expanded committee and what drove them to take on their leader roles. Here’s what we learned:</p>



<p>Q) What are some of the challenges the TSC faces in the next year? Opportunities?</p>



<p>Arnaud: Over the first five years of Hyperledger we’ve made good progress in getting our house in order with well defined processes, consolidated governance documents, and a systematic way of managing issues and recording decisions. Yet, people, especially those new to Hyperledger, consistently report challenges in understanding what’s going on, what the different projects are about, how they relate to one another and where they are going. I think our biggest challenge remains finding a way to develop a better understanding of what’s going on by fostering greater exchange of pertinent information across projects so that opportunities for collaboration aren’t missed. As projects mature and development becomes less frantic, I think there is an opportunity for this to happen, which is key to building one global community.</p>



<p>Tracy: Arnaud discussed the challenges that we have related to understanding the different projects within the Hyperledger community. I see similar challenges with complementary projects that exist within the Linux Foundation (e.g.,<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/10/introducing-the-open-governance-network-model/"> Open Governance Network Model</a>,<a href="https://trustoverip.org/"> ToIP</a>,<a href="https://confidentialcomputing.io/"> Confidential Compute Consortium</a>,<a href="https://accordproject.org/"> AccordHQ</a>). The same opportunity exists for us to exchange information and collaborate with these other communities so that we can ensure what we are building is useful in the greater ecosystem.</p>



<p>Q) Are there emerging technologies or challenges you see as opportunities for new projects?</p>



<p>Tracy: As a Lab Steward, I am among the first to see some of the<a href="https://labs.hyperledger.org/"> interesting things that the community is thinking about and developing</a>. We have seen a couple of our top-level projects (Ursa and Cactus) that came out of Hyperledger Labs, and I expect that we will see more in the future.</p>



<p>There are a number of labs specifically looking at different ways of adding privacy and confidentiality across the different blockchain platforms and at different layers in the stack. The amount of interest in this space is an indicator that we may see a project being brought forward on how enterprises can share data while maintaining privacy and confidentiality.</p>



<p>Q) Why did you want to take on a leadership role with the TSC?</p>



<p>Tracy: Prior to joining Accenture, I spent not quite two years as a Hyperledger Community Architect evangelizing the organization and all of its projects at both meetups and conferences around the world, supporting the community, and improving the collaboration tools. This experience allowed me to build relationships with many in the community and gain a deep understanding of the challenges that the technical community faces on a daily basis. When I joined Accenture, I wanted to continue to be involved with the Hyperledger community. I have been able to do that through my role as a Lab Steward, a member of the Hyperledger Speakers Bureau, a co-chair for the 2020 Hyperledger Global Forum program committee, and a member of the TSC.&nbsp; As a member and vice chair of the TSC, I bring diversity and additional perspectives to the conversations, which in turn will make the community stronger.</p>



<p>Q) Why was it important to expand to TSC this year?</p>



<p>Arnaud: The number of Hyperledger projects has grown a lot since we started five years ago. Increasing the number of seats on the TSC gave us a chance to get a broader representation of the many different groups we now have. Looking at the seven new members that were elected to the TSC it is clear to me that we have indeed achieved that goal. The improved gender diversity with a greater number of female members we gained only makes that better.</p>



<p>Here is the full list of TSC members:</p>



  <a href="https://github.com/adecaro">Angelo De Caro</a>, IBM  <a href="https://github.com/lehors">Arnaud J Le Hors</a> (chair), IBM  <a href="https://github.com/arsulegai">Arun S M</a>, Walmart*  <a href="https://github.com/yeasy">Baohua Yang</a>, Oracle*  <a href="https://github.com/bobbijn">Bobbi Muscara</a>, Ledger Academy*  <a href="https://github.com/shemnon">Danno Ferrin</a>, ConsenSys*  <a href="https://github.com/denyeart">David Enyeart</a>, IBM*  <a href="https://github.com/mastersingh24">Gari Singh</a>, IBM  <a href="https://github.com/gmhartley53">Grace Hartley</a>, ConsenSys*  <a href="https://github.com/hartm">Hart Montgomery</a>, Fujitsu  <a href="https://github.com/mtnieto">María Teresa Nieto</a>, Telefónica*  <a href="https://github.com/n1zyz">Mark Wagner</a>, Red Hat  <a href="https://github.com/nage">Nathan George</a>, Kiva  <a href="https://github.com/tkuhrt">Tracy Kuhrt</a> (vice chair), Accenture  <a href="https://github.com/troyronda">Troy Ronda</a>, SecureKey

<p>By Jesús Salas, Associate, Responsible Technology</p><p>American consumers are increasingly concerned about privacy and data security when purchasing new products and services, which may be of a competitive advantage to companies that take action towards these consumer values, a new Consumer Reports (CR) study&nbsp;finds.</p><p>The new <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/downloads/CR_PrivacyFrontAndCenter_102020_vf.pdf">study,</a> “Privacy Front and Center: Meeting the Commercial Opportunity to Support Consumers Rights,” from CR’s Digital Lab with support from Omidyar Network, looks at the commercial benefits for companies that differentiate their products based on privacy and data security.</p><p>The report lays out a succinct timeline for the evolution of consumer attitudes toward privacy that culminates with a clear call to action for innovators. Through their comprehensive research methodologies, CR has been able to draw out the nuance around when, why, and how much privacy and security features matter for individuals looking to use and buy security cameras, connected cars, smart speakers, and other products. The report also contextualizes the role that both rule-making through regulation and the supply of better products can have to meet the growing market&nbsp;demand.</p><p>“This study shows that raising the standard for privacy and security is a win-win for consumers and the companies,” said Ben Moskowitz, the director of the Digital Lab at Consumer Reports. “Given the rapid proliferation of internet connected devices, the rise in data breaches and cyber attacks, and the demand from consumers for heightened privacy and security measures, there’s an undeniable business case for companies to invest in creating more private and secure products.”</p><p>Here are some of the key findings from the&nbsp;study:</p>  According to CR’s February 2020 nationally representative survey, 74% of consumers are at least moderately concerned about the privacy of their personal&nbsp;data.  Nearly all Americans (96%) agree that more should be done to ensure that companies protect the privacy of consumers.  A majority of smart product owners (62%) worry about potential loss of privacy when buying them for their home or&nbsp;family.  The privacy and security conscious consumer class seems to include more men and people of&nbsp;color.  Experiencing a data breach correlates with a higher willingness to pay for privacy, and 30% of Americans have experienced one.  Of the Android users who switched to iPhones, 32% indicated doing so because of Apple’s perceived privacy or security benefits relative to&nbsp;Android.  <p>The study draws from a nationally representative CR survey of 5,085 adult U.S. residents conducted in February 2020, a meta-analysis of 25 years of public opinion studies, and a conjoint analysis that seeks to quantify how consumers weigh privacy and security in their hardware and software purchasing decisions.</p><p>Omidyar Network is honored to support this endeavor to both understand and inform the commercial case for investments in security and privacy-enhancing technology. While privacy should not be turned into an out-of-reach luxury, these findings do present an opportunity for companies to be among the first to differentiate and capture market share or leverage consumer’s willingness to pay in the short-term. Over time, we expect many privacy and data security features to become “table stakes,” in which case first movers will innovate and raise standards further.</p><p>Supporting efforts like this is key to our vision of enabling responsible technology that promotes well-being and individual liberty. To accomplish this, we support different levers that drive competition and innovation while safeguarding to manage risks and unintended consequences.</p><p>CR also recently launched an updated and expanded website for the <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/">Digital Standard</a> with Omidyar Network joining as a strategic partner. The Digital Standard is an evolving, open source framework used by independent testing organizations, researchers and product teams to evaluate how technologies respect consumers’ privacy and security interests. It serves as a resource for companies looking to implement and take action on stronger privacy and security, as well as ownership and governance.</p><p>We encourage innovators to leverage and enhance this tool to collectively raise the standard on technology, and grow a culture of responsibility within companies overall.</p>

 Omidyar Network’s Statement on US v. Google, Filed Today by the US Department of&nbsp;Justice <p>Today marks a new chapter in the long history of US enforcement of antitrust law. The filing of this lawsuit is recognition that digital platforms, namely Google, have used illegal and improper means to maintain their dominance.</p><p>Over many years, Google has exercised tremendous control over the marketplace of online search. This complaint makes a strong case for how Google manipulated the online search market by paying billions to secure default positions on browsers and mobile handsets to exclude rivals, by denying interoperability to challengers, and by preferencing its own products and services in search&nbsp;results.</p><p>The DOJ did not sue Google because it has grown large or successful. Rather, the investigation yielded sufficient <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">evidence</a> to show Google has violated US antitrust law — a set of rules that apply to everyone, and are designed to make sure all of us benefit from free markets and fair competition.</p><p>The ideal outcome of this lawsuit is the restoration of competition and safer, more innovative choices for consumers in the online search market. We know that Google’s profit motive influences the content they deliver. Google searches often lead people to Google’s own goods and services, to those who pay Google for our attention, and down rabbit holes of misinformation, hate, and extremism. All of these “results” bolster time spent on the platforms and Google’s revenues. Surely, other search engines, if not excluded from the market, could design algorithms that were safer and more consistent with society’s values.</p><p>Today’s filing is an important first step in enforcing existing laws governing Google’s improper past conduct. But this journey is not over; the legal process could take many years to resolve, and other concerns will need to be addressed. For example, Google also used its online search dominance to develop another illegal monopoly in the digital advertising market. Americans deserve and expect that Google will be held accountable for all of its anti-competitive and otherwise harmful conduct as well as prevented from engaging in similar abuses in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Consumers, competition, our economy, and our democracy have already paid too high a price for what are seen as “free” services. Undoubtedly, Google has provided valuable, innovative services that have become essential to everyone’s lives, creating the foundation for how we live, work, and play. And like other necessities that are embedded in our lives — power, water, cars — technology companies should be held to the highest standards. However, if left <a href="https://omidyar.com/uncheckedpower-the-root-of-big-tech-issues/">unchecked</a>, Google’s practices will continue to create serious consequences for advertisers, publishers, foreclosed technological rivals, and the&nbsp;public.</p><p>To that end, and alongside this case, we call for federal attention toward the ad-tech stack and support for state-level antitrust cases directed at other aspects of Google’s sprawling businesses. Because antitrust action alone will not restore competition to these markets, Congress should also continue to pursue the development of <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3429">new laws and&nbsp;rules</a>.</p>

<p>Electronic, XML-based agreements between trading partners is a key part of the ebXML family of standards developed jointly by OASIS and the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT)</p>

<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Collaboration Protocol Profile and Agreement Version 3.0 from the OASIS ebXML Core (ebCore) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>
<p>Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML) is a family of standards developed through a joint initiative of OASIS and the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). Five of these ebXML standards, including Collaboration Protocol Profile and Agreement, have been approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as the ISO 15000 standard. ebXML provides an open, XML-based infrastructure that enables the global use of electronic business information in an interoperable, secure, and consistent manner by all trading partners.</p>
<p>Collaborative Partner Profile Agreements are XML-based documents specifying a trading agreement between trading partners. Each trading partner will have their own Collaboration Protocol Profile (CPP) document that describes their abilities in an XML format. This can include the messaging protocols they support, or the security capabilities they support. A CPA (Collaboration Protocol Agreement) document is the intersection of two CPP documents, and describes the formal relationship between two parties.</p>
<p>CPPA Version 3.0 (CPPA3) specifies several improvements and innovations since the previous Version 2.0 (CPPA2). A CPPA3 document is much easier to read and to create and update manually or using automated tooling than a corresponding CPPA2 document. The same information can be expressed in a significantly smaller CPPA3 CPA document than in a CPPA2 CPA document.</p>
<p>CPPA3 adds support for AMQP, WebSocket transport and the SFTP subsystem of SSH2, in addition to the HTTP, SMTP, FTP transports already covered in CPPA2. The specification text is complemented by the normative CPPA3 XML schema, the agreement registration Exception XML schema, documentation embedded in those schemas, and sample documents.</p>
<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation. The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>The world of digital identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) is evolving quickly, giving much cause for optimism. Standards are starting to connect and move towards functional interoperability, governed by testable protocols. Most of this work is happening on the level of VCs. However, DIDs and their infrastructure are also starting to converge and mature as an extensible-yet-interoperable technology.</p><p>Adoption by markets, standards bodies and regulators is largely contingent upon provable security and provable interoperability, so these promising developments cannot come soon&nbsp;enough.</p><p>The Digital Identity Foundation (DIF) is very proud to be hosting one particular research and development project that could prove pivotal in this process. It is currently a work item of DIF’s <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>. However, a charter for an autonomous working group will be available for review at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">#IIW31</a> this week (20–22 October 2020) to facilitate broader participation. The project is called KERI and it is a project that could only be developed in the open, for the public good and for the widest, quickest adoption.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@pucelano">Fernando Santander</a> But first, what is&nbsp;KERI? <p>KERI stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. A “key event” is a discrete event in time that involves public/private keypairs, often called blockchain identities or cryptographic identities. These events can be generalized as inceptions (creations), rotations, and signing events: the three kinds of events for which KERI generates and handles receipts. In other words, key events are cryptographic events in the history of an identifier.</p><p>Importantly, everything else a decentralized identifier says, does, or refers to is not a key event. As KERI is deliberately laser-focused on key events only, we can call these other events non-KERI events. The real world consequences of a signature or rotation are out of scope and method-specific to boot. KERI is only interested in the most universal aspect of interactions between keys and cryptographic systems, i.e. the cryptography that allows drastically different DID systems to trust each other’s security guarantees.</p><blockquote>“DID Methods exist to solve a trust issue. This does it in a different way.”</blockquote><blockquote>Charles Cunningham (Jolocom GmbH, Rust development lead for&nbsp;KERI)</blockquote><p>Each key event produces a receipt containing only checkable signatures of key event information. Nothing more. Receipts are threaded into logs tracking the history of each identifier, which is similar to a traceable audit trail of hashes — useful for confirming but not for deducing the underlying key material. These threads are compiled into logs that are shared and replicated according to a consensus algorithm and a logic of trust thresholds that creates a fabric of shared history between&nbsp;nodes.</p> Is KERI a blockchain or a DLT? No. Does it replace blockchains? Also&nbsp;no. <p>The trust fabric created when KERI nodes share and propagate key material records&nbsp;might</p><p>sound redundant to the blockchains where all of today’s DID methods store their key material chronologically. To a degree, this is true: each log containing the history of one key is a “microledger,” like a blockchain with only one participant. Inception and rotation events in all of today’s DID methods are stored in a chronological distributed ledger which can be crawled to create a log of these key events by DID. So, why the redundancy? Why replicate a subset of the blockchain’s capabilities and features in a distinct blockchain-like infrastructure just for key material?</p><p>The answer is simple and manifold: blockchains enable many features outside the scope of KERI. These features bring with them complexity, diversity, scale costs, and trust issues. Within KERI’s scope, however, only some of a blockchain or distributed ledger technology’s (DLT’s) features are necessary. Total ordering and double-spend protection, for instance, are hallmarks of distributed ledgers, but hardly justify the added complexity here.</p>Subset of blockchain/DLT capabilities required by KERI (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf">Dr Sam Smith</a>,&nbsp;2019)<p>Working backwards from a short list of security features, KERI infrastructure can be a much more performant, minimalist distributed ledger system. It is still in the family tree of blockchain, DLTs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but it is closer to a sidechain or a trans-blockchain interoperability mechanism. In use cases where all that is needed is a self-certifying, widely-portable identifier, KERI can stand alone as a lightweight DID method. In combination with a traditional DID Method, KERI can increase key management options and strengthen security guarantees by raising a red flag at the first discrepancy between the two parallel and redundant systems.</p><p>As a scaling mechanism, KERI can also take away some of the traffic and complexity from the underlying blockchain. In implementations where key management and state maintenance (record keeping about keys that rotate over time) are entrusted directly to the KERI mechanism, these functions can be operated much closer to the edge and replicate after a slight delay. This might be a totally acceptable trade-off of efficiency for latency in many use cases. For example, a roundtrip write-and-wait-for-finality transaction on a global blockchain makes no sense in a low-connectivity Internet of things (IoT) use case, where double-spend is a non-issue.</p> KERI is both an interoperability mechanism and a standardization incentive <p>More importantly for the DIF, however, is another major feature of KERI: it could become the foundation of massive interoperability and portability at the infrastructure layer. What’s more, if adopted by enough major players, it could even speed up the standardization process of DIDs themselves. By offering a minimum level of security guarantees shared across all participating methods, it would simplify the security review process for both individual DID methods and for interoperable DIDs as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>By abstracting out the universal, minimal set of key functions, a KERI log that spans multiple ledgers or methods is just as verifiable as one that does not. This means that&nbsp;anywhere</p><p>self-certifying KERI identifiers are accepted, an identifier’s history can stretch back further than the existence of KERI. Plus, that history can include so-called “portability events”, where an identifier is deactivated on one ledger and re-activated on another. Method-specific features or records might still need to be exported and imported. The core proof of control function of a DID, however, would be universalized in a way that enabled massive portability.</p><p>This same universalizing effect of sharing a security vocabulary across all participating DID methods has the added benefit of being able to guarantee certain security features in any KERI-compliant system. Since KERI also lends itself to simple compliance tests, and since KERI logs give a benchmark against which to test method-specific and blockchain-specific security, this is a small leap for each DID method and a giant leap for standardization and security engineering.</p> KERI’s history: from whitepaper to community incubation <p>So far we have been highly technical in our explanation of the project. A careful reader, however, may already have caught the community commitment implicit in phrases such as “KERI-compliant” and “participating DID methods.” KERI is only useful if the major DID methods incorporate it, or if the set of participating DID methods becomes congruous over time with the set of major DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>It is, in a nutshell, a community project of alignment as much as a technological innovation: an agreement on the security model for the common core functionality shared across all DID methods, allowing much variety and extensibility to be preserved by the participating DID methods. Decentralized identifiers have been very decentralized in their design and governance from the beginning, with a high degree of extensibility and flexibility within the fiefdom of each DID method and its governance. KERI has been gathering steam for over a year as a countervailing force, potentially making all DIDs function in an end-verifiable and thus universal way.</p><blockquote>“Investing in KERI is investing in interoperability, standardization, and cross-community security guarantees.”</blockquote><blockquote>Dr Sam Smith, author of the KERI whitepaper and project&nbsp;lead</blockquote><p>In large part, the roots of KERI lie in debates within the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a>. For years it has been discussing the “shalls” and “mays” that define a W3C-compliant DID method (and thus a DID system). In practical terms, this process specifies what each DID method can and must assume about other DID methods for such a decentralized and open system to make appropriate security guarantees.</p><p>KERI’s creator and the author of its whitepaper is Samuel M Smith PhD., a pioneering technologist in multiple fields, including automated reasoning, distributed systems, autonomous vehicles and blockchain protocol design. Dr. Smith has been refining and experimenting with such a cross-method mechanism since 2019, presenting at every meeting of the biannual Internet Identity Workshop. First came some core principles and requirements of a key infrastructure at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/OffChain_(PKI)_Key_Management_%E2%80%93_Revocation_Rotation">IIW28</a>, then at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI:_1_Universal_DKMI_Root(s)_of_Trust_Decentralized_Systems_Primitires_%26_DKMI_Last_Mile_of_Trust">IIW29</a> a series of sessions about different aspects of a hypothetical system of witnesses that could replicate logs. For <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">IIW30</a>, Dr Smith brought more concrete sessions on finer points and even the roadmapping session that became the DIF working group. Along the way, he has iterated an ever-growing <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">whitepaper</a> describing and explaining all of&nbsp;this.</p><p>Now, however, Dr Smith has moved the project into the DIF under the auspices of its <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a> where he sits as co-chair. Asked about the decision, Dr Smith said, “DIF was a natural choice because I wanted the work to happen quickly but in the open, with participation from the greatest number of companies and innovators across various communities.”</p> KERI’s contributors: join&nbsp;us! <p>Foremost among DIF contributors is, of course, Dr Smith, who brings to his KERI design work more than a decade of engineering experience with scale and high-performance systems. Much of this work, focusing largely on AI and streaming/scaling projects, was done through his Python-centric consulting company <a href="http://prosapien.com">Prosapien.com</a>. He has also worked with Consensys, contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/reputage/seedQuest">Seed Quest</a> project among others, soon to be donated to&nbsp;DIF.</p><p>Berlin-based <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom GmbH</a> has been a major interlocutor in the early development of KERI, since before the creation of the working group at DIF. Jolocom’s Charles Cunningham is the working group’s lead Rust developer, who has written a highly interesting post about mental models of <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/how-keri-tackles-the-problem-of-trust/">How KERI tackles the problem of trust</a> from a developer’s point of view for the Jolocom&nbsp;logbook.</p><p>Representing <a href="https://www.spherity.com">Spherity GmbH are the working group’s lead </a>JavaScript developer and note-taker. Spherity’s founder, Carsten Stöcker, has written a detailed piece for his company’s blog which called KERI “<a href="https://medium.com/spherity/introducing-keri-8f50ed1d8ed7">a more performant ledger for trusted identities</a>.”</p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based non-profit, has been co-developing on the Rust side as well, working in parallel and providing input on the design considerations. The Human Colossus Foundation has also put substantial energy into promoting and socializing KERI in the Trust-over-IP Foundation, the MyData community and in the Sovrin community, including featuring an hour-long KERI <a href="https://vimeo.com/459348260">session</a> prominently in a half-day <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/invitation-core-public-utility-technologies-for-a-next-generation-internet">mini-conference</a> it organized.</p><p>At IIW31, the KERI developers will be demonstrating their initial work to date while there is still the opportunity to get involved and determine the course of KERI as the project moves from direct mode (two-party) to witness mode (multi-party, distributed consensus). Many sessions are planned for IIW, ranging from introductions to technical discussions to use-case and requirements gathering for KERI-based ideas. Additionally there will be a live demo of the working direct-mode prototype.</p><p>Introductory reading and video materials are collected at the main DIF <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">repository</a>, but even if you don’t watch them in advance (or fully understand them if you do), there are many ways to get involved and make this community project stronger and more&nbsp;diverse.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/keri-for-every-did-a-microledger-f9457fa80d2d">KERI: For every DID, a microledger</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>OASIS and the OASIS Business Document Exchange (BDXR) TC [1] are pleased to announce that Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) Version 2.0 Committee Specification 02 is now available for public review and comment. The TC members have approved [2] submitting this Committee Specification to the OASIS membership for consideration as a Candidate OASIS Standard, as described in the OASIS TC Process [6]. This is a 60-day public review, after which it may be submitted to a membership-wide call for consent to promote the specification to OASIS Standard. This specification describes a protocol for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner network. In a 4-corner network, entities are exchanging business documents through intermediary gateway services (sometimes called Access Points). To successfully send a business document in a 4-corner network, an entity must be able to discover critical metadata about the recipient of the business document, such as types of documents the recipient is capable of receiving and methods of transport supported. The recipient makes this metadata available to other entities in the network through a Service Metadata Publisher service. This specification describes the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover endpoint information. A client can either be an end-user business application or a gateway/access point in the 4-corner network. This specification also defines the request processing that must happen at the client. The TC has received four Statements of Use from IBM, Philip Helger, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Efact [3]. The candidate specification and related files are available here: Service Metadata Publishing (SMP) Version 2.0 Committee Specification 02 16 January 2020 Editorial source (Authoritative): https://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v2.0/cs02/bdx-smp-v2.0-cs02.docx HTML: https://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v2.0/cs02/bdx-smp-v2.0-cs02.html PDF: https://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v2.0/cs02/bdx-smp-v2.0-cs02.pdf XML schemas: https://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v2.0/cs02/xsd/ and https://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v2.0/cs02/xsdrt/ Model documentation: https://docs.oasis-open.org/bdxr/bdx-smp/v2.0/cs02/mod/ For your convenience, OASIS provides a complete package of the specification document and any related files in ZIP distribution files.

<p>When the ToIP Foundation launched in May 2020, our mission was to define a new model for achieving trust online—a model that breaks away from the thousands of siloed solutions for secure, privacy-enhancing digital identity and trust that do not work with each other. This lack of interoperability costs billions of dollars per year in complicated and time-consuming integration and hinders adoption by the very customers we are trying to serve.</p>



<p>Our goal is to drive adoption of a new model for digital trust based on open standard digital wallets and digital credentials that are every bit as interoperable as the physical wallets and paper or plastic credentials that we use every day—to do everything from getting on a plane to entering a hospital to signing a mortgage. As these new tools emerge as the primary mechanism for contactless identity verification, payments, and other online transactions, they will become as essential to our digital lives as browsers and email clients have become to the Web today.</p>



<p>As that happens, it is critical to avoid recreating the vendor-lock in and fragmentation of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars</a>” that hindered the early days of the Web. Interoperable solutions that avoid vendor lock-in are paramount for a vibrant digital marketplace where consumers are free to choose their preferred digital wallet software from a variety of vendors and use digital credentials from any issuer as they choose.</p>



<p>The need for market-driven interoperability</p>



<p>Open standards alone do not produce interoperable market solutions—there are too many ways interoperability can still go off the rails. Testing labs are another step in the right direction—but vendors need incentives to use them, and those incentives can be scarce in a new market.</p>



<p>The ToIP Foundation recognized that, as our economy grows increasingly digital and collaboration tools grow steadily more powerful, there is a new path to interoperability: tapping market dynamics to drive incubation and adoption of truly interoperable solutions.</p>



<p>With this approach, vendors and customers voluntarily work together to develop interoperability testing requirements designed to meet explicit customer needs in the market. Vendors then satisfy those requirements by passing these interoperability tests with production-ready software.</p>



<p>Introducing the ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</p>



<p>To facilitate this new approach to market-driven interoperability, the Technology Stack Working Group of the ToIP Foundation developed the <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/technical-stack-wg/blob/master/TIP_LIFECYCLE_MANAGEMENT.md">ToIP Interoperability Profile (TIP)</a>. A TIP represents a specific combination of technologies that span each of the four layers of the ToIP technology stack in order to meet the requirements of a set of target customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>TIPs can be designed, refined and supported by multiple vendors and customers wishing to collaborate on interoperability. A TIP typically includes the following elements critical to customer success:</p>



  Use cases capturing the specific requirements of customers in one or more digital trust ecosystems.  Design principles that must be clearly defined when combining technology and business policies to formulate a solution architecture.&nbsp;  Documentation that clearly communicates the design, architecture, features, and benefits of a TIP to the digital trust ecosystems targeted for adoption.  Best practices and implementation guidance for adoption of a TIP, including how to incorporate policies from the ToIP governance stack.  Interoperability tests that enable vendors supporting the TIP to be certified for verifiable interoperability.  Adoption metrics and case study references that provide quantifiable evidence of the real market impact.  



<p>TIPs harness market forces to drive convergence on interoperability</p>



<p>Each TIP consists of two types of components:</p>



  Fully-standardized components of the ToIP stack. These components, called ToIP Standard Specifications (TSS), are standards that have already gained Foundation-wide approval.&nbsp;  Custom components that are specific to a TIP. Some places in the ToIP stack do not yet have agreed-upon specifications. For these gaps, a TIP must specify how it fills the gap via an open community specification that can be implemented by any vendor or open source project.  



<p>A conceptual “lego block” picture of a complete four-layer TIP—showing how it is constructed from a combination of standard TSS components and custom TIP-specific components—is shown in the figure below.</p>



  



<p>Launching the Saturn-V TIP</p>



<p>The first TIP published by the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group is named for the historically significant multi-stage rocket platform, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V">Saturn-V</a>. This TIP emerged from work begun at a 2019 Connect-a-Thon event held by the Hyperledger Indy community. When the ToIP Foundation was launched in May 2020, ToIP members including Commerzbank (Main-Incubator), esatus AG, Evernym, IBM, Trinsic and idRamp recognized the opportunity to coalesce their collaboration into a TIP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the ToIP Technology Stack Working Group was formed, it established the criteria for managing the lifecycle of TIP from incubation through design, demonstration, acceptance and adoption. The Saturn-V collaborators then proposed their TIP following this process and it was formally accepted as a Draft Deliverable by the Technology Stack Working Group at their 24 August 2020 meeting.</p>



<p>The next stage: mission-critical collaboration on interoperability testing</p>



<p>All the vendors participating in the Saturn-V TIP actively pair with developers from other participants to work through agreed-upon test plans. Having the Technology Stack Working Group oversee the TIP development life cycle on behalf of all participating vendors ensures a more transparent and robust joint testing project than a typical multi-vendor “plug-fest”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the technologies used for the Saturn-V TIP are Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries at<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack/img/fig-1-toip-full-stack-2020-05-06.png?raw=true"> layers 1-3 of the ToIP Technology Stack</a>, the open source Aries Test suites will be used as the baseline for all test plans. Participating vendors are currently tackling the following stages of the Saturn-V Interop Test Plan One:</p>



  Self-Validation against Aries Protocol Test Suite for Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0  Peer-Validation
 
 Core Aries Interop Profile v. 1.0 (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries RFC 302</a>), which supports DID connections, issuing credentials, and fulfilling proofs 
 Connectionless Proofs using the Service Decorator (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0056-service-decorator">Aries RFC 56</a>), 
 HTTP over DIDComm (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0348-transition-msg-type-to-https">Aries RFC 348</a>). 
 
  



<p>Future missions</p>



<p>Once Test Plan One is complete, TIP Participants will define Saturn-V Interop Test Plan Two which intends to minimally include peer-to-peer validation for:</p>



  Core Aries Interop Profile v. 2.0 (content and scope not yet defined by community)  Out-of-Band Protocol (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0434-outofband">Aries RFC 434</a>)  <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">End-to-End testing the Aries Agent Test Harness</a> (contributed by the Government of British Columbia)  



<p>Once these stages of interoperability testing are completed, the Technology Stack Working Group will be able to assess whether component specifications of this TIP meets the criteria to become a TSS. If so, these will be advanced to become their own Draft Deliverables for ultimate approval by the Working Group and then the ToIP Steering Committee.</p>

<p>By Sarah Drinkwater, Director, Responsible Technology</p><p>Today our grantee, WaitWhat, launched the second season of <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">Should This Exist?</a>, which earlier this year was nominated by the prestigious Webby Awards for best tech podcast in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>We put Should this Exist? on the “must listen” list! It stretches your understanding about radically new technology and its implications on our lives — both the promising and perilous. The storytelling is riveting, the topics are supremely well chosen, and the show’s host — Internet serial entrepreneur and investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterina_Fake">Caterina Fake</a> — masterfully guides listeners on unforgettable journeys alongside the inventors of our times. In each episode, Caterina engages with a groundbreaking technology — from contact tracing, to a robot caregiving, to deepfake video production — to ask the important questions. The show surrounds you with ideas and interpretations, but ultimately leaves it to you to decide if the tech should exist, and how it&nbsp;should.</p><p>We’re excited to support this show because the world is hungry for this kind of conversation, as we’ve seen with interest in <a href="https://ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer</a> and in Netflix’s recent The Social Dilemma. We want to imagine and guide technology to its greatest potential and help technologists navigate around unintended consequences that are so hard to anticipate.</p><p>After you subscribe <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">here</a> to the podcast, you might want to sign up to the <a href="http://eepurl.com/gnZTf9">weekly newsletter</a>.</p><p>Here’s a <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">custom link</a> to today’s show if you’d like to share, and below, you can read more about our first three episodes.</p><p>LISTEN: <a href="http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar">http://listen.shouldthisexist.com/Omidyar</a></p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 14:<br>The deepfake detective<br>Chances are, you’ve seen a “deepfake” video. But did you know it? A new breed of tech detectives are building tools to spot these hyper-realistic videos — built with AI — where people say things they didn’t say or do things they’d never do. Some of these clips are just good, fanciful fun. But a deepfake deployed at the right moment could sway an election, or wreck a life. That’s why UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid is working on a “deepfake detective” — a tool to help media outlets know what’s real and what isn’t. But the same program could also give deepfakers a blueprint for how to make their work undetectable. Deepfake technology already exists.

But can it defeat the disease without spying on people who might carry it? MIT’s Kevin Esvelt has a bold idea: Let’s try a new form of contact tracing that could more than double the program’s impact. Bi-directional tracing looks both forward and backward from a known transmission, building a chart of the “undiscovered branches of the viral family tree” and identifying potential spreaders other systems can’t see. But how much of our data are we willing to give the government, even if it’s to fight Covid-19?</p><p>Premieres Wednesday, October 21:<br>Grandma, here’s your robot<br>Is it the loneliest idea you’ve ever heard? Or an ingenious hack that helps human caregivers be more attentive and empathetic? You might have these questions when you meet the robot caregivers who roam the halls at retirement homes, doing basic tasks for residents and keeping them connected. Is elder care something we want a robot to do? Roboticist Conor McGinn from Trinity College Dublin actually moved into a retirement home in Washington, DC, to gain a deeper understanding of what residents might want from a robot. The answer surprised him, and it prompts deeper questions: As humans, what responsibility do we have toward our elders? When we fail them, should robots close the gap? And is that the future we want for ourselves?</p>

 Lumen — The Year in&nbsp;Review  September 2019-August 2020 <p>By: Adam Holland, Andromeda Yelton, and Chris&nbsp;Bavitz</p> Introduction <p>September 2019 through the end of August 2020 marked the first year in which Lumen operated with a generous supporting grant from the Arcadia Fund. During that year, the project’s primary objectives fell within three themes: (1) technical improvements to the Lumen site and database; (2) expanding research opportunities, both internal and external; and (3) outreach, both to possible new notice-submitters and to the various constituencies of the Lumen user community. This post draws from Lumen’s first annual report to Arcadia and provides an overview of the project’s key activities during the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>To say the least, it was a complex and difficult year on a number of fronts — most notably, because of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced us into a remote work mode for much of 2020. That said, we were able to make significant progress on a number of key&nbsp;fronts:</p>  Lumen’s developers and technical support team achieved a great deal, especially on the backend of the site, and also by adding new user interface features and new notice categories.  Lumen had success increasing and improving external research using Lumen’s database, with database access credentials granted to 49 new researchers or research teams, ranging from college undergraduates and investigative reporters to law professors and economists. Several of these researchers produced substantive written work along with various other shorter articles and&nbsp;pieces.  Regarding outreach, we had conversations with a range of organizations, online service providers and individuals regarding working more closely with Lumen. The Lumen team participated in a multi-stakeholder virtual workshop in June of 2020, with more topic-specific workshops planned.  The onset of the pandemic put a wrench in the works in terms of hiring, but Lumen plans to bring onboard a new research fellow in the coming&nbsp;months.  <p>The remainder of this overview addresses and provides more details on these main themes in the order outlined&nbsp;above.</p> (1) Technical Improvements and&nbsp;Progress <p>In addition to too many small-scale bug fixes and one-off requests to name, the Lumen developers’ activity in the first year fell into several key main categories:</p> Security/anti-obsolescence updates   Lumen upgraded Rails (the web application framework the whole system uses) from version 4.2 to version&nbsp;5.2.  Lumen upgraded Ruby (the programming language in which Lumen’s site and administrative interface is built) from version 2.3 to version&nbsp;2.5.  Lumen upgraded various software libraries.  Lumen is in the process of upgrading its native search function from ElasticSearch version 5 to ElasticSearch version 7, which is expected to significantly improve the ability of researchers and others to access notices in the database.  <p>In combination, these upgrades and improvements improved system security and system performance, making the database notably faster for users. Additionally, the various improvements keep the site effectively modernized, which in turn allows developers to take advantage of and implement further improvements without too much work. Finally, the ongoing ElasticSearch upgrades allow Lumen administrators to more quickly and effectively redact sensitive data in Lumen’s notices (in addition to making site search functionality more powerful for&nbsp;users).</p><p>Overall, these technical improvements make the Lumen site easier to use by and more responsive to both its internal team and the research community. They also serve to “future-proof” the site to the extent possible, making it far more likely that Lumen will be able to continue to exist and thrive indefinitely, and making continued and sustained improvements easier to accomplish.</p> Improvements to the Lumen administrative interface   Lumen updated rails_admin from version 1.4 to version 2. As an example of modernization making more modernization easier and possible, this upgrade was only possible because of the underlying Ruby upgrade mentioned above.  Lumen added a Content Management System (CMS) to the site and migrated all the old blog posts and pages into it. The CMS will also make it much easier for the Lumen team to share out rich multimedia content on the Lumen website and write short pieces more rapidly and effectively. Some recent blog posts made using the CMS include a write-up of Lumen’s <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/lumen-best-practices-event">workshop on best practices in notice and takedown transparency</a>, <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/background-audio-takedowns">“Algorithmic Copyright Management: Background Audio, False Positives and De facto Censorship</a>” and “<a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/plandemic_DMCAs">Pandemic Misinformation Campaign Comes to&nbsp;Lumen.”</a>   Improvements to receiving and sharing notice&nbsp;data   A series of improvements to the Lumen application programming interface (“API”) improved the quality of data that the database is able to accept and process, most notably with respect to URLs submitted. Some URLs are malformed when submitted, and API improvements dramatically reduced the error rate upon submission.  Prompted by a series of distributed denial of service attacks on the Lumen site, Andromeda Yelton, the lead developer for Lumen, spent a great deal of time and effort putting into place, documenting, and continuing to improve on a series of changes and improvements for managing the requests for data that Lumen receives through its API, which represent a potential vulnerability for the site and database. These changes improved Lumen’s data security, made it easier for legitimate researchers to continue to use the site, and helped better allocate site and system resources. Andromeda later gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NvKfTSr7eU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330">a presentation</a> about her work at Code4Lib.  Lumen added “Counterfeit” and “Placeholder” notice types. Google began accepting takedown notices referencing the presence of counterfeit goods or advertisements for them on Google sites, and in order to accommodate this new notices stream, we created a new template for such notices. Having this new type available also made it possible for the Lumen team to effectively reach out to new possible submitters, including Amazon and eBay. The “placeholder” notice is another new type that allows Lumen to accept more notice streams. Some large OSPs, like Google, receive takedown requests about which they are unable to share the details for legal reasons. Despite this, they still wish to indicate that they have received a request. In those cases, they can point their users to a “placeholder” notice that provides what details are available.   User Interface <p>Lumen made a series of changes regarding how visitors to the site see the URLs that are part of each notice. The changes make it possible for Lumen to present notice URLs in a truncated form to casual Lumen visitors, while still granting access to complete URLs to Lumen accredited researchers. Casual Lumen users can view one notice’s full set of URLs by providing an email address. Researchers with credentials can be granted access to notices within a limited time frame, up to a maximum specific number of notices, and with or without use of the Lumen API, and can also be given the ability to generate “permanent” versions of Lumen notice URLs that are suitable for use in published works or for citation.</p> (2) Research Using the Lumen&nbsp;Database <p>Lumen granted research credentials to forty-nine different researchers during the year in question. These researchers range from college undergraduates who have recently become interested in copyright law or censorship, to international researchers from a wide range of countries, including Brazil, Turkey, Ukraine, France, India, Austria, Russia, Germany, and the UK, as well as EU-affiliated researchers and international NGOs such as the Committee to Protect Journalists, as well as law professors and journalists and others in the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>Many of the projects that these researchers are working on are still ongoing, such as Professor Eugene Volokh’s ongoing series of law journal articles about falsified court orders and online defamation law. Some of the completed research projects&nbsp;include:</p>  Asher-Schapiro, Avi, Zidan, Ahmed. “India Uses Opaque Legal Process to Suppress Kashmiri Journalism, Commentary on Twitter,” Committee to Protect Journalists (blog), October 24, 2019, <a href="https://cpj.org/2019/10/india-opaque-legal-process-suppress-kashmir-twitter/.">https://cpj.org/2019/10/india-opaque-legal-process-suppress-kashmir-twitter/.</a>  Fuller, Andrea, Grind, Kirsten, Palazzolo, Joe. “Google Hides News, Tricked by Fake Claims,” Wall Street Journal, May 15, 2020, sec.

Preliminary Results from a Natural Experiment. <a href="https://osf.io/nc7e2/">https://osf.io/nc7e2/</a>  <p>There are also many shorter articles online referencing or relying on Lumen, such as <a href="https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/twitter-barely-replied-indian-information-requests">this one</a>, from the Sunday Guardian Live, or <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/movie-tv-show-database-bombards-google-with-bizarre-takedown-notices-200126/">this one </a>from TorrentFreak.</p><p>Over the summer of 2020, the Lumen team also worked closely with a Harvard Law School student research assistant to begin developing a taxonomy of takedown notices, their underlying data, and the various involved stakeholders. This draft taxonomy seeks to cast light on the range of interests and incentives that a given stakeholder in the notice and takedown (“N&amp;TD”) ecosystem must balance with respect to whether a particular piece of information should come down and the degree to which there should be transparency regarding the request and any subsequent action taken. It is the Lumen team’s hope to soon turn this working draft into a white paper, as well as the raw material for a Lumen workshop, as well as use it to inform discussions on any statement of best practices regarding N&amp;TD transparency.</p> (3) Outreach  Events <p>The Lumen team’s original plan had been to hold a fairly intimate in-person workshop over the course of two days, as a way of initiating conversation between the various parts of Lumen’s user and research communities, and to plant the seed for more detailed and targeted workshops to come. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic got in the way of those plans, and as a result, the June workshop was held virtually. Although the Lumen team members were of course very disappointed to not be able to have the full in-depth workshop we had planned, especially the face-to-face network building and conversations, hosting a virtual event had some positive aspects. These included lower costs and the possibility of drawing more participants. The end result was that we were able to diversify and expand the initial invitee list substantially, including a wider range of interested parties, and — critically — giving the group more international representation. On that note, it meant that some foreign human rights activists who would otherwise not have been able to attend were present — including representatives of EngelliWeb, which has published a human rights report on Turkish takedowns that relies heavily on Lumen. The most recent of EngelliWeb’s reports can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://engelliweb.ifade.org.tr/">here</a>.</p><p>Using the lessons learned from this first virtual event, and anticipating that virtual events will be the norm for the foreseeable future, Lumen has planned a series of smaller and more topically focused events for the coming fall and winter, the first few of which will be focused on learning more from current and prospective Lumen researchers.</p> Outreach to New Sources of Notices and Notice&nbsp;Data <p>Encouraging recipients and senders of takedown notices to share copies of those notices with Lumen has proven to be one of the biggest challenges the team has faced. Although Lumen’s name recognition has clearly improved, due in no small part to the increased publicity from outside journalism and research publications, and although those companies with whom Lumen has existing relationships are generally positive about the benefits of sharing, some institutions are still loathe to share notices and notice data. Finding ways to be more effective at turning preliminary outreach into new data-sharing arrangements will be a top priority for the Lumen team in the coming&nbsp;year.</p> General Outreach and Media Participation <p>In addition to the June 2020 workshop mentioned above, and their ongoing work with Lumen researchers, members of the Lumen team participated in the following activities:</p>  Prompted by the increased attention paid to the Internet Archive after it announced its pandemic-motivated National Emergency Library, Adam Holland wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-internet-archives-new-national-emergency-library-generates-a-range-of-strong-reactions-10afc5d2abf7">Medium piece </a>examining the various points of view on the library, and urging the NEL to share any takedown notices it received with&nbsp;Lumen.  Lumen provided some statistics on Google takedowns to TorrentFreak for an&nbsp;article.  Lumen provided statistics on takedowns to Professor Rebecca Tushnet for her testimony to the<a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/the-digital-millennium-copyright-act-at-22-what-is-it-why-it-was-enacted-and-where-are-we-now"> Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the&nbsp;DMCA</a>.  Lumen Project Manager Adam Holland answered some questions from a cyberlaw professor about Google’s search index and robots.txt pertinent to the way in which the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) operates its publicly-accessible database of FL residents who have been previously convicted of various sex offenses.  As noted above, Andromeda Yelton gave<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NvKfTSr7eU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NvKfTSr7eU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=330"> a presentation on her work</a> defending Lumen against a Russian botnet to Code4Lib.  Adam spoke with a member of the data team of<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__thecorrespondent.com_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=SnvO2m0td3laYhZMLUgVrywBmVR2OC98yFxqHcbtCUM&amp;m=zxgR2e7-pX4UOhXaaySwWtN_jtXNWaknIZmgNpXreio&amp;s=jK3FtWysUuFhvb0EKv_Xg2232Wm5B2A8mtMF6Ta7gpE&amp;e="> The Correspondent</a>, a newsroom based in Amsterdam.  Adam provided general commentary regarding the DMCA and United States fair use law to Daniel Laufer, a German reporter interested in how a German company, Acromax Media, may be abusing the DMCA to take down critical reporting in Albania, and was <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/a-german-company-is-responsible-for-the-deletion-of-videos-critical-of-the-albanian-government/">quoted in the ensuing&nbsp;article.</a>  · Adam spoke to a New York Times reporter to give background information about DMCA takedowns for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/business/omegaverse-erotica-copyright.html">an article about a lawsuit</a> between two self-published Amazon&nbsp;authors.  Adam spoke with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/online-reputation-management-cbs-news-investigation-finds-fraudulent-court-orders-used-to-change-google-search/">CBS News</a> regarding a story about Professor Volokh’s research.  Adam spoke with the San Antonio Express News for a story posted online<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.expressnews.com_news_education_article_Someone-2Dasked-2DGoogle-2Drepeatedly-2Dto-2Dremove-2D14029141.php&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=NGg7VqmEIvldEdox2XBkRg9frrgwzBAfp51eaMWwbDg&amp;m=fku_iY8E4EEg8g4QAEQscLLAnDjbuYdpY0R00vp71YA&amp;s=1UiSarqNrgKzLfz6_DtvmOOzkdCU9H2lthmiVTF4ab0&amp;e=">&nbsp;here</a>.  Additionally, members of the Lumen team provided background information regarding Lumen, the DMCA and notice &amp; takedown generally to inquiries from journalists, activists, legislative staffers, researchers, and other interested parties.  <p>Of special note, on December 16, 2019, Lumen project manager Adam Holland and Lumen PI Chris Bavitz made comments to the Third Meeting of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Art. 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market in Brussels. Article 17 references “”Use of protected content by online content-sharing service providers.”</p><p>The presentation was well-received, and also was a boost to Lumen’s broader publicity. Lumen was invited to join a multi-stakeholder mailing list regarding ongoing Article 17 discussions, in which it continues to participate, and also made several new EU contacts, including a former member to the EU Parliament, who have kept Lumen apprised of opportunities to contribute comments or thoughts to ongoing copyright and intermediary liability-related legislative and regulatory discussions within the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>A copy of the remarks can be found&nbsp;at:</p><p>Bavitz, Chris, Holland,Adam, “Lumen Presents Comments to the Third Meeting of the Stakeholder Dialogue on Art. 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market in Brussels” (December 17, 2019) <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/807">https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/807</a></p><p>A recording of the day’s proceedings is available at:</p><p>“COPYRIGHT STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUES — Streaming Service of the European Commission,” <a href="https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/copyright-stakeholder-dialogues-16-12.">https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/copyright-stakeholder-dialogues-16-12</a>, (accessed October 8,&nbsp;2020)</p><p>Lumen’s participation begins at approximately the 4:00:00&nbsp;mark.</p> Other outreach&nbsp;efforts <p>The Lumen team has also had productive conversations with a variety of other activists and researchers about possible cooperative efforts, including with Carrie Goldberg, an American lawyer specializing in representing victims of so-called “revenge porn”; the “Disinfodex” project emerging from the Berkman Klein Center’s 2019–2020 Assembly Program; the Digital Public Library of America, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Harvard’s Caselaw Access Project, and the Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society in&nbsp;Berlin.</p> Social Media Statistics <p>Lumen maintains a Twitter account, from which it tweets or retweets about content moderation, takedowns, censorship, academic freedoms, the “right to be forgotten” and other news related to online information. During the period from September 1, 2019 to August 31,&nbsp;2020:</p>  The account added 986 new followers, a ~25%&nbsp;increase  The engagement rate on Lumen’s tweets and retweets went up each quarter, from 0.9% in the first to 2.0 % in the&nbsp;fourth.  Lumen’s tweets received 1.41 million total impressions, and an average of between 20 and 25 link clicks per&nbsp;day.  Lumen’s top mention in terms of engagements (an order of magnitude greater than typical) was when a CNN reporter mentioned Lumen in a tweet referencing a takedown notice sent regarding Donald Trump’s&nbsp;account.   Data and Material&nbsp;Produced <p>During this year, the Lumen database added ~2.6 million more notices, referencing many millions of URLs, involving approximately fifty-eight thousand separate entities. As mentioned above in the technical improvements sections, we put into place our planned changes for displaying URLs in a truncated form to casual Lumen visitors, while granting access to full notices with complete URLs to researchers requesting access. We were and are gratified to have received relatively few complaints from users regarding the change, and none from active researchers. Current policy is to grant a single request per email address to view a notice. Lumen has consistently averaged approximately one thousand such requests per day, but may revisit and revise the bounds of that policy in the coming&nbsp;year.</p><p>During the time period from September 1, 2019 to September 1, 2020, Lumen received almost six hundred thousand unique visitors, who visited Lumen close to fourteen million times, viewing over nineteen million unique Lumen website pages. These traffic numbers represent an approximately 50% increase in activity from the previous year, which the Lumen team attributes to both more research activity and greater use of the site by the public at&nbsp;large.</p><p>The most visited Lumen URL was <a href="http://lumendatabase.org/notices/9415">http://lumendatabase.org/notices/9415</a>, which is a Google placeholder notice for search results that contain URLs reported as illegal under German youth protection laws. There is no way to be certain as to why this notice is visited often, but it may be that this notice’s popularity is a rough proxy for the number of such removals by Google in Germany and the number of searches the internet-using German public performs for the underlying material. Or, it could be the relative novelty of the new laws is driving interest. The second most visited Lumen page, close behind first in terms of total visits, was Lumen’s own search&nbsp;page.</p> Conclusion <p>In the year to come, the Lumen team looks forward to continued progress on all fronts, from expanding the scope, scale and impact of research done with Lumen’s data and gathering new sources of takedown notice data, to improving the Lumen user experience and adding new members to the Lumen team, There will be more events, whether virtual or in person, more publications, and more opportunities to get involved.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/lumen-the-year-in-review-ed6bf4d4be4b">Lumen — The Year in Review:</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A Decade of Digital Public Goods: Holding Up the Digital Economy, Preventing Monopolies, and Safeguarding Freedoms for&nbsp;All <p>By CV Madhukar, Managing Director, Responsible Technology</p>Long lines form with South Africans waiting to receive COVID relief&nbsp;funds.<p>Digital platforms, such as <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/the-open-source-identity-platform-mosip-hits-a-new-milestone-ff9137610bed">digital identity</a> and interoperable <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">payment systems</a>, form the scaffolding that holds up our entire digital economy, improving the delivery of basic services to millions.</p><p>While not visible, this digital architecture has the power to enhance many different aspects of our lives, wherever we live on the globe. Identification enables people to open new bank accounts and access public services like education and health. While interoperable payment systems have the ability to drive down transaction costs for consumers.</p><p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen just how essential digital infrastructure can be. South Korea and Singapore were able to use theirs to track and trace who had contracted the virus — and to whom they had been in close proximity with. India used its digital infrastructure to send more than $200 million in emergency aid directly to more than 340 million citizens in a matter of days. Estonia, meanwhile, used its digital infrastructure to create digital immunity passports, which allow those who have recently tested negative for the novel coronavirus to return to work in person. <br> <br>The problem is that this kind of digital infrastructure is only present in a few countries around the world — which leaves the rest of us to depend on slower, less reliable systems. Even in countries as wealthy as the US, unemployment benefits, which could be paid in seconds via digital infrastructure, can take months to process due to antiquated technology and processes. And when it comes to countries with far fewer resources, especially in Africa, the lack of digital infrastructure can create even bigger impediments to access even basis services. For example, the lack of formal identification is one of the biggest barriers for financial inclusion. And even if governments and philanthropists have every intention of supporting vulnerable people, these will remain mere intentions without a mechanism through which they can get people the resources they need. <br> <br>That’s why Omidyar Network is working to make sure countries have the technical resources to build the digital infrastructure that is powering so much of the developed world — and to do it in a way that is cost-saving, open-sourced, and empowering to local entrepreneurs who will no longer have to be dependent on big technology companies.</p><p>To be clear, digital infrastructure must also be accompanied by rigorous laws and policies to protect individual privacy and prevent harms. Digital infrastructure must be built so people have control over how their data are used, and data privacy must be built-in, not opt-in. It should be seen as a public good that enables private-sector growth, prevents digital monopolies, and safeguards the rights and freedoms of&nbsp;all.</p><p>On September 18, New America organized a virtual event, “<a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/">2030: A Decade of Digital Public Goods for Effective Institutions</a>,” on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Philanthropists, heads of state, government regulators, civil society leaders, and startups gathered to launch a decade of work to develop digital goods for the public sector. Several speakers pointed to the shortage of public investment in building such infrastructure.</p><p>We urgently need philanthropists to not only bring development assistance to the countries that need it, but to also invest in the infrastructure that makes it possible to get there. We need governments to own this agenda and build tech so the management of large-scale, digital infrastructure lies within the country’s elected institutions. And in an era where data has become a key factor of economic development, we need to focus on empowering individuals with agency, thereby generating the greatest benefit to the&nbsp;people.</p><p>That’s not to say the private sector won’t reap any rewards from these investments, on the contrary. In the same way companies benefit from public works like roads, bridges, and tunnels, they will also be able to innovate on top of this foundational layer of digital infrastructure — and reach customers they never could have found otherwise. Likewise, this technology will be able to multiply returns on philanthropic investments by exponentially expanding the universe for people across the world. <br> <br>Put simply, digital infrastructure is a first-mile necessity for an equitable digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>This could have a positive, transformative impact on the global economy and global development. But it’s going to take all of us to install safe and inclusive, digital infrastructure all over the world. If we make this kind of investment, we can begin to build a world where gaps in technology never limit the programs governments can implement, the progress they can make, or anything people do to improve their own&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Watch the full <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/events/un-general-assembly-2020/">event recording</a> online to hear how others in the conversation proposed advancing the #DigitalDecade to support public institutions.</p>

<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that OSLC Core v3.0, OSLC Query v3.0, OSLC Requirements Management v2.1, and OSLC Change Management v3.0 from the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration Open Project [1] have been approved as an OASIS Project Specifications. These join the previously announced OSLC Quality Management v2.1 as the first approved Project Specifications from the Open Projects program. Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle is very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across a product’s entire application and product lifecycle. OSLC Core defines the overall approach to Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration based specifications and capabilities that extend and complement the W3C Linked Data Platform. OSLC Query provides a mechanism for a client to search for RDF resources that match a given criteria. OSLC Requirements Management support key RESTful web service interfaces for the management of Requirements, Requirements Collections and supporting resources defined in OSLC Core. OSLC Change Management defines a RESTful web services interface for the management of product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources. These Project Specifications are OASIS deliverables, completed and approved by the OP’s Project Governing Board and fully ready for testing and implementation. The applicable open source licenses can be found in the project’s administrative repository at https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/LICENSE.md The specifications and related files are available at: * OSLC Core Version 3.0 Project Specification 01 17 September 2020 – OSLC Core Version 3.0.

<p>
</p><p>The 8-month Business-oriented Programme offers business and technical support to integrate SSI technology with market propositions and it’s structured in 3 competitive stages (only the best performing projects in each phase are entering the next).</p>
<p>The initial stage, which expanded for the first month, was intended for the teams to work in the Proof of concept of their projects and to start building their business case. They both presented the outcomes of their work during business pitches and technology demonstrations in the online Hackathon which took part on September 16th&nbsp;and 17th. All the 19 projects who took part in this first stage, including those by <a href="https://www.filancore.com/">Filancore</a>, <a href="https://www.wellbeingcart.com/">Wellbeing cart</a>, <a href="https://www.mydata.org/">MyData Global</a> and <a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, will receive € 15,000 funding to reward their efforts.</p>
<p>During the second stage, which already is ongoing, the 15 selected teams will work during the next 5 months on their developments to create a mock-up and a Prototype and on their business models and will cooperate among them to create a real ecosystem ensuring interoperability and scalability. Funding linked to the participation in this stage is € 50,000.</p>
<p>Only the best-in-class teams from those will reach the third stage and focus on testing their MVPs and defining Business models to get a final funding of € 41,000.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Are you curious about which ones will be those completing the programme?

    Hi friends,<br>  <br>  If you're interested in getting involved in the Global Privacy Control Spec, you can join the W3C Privacy CG <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/">https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/</a>, and participate in the GPC discussion here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10">https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10</a>&nbsp;<br>  <br>  I sent my concerns to the Certification WG last week so won't repeat them all here.&nbsp;<br>  <br>  My main problem with the spec is that it is functionally an opt out--meaning that the individual must take an action to deliberately opt out of selling data.&nbsp; Once again, the burden is put on the individual.<br>  <br>  A central thesis in CCPA and the folks drafting the spec seems to be that "Privacy by default is great but has even more legal teeth with this preference chosen explicitly." [quote from issue in github by Henry Lou]<br>  <br>  Richard and I discussed this a bit earlier in the year, and I'm still confused about the legal foundation for this assertion, and why it's being framed like this.&nbsp; Wouldn't Privacy by default be kinder, and more respectful? Better?&nbsp;<br>  <br>  In any case, I highly encourage you to get involved directly in the work.&nbsp; (Because there's a lot of interesting stuff happening in the Privacy CG.)<br>  <br>  Lisa  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>

<p>What standards are and what it means to make them&nbsp;openly</p><p>I<a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">n our last post</a> in the series, we drilled down into a granular definition of “open-source” development and the thinking that goes into a choice of license. In this post, we drill down into what “standards” are, and the characteristics of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. In the next post in the series, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jimquenzer">Jim&nbsp;Quenzer</a><p>It is worth noting up front that the term standard has two slightly different usages. One is related to quality assurance or business process compliance — think of marketing that references “the highest standards of _____ ”. This refers to specifications and metrics used to grade outputs in a regulated industry or sector, like “Grade A Beef”. These are set and enforced by some combination of regulators, private-sector auditors and industry associations. Outside of software, this is usually what people refer to by “standardization:” and a specialist in any industry can wax eloquent on the politics and the consequences of decisions by standards bodies fixing those specifications and&nbsp;metrics.</p><p>In software and other IP-driven industries like medicine or engineering, standards have more to do with control and portability of data, enforcing measurable compatibility with the products of others. A common metaphor for this kind of standardization is the width or “gauge” of railway tracks — how far apart the rails are is a somewhat arbitrary decision but if they are different between two countries or regions they will have completely distinct rail systems. Software standards work much the same way, and for this reason standardization is often a prerequisite of procurements from government or substantial investments in the private sector. No one wants to invest in locomotives if all the places they want to take it… use different rails.</p><p>In the software world, as in the world of trains, standards define a given market for products and services. Compliance tests make objective (and far less controversial) the question of whether or not a given product meets a given set of requirements. Explicitly-defined, testable protocols make products provably swappable and/or interoperable. Open standards processes try to define those tests and protocols in the open, with input from initial and future contenders in that market, speeding up the timeline to legitimacy by incorporating major players and incorporating widely-sourced input.</p> Standards processes, as inherited from tangible industries <p>One way to explain standards processes is to begin with some examples in the physical world, which we learned about as matters of fact in our education. These evolved to support the creation of precise manufacturing methods and to support more seamless commerce, giving stability and safety to commodity markets. Weights and measures are classic standards that support for both: after all, there is nothing natural about our units of measure or currencies, as anyone who’s used both metric and non-metric measures knows all too well. How long is something? How heavy is something? How much liquid is in a gallon or&nbsp;liter?</p><p>Standardizing these kinds of measures was a quantum leap for commerce and mercantilism: it gave everyone a common reference point and enabled accounting systems (and “ledgers”) of vastly wider scope and simplicity. The fact that standards have been decided at the international level means it can happen on a global scale. The metric system, for example, is defined by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, an international standards development organization (<a href="http://unicode.org/faq/sdos.html">SDO</a>). There is little debate in 2020 about what a gram is (it’s the weight of one milli-liter of water), but things like tolerance or accuracy in weighing and marking system is still an ongoing matter of debate and specification carried out&nbsp;there.</p><p>Another physical world standard is the <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691170817/the-box">shipping container</a>. A whole global infrastructure has been built around this standard-sized container that allows it to be put on truck beds, shipped on train cars and put in ships that go around the world. It also means if you can fit whatever your thing is inside that box it can get to almost anywhere in the world because there is a standards based infrastructure that can handle it. Massive economies of scale (which have terraformed geopolitics by enabling high-throughput, high-efficiency global trade networks) are unlocked by this kind of standard, which enables the movement of containers (in most cases with no knowledge, or no direct knowledge, of what is inside them) to become a kind of commodity whose price stabilizes and steadies far-flung trade. The analogy to the “packets” or “data points” of modern information technology has been a mainstay of thinking about software business models for decades, and W3C Verifiable Credentials are <a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/like-shipping-containers-verifiable-credentials-will-economically-transform-the-world-fece2b9da14a">no exception</a>.</p><p>Similar standards also govern the electricity coming out of the walls in our houses, which has become so reliable and ubiquitous over the last century that few people outside of the relevant industries think much about it, or how dangerous it would be if standards were loosened. The “amount” (load and speed) of electricity, as well as the physical form factor of plugs, wiring, and circuit boards are all standardized at the national or regional level. This creates regional economies of scale in both the delivery of energy as a resource and in the manufacturing of electricity-powered products. Indeed, much of software engineering as an academic discipline and a labor market, as well as many standards around data and their governing standards bodies, evolved out of the electrical and communications infrastructure that preceded the advent of modern software.</p> Standards processes, for bits and&nbsp;bytes <p>Digital technology also needs explicit and testable standards, deliberated by specialists and engineers in a transparent process for the common good and for the stability of huge systems of capital and human effort. As the internet has evolved, the bulk of this effort has focused on the definition of common protocols that allow information to be exchanged by different computer systems, potentially written in very different languages and operating across very different topographies, with very different inputs and automations and governance structures.</p><p>The protocols that make up the modern internet were originally created by the group that began building the ARPA network. In 1986 the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Forcehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a>) formed and it is still the steward of many key protocols that form the basis of much of the internet, particularly around security and load-balancing at massive, infrastructure scale. The <a href="http://w3c.org/">Worldwide Web Consortium</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a>) was formed in 1994 and works to develop the software standards for the World Wide Web’s core technologies: browsers and&nbsp;servers.</p><p>One example we all use every day is E-mail, or as it was once known, “electronic mail”. How addressing and discovery can work, the limits and parameters of a universally-recognizable address, etc are all written up in authoritative specification documents. Colloquially, these documents are often referred to as “the standard,” or “the RFCs” (“Request[s] for Comment” referring to the collective editorial process by which standards are written). Email is typical, however, in that a patchwork of multiple interlocking protocols are actually required to send and receive&nbsp;emails.</p><p>Although this list of protocols needs to move slowly to give the end-consumer stability and assurance, the list is actually in a state of permanent minor flux, as individual protocols are iterated and upgrades, support for older versions fades away, and now protocols are added that take advantage of security or performance enhancements reaching critical mass elsewhere. For decades, the dominant protocols in email have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol">Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</a>, and underlying handshake/transport protocols like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>. As you can see clicking any of these links, the “standard” (current best practices and specifications) are compromised of a patchwork of iterating and component specifications with a more narrow scope, allowing for a kind of modular and incremental evolution allowing markets and applications to phase components and subsystems in and out over time without interruptions to service or sudden changes in user experience.</p><p>Another example we use every day is “web standards,” i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>. These protocols are the standards that let any web server present information according to prescriptive formats which will be displayed in roughly the same way by any compliant web browser. Here, as in weights and measures, or electricity, there are always slippages and margins for error, though, as any front-end developer can tell you) This enables a diversity of web servers and a diversity of browsers. There are of course open source examples of each (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache Server </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox Browsers</a> being two examples) but there are also proprietary versions of them as&nbsp;well.</p><p>To many observers, the degree of openness in the codebase matters less than the diversity and complexity of organizations involved in the governance of the protocols: in this regard, control of “browser standards” might be endangered by increasing market power on the part of browser vendors owned by private entities that also have outsized and direct control over operating systems and app store platforms, upon which any competing browser would depend directly. Neither open source nor open standards are a guarantee of a healthy and open market, although both generally contribute to that&nbsp;end.</p> Standards and Proto-standards <p>Standards development is generally a slow process taking years, driven by a balance between (rough) consensus between stakeholders refining and iterating requirements and running code against which these requirements can be measured or considered. Depending on the context, stakeholders can include vendors or commercial actors, regulators, consumer advocacy groups, affected industries, and/or individuals. The terms “running” and “code” both cover a lot of territory, but it would be impossible to arrive at a standard without at least two independent, functioning pieces of code that have been tested, audited, and hardened, ideally by some deployment at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>In some cases, this is where an open standards process begins: two maximally independent implementations decide to cooperate for greater adoption and maturity, and seek out a venue for the relevant stakeholders to debate the merits and trade-offs of their current codebases and future variations or possibilities. Different standards bodies can be more or less public in their processes, more or less transparent in their results, and more or less complex in their rules of engagement: indeed, some operate according to a rulebook as complex as that of a parliament, and a style guide as exacting as an academic institution.</p><p>For the most open of standards, however, it is possible to work in the open, deliberatively and transparently, long before this “first” step. Working in an industry group, trade association, or other neutral venue can speed up the work towards a standards by front-loading the collaboration, peer-review, market-testing, and process legitimacy needed to get an idea ready for the market and standardization sooner. These “pre-standards” venues are like containers where all those participating have signed an IPR agreement up front that means their work is unencumbered by patents or royalties and safe from being front-run or patent-trolled.</p><p>The products of these pre-standards processes are often called “pre-standard specifications” or “proto-standards” (if they are more ambitious and protocol-shaped). Groups that develop proto-standards often have explicitly-defined processes for how to publish a proto-standard, as well as when and how to hand off a sufficiently matured proto-standard to an SDO process for more formal and authoritative standardization.</p><p>We should not overstate the distinction between standards and pre-standards, however: there are many shares of grey in between. “Standards-track” and “non-standards-track” specifications alike can be more mature or legitimate depending on the parties involved, the pertinent SDOs (or lack thereof), and of course the process used to create them. For this reason, work items and working groups at the DIF avail themselves of multiple procedural options and tailor their processes to the context, which is why “scoping” and “chartering” processes can take months to hammer out between organizations and their legal departments. This is also specifications developed at DIF without being further hardened in a more formal standards body can sometimes be called “standards,” in the sense that they are adopted in the industry and function as standards. How the market and the relevant industries treat, and trust, and rely on a specification is the ultimate judge of when it can be called the authoritative text for a standard process or procedure!</p><p>In our next drill-down, we’ll go into more detail on DIF’s processes, how you can get involved, and what decisions go into assuming an active role in a working group or work&nbsp;item.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495">Drilling down: Open Standards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>SBI Sumishin Net Bank is an Internet-focused bank jointly established in 2007 by SBI Holdings and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. In keeping with their aim to be recognized for innovation, the bank deployed FIDO Authentication in July 2020. We had an interview with the bank about the details of their deployment.</p>



<p>Q. Describe your service and how it’s using FIDO Authentication.</p>



<p>We have incorporated&nbsp; FIDO-compliant authentication into our&nbsp; existing “SBI Sumishin Net Bank” mobile application. Now, a single application is available to provide both banking and authentication functions to our customers. This eliminates the need for our customers to enter passwords and verification codes for each transaction. Instead, they can simply log in to the SBI Sumishin Net Bank App with biometric authentication. Even when transactions are made from a PC or other non-mobile application environments, the application will confirm and approve the transaction details before they are executed, preventing unauthorized transfers. Furthermore, when using the login approval function, only the registered smartphone can remove any control, which prevents unauthorized logins.</p>



<p>Q. What FIDO specification(s) did you implement?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have deployed a solution based on FIDO UAF, which uses biometrics (fingerprint and facial recognition) and PIN as the authentication methods.</p>



<p>Q. What other approaches did you consider before choosing FIDO?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We looked at continuing with the existing smartphone application “Smart Authentication,” which is a separate application the customer would have to authenticate logins and bank transactions. However, we saw it as difficult to operate two applications separately and saw it as a burden for our customers to have to use two separate applications just to bank with us.</p>



<p>Q. Why did you choose FIDO authentication over other options? What did you identify as advantages of implementing FIDO?</p>



<p>Although there are various types of authentication methods available, the fact that FIDO Authentication is a global standard developed by a global consortium FIDO Alliance, and that we have seen is increasingly being deployed in Japan and globally – were two factors that made it very appealing to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q. Why did you decide on a standards-based approach?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two main reasons why we chose to take a FIDO standards-based approach.</p>



<p>First, FIDO Authentication provides stronger security. FIDO Authentication enables safe exchange of authentication results over the network, and the credential is stored only on the device that performs the authentication (in our case, the smartphone) and does not need to be transmitted over the network or stored on the server side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, FIDO improves convenience for our customers. By incorporating authentication into our existing banking app, we are making it possible to complete both banking and authentication functions in a single app, enabling smooth transactions without having to enter passwords or other information.</p>



<p>Q. What steps were involved in your roll out of FIDO Authentication? Did you work with a partner?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We implemented the FIDO-compliant “SaAT Pokepass Authentication Service” provided by Net Move Corporation (“Net Move”), a wholly owned subsidiary of SBI Sumishin Net Bank. The new authentication function “Smart Authentication NEO” was deployed by incorporating the client SDK for this service into the bank application.</p>



<p>Q. What other data points can you share that show the impact FIDO authentication has had?</p>



<p>On July 31, 2020, we launched a new authentication feature, “Smart Authentication NEO.” On the quantitative side, the number of new registered customers has reached approximately 100,000 in just three weeks since its launch, and we expect this number to increase further in the future.</p>



<p>On the qualitative side, many customers have commented on the convenience of being able to use a single app for both banking and authentication functions.</p>



<p>Q. What advice would you give to other organizations considering rolling out FIDO authentication?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, our company’s FIDO authentication uses Net Move’s “SaAT Pokepass Authentication Service.” By collaborating with Net Move, we were able to deployed the new authentication function “Smart Authentication NEO” in a short period of time.</p>



<p>In addition to FIDO authentication, Net Move already has an installed at more than 100 financial institutions, including “SaAT Netizen,” an anti-fraudulent remittance service, and we believe that Net Move can help to solve these issues.</p>



<p>Q. What role do you see FIDO Authentication playing for your company in the future?</p>



<p>The “Smart Authentication” service will be discontinued after January 2021, and we will move exclusively to the FIDO-enabled “Smart Authentication Neo” app. We see moving to the FIDO-enabled app&nbsp; as the key authentication function will further allow us to provide secure and convenient experiences for our customers.</p>



<p>Q. If you are able, please provide a quote from an executive regarding this deployment and the impact FIDO has had for your organization.</p>



<p>Quote from the project manager of SBI Sumishin Net Bank:</p>



<p>“Our goal is to revolutionize financial services and make society more comfortable and convenient by utilizing the most advanced technology with a customer-centric approach. Security is an extremely important factor in achieving this goal, and we believe that the introduction of FIDO will make a significant contribution.”</p>

<p>Kantara to Provide Its NIST SP 800-63-3 Conformity Assessment For Identity Proofing &amp; Authentication</p>
<p>WAKEFIELD, Mass., USA – October 7, 2020 — <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> announced today that the United States General Services Administration (GSA) is joining Kantara and plans to put its Login.gov service through the Kantara assurance and approval program based on third-party assessment against the requirements detailed in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines.</p>
<p>“NIST SP 800-63-3 is focused on modernizing the policy in keeping with rising threat levels for identity proofing, verification and authentication whilst also improving privacy in the overall digital user experience,” said Colin Wallis, Executive Director, Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; “Kantara has developed assessment criteria against each of 63-3’s normative requirements to drive consistency in assessments of applicable credential service providers (CSPs) done by Kantara 3rd party accredited assessors. Consistency in assessments drives long term integrity in Kantara’s Trust Framework and Trust Marks internationally, thereby building trust and confidence for all stakeholders in the wider digital economy.”</p>
<p>With the GSA’s oversight, Login.gov provides simple, secure, private access to participating US government digital services online.&nbsp; A single privacy-aware login.gov account can sign-in to multiple government agencies making managing federal benefits, services and applications easier and more secure for the public. Login.gov is used by over 60 applications at 17 agencies including the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy and the Executive Office of the President. To date, over 25 million people have signed up to use login.gov.</p>
<p>Kantara is one of the leading global consortiums improving trustworthy use of identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. It <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trustoperations/800-63-3/">provides third party assessment against the NIST SP 800-63-3 for identity proofing and authentication</a>. US Government agencies are required to follow NIST guidelines and independent, external assessment is acknowledged as best practice to demonstrate NIST standards compliance.</p>
<p>Kantara was authorized as a US Government Trust Framework provider to the GSA’s then FICAM Trust Framework Solutions (TFS) program in 2011 and works with governments and standards-bodies internationally to align its Trust Mark program for multi-jurisdictional adoption. Kantara is one of the premier Trust Framework Providers aligned with the US National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) program as well as similar initiatives outside the US.</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3 is the set of prevailing digital identity guidelines to which US Federal agencies implementing identity verification and authentication must comply. It also serves as a widely-recognized benchmark for any organization or business wishing to implement identity verification and authentication services, both internationally as well as within the US.</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative Trust Framework</p>
<p>Kantara Initiative’s Trust Framework Operations and Identity Assurance program is the industry leading program that&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/idassurance/assessor-accreditation/">accredits Assessors </a>and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/idassurance/service-provider-approval/">approves Credential Service Providers</a> (CSPs).&nbsp; The program offers three Classes of Approval that enable CSPs to seek approval of their Identity and Credential Management Services as meeting NIST 800-63 rev.3 requirements. By design, Kantara’s IAF can be applied to a range of standards-derived schemes and classes of approval to verify an organization’s conformance, including NIST SP 800-63-3.</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative</p>
<p>The Kantara Initiative is one of the leading global consortiums improving trustworthy use of digital identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. Kantara provides real-world innovation through its development of specifications, applied R&amp;D and conformity assessment programs for the digital identity and personal data ecosystems.

 Omidyar Network’s Official Statement on Today’s Report Issued by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law <p>The House Judiciary subcommittee’s recommendations released today represent the most comprehensive response from Congress to date on anti-competitive conduct in the tech sector. After a lengthy probe into industry giants Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook, we are grateful to see bipartisan understanding of the problems posed by unchecked concentration in this sector, the recognition of how competition policy can improve, and the need for additional resources to enable the DOJ and FTC to enforce existing antitrust laws. We are even more encouraged to see proposals for legislative changes and increased oversight.</p><p>Until now, critical areas of the internet have remained <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/youre-grounded-and-we-re-taking-away-the-keys-to-the-car-b80cf01f527f">unregulated and unchecked</a>, requiring the sort of dedicated investigation that the report reflects. The potentially illegal market dominance of the largest technology platforms, as well as their social and political power, is seriously threatening our individual freedoms, workers’ rights, economies, and democracies. From widespread disinformation and discrimination against vulnerable groups, to questionable tactics to kill competition and pervasive surveillance practices; we have ample <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/a-legal-roadmap-to-address-googles-monopoly-on-search-engines-effdfbcbc1f7">evidence</a> that the status quo is creating adverse conditions for individuals and society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>The “<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/investigation_of_competition_in_digital_markets_majority_staff_report_and_recommendations.pdf">Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets</a>” Majority Staff Report and Recommendations from the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law, is a thoughtful roadmap for legislative and regulatory action to reign in the power of big tech, protect Americans, and guide Congress’s work in the coming year. Democrats and Republicans agree that the dominant technology platforms have acquired monopoly power in their respective markets; federal agencies should have more resources for enforcement; interoperability and data portability should be mandated; and the burden of proof in merger cases should be shifted. Democrats go beyond, and propose to mandate structural separation between the technology platforms’ many business units, and the removal of certain barriers to private antitrust enforcement.</p><p>To better steward technology and shape the rules of the road for the future, we believe that all people — including those who use technology, or are directly affected by these companies’ business practices — should have a voice in how these platforms operate. Strong competition policy matched with strong oversight is as important to every entrepreneur looking to innovate and build THE next great company as it is to every household, every worker, and every&nbsp;voter.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>By Franklyn Odhiambo and Thea Anderson, Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, the Nigerian government launched a <a href="https://techeconomy.ng/2020/06/fg-inaugurates-steering-committee-for-nigeria-digital-identity-project/">Steering Committee for the National Identity</a> in June, and published the <a href="https://www.nimc.gov.ng/docs/adverts/Advert_for_review_of_Draft_Data_Protection_Bill_2020_for_print.pdf">Data Protection Bill 2020</a> for public comment in August. As a social change venture with a presence across Africa, we as Omidyar Network actively use our voice and partnerships with civil society organizations to reinforce good technology design and policy practices that yield Good ID — equity, inclusion, privacy, security, and transparency.</p><p>To better understand the implications of these developments in Nigeria, we recently spoke with Adeboye (“Boye”) Adegoke, Paradigm Initiative’s senior program manager. Paradigm Initiative is an African social enterprise, focused on increasing transparency and accountability between governments, civil society organizations, grassroots organizers, and the general public, on issues related to digital rights and inclusion. Omidyar Network <a href="https://medium.com/positive-returns/bringing-data-privacy-and-protections-to-nigerias-id-program-and-digital-economy-why-we-invested-439ad5ba5eef">partnered with Paradigm Initiative</a> in early 2020 to support their advocacy and education efforts with Nigeria’s policymakers and the Nigerian Identity Management Commission, aiming toward securing greater safeguards and transparency in the National Identification Numbers&nbsp;program.</p><p>The commission operates the federal government’s national identity database, and assigns and issues the unique identification numbers that will soon be required for citizens and legal residents ages 16 and&nbsp;older.</p><p>Below Boye discusses these recent announcements and his organization’s vision for increasing digital ID and data protection safeguards, as well as transparency in government decision-making.</p><p>What are your top recommendations to Nigerian policymakers today on the draft Data Protection Bill&nbsp;2020?</p><p>Adegoke: One, the proposed Data Protection Commission must be fully funded, staffed, and operational before there is any further registration, or issuing of [National Identification Numbers] or any other digital ID programs.</p><p>Two, the commission must be truly independent. The overwhelming number of government actors currently proposed for the commission’s advisory board will seriously impact true independence.</p><p>Three, independent members — from civil society, media, and academia — must be included on the advisory board to balance government and private sector representatives equally.</p><p>Four, data protection must never be used as a disguise to deny journalists access to critical information in the interest of the public, especially within journalistic rights.</p><p>Five, vague terms such as “national interest”, “national security”, and “public morality” — which have been used in the past to derogate from citizens’ rights — must be clearly defined in the bill, and not be left open-ended and amenable to different interpretations.</p><blockquote>“Given the work that we do, part of our advocacy objectives is to ensure that the development of digital policy receives quality inputs from us. Our focus is clear in this regard; rights, inclusion, and innovation. We will advocate against draft legislation/policy that seeks to limit rights, stifle innovation or widen access gaps and we will support those who seek to promote access, rights, and innovation.”</blockquote><p>How did Paradigm Initiative come to advocate on digital identity&nbsp;issues?</p><p>Adegoke: Our entry point builds on our existing commitment to digital rights and digital inclusion, alongside our belief in the right to privacy and equity for all Nigerians. When the federal government relaunched and wanted to fast-track the National Identification Number registration process, we were alarmed and had to act. Before a new ID program is even considered, we believe there must be many strong safeguards in place, including a data protection framework. Government-issued ID programs in Nigeria have never been inclusive, starting at the point of registration. They’ve amplified gaps between the “haves” and the “have-nots” that corrupt officials can exploit, especially for Nigerians that are not socially or politically connected, and stateless populations. <br> <br>What issues do feel poorly-managed government-issued IDs create for citizens and residents? <br> <br> Adegoke: There are potential risks depending on how the ID system is instituted. We are mindful of the kind of problems that an [digital] ID for residents can help solve. We are also aware that these can create new problems and amplify old ones. A digital ID may complicate already problematic and non-transparent surveillance activities of repressive regimes. On the other hand, [digital IDs] can ensure state resources are efficiently distributed, and problems, such as eliminating “ghost workers” in government services, can be resolved.<br> <br>What are practical challenges you see with the current National Identification Number process in&nbsp;Nigeria?</p><p>Adegoke: One, poor engagement by the government with the public. The government often assumes they know what is best for people, but have had no engagement with civil society voices or public forums. Two, digital ID vendors and contractors wield a huge influence in the Nigerian [National Identification Number] process, while human rights organizations and civil society voices have been largely ignored. Three, infrastructure challenges, including unstable electricity access and limited internet connectivity. Implementing a transparent and inclusive digital ID program requires not just an internet connection, but a reliable one. In October 2019, for example, it was announced that a [National Identification Number] would be required to write university matriculation Exams. The government was forced to quickly walk back that decision when the [National Identity Management Commission] could not cope with the surge of admission seekers due to the lack of operational [National Identification Number] registration centers. And four, corrupt practices by some [National Identification Number] registration officers. Registering for a [National Identification Number] goes to its highest bidders, weakening the accountability and trust in the government.</p><p>How does Paradigm Initiative engage with Nigerian policymakers to raise these concerns?</p><p>Adegoke: First, we have been at the forefront of the campaign for Nigeria to enact the <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2019/12/03/digital-rights-freedoms-bill/">Digital Rights and Freedom Bill</a> in Parliament since 2016. Second, we engage and educate policymakers on the need for parliament to pass the Nigerian Data Protection Bill (originally introduced in 2011) into law. While the new draft Data Protection Bill 2020 is critical, it only addresses a fraction of our concerns. Third, in 2019 a federal High Court in Abuja recommended the [National Identity Management Commission] put safety measures and a sufficient regulatory framework in place. We led a group of actors to demand that [commission] suspend [National Identification Number] implementation until the government enacts a comprehensive data protection law, and resolves the data security lapses and privacy concerns we identified.</p><p>We [also] facilitate engagement between [the commission] and civil society groups, grassroots advocates, and social media activists. In February, we hosted top officials in two engagement sessions with stakeholders from the Niger Delta region and Uyo. Also, in August, we hosted a virtual conversation between the Director General of [the commission], and civil society, where we received feedback on the [National Identification Number] concerns of our citizens and civil society. This month, we facilitated a virtual <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/pin-host-webinar-on-draft-bill-on-data-protection-launched-report-on-digital-rights-in-nigeria/">public consultation session</a> for feedback and recommendations on the draft Data Protection Bill&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Paradigm Initiative recently released <a href="https://paradigmhq.org/download/digital-rights-and-privacy-in-nigeria/">the Digital Rights and Privacy in Nigeria report</a>, and co-hosted the <a href="https://cipesa.org/fifafrica/">Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFAfrica</a>) to amplify the voices—and solutions—of African civil society organizations working on digital rights issues. Additionally, just last week, Paradigm Initiative <a href="https://twitter.com/Id4africaE/status/1309010053836480512">represented Nigerian civil society</a> in an ID4Africa panel on Nigeria’s identity ecosystem. The conversation resulted in a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202008/verify-my-life-could-a-nigerian-problem-lead-to-a-global-trust-solution">Biometric Update article</a> on the lack of both accountability mechanisms, and transparency on the ID program, as well as the fees collected when the Nigerian government hires third-party private actors to enroll people in the&nbsp;program.</p>

<p>A crash-course in the complex world of variously-open software licensing</p><p>The ostensibly binary distinction between “open” and “closed” software gets bandied about in many contexts, often in a dangerously simplified form, as though there were only two, mutually-exclusive options. It can also be extended to standards in an imprecise or oversimplified way. Sometimes people refer to groups like DIF “working on open-source standards,” but speaking precise, no such thing&nbsp;exists!</p><p>Only software code can be open-source, since after all, “source” is short for “source code” (pre-compiled software). Standards, whether open or not, are not code — instead, they are functional definitions and specifications that define and specify protocols that one application (or code base) uses to talk to another (or code base). Each standard can be understood as a benchmark for testing specific implementations, dividing existing and future codebases into those fully, partly, or non-compliant with its requirements.</p>“Lean Startup workshop” in Amsterdam, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@epicantus">Daria Nepriakhina</a><p>Code, whether open-source or not, can implement or “build to” a pre-existing standard, which can be developed in a variously open or closed manner; there is no inherent link or dependency between the openness or rigor of the two processes. Similarly, a standard can be “written around” one or more existing implementations, in such a way that the existing code is definitively compliant with the resulting standard tailored to it. This latter operation is an important function in open-source communities, in that it invites future developers to make new code that will be interchangeable or interoperable with that precedent. Even if that pre-existing code is closed, the resulting standard can be of great use to open-source development, particularly if the process used to write it was also “open” and participated in by the designers and implementers of that closed-source precedent.</p><p>In this series of three brief explanatory posts, we’ll first explain open-source development as a process rather than defining it by its results. In the next post, we will explain the characteristics and optionalities of an “open process” for developing standards. Supporting these open standards is where the bulk of DIF’s efforts and resources are focused. Lastly, we will turn to how open source and open standards work together to create new business models and strategies with real-world consequences for cooperation, “coöpetition,” and healthy&nbsp;markets.</p> Source Code and Intellectual Property&nbsp;Law <p>At their lowest level, computers are just machines that exercise millions of structured computations every second. They take inputs, perform computation, and produce&nbsp;outputs.</p>(public domain)<p>These computations can be combined into complex structures of data and decision-making called “programs” that interface with humans to make useful and meaningful outputs. At the lowest level, these computations still look like oceans of 1s and 0s to the untrained eye, but decades of refinement of operating systems, programming languages, scripting languages, and other abstractions make it easy for engineers to deal only with “source code” as a kind of human-readable abstraction at higher levels. This is “compiled” into more efficient, machine-readable “binaries” (ones and zeros) that can be deployed to standardized hardware in the real world where it is “run” (live software is often referred to as “runtime”).</p>by <a href="https://scs.senecac.on.ca/~chris.szalwinski">Chris Szalwinski</a> from <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp100/pages/content/compi.html">The C Program</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ca/">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada&nbsp;License</a>.<p>Because it is human-readable and because licenses apply to compiled binaries and functional software in specific jurisdictions, the software industry has largely applied practices analogous to academic “peer review” for sharing and critiquing core pieces of source code. This complicates the open/closed distinction further, since a closed-source project and a licensed binary might still offer key components up for review through github or other channels traditionally used for open development. Furthermore, the many gradients between complete “open” or “closed” software depends on the ownership and licensing of a given piece of software, which can evolve over time or differ in its enforceability across jurisdictions. Like all legal matters, mileage may vary and always consult a licensed&nbsp;expert!</p> A thumbnail history of licensing <p>There is a range of different licensing regimes for source code. Among open-source licenses, different functions can be enabled or facilitated independently of one another: external review, attribution, innovation, maintenance, and even revenue-sharing and other conditions on business practices.</p><p>Proprietary code bases are released under closed-source licenses, which are optimized for secrecy, exclusivity, and/or sale of the results through licensing-based revenue models. For decades, this was how Microsoft licensed not only its proprietary stand-alone software, but even the bulk of the Windows operating system. The licensing landscape is much more diverse today, but before the 1990s very little commercial software was developed in the open or had its source code published after the&nbsp;fact.</p><p>The culture of academia is one of sharing and publishing intellectual work for peers to see and review — open peer-review is as central in academic computer science as it is in the hard sciences. The internet was originally imagined, architected, prototyped, and built by academics, and tinkerers, primarily supported by military and government funding. These three cultures (the military, academia, and independent “hacker”/tinkerer types) formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet_Galaxy">basis of internet culture</a>. A fourth culture was added later when the general public’s access to the internet evolved into a massive commercial industry in the early&nbsp;1990s.</p><p>For our purposes here, we can limit ourselves to the fairly direct link, sometimes biographical, between the anomalous, non-commercial origins of the internet and the development of the open-source movement within the software industry. One “origin myth” that exemplifies this link is the story of a young Richard Stallman, then working in an early Artificial Intelligence lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who wanted to customize some printer software for an expensive new printer shared across all the floors of a busy research building. To do so, he needed to get the source code from the manufacturer, which he had done to customize the previous “workhorse” printer in the same building.</p><p>The manufacturer of the new model, however, surprised Stallman by refusing to hand over the code on grounds of licensing and intellectual property rights. Stallman, to whom the motto “software wants to be free” is often misattributed, often <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823">credits the incident</a> for his deeply-held belief that the end-users of software have a right to modify and participate in the software they use, whether they paid directly for it or benefited from the procurements of governments. To this day, the details and boundaries of this right are still being debated, not only in open-source requirements for government procurements, but also in “right to repair” laws that extend these rights into the domain of hardware and the physical (and 3D-printed) world.</p> Varying degrees of “Software Freedom” <p>Stallman went on to found the Free Software Foundation and play a pivotal role in the elaboration of an open-source (and “free open source”) movement. He also created the first GNU Public Licence (GPL), still a major and influential family of licenses. All versions of the GPL have within them some version of these 4 essential “freedoms”:</p><blockquote>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (“freedom 0”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (“freedom 1”). Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (“freedom 2”).</blockquote><blockquote>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (“freedom 3”). By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for&nbsp;this.</blockquote><p>Honoring these four freedoms textually and fully can make it very hard to sell software commercially for many reasons, salient among them that freely-available source code in a major language is trivial to compile into functioning binaries; commercial or “closed” software is generally sold as compiled binaries, keeping the source code&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Furthermore, many early open-source licenses like GPL explicitly forbid so-called “enclosure” of the code, i.e., incorporating pieces or subsets of the licensed code into a new, close-source product. Anti-enclosure licensing is often referred to as “copyleft” (because it prohibits future copyrighting!) or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license">viral</a> licensing,” since it cannot be mixed and matched with other licensing without overriding more restrictive licensing. This severely limits commercial potential of “forks” or derived variants. The entire Linux family of operating systems are licensed this way, which keeps Linux development squarely in the camp of maximally-open development throughout.</p><p>Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, the open-source movement grew and at some point the software industry could not afford to ignore it, even if directly participating with licenses like GPL was not feasible for most companies of any size. This period saw the first “compromise-licenses” and hybrid open/closed business-models evolve around them. Many of the licenses still popular today date to these early experiments. For instance, the license originally created for the University of California, Berkeley’s fork of Unix, and still known today as the Berkeley Software Development (BSD) license, is one such “commercially lenient” open-source licenses. These licenses allow developers to take code that was originally open, make significant changes to modified versions of it, and license or even sell those under more classically commercial licenses.</p><p>Similarly, more lenient variants of the Apache and MIT licenses date to this period as well. It is worth noting that Apache web servers were one of the first open-source pieces of software that replaced a dominant commercial product. Apache web server software reaching a dominant position in the previously closed-license, commercial niche was a watershed moment for open-source software.</p><p>Apache is often held up, alongside Linux, as an example of where open-source software optimizes for standardization and safety of mission-critical infrastructure, largely due to the thorough and ongoing auditing and maintenance enabled by its core components being completely open to review, testing, and improvement proposals. Conversely, however, some historians of software development point out that allowing enclosure to the degree that Apache licenses do can lead to simultaneous or “parallel” development of various (partially closed-source) forks to evolve in tandem according to various divergent business agendas. Over time, this can splinter development, wicking off talent, attention, and manpower into closed development and creating a major coordination problem for the open-source “parent” of the family tree. In the most severe cases, this can greatly diminish and forfeit the standardization and security gains that made sharing an open-source parent so desirable in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Today and&nbsp;Tomorrow <p>Today, cloud-based business models and Software-as-a-Service have revived and expanded the toolkit for closed-source development, and in turn breathed new life into the debate about how hybrid models could make open-source infrastructure sustainable by revenue shares from closed-source products that depend on it. Similarly, the so called “cloud loophole” in older GPL licenses, whereby software could be run but not “distributed,” was closed by the newer <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">Affero GPL</a> that applies to cloud environments.</p><p>Another interesting frontier in the evolving licensing landscape is being opened up in recent years by distributing computing and distributed ledgers. One key assumption of traditional licensing is that software runs on a finite set of distinct pieces of hardware, with ownership and liability that follow straightforwardly from there. Distributed computing, however, where computation work is spread out over a more diffuse and indeterminate numbers of computers, which might have limited or no insight into the “big picture” of the software they are running, muddy the waters even further than traditional cloud environment. On the radically open side of the spectrum, the distributed-computing ecosystem project HoloChain has innovated the <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license-172ac920966d">Cryptographic Autonomy Licence </a>to empower users (and the software running in their name) by protecting them with encryption.</p><p>New forms of “confidential computing” and encrypted, self-sovereign networking take this even further, making the boundaries of software and runtime environments similarly porous. Attempts at licensing for these new topographies have been <a href="https://sdtimes.com/os/osi-co-founder-leaves-initiative-over-new-license/">controversial</a> at times, but they are also an important precedent and context for work happening in the DIF, such as that of the Secure Data Storage <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working&nbsp;group</a>.</p><p>There are even more radical experiments and movements happening in the open-licensing problem space, which would restrict usage not [only] according to commercial terms or enclosure, but according to non-monetary and non-licensing rubrics as well. For instance, the “ICE breaker” <a href="https://icebreaker.dev">project </a>has brought more attention to the movement to license software according to so-called “<a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/licenses/">ethical licenses</a>.” These restrict derivative use anywhere it can be proven to support of human rights violations, such as in military applications or for “predictive policing” and other use-cases that run afoul of international authorities on human rights and discrimination. The provisions or triggers for such licensing might be as hard to enforce as international human rights law (i.e., very hard), but it sends a signal that specifications and standards from other disciplines such as human rights law and ethical philosophy might someday find their place among the commercial and attribution clauses in open-source licenses.</p> Further reading <p>All code developed under the DIF umbrella is strictly open source, and while DIF accepts donations of previously-closed source code, it is expected that all ongoing iterations of them will take place in the open. The original vision for DIF as a project within the <a href="https://www.jointdevelopment.org/about1.html">Joint Development Foundation</a> was to host code development, and it has since expanded to include co-developed pre-standards specifications and other educational and non-technical <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/education/home">materials</a> as well. Take a spin through our github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/">repositories</a> if you’d like to see an overview of historical and ongoing projects.</p><p>In this quick overview, we have only scratched the surface, though, and we encourage anyone working in the open software space to educate themselves further. The Open Source Initiative <a href="https://opensource.org/trademark-guidelines#Usage_That_Does_Not_Require_Permission">holds the trademark </a>on the phrase “open source” and maintains a very helpful list of licenses that it has decided are fully conformant with its principles. The <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/category">list of approved licenses</a> that they maintain is a great place to start if you are researching the licensing landscape, and they also hold <a href="https://opensource.org/events">events</a> and offer a substantial offering of <a href="https://opensource.org/osi-open-source-education">educational materials</a>.</p><p>In our next installment, we’ll turn to Open Standards and the work of the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76">Drilling down: Open Source</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Kacie Harold, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the <a href="http://www.ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer Pack</a> — a toolkit designed to help tech workers spark dialogue about the future impacts of their designs, identify early warning signs, and brainstorm positive solutions. This week, we are sharing some additional, practical advice from leading experts on how to mitigate against several of the tech risk zones (or potential downsides) and ensure technology is safe, fair, and compassionate.</p><p>Chris Hughes is the co-founder and co-chair of the Economic Security Project, a group that is working to restructure the economy so that it works for everyone. Prior to this, he co-founded Facebook in 2004, and later worked as a publisher at New Republic for several years. Chris has worked exclusively on economic issues since 2016, focusing on anti-monopoly and antitrust issues, and calling for a guaranteed income and tax&nbsp;policy.</p><p>What motivates you on the issues related to ethics and responsibility within technology?</p><p>I think any systems builder, whether it’s in technology, finance, or the arts needs to think about how their work impacts other people and the world. This is an obligation that we all have as humans first, whether we end up as business people or anything else. Tech in particular has a very important responsibility since so many of the companies that are out there, pioneering and charting new paths for products and services. And each one of those comes with a different set of ethical questions that tech companies need to develop a practice of asking and answering on a regular&nbsp;basis.</p><p>I tend to be an optimist and think that folks in tech now are thinking much more comprehensively and ethically. That said, I don’t think that we should overcomplicate thinking about ethics. Just as parents teach their kids at the playground to think about how their play affects other kids, we do the same thing in schools. We have to do the same thing in business and technology as well. And I don’t think that creating the habit of thinking about how our work impacts others is a particularly tall ask. Part of being human is thinking about how we live in community with other people, what other people provide us and what we’re providing them. If there’s any moment in the past several decades that illustrates that more than ever it’s COVID-19. We can see that we all rely on each other to stay healthy and create the kind of communities that we, have appreciated and want to return&nbsp;to.</p><p>I think that the long arc of history teaches us that we’re all relying on each other and the decisions that we make as individuals affect the greater community. This is true in business. It’s true in politics and in organizing, too.</p><p>How do monopolies hurt entrepreneurs?</p><p>For small business entrepreneurs, the most worrying things about monopolies is their ability to move into a market and effectively shut that market down by either price gouging, copying features or tools, or, hostile acquisitions of companies in that marketplace. From a talent perspective, it is often difficult to compete against monopolies because of their ability to attract and retain&nbsp;talent.</p><p>Increases in market concentration lead to decreases in entrepreneurship and innovation. It becomes harder to enter these markets, and this slows down the pace of innovation. Even before the recession, small business startups were at a near historic low, and one of the chief causes of that is monopoly&nbsp;power.</p><p>My sense is that we’ve lost a vocabulary and a framework to talk about outsized corporate power in the United States over the past 30 or 40 years. Most folks in tech are wary of these conversations, but they are also concerned about the big of the consolidation of power. And so we’re at a transitional moment where folks in tech, like a lot of people elsewhere in the country and even in the world are rethinking what the role of public policy should be to create markets that are fair and create good outcomes for everyone.</p><p>I think another issue is that people have begun to see the large tech monopolies as inevitable and unchangeable. And so they may not think as much about how those monopolies impact their lives or impede their&nbsp;work.</p><p>That’s what the leaders of the large tech companies want you to believe. So if that’s what you’re thinking, they’ve got you right where they want you. The more that they can convince folks that there is no other way, and that this is the best of all possible worlds, then they’ve&nbsp;won.</p><p>I think there are a lot of entrepreneurs out there who are thinking creatively and are skeptical about the role that those large companies are playing. The challenge is less about not buying into what the tech companies are saying — that monopolies are inevitable– and more about believing that government can be a positive force for good in the world. Specifically, that the Federal Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice can create markets that are more dynamic and fair. We live in a time where cynicism about the government runs deep. I think for entrepreneurs, that cynicism is bigger barrier than the tech companies’ talking&nbsp;points.</p><p>If you don’t mind shifting for a moment, I’d like to ask you about something you wrote in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html">op-ed</a> for The New York Times in 2019 about your experience working at Facebook.</p><p>“I’m disappointed in myself and the early Facebook team for not thinking more about how the News Feed algorithm could change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders.”</p><p>Given your experience of being in the room as decisions like this get made, is there any advice you would give tech developers and teams to identify the key moments where they need to stop and think about what they are creating?</p><p>I can only speak for myself. In the early days of Facebook, it was very hard for me to imagine what a success at scale might look like. These were products that were for college kids in the United States that were largely meant to be fun, about creating connection. We knew that it was more than just fun, but the backdrop was that it was a lighthearted, recreational project that we hoped would bring people closer together. That would have been the way we would have spoken about it at the time. And so for me it was very hard to imagine what this thing would look like when over a billion people were using it, for who knows how many hours a day, and anyone can have access. That difficulty was real, and it isn’t an excuse because we knew that Facebook was a very sticky, very popular product, very early on. And that’s why I wrote what I wrote. Because we should have thought much more seriously about what it could turn into, even at the&nbsp;outset.</p><p>I’m not sure if it would have changed in some of those initial decisions that I made at the time, but it would have created a framework of accountability that we could refer back to as a team and individually. And I think it’s only in the past year or two that Facebook has really come to even understand its responsibility, if it really has. My advice to (tech) teams is, even if you’re working small, think big, and think about what problems could be introduced at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>I think when you are in a company that is growing and doing really well, it’s natural to be excited and want to move quickly, but that speed can make it difficult to predict ways that things could go wrong. Do you have any advice for how tech makers can recognize those pivotal moments where they should slow down and consider the impact of what they are creating?</p><p>You’re always in the moment, and you don’t have to worry about figuring out if you’re in the moment or not. My advice is that you should always be asking that question. Often it will feel theoretical, but it isn’t. I guess that’s my point with the playground analogy at the beginning. Thinking about how your actions impact other people is a basic part of living in a community with other&nbsp;people.</p><p>I realize that interviewing somebody (formerly) from Facebook may be a little counterproductive because people could say, well, my company is not going to become a Facebook, so I don’t need worry about this. But I think everybody should be thinking about it much of the time, whether you’re in the CEO suite or, the most junior customer service&nbsp;agent.</p><p>You can find more of Chris’ thinking on twitter <a href="http://chrishughes/">@chrishughes.</a> The <a href="https://www.economicsecurityproject.org/">Economic Security Project</a> is a grantee of Omidyar&nbsp;Network.</p>

<p>By Kacie Harold, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the <a href="http://www.ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer Pack</a> — a toolkit designed to help tech workers spark dialogue about the future impacts of their designs, identify early warning signs, and brainstorm positive solutions. This week, we are sharing some additional, practical advice from leading experts on how to mitigate against several of the tech risk zones (or potential downsides) and ensure technology is safe, fair, and compassionate.</p><p>Caroline Sinders is a designer and artist focusing on the intersections of artificial intelligence, abuse, and politics in digital conversational spaces. She has worked with the United Nations, Amnesty International, IBM Watson, the Wikimedia Foundation and recently published a <a href="https://medium.com/@OmidyarNetwork/how-to-design-for-delight-and-connection-during-the-pandemic-c54eb2131169">piece</a> with the support of Omidyar Network and Mozilla Foundation. Sinders has held fellowships with the Harvard Kennedy School, Google’s PAIR (People and Artificial Intelligence Research group), and the Mozilla Foundation. Her work has been featured in the Tate Exchange in Tate Modern, the Victoria and Albert Museum, MoMA PS1, LABoral, Wired, Slate, Quartz, the Channels Festival and others. Caroline also has a passion for addressing harassment online, which represents one of the harmful behaviors within the Bad Actors Tech Risk&nbsp;Zone.</p><p>Caroline, can you tell us about how design plays an important role in creating safe and inclusive environments online?</p><p>I’ve been studying online harassment for nearly the past seven years. I look at it from the perspective of how technology products and social networks are designed, and how that design can mitigate or amplify harassment. I focus on how the design of a space allows for harassment to occur, including both the actions that a harasser could engage in and the affordances that a victim has, to mitigate the harassment that they are receiving.</p><p>How can tech companies benefit from protecting their users from harassment?</p><p>I always like to remind people that bad business costs money. Additionally, when people face harassment, they tend to engage in self-censorship. The chilling effect of harassment is that people post less content and they engage less often. I believe that becomes a human rights issue when, for safety reasons, some people can not engage freely in a platform, but others can. Being able to participate safely in a space is crucial for engaging in free speech. Ultimately, a company will lose money if people stop using or all together leave their platform; one way to get users to stay is to protect&nbsp;them.</p><p>In the last few years, you’ve worked with Band Camp, Facebook, and Wikipedia on anti-harassment policies and tools to support victims. Are there any common challenges that you’ve seen tech teams struggle with as they address harassment on their platforms?</p><p>Platforms, across the board, struggle to identify growing forms of harm. Harassers are always changing their methods and finding some new and interesting way to hurt other people. It’s important to regularly talk to a variety of people from underrepresented groups, who are using your product or technology in order to understand how forms are harassment are evolving.</p><p>When you listen to users, you need to be aware their relationship to the tool. Often in open source communities or volunteer led projects, you see a lot of users who feel very committed to a project because they have contributed to it and they are deeply invested in the community. For instance, at Wikimedia, I saw victims who were more willing to forgive or try to empathize or work through the harassment they had faced out of concern that asking the Wikimedia Foundation or community leadership to make changes might rupture the community or hurt the encyclopedia. In these cases, you need to find other marginalized members who have experienced toxicity, and have a conversation with them and make sure you aren’t perpetuating toxicity in order to protect a&nbsp;project.</p><p>Another challenge is that some forms of harassment look innocuous at first. For example, imagine you receive the same message from 10 different people over the course of a year, and although you block the users, the messages keep coming. When you file a report, there’s no way to show the messages are related, and the platform has no way to investigate it. In another scenario where you receive a comment from someone that says, “I love your green top with the polka dots,” you might be scared, wondering why or how that person has seen your shirt. But the content moderator isn’t going to see that, all they see is a comment on the victim’s appearance. Even with harassment policy and procedures in place, reporting flows may prevent victims from sharing context or evidence necessary for a content moderator to verify&nbsp;it.</p><p>How can tech companies be proactive about preventing harm on their platforms?</p><p>Unfortunately, when big tech thinks of preventative care in terms of harassment, they think of technology solutions to it. This can be really problematic because those technology solutions end up being things like AI and AI filters, which aren’t very accurate.</p><p>Preventing harassment would entail much more user friendly privacy settings. The challenge is, most people aren’t necessarily thinking of their safety until it has been compromised. One way to increase safety for users is to make data privacy settings really legible, and easy to find and use. This could also look like sending users a push notification suggesting changes to their privacy settings, keeping location sharing off by default, or even notifying users of ways that harassment can occur on that platform.</p><p>In addition to giving people tools to protect themselves, victims may also need proof that they have reported abuse in case things get worse. So right now, if you file a harassment report on Facebook or Twitter they send you an email, but it would help victims to be able to find all of those reports in one place and in a downloadable format in case they need those reports to build a legal case at some&nbsp;point.</p><p>What advice do you have for tech makers, builders, or companies that are just starting to think about or discuss harassment?</p><p>Hire Black women and other marginalized people who use your tool. If you are a privileged person, you may not quite understand that someone could experience harassment in a place that you feel is very safe. I think of Zoom which, really could not have anticipated this moment or the popularity of their tool. The CEO said that they had never thought of harassment because Zoom was created as a workplace tool. But we know that harassment happens at&nbsp;work.</p><p>When you design a technology, always ask yourself what could possibly go wrong and really map out things, even if they feel absurd to you. Don’t just design for like this middle area of how you hope people will use your technology, design for the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Finally, remember that every data point about harassment is a real person’s traumatic story. So even if you have what seems like really low numbers of harassment, it’s always important to remember that these are people experiencing trauma, not&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>You can find more of Caroline’s work on her <a href="https://carolinesinders.com/projects/">website</a>, and can follow her journey on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/carolinesinders">@CarolineSinders</a>.</p>

 Zeenab Aneez &amp; Neha&nbsp;Mujumdar  Session <p>It was media theorist Marshall McLuhan who popularised the phrase ‘the medium is the message’; to him, different kinds of media engage the senses in different ways, affecting how we process it and engage with its contents. Before situating research in the digital space, it is important to ask ourselves: what is the nature of the medium are we dealing with here? How do people interact with it? What are the opportunities it provides and the risks it poses? How can we study new digital objects, such as online-first news outlets, podcasts, etc in a way that recognises the medium’s&nbsp;newness?</p><p>The proposed session is an exploration of a methodology that is informed and defined by specific characteristics of the medium, with a special focus on digital news and journalism in India. Through this, it seeks to tackle the first of the four key focus areas of the conference: How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?</p><p>Keeping this key question in mind, we ask: how can digital methods research contribute to the study of news and journalism in the digital space? How can we use digital objects such as tags, Likes, and Comments to understand how user feedback works in the new information economy? What can the interface of a news creation platform tell us about the changing roles of Indian journalists in today’s media environment? How can we formulate a methodology for studying the metamorphosis of a news story by using Twitter and what skills are required to gather and process information for research of this&nbsp;nature?</p><p>In order to inform our responses to such questions, we borrow from Richard Rogers’ adage ‘Follow the medium’ (Rogers 2013), which argues that “natively digital”(Ibid. 19) objects like tags, links, Likes or Comments, which originate in digital networks, cannot be fully understood with methods, such as, say content analysis; an example of a non-digital method that does not recognise its digital nature. The proposed session will make use of the general philosophy embodied by Rogers’ approach and urge participants to acknowledge the specific properties of the Internet as a medium and look at news and journalism as part of the larger media ecology of the web. This calls for the use of new methods that are digital in nature; the discussion on contemporary news should expand from how the news industry is coping with the digital transition, to how we can better understand the specific elements of this transition and use this understanding to reflect upon the changing nature of journalism and news&nbsp;itself.</p><p>In order to channel the discussion, the session proposes using the framework from one particular field of digital research: platform studies. With the advent of Web 2.0 and the emergence of the ‘web as platform’ (O’Reilly 2007) and the strengthening relationship between the news industry and social media platforms(‘Reuters Institute Digital News Report’ 2015), traditional as well as digital-born news sites are increasingly adopting a platform model. Therefore, platform studies makes for a fitting framework within which to understand the workings of these platforms, their technological and formal structures, and the specific ways in which they allow users to interact with news&nbsp;content.</p> Plan <p>The session will begin with a brief introduction to digital methods (Rogers 2013) and the field of ‘platform studies’ (Bogost and Montfort 2009; Gillespie 2010; Dijck 2013), which will serve as a loose framework through which to study existing news platforms as well as perform analyses on social media platforms as sites for news and journalism. This will be supplemented by the works of Anne Helmond (2015) and Tarleton Gillespie (2010).</p><p>Following this, participants will be divided into groups of four-six, with each group anchored by a volunteer, with added support from the two co-leaders. They will then be given the task of formulating a research question that makes use of one or more of the digital methods presented and are also required to frame a methodology that makes allowances for the particularities of the Indian news environment. The session will conclude with a brief discussion based on their findings.</p><p>The goal of the workshop will be to explore how digital methods can be aligned with current concerns about news and journalism in India, and open up avenues for research that acknowledges that online news occupies a space that includes natively digital objects and information architectures and hence demands research methods specific to this environment. The workshop also aims at reflecting on potential collaborations between researchers in media studies, data scientists and technologists in developing a comprehensive methodology using which to study digital media in&nbsp;India.</p> Readings <p>Gillespie, Tarleton. “The Politics of ‘Platforms’.” New Media &amp; Society 12, no. 3 (2010):&nbsp;347–364.</p><p>Rogers, Richard. “The End of the Virtual: Digital Methods,” Digital Methods.

Madeline Howard
 What do you do and what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m delighted to wear a few different hats! My day job is the Socio-Technical Engagement Manager at Cygenta, where I work on the human side of cyber security. I particularly focus on awareness, behaviour and cultural change. I love my field of work as I constantly feel as though I’m making a positive difference to help people and organisations to live more secure lives.</p>
<p>Cygenta also supports me as an <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/industry-100-introduction">i100 for the National Cyber Security Center</a> and their CyberFirst Schools programme. I dedicate one day a week to this – and I absolutely LOVE this part of my job.</p>
<p>Here, I get to work with amazing international, national and local companies to inspire, excite and enthuse the next generation about computer science and cyber security. It’s so rewarding to make a difference to the futures of young people while also supporting the industry talent pipeline.</p>
<p>Finally in my spare time, I’m a Director of Cyber Cheltenham, CyNam. It is a real privilege to be a Director of the UK’s largest cyber cluster and support the development of the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>So what gets me out of bed in the morning? Well I’m passionate about making a positive difference. Whether that is in improving organisations and individuals cyber security awareness, exciting the next generation about their future opportunities or developing the incredible cyber security ecosystem we have, I always want to make a positive impact.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>It was not exactly a ‘traditional’ route! I studied Geography at Newcastle University and really didn’t know what I wanted to do. Well that’s a lie, I knew my dream job was to be a weather girl… still true! When I finished university, I started in a role within cyber security working in business development. In months I knew I’d found my niche! I loved the pace at which this sector moves and it’s great to be constantly learning about how we engage with technology.</p>
<p>I was keen to pursue a career, raising awareness about cyber security. At Cygenta, I am extremely lucky enough to work for – and be mentored by – Dr Jessica Barker. One thing I recognise is that I’ve always been really lucky to have lots of fantastic people to turn to for advice and guidance and support when I’ve had to make tough decisions during my career.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned is to go with your gut, ALWAYS.</p>
<p>I’ve had lots of great opportunities but I nearly turned down some of these simply because I over-thought things. Sometimes things can feel like a risk but if it feels right in your gut it normally is . And, if it doesn’t work out, you’ll still have learned so much simply by learning to take a risk – it’ll all help to shape the future you.</p>
 What’s your advice to CEOs in the identity space? 
<p>STOP: Thinking that your employees are your ‘human firewall’ against cyber attacks and incidents. The human firewall suggests your employees should prevent attacks and incidents. When it comes to cyber attacks, you can’t prevent every incident, and so this is a totally unrealistic ask on individuals. It also doesn’t prepare people for what to do when something does go wrong.</p>
<p>START: Developing individuals as ‘Human Sensors’. The concept of human sensors suggests that individuals know how to detect and respond to incidents. They understand the indicators of compromise and feel empowered to approach the correct individuals or platforms to report incidents. This ultimately minimises the fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) they may have when they think an incident has occurred.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: Investing in cyber security – not just the technology but talent development and people skills. Ensure your employees feel confident and empowered to positively engage with cyber security to improve your response and resilience capabilities.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>In all aspects of life, diversity is the enabler for growth, innovation, collaboration and positive change.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p><a href="https://thegogiver.com/"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://thegogiver.com/">“The Go-Giver”</a>.</p>
<p>It really resonated with me. In short, it suggests we shouldn’t do things because we expect something in return but because we just want to help. It is a fantastic ethos to live by – it’ll empower you to become the best version of yourself!</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Care less about what people think of you.</p>
<p>It’s not ‘uncool’ to want to achieve.</p>
<p>Go with your gut and everything will work out.</p>
<p>And, finally, accept that you can’t be in control of everything.</p>
<p>I tell myself everyday ‘I wonder if the stars will align?’. If something works out, the stars have aligned. I don’t know anything about the stars but sometimes when things work out, it’s nice to visualise the stars aligning and shining for you.</p>

<p>By Kacie Harold, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the <a href="http://www.ethicalexplorer.org/">Ethical Explorer Pack</a> — a toolkit designed to help tech workers spark dialogue about the future impacts of their designs, identify early warning signs, and brainstorm positive solutions. This week, we are sharing some additional, practical advice from leading experts on how to mitigate against several of the tech risk zones (or potential downsides) and ensure technology is safe, fair, and compassionate.</p><p>Matt Mitchell is a hacker and <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/people/matt-mitchell/">Tech Fellow</a> at <a href="https://fordfoundation.org/">The Ford Foundation</a>, working with the BUILD and Technology and Society teams to develop digital security strategy, technical assistance offerings, and safety and security measures for the foundation’s grantee partners. Matt has also worked as the Director of Digital Safety &amp; Privacy at Tactical Tech, and he founded CryptoHarlem, which teaches basic cryptography tools to the predominately African American community in upper Manhattan.</p><p>Matt, why should small and midsize tech companies want to address issues of surveillance and think about data privacy and security for their&nbsp;users?</p><p>I recently spoke with founders of a blockchain, cryptocurrency social media startup that values “humans first”. Privacy came up briefly in the conversation. As a small team going through their first round of funding, they are motivated to build quickly, get people to use the product, and then find a way to monetize it. I suggested they create a transparency report and a plain speak privacy policy because this would give them competitive advantage, and it speaks to the motivations of that team. When you are building a product that’s new, existing companies and competitors might not have these things, so focusing on privacy is really easy, lo-hanging fruit when it comes to feature development. You can go a long way to earning the trust of your users and build engagement when people know that using your product isn’t going to compromise their security in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Are there any common surveillance related problems companies run into when they build a new products or features?</p><p>When you’re making a product, there’s a temptation to gather as much data as possible because, in the worst case scenario, maybe you’re VC-funded and you’re losing your seed funding. The money you have to play with every month is going down and you’re not really meeting your KPIs, but you do know your users. If you reach a place where you may have to lose some staff, it can be tempting to sell user information or what you know about user behavior.</p><p>Monetizing user data usually seems like a good idea at the time. But it always turns out to be something that hurts you, because it hurts your relationship with the users. When your users can’t trust you anymore, they begin seeing you as the lowest part of what you provide. You are no longer delighting the users, and then they lose the reason why they’re there, and it becomes so easy for someone to replace&nbsp;you.</p><p>You may be approached by a company who is interested in just a small part of what you do, for instance, something related to user behavior. This is where you should say “no”. You are still empowered to say “no” at that moment. But as soon as you say “yes”, even if it’s just to sell a little bit of information, but only to trusted partners in certain conditions, that criteria starts sliding really quickly, especially if you are not the only one making decisions or you have funders or VCs you report to. Once you make it, you can’t undo it. You can’t unbuild a surveillance apparatus.</p><p>Another common problem is that teams are working on tight timelines, and it can be hard to find the time to make sure they are doing things right, and without guidance, they don’t know when they are doing something wrong. When it comes particularly to surveillance, people don’t have a good mapping of things that equal surveillance in their industry and in their products. Engineers aren’t thinking they want to add surveillance to something, they just want to build a tool. They don’t realize when the different elements of what they built and the data they are collecting can be used to monitor and harm&nbsp;users.</p><p>What can teams do to prevent surveillance issues from creeping up on&nbsp;them?</p><p>I think harm reduction on a micro-intervention level is a helpful practice because it’s just adding a few minutes into a workday that is full of loose minutes. When you’re trying to fix a broken app or a broken world it can take years, and you won’t necessarily have any wins. This is why it is important to invest those minutes and prevent these&nbsp;harms.</p><p>Everyone on the team needs to be equipped with tools and information to identify and prevent surveillance-related harms. For engineers, (quality assurance), and the debugging team, using basic checklists on a regular basis can help prevent problems and identify moments where the team should slow down and evaluate whether there may be a surveillance issue developing. Product managers and UX should create user personas that include information about how that user could be harmed, if your tool were used for surveillance.</p><p>Finally, give your team an “emergency brake” that anyone can pull anonymously, if they see an emerging harm, or something that violates the values your team or company has agreed upon. Make it clear ahead of time that if the emergency brake is pulled, the team will dedicate a sprint to fixing the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>What advice would you give tech builders who are just starting to think about surveillance?</p><p>Reading doesn’t seem like the first thing you want to do when starting a company and focused on finding funding, hiring engineers, and building a prototype. But reading doesn’t take long, and the value it saves you in protecting you from liability, enhancing your ability to compete, and building trust with your users pays itself back in dividends.</p><p>I recommend reading about Black [people] using technology, because those use cases open up a set harms that you can apply to almost everything. Two books I like are <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/dark-matters-on-the-surveillance-of-blackness/9780822359388">Dark Matters</a> by Simone Brown, an amazing book on the surveillance of Black folks, and <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/algorithms-of-oppression-how-search-engines-reinforce-racism/9781479837243">Algorithms of Oppression</a> by <a href="https://omidyar.quip.com/XKgdAsdCCxXq/Interview-with-Safiya-Noble-EE-blog-edit">Safiya Umoja Noble</a>. When you know better, you can do&nbsp;better.</p><p>You can learn more about Matt’s work and watch his talks and security training videos on <a href="https://medium.com/@geminiimatt/whoami-a513e9e4c02f">Medium</a>, or follow him on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/geminiimatt">@geminiimatt</a>.</p>

<p>A cross-community effort to standardize on common, DID-anchored capabilities</p><p>If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DID</a>) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented. The addresses take the form of a long, opaque “string” (a long block of letters and numbers, in this case of a fixed length), and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID “documents”</a> that get returned when they are queried contain some cryptographic key material and, depending on the particularities of the returning system, maybe a few other pieces of information or addresses.</p><p>Identity systems have traditionally been largely hierarchical, focusing on asymmetrical or vertical relationships. The most open system that allows horizontal communications between users in different systems is email, and even there, user-to-user communications are mediated by servers, which banlist each other based on a federated reputation system. DIDCommunications (DIDComm), on the other hand, is a set of tools to allow horizontal (or at least, power-neutral) and bidirectional channels of communication between two entities that know each other’s DIDs and nothing else. It resembles today’s end-to-end encryption systems like Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp more than it resembles traditional email.</p> How DIDComm&nbsp;works <p>DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that&nbsp;DID.</p><p>This architecture is powerful because it provides a way to do mutual authentication between any two parties. Right now many systems of messaging and communication on the open web don’t provide for mutual authentication with cryptography; they ask individuals to authenticate to sites or businesses (nowadays mostly with single-sign on integrations, i.e. “log in with your XXX account” buttons), and these businesses vouch for and secure the end-user. In exchange, businesses get valuable insight into the communications or commercial activity they facilitate — insights they often sell to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Furthermore, while the onus is on individuals to authenticate themselves to these enabling institutions and middlemen, the business themselves do little to authenticate themselves reciprocally. Over time, the “lock icon” next to URLs in modern browsers has come to be a useful norm (and users have been habituated to reacting suspiciously to any website which cannot provide on). However, phishing attacks, where intercepted or falsified communications lead users to malicious websites impersonating ones they trust, continue to be a major attack vector for fraud and identity theft. By supporting mutual authentication, a more uniform and democratic protocol is established for secure communications, which raises the bar for user expectations for security assurances from institutions and websites.</p> A Quick History of DIDComm and the Aries Protocols <p>DIDComm was first developed within an international and collaborative open source co-development project called <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> (hosted at <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger</a>) and under a IPR regime <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs#about">designed to cover</a> software but not specifications. Aries was spun out of the earlier Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a> project, to both iterate, expand, and make more blockchain-agnostic the codebase and tooling created earlier for the identity blockchain Indy. In the same process, Hyperledger <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Ursa</a> was also created to advance the underlying cryptographic elements independently of the blockchain and the identity systems relying on it. The Indy project continues evolving as well, from a single blockchain to a family of <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36734079">interoperable</a> ones.</p><p>The name “DIDComm” and version 1 of its libraries and designs evolved in this context: it adapted the Indy-specific horizontal communications libraries to a more agnostic Aries context and iterated them to be more configurable for new contexts and implementations. At some point, however, it became clear that further interoperability would be best served not by writing specifications based on existing Aries implementations, but by a more “green-field”, specification-first design process with interlocutors from further afield. This work came to be co-sponsored by DIF and Hyperledger partly to engage these outside interlocutors, and partly because the IPR protections of DIF were more appropriate to a specification-first open-standards process. The charter of the DIDComm working group at DIF&nbsp;.</p>Source: CHAPI101/DIDComm101 <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">joint session</a> at&nbsp;#<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a> The Future of&nbsp;DIDComm <p>Since the chartering process began in September of 2019 at the post-IIW DIF Face to Face, the work of designing a new core for DIDComm and thinking through new features and structure has proceeded at a steady clip. The implementations and details are still being hammered out in some places, but the feature set is stable. The benefits of the new protocol will&nbsp;include:</p>  Mutual authentication  Robust, email-like threading support for relying messaging systems (including error-handling and other machine-readable messaging systems)  Support for new security and transport primitives like the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">JWM&nbsp;envelope</a>  Asynchronous by default, but with synchronous communication modes also supported  Offline support so that two agents who are not online can exchange information via bluetooth or QR&nbsp;Code  Easy to support with a web server (among many other topographies)  Many of the positive qualities of the earlier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/soap12/">SOAP</a> protocol, include message format standards, routing, transport agnostic support, and subprotocols.  <p>This effort has the direct support and participation of many core members of the Aries community. It is within the plans of the Aries community to migrate to DIDComm V2 as it becomes ready for use and tested. In both existing DIDComms (many of which are already in production), protocols relying on a DIDComm-encrypted channel for authentication or communications functions will be moved over. The relationship between DIDComm and these relying “subprotocols” is quite similar to the relationship between HTTP and the APIs created on top of HTTP — an upgrade to the underlying security or feature set will not affect the relying applications that just need a secure&nbsp;channel.</p><p>There is <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/111">some consternation</a> about the use of the term “DIDComm Protocols” to describe the various different types of exchange or transactions that could be built on a DIDComm foundation. Regardless of whether one chooses to call them “protocols” or something else, a cross-community standard will be crucial to co-developing broadly interoperable capabilities and common libraries on the basis of secure, authenticated DIDComm channels. Some examples of what these would&nbsp;include:</p>  Secure user messaging or even chat-like instant messaging  Issuing a credential  Presenting a credential or an identity&nbsp;proof  Interactions with IOT systems or even directly with specific, authenticated devices  Payment coordination   Getting involved <p>A good place to jump in would be this video recorded by DIDComm WG Chair Sam Curren at the June DIF Face-to-face meeting:</p><p>With this background, a read through the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/master/Org%20documents/WG%20documents/DIF_DIDcomm_WG_Charter_v1.pdf">charter</a>, the mailing list <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/didcomm-wg/topics">archives</a>, the github <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/DIDComm-js">repository</a>, or the Slack channel of the DIDComm <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">working group</a> at DIF will make a lot more sense; as will DIDComm sessions at the new IIW and F2F meetings.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Whether, why, and how to attend the biannual conference along with&nbsp;DIF</p><p>The <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a> is an interactive “un-conference” that has convened various kinds of researchers, identity technology companies, and thinkers since 2005. It brings together a wide swath of people working towards great control of the digital representations of themselves, incorporating theoretical, market-building, research, and policy-oriented projects. This coming month, the 31st edition will be held entirely only on the Qiqochat platform, like the 30th edition before&nbsp;it.</p> The Storied History of&nbsp;IIW <p>Kaliya Young, Doc Searls and Phil Windley founded the conference in 2005. At the time, all three were active in a group known as “the Identity Gang”. They had been discussing identity technology concepts in detail on a mailing list since meeting each other at Digital Identity World in the fall of 2004; after a year of passionate discussions, there came a point where an in-person meeting felt necessary. The first meeting was in Berkeley, California, and ever since it has been hosted at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. It has moved online-only since the Covid-19 pandemic began in early&nbsp;2020.</p><p>In 2005, many in the community were blogging and writing about identity and related themes. Some had made broad and widely acclaimed pronouncements like Kim Cameron, most known in this regard for his essay, <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=1065">The Seven Laws of Identity.</a> One early collaboration within the community was a <a href="http://wiki.idcommons.net/Lexicon">Lexicon</a> that has aged well. Many were also writing code and founding projects to realize their various visions. At the first IIW, eight different projects gave structured presentations on the first day, while the second day was devoted to a more open-ended and collaborative synthesis, facilitated by Kaliya Young using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Open Space Technology</a>.</p><p>At that first event, several of the projects focused on using URLs as identifiers for individuals, who could authenticate against these as they moved around the early Web 2.0, commenting on different sites. Conversations at the event were formative on the OpenID protocols and the OpenID Foundation. Since then, many different protocols have been conceived and/or nested at the conference, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, <a href="http://www.simplecloud.info/">SCIM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_card">Information Cards</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Resource_Identifier">XRI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDI">XDI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebFinger">Web Finger</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_(protocol)">Salmon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSub">PubSubHubbub</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>The event attracts people from all over the world and continues to be the “biggest tent” for collaboration and ideation across the various user-centric identity spheres and communities, particularly for what is now called “decentralized identity” or “self-sovereign identity”. You can see the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">book of proceedings</a> from most of the IIWs for the last 15 years, refined and edited in the month after each organic and <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/engagement-guidelines/">self-organizing</a> event.</p> The Decentralized Identity Foundation at&nbsp;IIW <p>IIW has always been a neutral venue where diverse groups across the community focused on the decentralized identity, that often work in parallel between IIWs, come together to report out and understand each other’s projects. Furthermore, many attendees come from established sectors of the software industry, such as Enterprise Identity and Access Management (EIAM), Cybersecurity, or Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). This creates a healthy mix of specialists, professionals, activists, and novices, balancing the “bikeshedding” of technology specifics with societal conversations and industry-wide trends and roadmaps. The open culture of DIF and its commitment to integrations with today’s identity technologies thrive in this environment, and many key DIF collaborations have begun or successfully recruited new participants at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>Anyone who attends from any of the myriad organizations in the space can put agenda/discussion topics forward, which also makes it a very generative place for researchers, innovators, and market-watchers. Many of the DIF working groups present their latest work at the event for technical or business review, and it is a key venue for soliciting insightful feedback from related organizations and industry stakeholders. Sometimes projects in early stages of development, specification, or scoping even do requirements gathering or technical sanity-checks at the&nbsp;event.</p><p>Historically, the DIF has hosted a one-day face-to-face meeting immediately before or after the IIW conference proper to take advantage of the geographic co-location of so many key players. This time around, however, DIF is experimenting with a more spaced-out approach to allow for a period of processing of the IIW sessions to allow for a more complementary role 5 or 6 weeks after the fact. Stay tuned for more details about design or development sprints to take place bookended by the two&nbsp;events.</p> Hot Topics across #IIW30 and&nbsp;#IIW31 <p>At the last IIW, DIF working groups put forward these sessions:</p>  The internal governance group shared its new <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Code_of_Conduct_-_at_DIF">Code of Conduct </a>and the <a href="https://identity.foundation/open-groups/glossary.html">Glossary Group</a> also gave a presentation on its <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/finding-the-bell-curve-of-meaning-61a1d22b7bdd">methodology</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Glossary_Results_-_Credentials,_Wallets,_Agents_Defined._%2B_Next_Steps">results</a>  There were four different sessions presenting and gathering feedback on four different aspects <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/%22KERI_(A)_Key_Event_Receipt_Infrastructure._A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">of</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_-Part_B_Key_Event_Reciept_Infrastructure.A_ledger_agnostic_framework_for_decentralized_identity._KERI_unifies_many_DID_methods_types.">the</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_(C)_KACE_Agreement_Algorithm_Recoveryhttps://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf%22">KERI&nbsp;</a><a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/KERI_Implementation:_Whats_Next_DID:UNI_Method._Ref_Imp._DIF_Project.">project</a>.  Similarly, there were multiple presentations on the BBS+ signature suite at the heart of both the Aries <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/BBS%2B_JSON-LD_ZKPs_and_Aries_%26_Indy._Your_Thoughts%3F">AnonCreds2</a> system for verifiable presentations and a novel <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD_using_BBS%2B_-_Round_2">JSON-LD-based system</a>, development of which continues to be lead by Mattr&nbsp;Global.  The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm</a> WG gave a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/DIDComm_WG_Progress_Update">progress report</a>, which was particularly important to many stakeholders in the Aries community not involved in the autonomous research &amp; development project. A separate session was held on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/JSON_Web_Messaging_(JWM):_What_are_they_and_why_are_they_useful_for_secure_messaging_sytems%3F">JSON Web Messaging (JWM)</a> proposal that the DIDComm WG submitted to the&nbsp;IETF.  Similarly, there was a well-attended joint progress report on the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Sidetree_Protocol_/_Element_DID_and_Friends">SideTree Protocol / Element DID and Friends</a>&nbsp;, as well as an update from the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/TxAuth_and_XYZ_(and_Maybe_someday_OAuth_3)">XYZ project</a> to iterate the OAuth protocol.  A breakthrough <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/101_Session:_Verifiable_Credential_Handler_(CHAPI)_and_DIDComm">panel</a> (which was recorded — see previous link) explored the potential interaction or combination of the complementary browser-based CHAPI communications/transport protocol and the more browser-independent work of the DIDComm&nbsp;WG  Frameworks and ecosystem maps were presented by the new Trust-over-IP foundation, the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Understanding_MyData_Operators_-_white_paper_published_today">Operators</a> <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">project</a> of MyData Global; certification programs were announced and outlined by the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/Intro_to_the_Me2B_Alliance_Testing_Specification">Me2B Alliance</a> and the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ID2020_Certification:_feedback_and_next_steps">ID2020</a>&nbsp;project.  For a more detailed overview of highlights, see Juan Caballero’s <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/lessons-from-the-internet-identity-workshop-2020-89a4915c4658">detailed recap</a> for the <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">company blog</a> of DIF member organization, Spherity&nbsp;GmbH  For the complete, edited notes from all sessions, see the <a href="https://github.com/windley/IIW_homepage/raw/gh-pages/assets/proceedings/IIW_30_Book_of_Proceedings.pdf">Proceedings Book</a> (sponsored by DIF member organization, Jolocom&nbsp;GmbH)   Heading into the 31st IIW, we can expect significant interest and attendance at sessions on these&nbsp;topics:   A progress report on the alignment of the browser-native Presentation Exchange DIF specification and the relevant Aries RFCs and libraries  Moving KERI from prototype to actual implementations (and integrations!), as well as Drummond Reed’s less-technical introduction entitled “KERI for Mere&nbsp;Mortals”  Cross-method interoperability and portability, within and beyond Indy networks (which are proliferating quickly in&nbsp;Europe!)  Test Suites and a process to incentivize (or even fund?) revisions of major specifications to include more explicit test&nbsp;vectors  Lessons from the mid-2020 DID-Core sprint and PING W3C Security&nbsp;Review  Updates on OIDC-DID bridging work, OAuth &amp; GNAP, and fast-moving regulatory changes in Europe and North&nbsp;America   Making your IIW&nbsp;plan <p>DIF has had great success presenting work at IIW — and increasingly, it is becoming an important aspect of our educational and outreach efforts to post recordings of these presentations on our youtube <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ?c=UCicZIzvOXOyij0A6jlA7nxQ">channel</a>. We’re hoping this tradition will build more momentum at the upcoming&nbsp;IIW!</p><p>The event is a great opportunity for those who are already very active in the community working on standards and code related to decentralized identity. It is also a great opportunity for those who are very new to get up to speed quickly via what language professors call “deep immersion.” It is very welcoming and friendly, and since each session includes experts from different fields, there are few assumptions and much level-setting. DIF leadership attends the event and encourages its membership to actively participate.</p><p>For those already planning to attend, please note that a skeletal structure is already <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/schedule/">posted</a>. The most important sessions to attend are each day’s “agenda creation” sessions; the “demo hour” sessions for live demos of new products and prototypes, and the “closing circle” readouts from each day’s events are close seconds. Cordoning off those timeslots in your calendar weeks in advance is highly recommended, as a way of keeping those timeslots free of conflicts in your home time&nbsp;zone!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-at-iiw31-f8aafe64c985">DIF at #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>OASIS and the OASIS Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) TC are pleased to announce that AMQP Request-Response Messaging with Link Pairing Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for this specification. AMQP defines links as unidirectional transport for messages between a source and a target. A common messaging pattern is that of “request-response”, that is, two parties partaking in a bidirectional conversation using messages. This document defines a common pattern for pairing two unidirectional links to create a bidirectional message transport between two endpoints.

<p>Dear OpenID Foundation Members:</p>
<p>It is with a heavy heart to share this news with you. Don Thibeau, after many years of his excellent service, informed the OpenID Board of his intention to move on from his position as the Executive Director at the end of 2020 to pursue other opportunities and challenges in the identity space. This is such a loss for the Foundation, as we would never have grown to what we are without Don’s dedicated service as a colleague and friend to many of us.</p>
<p>Don has committed to the Board of Directors to provide the time needed to ensure a successful transition to new leadership in 2021. Don will continue to be instrumental through his tenure in the many liaison relationships that the Foundation has under way.</p>
<p>I have asked Vice Chairman Bjorn Hjelm to lead the Foundation’s transition to new leadership in 2021. The Executive Committee and the Board of Directors have started this work under Bjorn’s direction and will continue to communicate with membership and the community at large on our progress. If you have any questions or input into this process, please direct your inquiries to <a href="mailto:bjorn.hjelm@oidf.org">Vice Chairman Bjorn Hjelm</a>.</p>
<p>This is an important transition in the evolution of the OpenID Foundation. The Board of Directors is committed to taking the time required to successfully execute a transition plan while being transparent in our efforts, and continuing the work of the Foundation with its members and working groups. Thank you for your continued support and contributions to the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura<br>

 Urs Gasser on two new books — and what’s&nbsp;ahead <p>The precariousness of the early days of the pandemic turned parents into educators and scholars scrambling to make sense of the historic challenges faced by our societies and the institutions governing them.</p><p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a>, the Executive Director of the Berkman Klein Center (BKC) and Professor of Practice at Harvard Law School, has co-authored two timely books that inform both of those struggles.</p><p>Gasser co-authored <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/john-palfrey/the-connected-parent/9781541618022/?fbclid=IwAR0ulyZ9NQKm-mqVQdg6WidnjTpS6IqSswaAgAChB2W7OJOV6IVGjV035kU">The Connected Parent</a> with <a href="https://www.macfound.org/about/people/president/">John Palfrey</a>, president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which turns a decade of academic research into practical guidance for parents raising children in a “digitally connected” world. He also wrote an essay series published in German (<a href="https://www.helbing.ch/detail/ISBN-9783719044022/Pandemie-als-Verbundkrise-und-digitales-Ph%C3%A4nomen">Pandemie als Verbundkrise und digitales Phaenomen</a>) that focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law. This book is co-authored with <a href="http://drolshammer.net/work-experience/">Jens Drolshammer</a>, professor emeritus at the University of St. Gallen and former BKC faculty associate.</p><p>We spoke with Gasser about the books, threads between them, and what he is working on&nbsp;next.</p> You’re the co-author of two new books to be published within a few weeks’ time. Let’s start with “The Connected Parent”. In a nutshell, what is this book&nbsp;about? <p>“The Connected Parent”, written with my friend and long-time collaborator John Palfrey, offers advice to parents and other caregivers on how to support their children as they grow up in an increasingly digitally connected environment. The book includes very practical advice and suggestions. John and I summarized the best available research, including 15 years of <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">youth and media</a> work at the Berkman Klein Center (BKC), to help parents figure out how to think about issues like screentime, social media usage, privacy and well-being, digital activism and citizenship skills, to name just a few — and what to do about them to minimize risk and embrace opportunities.</p> Your second book focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law. Can you tell us more about&nbsp;it? <p>This book is published in German and in the form of an essay collection. It offers initial reflections on COVID-19 as a specific type of risk that Judge Posner a decade ago in a seminal <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/catastrophe-9780195306477?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">book</a> described as a “catastrophic risk” — something most recently also taken up in Tony Ord’s <a href="https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/toby-ord/the-precipice/9780316484893/">new&nbsp;book</a>.</p><p>The texts were written during the “lockdown” and in collaboration with my former teacher and previous BKC associate Jens Drolshammer. Switzerland serves as a country case study to better understand what role the law plays during such a massive crisis. We have heard and learned a lot from public health experts during the crisis. Understandably, the legal system has been less front-and-center. Yet, it turns out that law is almost everywhere and hugely relevant especially during a crisis of this magnitude. Some of the essays also explore the historic role digital technologies play in dealing with COVID-19 — I call it metaphorically the first “digital pandemic.” We talk about the intersectionality of these&nbsp;things.</p> Both of these books are timely to the ongoing pandemic, in different ways. Are there any connecting points between these two&nbsp;books? <p>We submitted “The Connected Parent” manuscript before COVID-19 arrived in the US and were only able to add small references to it as our publisher was initially skeptical about how much of a “big deal” COVID-19 would be. Well, of course, now we know better. Parents and educators are trying to figure out how digital tech can be used to support kids around the world as their education is so deeply disrupted by COVID-19. The book will not give a full answer to the current crisis, but might be still helpful in the present based on the connected parent philosophy we sketch in the book. And we believe it offers sound longer-term guidance that helps parents to engage with their kids — and be connected with the digital world they live in. The book on the pandemic reflects on some of the educational experiences in real-time, albeit from a policy and not necessarily a parental perspective. There are also other connection points between the two books. Both are written with a broader audience in mind, and both are the fruit of collaboration.</p> What motivated you and John Palfrey to write “The Connected Parent”? Isn’t it unusual for scholars to write a parents’&nbsp;guide? <p>Yes, it is! John and I have already written several books together, including our 2008 and 2016 book “<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/node/99526">Born Digital</a>,” and in some ways, the new book is its cousin. Since our last book, we’ve been asked many times for more practical guidance than we were willing to offer in our previous work. And at some point, we decided to take on this challenge and translate what we can learn from research in ways that it translates into recommendations for parents. For me, it’s been a great learning experience to write this book. As academics, we are used to making all sorts of caveats — “can’t say, more research is needed” — where the data is shaky. But as a parent, you have to make decisions, whether you have scientific evidence or not. So we’ve tried to take this seriously and be helpful even where we don’t have all the answers. We did so by being very honest about what we know and what we don’t know — and then still give advice based on what we think makes sense based on our own experiences as researchers, educators, and parents. The <a href="http://youthandmedia.org/">Youth and Media</a> team at BKC has been very helpful to keep us honest and grounded.</p> In the introduction to the essay series on the pandemic, risk, digitization, and the law, you and Jens Drolshammer state that the book is an experiment. What do you mean by&nbsp;that? <p>It’s been an experiment in multiple ways. It’s experimental in the sense that it was written during the early moments of the pandemic, with lots of uncertainty and even unknown unknowns. The texts offer real-time observations and reflections, without a rigorous methodology, which of course means that our observations are not scientific and offered more in the spirit of early hypotheses. We looked at it like writing initial observations and questions into a personal journal and making these entries publicly available because it might be of interest to others as well. We did so based on stories, reports, news coverage, etc. we’ve collected from the first day of the pandemic based on a set of 10 criteria.</p><p>So both the format and working style is experimental, at least for me. We hope that these early and only tentative entries into what we termed our “logbook” might invite more rigorous work over the years to come. It’s also an experiment to write and publish such a book across the Atlantic during such an extraordinary time.</p> Will you publish an English translation of the&nbsp;book? <p>I don’t think so. While I enjoy the challenge of writing and publishing in two different languages, I generally don’t feel excited about translating what I’ve written in one language to the other. To me, it’s about more than translating the text: When writing in German or English, I think differently about what I am going to say and how — it’s like flipping a&nbsp;switch.</p><p>That said, a brief summary with some of the key observations, as well as a transatlantic conversation with Professor Martha Minow and John Palfrey that is included in the essay collection, is also <a href="https://medium.com/@ugasser/pandemic-as-a-composite-crisis-and-digital-phenomenon-ba45cb5e3b9b">available on&nbsp;Medium</a>.</p> Do you plan to continue writing books, and if so, what’s&nbsp;next? <p>I try to keep a balance as far as types of contributions are concerned. I’m working on a number of shorter articles right now, but have another book project lined up — this time a book on the turn to information and information law, which brings me back to the roots of my academic&nbsp;life.</p><p>On a personal level, I enjoy working on books because it forces me to learn and engage in different ways than what has become the dominant mode in today’s professional lives. I’m acutely aware that both reading and writing books are an enormous privilege, and I couldn’t be more grateful for&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/urs-gasser-on-two-new-books-and-whats-ahead-de04c663b385">Urs Gasser on two new books — and what’s ahead</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>I’m working for HSBC and have been here since May 2016 doing a variety of roles, but recently (well since Jan 2018), I have been getting my fingers dirty in something very exciting –&nbsp; defining and creating a brand new strategic capability for the Bank called – Events Based Data Assurance – which will underpin our Digital Identity efforts.</p>
<p>Essentially, all Digital Identity is customer data that we trust. We have a lot of customer data in the Bank but we don’t record why we trust this data and so we ask the customer to prove who they are over and over again. i.e. when someone wants to open a new account, we ask them to prove their ID by showing us their passport. Someone in the Bank will look at the passport, match the photo on the passport to the person standing in front of them, and confirm that they match. However, what is recorded is the person’s name, DOB, Nationality BUT not the event of ‘passport check in branch’.</p>
<p>If we recorded ‘why we trust the data’ using a new type of data called ‘EVENTS’ i.e. the event which led to us knowing why we trust a piece of data (in the above example, Suzie, a Branch advisor in our Canary Wharf branch checked that the photo on the passport matched the person in front of them and it matched, it unlocks a huge opportunity inside the bank to ‘RE-USE’ data across markets and functions – resulting in a fantastic customer experience and reduction in costly and often duplicative processes.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I started on the Barclays Bank Graduate Programme and tended to move around every 3 years or so to new places.</p>
<p>I had a curious mind and wanted to do ‘new’ things rather than be in a BAU type role.</p>
<p>I was hungry to learn and develop and so sought opportunities every time I felt like I had learnt all I could from an organisation. I’ve tried my hand at all sorts of things from Banking, to Management Consulting, to starting up a brand new dotcom business, to digitising an insurance company, studying for an MBA, moving to the online travel industry and then back to Digital Banking and now most recently, qualifying as a Personal Performance Coach and setting up a Coaching Business as a side hustle!&nbsp; I absolutely love helping people understand what their potential is and to guide them to go and realise this!</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson I have learnt along the way is to be your authentic self, don’t try and be someone who you’re not. I know this is difficult because we all suffer from this, especially us women. We’re always comparing ourselves with the person who is always getting the promotions, the attention, the recognition etc – but by trying to be like her, you slowly start to move away from who you are at your core – your authentic self.</p>
<p>This will only result in a lot of frustration and unhappiness which can become a huge problem.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re an individual with skills, experience and a personality which is unique to you. Embrace this and become comfortable in your own skin and let people see the real you! You’ll be surprised where this can lead!</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
 
 
 
 Writing down your internal business activities in a granular way – so that others can understand why they should trust this piece of data 
 Agree on a common data model which can be used to describe events 
 Define the key trusted providers in your country (utility companies, passport office, mobile phone companies, travel companies) who are willing to start exchanging data/ events with you; get them to write down what they do to assure data in a machine readable way (using the same data model) 
 
 
 Stop:
 
 Trying to solve for the World – start small, and then scale focusing on real life use cases 
 
 
 Continue:
 
 to have dialogue with organisations, governments and customers/ citizens to keep the conversation going so that potential solutions/ way forward are relevant 
 to define key customer/ citizen/ employee pain points and look to solve for these 
 
 
 
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>We are all unique and with this uniqueness, we each bring a different viewpoint to the same problem so be tolerant, embrace this difference and experience the powerful results that follow.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>I’d highly recommend ‘Man’s search for meaning’ by Viktor Frankl because it teaches us/demonstrates the power of the mind and resilience.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the quote in the book: “he who has a WHY to live can bear with almost any HOW……and what alone remains is the last of human freedoms is the ability to choose one’s attitude in a given set of circumstances.”</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Don’t be afraid, speak your mind, be yourself and think positive thoughts. As a kid growing up in the UK, I suffered from both racial discrimination and bullying – which impacted hugely on my self -confidence. I hid in my shell and didn’t feel as valued, important or equal to my peers and therefore didn’t take the opportunities that presented themselves to me because of this.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about what people will think; ask the ‘stupid’ questions and never feel that you’re not good enough!</p>

Unsurprisingly, scholars (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3250950">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/lawless/8504E4EC8A74E539D701A04D3EE8D8DE">here</a>) and civil society organizations (<a href="https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Regulating-speech-by-contract-WEB-v2.pdf.">here</a> and <a href="https://www.observacom.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Estandares-regulacion-grandes-plataformas-Internet.pdf.">here</a>) have expressed their support and the project has gained a lot of traction since David Kaye — then UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression — <a href="https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/38/35">promoted</a> it in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>However, adopting international human rights law might not lead to more legitimate content moderation rules. First, international human rights law is not a set of universally accepted rules. The framework favors some speech standards over other reasonable alternatives. The choice for those standards should itself be subject to a legitimate rule-making process. Second, international human rights law is in many areas highly indeterminate. It offers guidance but no precise answers to many challenging questions. In those cases, human rights law might not constrain the power of tech firms but instead only create the appearance of legitimacy. In other words, the proposal could mean business as usual with the added ‘legitimacy-aura’ of human rights&nbsp;law.</p> International Human Rights Law Is Not&nbsp;Neutral <p>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the Covenant) offers the primary international guidance for free expression standards. The Covenant puts a priority on some normative options over others in areas in which reasonable disagreement between legal systems, experts, and communities exists. Two current controversies illustrate this&nbsp;point.</p><p>In July, the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">Stop Hate for Profit</a> campaign brought together hundreds of companies. For one month, they withheld advertisement from Facebook demanding that the tech giant curb the spread of hate on the platform. Among other demands, the campaign requests the removal of groups focused on Holocaust denial. Although sensible and understandable, the request is in tension with Articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant. The Human Rights Committee, the body that authoritatively interprets this international treaty, <a href="https://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/gc34.pdf">has said</a>, “Laws that penalize the expression of opinions about historical facts are incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant imposes.” Indeed, in 2019, Kaye explicitly <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25174&amp;LangID=E">used</a> the bans on Holocaust denial as an example of a law that breaches states’ international obligation to protect freedom of expression.</p><p>In other areas, human rights law sides with the campaign’s demands. Stop Hate for Profit also asks that platforms apply their rules equally to politicians and other users. Twitter and Facebook, however, see things differently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they decided not to delete President Trump’s posts violating their rules on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274323/trump-twitter-glorifying-violence-minneapolis-shooting-looting-notice-restriction">glorification of violence</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/technology/twitter-trump-tweet-warning.html">election integrity</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/08/05/trump-post-removed-facebook/">COVID misinformation</a>. They reasoned that the public interest of citizens in learning what their representatives think in these cases outweighed the harmful effects of such speech. In other instances, Facebook did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/technology/trump-facebook-coronavirus-video.html">remove</a> a video posted by Trump’s campaign for spreading COVID-19 misleading information, and both firms <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199845/twitter-tweets-brazil-venezuela-presidents-covid-19-coronavirus-jair-bolsonaro-maduro">took down</a> content that Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro had posted in violation of their&nbsp;rules.</p><p>In this contentious debate, international law falls much closer on the side of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. Kaye’s 2019 report (see para. 47) explains that even though exceptions to protect political speech could in exceptional cases be acceptable, in principle politicians and the public ought to be subject to the same rules. According to the report, harmful speech can even be more dangerous when uttered by political leaders. Therefore, there are even stronger reasons to apply speech rules to these&nbsp;figures.</p><p>The main point is that reasonable disagreement exists about how to balance these different considerations when governing politicians’ speech. And the choices that international law (or the Human Rights Committee) makes in these debates are not obvious and not universally accepted. They should themselves be subject to the control of the people. Rather than shifting decision-making power from tech companies to the UN (although certainly a step forward), it is urgent to focus on building processes that can actually involve the public in the deliberation over speech&nbsp;rules.</p> Lending Legitimacy to Unconstrained Power <p>At the same time, international human rights law leaves many speech questions unanswered. I have written about the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/why-international-human-rights-law-cannot-replace-content-moderation-d3fc8dd4344c">contradictions</a> between regional human rights systems that the UN framework does not solve. A more fundamental open question is how to apply the legitimacy requirement of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to content moderation.</p><p>According to Article 19, all restrictions to freedom of expression must have a legitimate end. Legitimate ends for governmental restrictions on speech are the protection of national security or of public order or of public health or morals. Evelyn Aswad <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3250950">asks</a> the right questions: Which ends would be legitimate for content moderation rules set by private companies? Could tech companies claim a business interest as a legitimate purpose? And even if they were not entitled to rely on the most explicit commercial interests such as advertisers’ preferences, could these companies claim that a specific content moderation rule helps them shape the type of community they want to&nbsp;foster?</p><p>Most supporters of the proposal would acknowledge that it is necessary to let companies disallow content for the purpose of meeting the preferences and expectations of different users. This appears sensible. Otherwise, all the speech that international human rights law protects — including adult nudity, pornography, and many graphic depictions of violence — would likely have to be allowed on platforms such as Facebook. This would render platforms nearly useless to a large set of users that does not want to navigate through all forms of legal, but perhaps undesirable, speech. But the line between permissible and impermissible ends becomes blurry, and the Covenant, designed to be applied to states, definitely does not draw such a&nbsp;line.</p><p>As long as no line exists, international human rights law poses few constraints on what companies can do. For any rule a company might wish to set, it could articulate a public interest end that the rule advances. For instance, for nudity rules, tech firms could claim they are trying to avoid all possible non-consensual distribution of intimate images. For hate speech that does not incite violence, they could posit that they are creating a “safe” environment for communities that are disproportionately the target of such speech. And the list goes on. Susan Benesch has <a href="https://www.yalejreg.com/bulletin/but-facebooks-not-a-country-how-to-interpret-human-rights-law-for-social-media-companies/">proposed</a> helpful guidance to translate the requirements of Article 19 to content moderation. But unless broad consensus can be built around the meaning of terms such as “the protection of moral,” human rights law will lend its legitimate framework and vocabulary without meaningfully constraining private regulatory power.</p> International Human Rights Law as a Framework <p>Adopting human rights law as default content moderation rules can be a project of translation, meaning: take international law standards that already exist and translate them into implementable content moderation rules. For the reasons I discussed earlier, I have little faith in that&nbsp;project.</p><p>However, another proclaimed virtue of international human rights law is that it offers a common framework and vocabulary to guide the discussion between multiple actors on how to come up with a new language, a new rulebook specifically designed for online speech. Indeed, it may still be valuable to rely on the human rights framework not to answer all questions but to agree on what questions need to be asked (does the rule have a legitimate end? is the rule necessary to meet that end? are less intrusive measures available?). Tech companies (or anyone making the rules) can contribute to public reasoning and deliberation by being transparent about the lack of unequivocal answers. They should explain, instead, why they prefer certain rules and how they think about them through the lens of the standards set forth in Article 19 of the Covenant. That type of transparent reasoning could be the start of a dialogue with other actors in a shared language.</p><p>Such an approach resembles what Larry Lessig refers to as “latent ambiguities.” Lessig tried to imagine how judges would react to novel legal questions posed by the development of technology. In some cases, translation of already existing rules would be easy: for example, extending the protection of mail to electronic communications. In other cases, however, there is no unequivocal answer, and there is a need to decide anew how to regulate. For those situations, Lessig imagined that judges could promote democratic deliberation by identifying those “ambiguous” areas, proposing possible paths forward, and explaining how their own decisions would advance constitutional values.</p><p>There is one fundamental difference between Lessig’s work on judicial adjudication and content governance. In the case of judicial decision-making, legislatures could later contest the judges’ decisions. Lawmakers can debate and vote for a different rule. In the governance of online content, although civil society may well play a role in contesting the reasoning and choices tech firms offer, no institution has the authority equivalent to that of a legislature to move the dialogue forward. In that sense, the transparent reasoning of companies can be the beginning of a conversation, but it remains unclear who can “speak”&nbsp;next.</p><p>As Jonathan Zittrain <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3458435">argues</a>, the current era of content moderation requires experimentation with processes and institutions that can reconstruct legitimacy and open opportunities for people’s participation in online governance. Looking at international human rights law, to the extent that it offers a common framework to enable conversations, might be a step in that direction. I have tried to begin exploring which positions that framework gives priority to and to emphasize the need for finding other actors that have the capacity to contest the public reasoning of tech companies. Only then will international law be able to foster an actual conversation rather than a monologue uttered by tech firms in the guise of human rights language.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/international-human-rights-law-is-not-enough-to-fix-content-moderations-legitimacy-crisis-a80e3ed9abbd">International Human Rights Law Is Not Enough to Fix Content Moderation’s Legitimacy Crisis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.3 from the OpenDocument TC [1] is now available for public review and comment. This is the third public review for OpenDocument v1.3. The OpenDocument Format is an open XML-based document file format for office applications, to be used for documents containing text, spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. OpenDocument Format v1.3 is an update to the international standard Version 1.2, which was approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as ISO/IEC 26300 (2015). OpenDocument Format v1.3 includes improvements for document security, clarifies underspecifications and makes other timely improvements. The OpenDocument Format specifies the characteristics of an open XML-based application-independent and platform-independent digital document file format, as well as the characteristics of software applications which read, write and process such documents. It is applicable to document authoring, editing, viewing, exchange and archiving, including text documents, spreadsheets, presentation graphics, drawings, charts and similar documents commonly used by personal productivity software applications.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, FIDO Alliance Executive Director &amp; CMO&nbsp;</p>



<p>The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights_Actions_to_Counter_Email-Based_Attacks_on_Election-Related_S508C.pdf">&nbsp;issued an advisory</a> Thursday recommending cyber attack remedies for election-related activities&nbsp; including the use of FIDO authentication to thwart phishing&nbsp; attempts and account takeover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advisory, entitled “ACTIONS TO COUNTER EMAIL-BASED ATTACKS ON ELECTION RELATED ENTITIES” noted that 78 percent of cyber-espionage incidents are enabled by phishing. CISA makes specific recommendations on protecting against cyber attacks to aid organizations involved in election-related activities.</p>



<p>Among other recommendations, FIDO Authentication was highlighted to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover for cloud email and other high-value services. Specifically, CISA cites <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> Security Keys as a tool that campaigns and organizations can, and should, use to protect themselves. The advisory also recommends that, when available, campaigns and organizations should enroll users in advanced protection services such as <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">Google Advanced Protection</a>, which leverages FIDO Security Keys as a best practice over other 2FA methodologies to protect workforces from account takeovers related to malicious attacks.</p>



<p>FIDO security keys offer protection against phishing attacks by working as a second, physical factor of authentication and only authenticating when a user is on the correct website. Thus, even if a user is tricked into supplying their password to a phishing website, the physical security key will still block attackers from accessing their account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phishing continues to be a problem and remains one of the most popular means by which cybercriminals obtain data. Embracing FIDO technology is smart politics, and smart policy for those who understand the gravity of the cyber threat. As the election draws near, we’re increasingly seeing foreign agents <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-campaign-firm-hit-by-suspected-kremlin-hacking-attack">attempting</a> to infiltrate, influence and disrupt our elections.</p>



<p>As the CISA advisory implies, phishing and other cyber attacks are a critical issue with widespread and damaging implications to U.S. national security. The CISA advisory highlights the importance of locking down email systems, which have become a preferred vector for malicious activity. The CISA recommendations are intended as a preferred method for protecting the 2020 and future political campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In June, NIST put out a call for comments on the next iteration of its Digital Identity Guidelines, SP 800-63-4. We welcomed the opportunity to comment; read our full comments in the <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FIDO-ALLIANCE-Response-to-NIST-800-63-3-call-for-comments.pdf">Government &amp; Public Policy area of the website</a>.</p>



<p>Up front, we note that SP 800-63-3 represented a significant improvement in NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines, taking a more modern approach to identity proofing, authentication, and federation. That said, technology and threat are both never static, and we are encouraged to see that NIST is embarking on another revision of the document.</p>



<p>In our comments, we make three recommendations for SP 800-63-4:</p>



<p>1. NIST should adjust its approach to AALs to help implementers clearly differentiate between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, a variety of authenticators based on shared secrets – including Look-Up Secrets, Out-of-Band Devices (i.e., Push), and OTP apps and tokens – are given the same weight in AAL2 as authenticators based on asymmetric public key cryptography, such as FIDO. Given how attackers have caught up with the former, it no longer makes sense to combine&nbsp; these two types of authenticators under a single designation. Doing so misleads implementers into thinking these two categories of authenticators are equivalent in strength or resiliency. In our comments, we provide NIST with several ideas for how it can adjust the AALs to provide more differentiation between tools that are phishing resistant and those that are not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. NIST should engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements</p>



<p>When SP 800-63-3 was first published, it created a path for some FIPS 140 validated FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 – if those authenticators were deployed in concert with Token Binding to deliver Verifier Impersonation Resistance. Since that time, most major browser vendors have withdrawn support for token binding. Per discussions with NIST, we understand that this means that FIDO authenticators can no longer meet AAL3 without implementing other approaches to mitigate the loss of token binding. As NIST embarks on the next revision of SP 800-63, we urge NIST to engage with FIDO Alliance to explore other alternatives to enable FIDO authenticators to meet AAL3 requirements.</p>



<p>3. Provide more direct references to FIDO</p>



<p>SP 800-63B describes Requirements by Authenticator Type but is inconsistent in how it points to standards that support that type. This has created some confusion in the marketplace when implementers consult SP 800-63B and see reference to standards like OTP and PKI but do not see any specific reference to FIDO. In our comments, we offer three suggestions for how the guidance can directly reference FIDO so that implementers have a clearer understanding of where FIDO fits in and supports the requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We greatly appreciate NIST’s consideration of our comments and look forward to ongoing dialogue and collaboration as they seek to update the Digital Identity Guidance.</p>

<p>Our congratulations go to the OASIS Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Open Project on the approval and publication of the first Project Specification produced in the OASIS Open Projects program. Managing change and configuration in a complex systems development lifecycle can be very difficult, especially in heterogeneous environments that include homegrown tools, open source projects, and commercial tools from different vendors. The OSLC initiative applies World Wide Web and Linked Data principles to produce specifications that enable interoperation of change, configuration, and asset management processes across an entire application and product lifecycle. Quality Management builds on the OSLC Core Specification to define the test plans, test cases, and test results of the software delivery lifecycle that should be supported by an OSLC Quality Management provider. This Project Specification is the first of multiple outputs that are in process in the project, including the Core specification, Requirements Management, and Change Management. This Project Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the Project Governing Board of the OSLC OP, and fully ready for testing and implementation. The prose specifications and related files are available here: OSLC Quality Management Version 2.1 Project Specification 01 27 August 2020 – OSLC Quality Management Version 2.1.

 Local Ambassador, Helen Chua, gives a round-up of the latest WiD launch on August 28th 2020 
<p></p>
<p>There has been much discussion of the role of digital identity since the pandemic. Most countries have experienced lockdowns and are now looking to digitise many traditional services.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the pandemic clearly highlighted the digital divide. While much has already been done to fill the gap, there is still more to do. This was a key point made by Minister Indranee, the keynote speaker at our recent webinar.</p>
<p>She explained that the Singapore government’s enduring vision is to have a fair and just society where everyone has equal opportunity to fulfill their dreams. But, like many countries, social divisions have widened during COVID-19.</p>
<p>The launch of the WiD Singapore chapter is a timely one as it emphasizes the importance of digitalisation and digital identity. &nbsp;The Minister believes that, in order to encourage women into careers in these areas, we have to start educating young girls to the benefits and opportunities of STEM subjects.</p>
<p>Ms Rama Sridhar, EVP at Mastercard, highlighted that the establishment of WiD will further encourage women to participate as subject matter experts around various aspects of technology. It is one of WiD’s core objectives to encourage and support women into leadership roles.</p>
<blockquote><p>The establishment of WiD will further encourage women to participate in speaking as subject matter experts around various domains of technology.</p>
<p>Rama Sridhar, EVP at Mastercard</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I am very excited about the role that WiD can play in Singapore, promoting digital identity and digital inclusion. Digital identity empowers every business and individual to reach their full potential.&nbsp; This is just the beginning of our journey as the Singapore chapter and we really want to reach out to more Singaporeans to elevate, inspire and support women in their STEM careers.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group</a> (eKYC &amp; IDA WG) of the OpenID Foundation welcomes the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12528-EU-digital-ID-scheme-for-online-transactions-across-Europe/F548976">proposal of the Commission to extend the scope of eIDAS trust services</a> by introducing a new trust service for identification, authentication and for the provision of attributes, credentials and attestations and allowing the provision of identification for devices (Option 2 in the EC Revision of the eIDAS Inception Impact Assessment). This will allow companies operating identity solutions to contribute to securing digital transactions across the EU.</p>
<p>The eKYC &amp; IDA WG is a dedicated working group of the OpenID Foundation (the technical standardisation body specifying OpenID Connect and accompanying extensions). The OpenID Foundation delivers specifications for interfaces that enable interoperability between implementations, and the eKYC and Identity Assurance Working Group is focusing on use cases and extensions to OpenID Connect for communicating strong identity assurance. (<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/</a>).</p>
<p>Most commercial identity providers have built their solutions on OpenID Connect because of its strong support for mobile platforms, ease of integration, formally proven security, and the ability to have users explicitly consent. Billions of transactions are performed every day using OpenID Connect. A significant number of identity providers, e.g. financial institutions or telecommunications operators, are also able to assert digital identities on a level comparable to eIDAS trust level substantial or high. A significant number of relying parties and their developers are familiar with OpenID Connect as it is used for Open Banking as well as their own use cases. In order to leverage the respective digital identities for the EU Single Market, we recommend the commission to endorse OpenID Connect beside SAML (which was already endorsed under Implementing Act 2015/1501) as a technical standard for eIDAS.</p>
<p>We would also like to mention that several Identity Providers provide access to government issued identities via OpenID Connect and even eID systems use OpenID Connect, namely itsme (Belgium), BankID (Norway, Sweden, &amp; Finland), and France Connect (France). We think this is a strong evidence that OpenID Connect could facilitate the implementation of all options given in the inception impact assessment document.</p>
<p>We also know that most commercial identity providers provide a mixture of attributes maintained according to different trust frameworks and at different trust levels (just think of name vs eMail address) and even self asserted attributes for the same identity. Technical standards utilised to implement the updated eIDAS regulation should consider and support such use cases by providing a clear delineation between identity attributes verified and maintained according to different trust frameworks as well as accompanying metadata about sources, validation process, and trust level (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/TorstenLodderstedt/identity-assurance-with-openid-connect">https://www.slideshare.net/TorstenLodderstedt/identity-assurance-with-openid-connect</a>).</p>
<p>The commission might also want to consider use cases where the digital identity of EU citizens is used beyond the boundaries of the EU. The eKYC working group focuses on an international standard that is relevant to many jurisdictions with representatives from Japan, Australia, UK, US, France, Czech, and Germany. In our experience, international use cases increase the requirement for dedicated representation of the aforementioned metadata in the technical standard for attribute provisioning in order to allow the relying party to process identity data in a robust fashion.</p>
<p>Since the consultation paper mentions blockchain based identity solutions, we would like to point out that technical diversity in implementations is of utmost importance for innovations. However, adoption across member states and services requires technical interoperability. That’s why there is also work under way to provide a bridge between blockchain based identity solutions and relying parties via the mature and simple integration with OpenID Connect standard.</p>
<p>As subject matter experts in digital identity, we are thrilled with the direction eIDAS is taking and are more than happy to offer our advice in the course of targeted stakeholder interviews.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/2020/09/03/the-ekyc-ida-working-group-welcomes-the-proposal-of-the-european-commission-to-extend-the-scope-of-eidas-trust-services/">The eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group Welcomes the Proposal of the European Commission to Extend the Scope of eIDAS Trust Services</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a>.</p>

There are a growing number of interpretations and implementations of various decentralized standards. These standards are at different stages in their development lifecycles, harmonizing gradually. As a result, there are lots of data, from lots of sources, that, without a little planning, won’t play nicely with other data. It is exciting to see the enthusiasm around the standards we know and love and to watch the proliferation of verifiable and portable data. With implementation boundaries as a hindrance, data interoperability will continue to be difficult. We could lose much utility and portability of the data. Luckily, in the midst of this excitement, a great opportunity presents itself: to forge bridges between data islands and promote the cross-pollination of methodologies for generating and exchanging verifiable data. Enter: the Presentation Exchange specification.</p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims &amp; Credentials working group</a> has been hard at work on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange specification</a> for months. The effort, starting in January 2020, began to provide a solution to the question, “How should we request and exchange credentials across implementations and systems?” Though <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">a few solutions</a> <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof">have been proposed</a> <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">before</a>, none have been as inclusive in the data model and transport agnosticism, or able to attract broad adoption, as Presentation Exchange. The working group is working towards the first release — at the time of writing, we have made over 100 commits and closed 37 GitHub&nbsp;issues.</p><p>The specification prides itself on its adaptability, aiming to be “both credential format and transport envelope agnostic, meaning an implementer can use JWTs, VCs, JWT-VCs, or any other credential format, and convey them via OIDC, DIDComm, CHAPI, or any other transport envelope.” At the same time, Presentation Exchange has garnered the interest and support of many key-players throughout the ecosystem, a step crucial to fulfilling the ambitions of the specification.</p><p>You may be wondering, what’s up with the title? Isn’t interoperability much broader than sharing credentials? Yes! Absolutely. Sharing credentials is only part of interoperability. Universal wallets, secure data storage, transports, identifiers, DIDComm, and so many more pieces are paramount to thriving in an interoperable, decentralized ecosystem. At the heart of many of these interactions, we find ourselves exchanging verifiable data. By driving a standardized method for requesting and returning verifiable data, which adapts to many data models and functional use cases, we cross an important threshold in making interoperability possible. Without working software to back up the specification, it is merely an interesting idea. We need to go further — to make it an interesting reality.</p><p>Recognizing how important the Presentation Exchange spec and reference implementations could be for accelerating real interoperability and healthy competition, we, on the <a href="http://credentials.workday.com">Workday Credentials</a> team, are involved in the specification’s development and are investing significantly in one of its first demonstrable implementations. Workday has been a very active member of DIF since 2019. Our interests lie across the DIF stack, with a focus on standards compliance, affording us opportunities to interoperate with community members and standards adopters alike. Towards that end, we have <a href="https://github.com/workdaycredentials">open-sourced much of our code and specifications</a> relating to decentralized identity. For Presentation Exchange, we have <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange-implementations">recently pushed a Golang representation</a> of the object model that can be useful in building and validating presentation definitions, submissions, and verifiable presentations (as defined by the W3C standards). We are building out more Presentation Exchange logic that we plan to open source in the coming months. We intend to adopt Presentation Exchange at Workday as we gain confidence in the specification and its other implementations. We are considering different ways Presentation Exchange can be useful in interoperating with verifiable data that does not originate on our platform.</p><p>We are looking forward to seeing others contribute reference implementations in other languages and we encourage you to consider contributing to Presentation Exchange and DIF! For more information, please <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">reach out to DIF</a>, or jump in on the <a href="http://decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange:%20Specification%20that%20codifies%20an%20inter-related%20pair%20of%20data%20formats%20for%20defining%20proof%20presentations%20(Presentation%20Definition)%20and%20subsequent%20proof%20submissions%20(Presentation%20Submission)">public GitHub</a>.

 Silpa Mukherjee, Ankita Deb &amp; Rahul&nbsp;Kumar  Session <p>We propose to design the panel as a workshop with three paper presentations followed by an open discussion with the house exploring the key question of media objects‟ (in the form of film/film music/memes/gifs/trolls) changing relations with law; copyright and piracy having attained newer connotations in the age of media convergence. While we deal with the materiality of cinema in the new media moment, the session will open out debates on the mutability of media objects in a networked digital terrain ushered in by fast growing and cost-effective internet culture in urban&nbsp;India.</p><p>In terms of methodology the panel deploys media archaeology to trace the mutations that film culture has undergone in the digital age. The coexistence of the obsolete media copyright with its meme and its digitally re-mastered copy on torrent informs the research that the three papers involve. A certain engagement with the logic of informed/fan-cinephilic digital labour that unwittingly maintains and updates the algorithmic database of Web 2.0 services will run through the presentations. Along with archival research and interviews with professionals involved with online media companies and “users” who are now the “pirate/prosumer-cinephiles” of media objects, we will carry out extensive digital ethnography to map the chimera of digital territory that user traffic based internet culture in India helped&nbsp;produce.</p><p>The digital is a space of intervention: a space for the users to intervene and play with the material online. It is a constant form of participation underscoring a potential for democratic authorship. The definitive notion of authorship voices the overarching body of the state through its legal status. Thus copyright as a legal entity produces a discourse of power through this form of authorship. The contemporary medium or rather the multi-media constellation driven by internet culture in India produces an alternative discourse on authorship, complicating the notion of copyright and piracy at the same time. This charged terrain of (il)legality is also due to the nature of piracy in the digital domain, which does not exist in isolation but have now created bodies or spheres where it has been appropriated as a sub-cultural practice. The figure of the “pirate”/ the “troll”/ the “fan” and the “cinephile” now merges with the technologically enabled body of the user of new media who negotiates with the medium in multiple ways (and morphs it) and thereby touches all kinds of spaces within and outside the webspace. It has changed the physical scope of cinephilia as addressed in the paper “A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar,” where the culture of networked sharing evolves from and further complicates physical stations. It has permeated into the body of film music in the paper “Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item numbers and the web”, which interrogates the layers of user-based morphs that the text of a dance number in Bollywood undergoes in the culture of web based remixing and hacking. It changes the way protected materials like films circulate in the space designated as YouTube, marked by its ability to reproduce copyright materials without violating the law as the third paper titled “Online Streaming in the Era of Digital Cinephilia” points out; the logic of the obsolete license of old Hindi films which gains a new viral life on YouTube with its official upload vying with the multiple hacker-user uploads.</p><p>Thus the panel intends to explore the dizzying overlaps that produce this internet induced distinct zone of ambiguity that neither the law nor the state or the author can claim ownership over. The very embodiment of the material in the digital is in transition i.e. in a state of being morphedby the blurring of the identities of the multiple bodies at work at each moment. Through the three papers we intend to chart this transitional aesthetic sometimes contained and sometimes flowing out of the body of the media text onto the physical, technological and extra textual objects as well. The panel seeks to position this new world of media objects that overlap and form an uncontainable entity, seeking newer forms of negotiations with the older existing order. We seek to explore then what happens to the very essence of author(ity)ship when digital enters its&nbsp;domain.</p> Plan <p>A Laptop and a Pen-drive: Cinephiles of Mukherjee Nagar</p><p>With the changes technology has brought to contemporary life, cinephiles — for whom movies are a way of life, films and how they are experienced have undergone major changes. The classic cinephile, as the term was adopted in the 1960s has undergone a major change in the era of internet piracy. I will look at the way pirated films via torrent downloads are consumed by students in certain pockets in New Delhi especially around Mukherjee Nagar area. These students who come from the upwardly mobile Indian middle class families are engaged inpreparations of competitive exams to land a lucrative government job. Circumstances dictate that these students own a laptop to watch films but not a high speed internet connection. To fuel their cinephilic urge, they are dependent upon soft copy vendors of pirated films. These vendors are like a video library, the repository here being a laptop and a storage drive. These professional film pirates depend upon the p2p file sharing commonly referred as “torrent.” DVD and Blu Rays released by official sources are ripped at a bigger size by certain uploaderswhich are downloaded by another one who rips it to an even smaller size, fit enough to be downloaded by pirates with a slower broadband till it reaches places like Mukherjee Nagar. Using this particular case study, where the world of online film piracy merges with a third world piracy domain, I plan to interrogate the logistics of a new kind of cinephilia and try and frame this particular form of informal circuit of media production and consumption into a coherent perspective.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://kat.cr/">https://kat.cr</a>, <a href="https://yts.la/">https://yts.la/</a>, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/">https://torrentfreak.com</a>.</p><p>Relevant software: Handbrake, uTorrent / Deluge /&nbsp;Vuze.</p><p>Relevant reading: Treske, Andreas. The Inner Life of Video Spheres: Theory for the YouTube Generation. Institute of Network Cultures, Amsterdam, 2013</p><p>Licensed, Remixed and Pirated: Item Numbers and the&nbsp;Web</p><p>The coming of new digital technologies has rendered the relationship of media objects’ with law extremely malleable and volatile. It urges us to rethink certain categories we have been working with, viz. piracy and copyright. The specific focus of the paper will be on item numbers’ relationship with changing technology and the law. The proprioceptive body being the central node of enquiry here: the law that affects the body that moves on screen and the body that is moved by the screen is made flexible in the digital age with Web 2.0’s unique design that spawns hackability and remixability. Through the registers of music licensing to YouTube, circulation of content offline as MP3 downloads in cheap mass storage devices, user generated morphed content related to item numbers (in the form of memes, GIFs, trolls, posters, tumblr blogs and listicles) spawned by amateur digital culture and remixing videos of film content the paper traces the gray zone between web based music piracy and its copyright rules. It will interrogate the moment when the entertainment industry has recognized the clear shift of its spectatorship from the older media to the more digital platforms and appropriates the contingency brought in by the algorithmic anxiety of Web 2.0 and its unique relationship with law and hence censorship regulations to innovate newer means of mass circulation and bypassing censorship.</p><p>Relevant content: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2O2dBonBok</a>.</p><p>Relevant user-traffic-oriented platforms: <a href="http://www.memegenerator.com/">http://www.memegenerator.com</a>, <a href="http://www.trolldekho.com/">http://www.trolldekho.com</a>, <a href="https://www.imgur.com/">http://www.imgur.com</a>, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">https://www.tumblr.com/</a>.</p><p>Relevant curated online media platforms: <a href="http://scoopwhoop.com/">ScoopWhoop</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/tag/india">Buzzfeed India</a>, <a href="http://blog.erosnow.com/">blog.erosnow.com</a>.</p><p>Online Streaming in the era of Digital Cinephilia</p><p>Digital piracy has allowed for certain democratization of film distribution and consumption through a parallel economy of piracy. The lack of control over these channels of distribution produces a blatant threat to the copyright and intellectual property rights that are quintessential to the mainstream culture of commercial film distribution. This paper will focus on the intersection of these two dichotomous cultures through the experience of watching old films via online streaming. The resurfacing of old films hosted by big corporations like Shemaroo, Venus and Ultra who began as film rights and video rights owners at one point host their old video content in a user generated space called youtube. The video content is a very specific form here. It is an obsolete entity, defined by its ambiguity with copyright that is able to make a legal transgression in order to circulate.</p><p>The circulation of the feature films in a web space that is primarily known for its clip culture also provides an interesting paradigm for the copyright material. The big corporate copyright floats in a culture of pirated experiences where the legal domain becomes a dizzying site of contradictions. Through this paper I will draw parallels between the history of these companies and their work in the field of film circulation and to the creation of a new form of cinephilia and its complicated relationship to the law. I will use a variety of archival sources, legal documents and discourses on online streaming to contextualize my argument.</p><p>Relevant websites: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt">https://www.youtube.com/user/ShemarooEnt</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies">https://www.youtube.com/user/VenusMovies</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour">https://www.youtube.com/user/UltraMovieParlour</a></p> Readings <p>None.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day1.DigitalDesires">IRC 2016: Day 1 #Digital Desires : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Silpa Mukherjee is a Delhi based research scholar.

<p>Esme Wardhaugh sat down with Andrew to talk about identity, and the digital community.</p>
 What is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Andrew Weaver
<p>I wear a number of hats – from Digital Identity Aotearoa/New Zealand, to independent consulting, helping equip organisations with payments technology through to supporting mahi aroha (literally ‘love work’) with charities and social enterprises. I love supporting people to reach their full potential, especially if it involves challenging the status quo.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>A common thread of applying knowledge of technology and systems (including human systems) to improve and add value. I’m most definitely not a fan of shiny tech for shiny tech’s sake!</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>Knowledge and wisdom is everywhere around us – in nature, in history, in different perspectives and worldviews. My most effective and rewarding role is in exploring and drawing that wisdom out, rather than assuming my own narrow perspective is shared by everyone.</p>
 What’s your message to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they start, stop or continue doing – and why? 
<p>Identity is Taonga, a Māori word meaning something that is treasured and cherished. When we change our view of identity information and recognise it as something very personal and very precious we will start to treat it with a lot more dignity, care and respect. That means stopping treating identity as a means to a monetised marketing end and stopping the wholesale harvesting and sale of personal information.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>I have to quote your own motto (which I do all the time, by the way) – Identity systems built for everyone are built by everyone. #ForAllByAll</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>Technically Wrong is a great book on inclusive design.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>Explore More</p>
 Where can we find you on social media / the Web? 
<p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewweavernz/">LinkedIn</a> and at <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">digitalidentity.nz</a>.</p>

<p>In the digital space, people need new solutions to know the identity of who they are dealing with and whether or not they can trust them. A number of initiatives are working on the future of digital identity. Some of them are government-led while others are linked to specific private institutions or proprietary technologies.</p>
<p>Banks and insurers are in a unique position to offer trust verification services built on their long track record of protecting personal information and providing banking privacy. They also have much at stake in how digital identity develops. The future of the customer relationship could be significantly altered in some scenarios, while in others they can build on traditional strengths, leverage their capabilities and monetize services they provide to the data economy. Recent developments have heightened the implications as COVID-19 accelerated digitalization and placed greater emphasis on Digital Identity as a critical underlying building block of the economy. At the same time, large tech firms are rapidly enhancing their capabilities as hubs of health data (in addition to the other areas they dominate).</p>
<p>The Institute of International Finance is collaborating with the OpenID Foundation, member firms, officials and various other entities to support the Open Digital Trust initiative, an interoperable and open source development with the objectives of introducing foundational trust into the global digital economy. It aims to create a vibrant marketplace for Digital Trust services which help individuals and entities to confirm identity and understand and manage risk. Specific workstreams have been mobilized (each with their respective working groups), with the IIF leading on policy development &amp; OpenID leading on technical standards.</p>
 
 Technical protocols: This group is developing updated standards by 2021. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.openid.net">openid.net</a> or contact Don Thibeau, Executive Director at <a href="mailto:don@oidf.org">don@oidf.org</a> 
 Policy initiative: will develop policy recommendations, requirements, and guidance for both public and private stakeholders in support the project’s wider objectives. Publishing target Q4’2020. 
 
<p>The Open Digital Trust Policy Initiative will build on guiding principles with focus groups developing the specific details in the following areas:</p>
 
 Individual centricity / purpose: Balance protecting individual rights (control, privacy) with a perspective among all stakeholder interests (individual, societal, corporate). Look across jurisdiction and regional approaches, such as the EU and ASEAN, to balance individual privacy with broader societal interests. 
 Liability / legal frame: Create a market-based mechanism for addressing liability and legal frameworks of reference.

<p>Members of the <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> Alliance are united in the belief that identity is a fundamental and universal human right and that we all deserve better ways to prove who we are — both in the physical world and&nbsp;online.</p><p>As a community of technologists, advocates, implementers, and funders, we also believe that ethically implemented, privacy-protecting, user-managed, and portable digital ID solutions offer a better alternative to the current “data as a commodity” paradigm.</p><p>A new report from KPMG entitled, <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2020/new-imperative-corporate-data-responsibility.html">The New Imperative for Corporate Data Responsibility</a>, suggests that the American public increasingly agrees with this perspective. Based on a survey of 1,000 respondents, the report concludes that consumers expect corporations to “take significant steps to better protect, manage, and ethically use their&nbsp;data.”</p><blockquote>“The findings are unmistakable,” says Orson Lucas, Principal, KPMG Cyber Security Services. “Data privacy and protection are clear priorities for consumers. Close attention to customer data handling, management, and protection practices are key, foundational elements of establishing and maintaining digital&nbsp;trust.”</blockquote><p>The report outlines valuable findings regarding how the public feels about the security of their data, the issues that concern them, and who they believe bears responsibility for creating a more secure and trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p><p>Key Findings: Beliefs</p>  97 percent of respondents say that data privacy is important to&nbsp;them  87 percent believe that data privacy is a human&nbsp;right  86 percent believe that data privacy is a growing&nbsp;concern  68 percent don’t trust companies to ethically sell their private&nbsp;data  54 percent don’t trust companies to use their personal data in an ethical&nbsp;way  53 percent don’t trust companies to collect data in an ethical&nbsp;way  50 percent don’t trust companies to protect their personal&nbsp;data  <p>These insights should not surprise us. After all, a majority of Americans have, at one time or another, been personally affected by a data breach. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see that public opinion is shifting; our experiences have made us all more cognizant of how our identity and personal data are being misused and mismanaged. On the other hand, these experiences are also contributing to a growing mistrust of all forms of digital ID. For those who work in this space, this is a timely reminder that, as we develop and deploy new forms of digital ID, we must do so with an intentional focus and abiding commitment to rebuild and maintain public&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Key Findings: Concerns</p>  83 percent of respondents worry most about the theft of their Social Security Number, followed by their credit card number (69 percent), and their passwords (49&nbsp;percent)  Only 16 percent are worried about their medical records being stolen. Medical records are the most commonly cited example of data that consumers trust companies to protect (57&nbsp;percent)  <p>Given these rapidly changing consumer opinions, and with our vision of good digital ID for all as our guiding star, we at ID2020 regularly revisit the question: how do we get&nbsp;there?</p><p>The data suggest what we have long believed: that, in the coming years, market forces (i.e. consumer demands) will drive tectonic shifts in the data economy. But will market forces be&nbsp;enough?</p><p>Most telling in the data is that the public is most likely to trust healthcare companies to protect the privacy of their medical records. Laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) establish robust data protections and stiff penalties for companies that mishandle data. These offer the public a degree of confidence that their health information will be held sacrosanct.</p><p>The house is on fire and that the public is finally smelling the smoke when it comes to data security. Market forces can be extremely powerful, but we expect that governments will play an equally important, catalytic role by establishing the regulatory frameworks and consumer protections necessary to rebuild trust and encourage the broad adoption of safe and secure digital ID applications.</p><p>Here as well, the KPMG data provides some valuable insights for policymakers.</p><p>Key Findings: Who is Responsible</p>  91 percent of respondents say that corporations should take the lead in establishing corporate data responsibility  56 percent say that companies should prioritize giving consumers more control over their data in&nbsp;2020  84 percent are open to state legislatures giving consumers more control over their&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Data privacy issues are not going to go away,” says KPMG Cyber Security Services Principle, Steve Stein. “In fact, consumer protections around data privacy, like the ones provided by the CCPA, are very likely to be codified in other states and eventually at the federal level. Simply put, privacy laws are only going to increase in volume and rigor. That’s why visibility, protection, and trust is gaining such momentum in the marketplace and also why leading-edge companies are not looking at data privacy as just another compliance or check-the-box exercise. They see privacy as one of the pathways to growing their business by improving trust with their customers.”</blockquote><p>So…How DO We Get&nbsp;There?</p><p>Identity systems rely on trust to function; trust between issuers of identity and relying parties and, critically, that of those who use the system to prove their identity to access various goods, services, and privileges.</p><p>ID2020 was established in 2016 to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions. To achieve this vision, we are working simultaneously along three&nbsp;tracks.</p><p>We are helping shape the market through the ID2020 Certification, which applies 41 rigorous, outcome-based Technical Requirements to certify best-in-class digital ID solutions. We are working with policymakers in the United States and internationally to advocate for the ethical implementation of better forms of digital ID. And, as the technologies continue to evolve, we are implementing programs in the field to test and apply what we learn as these systems are replicated and brought to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Fully realizing the potential of digital ID will require businesses, technology providers, policymakers, and civil society to collaborate — and quickly — to build and implement functional, privacy-preserving, user-managed ID systems, and work to overcome the mistrust which could impede their broad adoption. We developed the ID2020 Alliance model to foster this collaboration.</p><p>The road to good ID for all is riddled with potholes…and we have one chance to get this&nbsp;right.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights, while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/new-report-highlights-public-concerns-about-data-privacy-6cfd1e248d49">New Report Highlights Public Concerns About Data Privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 “Covid State of Play” examines sick buildings, planning lags, and reopening <p>By <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/carolyn-schmitt">Carolyn&nbsp;Schmitt</a></p>A tent hospital in Central Park. Photo: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Central_Park_tent_hospital_(2)_jeh.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a><p>In the absence of leadership guidelines for mitigating COVID-19, creative solutions — in concert with established public health recommendations — are&nbsp;key.</p><p>Low-cost air quality sensors, rethinking what schools look like, and identifying new modes of collaboration are a few of the creative approaches discussed during a recent discussion hosted by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a> and <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/margaret-bourdeaux">Magaret Bourdeaux</a> of the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/programs/bkc-policy-practice-digital-pandemic-response">Digital Pandemic Response</a>&nbsp;program.</p><p>The talk examined the current “Covid State of Play,” and covered COVID-19 testing, school reopenings, and ventilation. Their guest, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/joseph-allen/">Joseph Allen</a>, is an Assistant Professor of Exposure Assessment Science at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public&nbsp;Health.</p><p>Bourdeaux, also of the Harvard Medical School’s Global Public Policy and Social Change program and the Harvard Kennedy School’s Security and Global Health Project, outlined the current testing situation in the United States, urging for more action and implementation.</p><p>“I think this is all about hard work. It is about systematic planning. It is about leadership and not counting [on] that there’s going to be some miracle cure, some miracle intervention that is going to save us. We are going to have to actually do the work that is required to control this outbreak and we just have to grow up and do it,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Allen added that there ongoing work on a rapid saliva-based at-home test, which needs to be reviewed by the FDA but has the potential to be a quick, accessible, low-cost test. “There is the technology available for at-home rapid tests. To Margaret’s point, we need it now,” he said, noting that the test isn’t the same as the PCR tests currently in use. “It takes a different mentality. It’s not a diagnostic test like we expect at the doctor’s office. It’s a tool to control the pandemic or help control the pandemic, so we need a mindset shift here and think about how we think about testing.”</p><p>School reopenings without testing infrastructure and public health implementations are also a pressing concern. Atop the testing challenges, many schools and universities have buildings with poor ventilation, Zittrain pointed out. Bourdeaux and Allen emphasized how being outside is safer than being indoors, but buildings with good ventilation are important for mitigating the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>“We are in the sick building era,” Allen said, meaning many buildings meet only minimum air quality standards to save energy. “So we’re paying the consequence right now for our choices that we’ve stopped designing buildings for&nbsp;people.”</p><p>Zittrain inquired about the use of carbon dioxide sensors in indoor spaces to monitor the air quality, a tool Allen said is already in use, and that his lab has also built. “Some of these can connect to the building information system, so in real-time it can, to your point, ‘hey, your CO2 hit a certain level. Let’s open up the dampers in here.’ In fact, it’s called demand control ventilation,” Allen explained.</p><p>But the availability of low-cost carbon dioxide sensors means employees can also raise red flags about air quality. “It’s democratized this healthy buildings idea and people are sharing that data. They are sharing that. Buildings are getting labeled sick buildings,” he said. “People can finally make the invisible visible with these cheap sensors.”</p><p>With “sick buildings” as a backdrop, the conversation shifted to whether schools should reopen. Allen, a <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/harvard-expert-outlines-recommendations-for-school-reopenings/">proponent </a>for reopening schools, argued there should be prerequisites to opening: “One, you have to control the spread and two, you have to make enhancements to your risk reduction strategies within the school. So it’s the when and the what. When to open and what has to be done, and so that’s where I’ve been bullish to say hey, if you do those things, sure, schools should&nbsp;open.”</p><p>Allen cited recent reopening failures in states like Georgia as examples of when these conditions were not met and should not have opened. “I am confident if we meet those metrics you’ll have low community spread and the probability of entering into the school and your new cases lower, that’s obvious as a numbers game. And then if you put these other strategies in place which we know work in hospitals and elsewhere, including and beyond airborne transmission, it’s mask-wearing, it’s de-identification, it’s managing flows of people and queues of people,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Bourdeaux echoed Allen’s concerns, emphasizing the importance of controlling community transmission, including case counts, and “understanding how robust your public health measures to end community transmission are.”</p><p>She compared the current response to the virus to the way people experience a hurricane, where the storm blows over and the perceived danger subsides. Instead, she said, there is more work to do from a public health perspective before having the reopening conversation. Bourdeaux said having a national plan and for having the important conversations to help stop the spread of the virus should be part of this action&nbsp;plan.</p><p>“We’re not having a very intelligent conversation about really what we’re dealing with to date, and so that’s not related to schools and whether schools could be made safe,” she said. “They absolutely can be made safe. We’ve seen buildings like hospitals, as Dr. Allen has pointed out. We can make places safe but I think that it’s asking a lot to say okay, let’s reopen schools when we’re not having a smart conversation about where we stand with community transmission in general.”</p><p>While children have lower infection and mortality rates, Allen countered that schools play an important function for many students, and other risks — such as access to food and virtual dropout — should be factored in as well. “If we don’t think there are consequences to keeping tens of millions of kids outside of school, they’re at higher risk of abuse and neglect, exploitation. The loss of learning. The loss of socialization. Over 30 million kids rely on schools for meals. These are massive costs and it’s horrifying to recognize that our country hasn’t prioritized this,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Along similar lines, Zittrain asked whether any official guidelines for reopening might further intensify the inequalities between wealthier communities — who have access to more resources — and marginalized communities, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.</p><p>These inequalities will still exist with virtual schooling, Allen said. “This virus is exposing deep fissures within our society, the structural racism that’s in our society that exists within these schools. If we keep kids all at home that’s going to exist for the exact same reason and if you bring back some, well that inequality, inequity is going to exist and be exacerbated as well. There’s no simple answer here other than honestly it’s a systemic issue that needs to be fixed and fixed&nbsp;fast.”</p><p>To address these myriad challenges presented by COVID-19, Zittrain asked about best practices for sharing information and working together. Both Allen and Bourdeaux underscored the great opportunities and responses they have seen. Allen described the past few months as a period of great collaboration and camaraderie with “the whole world, every scientist and medical professional is focused on the same problem.” As an illustration of such new collaboration, he cited <a href="https://schools.forhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2020/06/Harvard-Healthy-Buildings-Program-Schools-For-Health-Reopening-Covid19-June2020.pdf">a report</a> he worked on to advise school superintendents. Bourdeaux similarly emphasized how so many people are trying to take action to help and support during the pandemic, and referred to a <a href="https://apnews.com/9126a38ef22c244f9ca18f9584061f8d">recent poll</a> that says most Americans support a mask&nbsp;mandate.</p><p>The trio also explored creative ways to host schools, such as makeshift schools outside, similar to how hospitals made tented spaces in parks. Allen pointed to an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/27/we-can-must-reopen-schools-heres-how/">op-ed he wrote </a>outlining steps to reopen, which includes temporary school&nbsp;spaces.</p><p>“Let’s put some tents. Let’s use the ball field. Let’s get creative. Look at what the medical community did…There were tents in Central Park,” he said. “We should turn convention centers into schools. Let’s put tents in every park. We can get real creative here instead of saying well, we have this old crumbling infrastructure, what are we going to do? Let’s just jam a thousand kids back into it and do everything the same way. Instead, I think there are some creative solutions out&nbsp;there.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/no-simple-answer-99085ffd0623">“No simple answer”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

It highlights why digital identity offers many different ways to present ourselves and walks through the basics of how ID today is dominated by mega-IdPs (identity providers). It gets to the conceptual heart of what SSI is about. It also shows a real live demonstration of a scooter-authorization project spearheaded by T-Mobile&nbsp;Germany.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81GkdBRmsbE&amp;t=9s">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Foam Figure Explainer v2</a> 9min<br>John Phillips from 460 Degrees, a consulting firm from Sydney, AU, updated his earlier video in January of 2020.

They also have coordinate other discussion groups open to non-members, such as the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/">Education Credentials Task Force</a> (“vc-ed”).</p> <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">The Internet Identity&nbsp;Workshop</a> <p>This biannual event has been the convening at the heart of the decentralized identity community for 15 years, held at the Computer History Museum in the heart of Silicon Valley. It is uniquely co-created by its participants in a mostly-organic and community-driven way, with no pre-picked speakers, keynotes, or commercial presentations aside from a demo hour. True to its name, workshopping, whiteboarding, and open (but detailed and concrete!) discussion on a massive scale are the core of the event. The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/past-workshops/">books of proceedings</a> organize and refine all of the <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">notes</a> taken live during all the sessions convened at each&nbsp;event.</p> <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> <p>This influential and egalitarian global organization grew out of a series of <a href="https://online2020.mydata.org">conferences</a> first held in 2016. They advocate for a human-centric and rights-driven vision where individuals can get digital services that support them to collect their data, not just safeguarding and well serving but even empowering the data subject. Organizational members and individual members come together to create an ongoing dialogue between “consumers” and ethical businesses to shape new types of markets for digital services. Rooted in the values of the <a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData Declaration</a>, they focus primarily on elaborating refined, nuance, and bottoms-up models for data governance; only from a solid governance foundation do they begin to make policy, business, and technology decisions. They recently published the <a href="https://mydata.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/Understanding-Mydata-Operators-pages.pdf">MyData Operators paper</a>, bringing their policy, business, and technological goals more squarely into the realm of decentralized identity.</p> <a href="https://sovrin.org/">The Sovrin Foundation</a> <p>Since the early days of decentralized identity, Sovrin has been one of the major hubs of innovation and entrepreneurship, serving as a kind of all-in-one community, codebase, blockchain, and better business bureau. They have also published many canonical educational and marketing texts that have been foundational to the development of “self-sovereign identity” as a sector of the software industry. The Aries project (housed in the Hyperledger Foundation) and the Trust-over-IP foundation are, in a sense, spin-outs of the Sovrin foundation, and both remain loosely based (sometimes by design, sometimes by momentum) on the Sovrin community’s codebase, ledger, and design principles. The fastest way to familiarize yourself with these is the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/">whitepaper library</a> on the Foundation’s website.</p> Standards organizations <p>These centers of gravity are where ideas and business models evolve in broad conversation. Inevitably, structuring ground rules and governance models for these eventually have to be negotiated between technical experts and standards adopted before major investments (of capital, but also of legislation and public good will) can be approved. See Nader Helmy’s great <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/overview-of-decentralized-identity-standards-f82efd9ab6c7">tour</a> of standards organizations relevant to these centers of&nbsp;gravity.</p> — Government Initiatives:  United States Federal Government <p>Anil John, head of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program run under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology directorate has been funding the development of standards and business models in the nascent field for years.

This network provides public-record credentials about registered business in a publicly accessible repository of Verifiable Credentials, bringing the traditional “orgBook” into the decentralized era. By directing much of their IT budgets towards open-source development and participating heavily in the emerging open-source community around this project, they have provided invaluable leadership, particularly within the Aries community, including such major contributions as the core of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-plugin-toolbox">Aca-Py Codebase</a>.</p> The European&nbsp;Union <p>ESSIF (European SSI Framework) is an ongoing open-source initiative to seed and accelerate the role of SSI in the EU digital “single market” strategy.

 ID2020 Announces Certification of BLOK Pass from BLOK Bioscience <p>ID2020 is proud to announce the certification of BLOK Pass from BLOK Bioscience, a digital ID-based solution for COVID health status certificates. BLOK Pass is the first COVID-focused solution to be certified by&nbsp;ID2020.</p><p>BLOK Pass offers individuals a self-sovereign record of their testing, antibody and, ultimately, vaccination status. Initially envisioned as a means to help businesses and governments manage the safe and incremental return to public life in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the solution is expected to be applied more broadly in the future to support immunization certificates and the transmission of other medical test&nbsp;results.</p><blockquote>“The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust digital credentials into the global spotlight,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “As we consider digital ID-based solutions for public health applications, getting the technology right is not negotiable. We intentionally set a high bar for certification and are delighted to recognize the BLOK Pass solution for meeting our high standards for privacy protection, user-management, portability, and&nbsp;more.”</blockquote><p>To be eligible for certification, solutions must adhere to 41 functional, outcomes-based<a href="https://id2020.org/uploads/files/Technical-Requirements.pdf"> Technical Requirements</a>. In addition to providing a roadmap to help developers create better products, the ID2020 Certification also provides a “third-party seal of approval” so that implementers — and ultimately, end-users — can trust that the technology was developed in accordance with the highest ethical and technical standards.</p><blockquote>“Pandemic management is essentially an entirely new solution domain,” said BLOK Solutions Chief Technology Officer, Areiel Wolanow. “The precedents we set now will set the standard for how the future unfolds, so we have a duty to get things right. By starting with the principle that individuals should always be the sole owner of their data, it is our hope at BLOK that this a standard that others will find it exceedingly difficult to deviate&nbsp;from.”</blockquote><p>The ID2020 Certification is already impacting the technical landscape for digital ID and technology providers of all sizes are increasingly aligning their technical approaches to comport with ID2020’s requirements. To date, more than 30 technology providers from every corner of the globe have submitted applications and worked with the ID2020 staff and advisory committees to complete the application process.</p><p>Today, BLOK Pass joins Kiva Protocol, Gravity.earth, and ZAKA as part of a small, but rapidly growing, cadre of ID2020 certified digital ID solutions.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment and to protecting user privacy and ensuring that data is not commoditized.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org/">www.ID2020.org</a></p><p>About BLOK BioScience, Ltd.</p><p>BLOK BioScience is part of the BLOK Group. With a network of global experts and a robust and far-reaching supply chain, we provide trusted and authentic solutions to help respond to the rapidly changing population wellness landscape.</p><p>Our unique combination of medical and strategic expertise and technical knowledge results in secure and compliant solutions for tracking and verifying immunity, and we use rapid antibody testing and recording to enable governments and industry to manage viral outbreaks and mitigate the economic and social effects of pandemics</p><p><a href="http://www.blokbioscience.com/">www.blokbioscience.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-announces-certification-of-blok-bioscience-immunity-passport-1f86013e9da5">ID2020 Announces Certification of BLOK Bioscience Immunity Passport</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">Support for FIDO in browsers and operating systems</a> is widespread and growing fast. Enterprises now have better tools to replace easily compromised passwords with simpler, stronger FIDO Authentication and eliminate phishing, man-in-the-middle and other security attacks. But, if you want to deploy FIDO in your enterprise, what are the first steps? Do you need to explain “why FIDO?” to your CISO? What do the timelines look like? Should you build your own server or work with a vendor? What FIDO authenticators should you accept? How do you manage&nbsp; them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) will answer these questions, and more, in its new white paper series. The series aims to educate corporate management and IT security on the improvements available for authentication today and how to leverage them within their own organizations. This work is dedicated to eliminating passwords and securing the simple act of logging into company systems and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First up in the series is the primer “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">CXO Explanation: Why Use FIDO for Passwordless Employee Logins</a>?” This document is the guide for you and/or the executive leaders in your organization as to why you should invest in FIDO2 deployment for your employees.</p>



<p>It addresses all of the common questions from CXOs on the value proposition of FIDO Authentication and how the FIDO2 passwordless framework addresses the authentication needs and challenges of companies for the modern workforce. Read it now at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/">https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-cxo-explanation-why-use-fido-for-passwordless-employee-logins/</a> and pass it along to colleagues.</p>



<p>Subsequent entries in this educational series will focus on server deployment, authenticator choices, authenticator life-cycle management, and credential acceptance in the enterprise. This series is part of the Alliance’s strategy to provide expert deployment guidance to our community in order to support the rapidly growing number of FIDO implementations across a variety of use cases. Please watch this space as we publish more in this Enterprise Series over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

 Daphne Keller discusses CDA 230, the executive order, and content moderation Daphne Keller (left) joined Oumou Ly (right) for the latest episode of The Breakdown.<p>In this episode of The Breakdown, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/oumou-ly">Oumou Ly</a> is joined by <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/people/daphne-keller">Daphne Keller</a> of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center to discuss the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, content moderation and Big Tech platforms, and recent events that propelled them into the spotlight in recent&nbsp;months.</p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, or “The Twenty-Six Words That Created The Internet,” provides platforms legal immunity for third party speech — including by their users. It came under fire recently when President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/28/863932758/stung-by-twitter-trump-signs-executive-order-to-weaken-social-media-companies">signed an executive order </a>to limit protections for social media companies.</p><p>Read the transcript, which has been lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>Oumou Ly (OL): Welcome to the Breakdown. My name is Oumou; I’m a staff fellow on the Berkman Klein Center’s <a href="https://www.bkmla.org/">Assembly: Disinformation program</a>. Our topic of discussion today is CDA 230, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, otherwise known as “The Twenty-Six Words That Created The Internet.” Today I’m joined by Daphne Keller from the Stanford Cyber Policy&nbsp;Center.</p><p>Thank you for being with us today Daphne, I appreciate it, especially this conversation will help to unpack what has turned out to be such a huge and maybe consequential issue for the November election and certainly for technology platforms and all of us who care and think about this information really critically.</p><p>One of the first questions I have for you is a basic one, can you tell us a little bit about CDA 230 and why it’s referred to as The Twenty Six Words That Started The Internet?</p><p>Daphne Keller (DK): Sure. So first, I strongly recommend <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501714412/the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet/">Jeff Kosseff’s book</a>, which coined that Twenty Six words phrase, it is a great history of CDA 230, and it’s very narrative.</p><p>So Intermediary Liability Law is the law that tells platforms what legal responsibilities they have for the speech and content posted by their users. And US law falls into three buckets. There’s a big bucket, which is about copyright, and there the law in point is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA, and it has this very choreographed notice and takedown&nbsp;process.</p><p>The other big bucket that doesn’t get a lot of attention is federal criminal law. There’s no special immunity for platforms for federal criminal law crimes. So if what you’re talking about is things like child sexual abuse material, material of support of terrorism, those things, the regular law applies. There is no immunity under CDA 230 or anything&nbsp;else.</p><p>And then the last big bucket, the one we’re here to talk about today is CDA 230, which was enacted in 1996 as part of a big package of legislation. Some of which was subsequently struck down by the Supreme Court, leaving CDA 230 standing as the law of the land. And it’s actually a really simple law, even though it’s so widely misunderstood that there’s now a <a href="https://twitter.com/badsec230takes?lang=en">Twitter account</a>, a Bad Section 230 Takes, just to retweet all the misrepresentations of it that come&nbsp;along.</p><blockquote>“Broadly speaking, the Internet could not exist the way we know it without something like CDA&nbsp;230”</blockquote><p>But what it says is, first, platforms are not liable for their users’ speech. Again, for the category of claims that are covered, so this isn’t about terrorism, child, sex abuse material, et cetera. But for things like state law defamation claims, platforms are not liable for their users’ speech. And the second thing it says is also platforms are not liable for acting in good faith to moderate content. So to enforce their own policies against content they consider objectionable.</p><p>And this, that second prong was very much part of what comes Congress was trying to accomplish with this law. They wanted to make sure that platforms could adopt what we now think of as terms of service or community guidelines and could enforce rules against hateful speech or bullying or pornography, or just the broad range of bad human behavior that most people don’t want to see on platforms. And the key thing that Congress realized, because they had experience with a couple of cases that had just passed that happened at the time, was that if you want platforms to moderate, you need to give them both of those immunities. You can’t just say you’re free to moderate, go do it. You have to also say, and if you undertake to moderate, but you miss something and there’s defamation… still on the platform or whatever, the fact that you tried to moderate won’t be held against&nbsp;you.</p><p>And this was really important to Congress because there had just been a case where a platform that tried to moderate was tagged as acting like an editor or a publisher and therefore facing potential liability. That’s the core of CDA 230. And I can talk more if it’s helpful about the things people get confused about, like the widespread belief that platforms are somehow supposed to be neutral, which is&nbsp;—</p><p>OL: Well, would you please say something about&nbsp;that.</p><p>DK: Yeah. Congress had this intention to get platforms to moderate. They did not want them to be neutral; they wanted the opposite. But I think a lot of people find it intuitive to say, well, it must be that platforms have to be neutral. And I think that intuition comes from a pre-Internet media environment where everything was either a common carrier, like a telephone, just interconnecting everything and letting everything flow freely. Or it was like NBC News or The New York Times — it was heavily edited, and the editor clearly was responsible for everything that the reporters put in there. And those two models don’t work for the Internet. If we still have just those two models today, we would still have only a very tiny number of elites with access to the microphone.</p><p>And everybody else would still not have the ability to broadcast our voices on things like Twitter or YouTube or whatever that we have today. And I think that’s not what anybody wants. What people generally want is they do want to be able to speak on the Internet without platform lawyers checking everything they say before it goes live. We want that. And we also — generally — also want platforms to moderate. We want them to take down offensive or obnoxious or hateful or dangerous but legal speech. And so 230 is the law that allows both of those things to happen at&nbsp;once.</p><p>OL: Okay. Daphne, can you talk a little bit about the two different types of immunity that are outlined under CDA 230 we call them shorthand (c )(1) and (c )&nbsp;(2)?</p><p>DK: Sure. So in the super shorthand, (c )(1) is immunity for leaving content up, and (c ) (2) is immunity for taking content&nbsp;down.</p><p>OL: Yeah.</p><p>DK: So most of the litigation that we’ve seen historically under the CDA is about (c )(1). It’s often really disturbing cases where something terrible happened to someone on the Internet, and a speech defaming them was left out, or speech threatening them was left up, or they continue to face things that were illegal. So those are cases about (c )(1). If the platform leaves that stuff up, are they liable? The second prong (c )(2) just hasn’t had nearly as much attention over the years until now. But that’s the one that says platforms can choose their own content moderation policy that they’re not liable for choosing to take down content they deem objectionable as long as they are acting in good&nbsp;faith.</p><p>And that’s the problem that does have this good faith requirement. And part of what the executive order attempts is to require companies to meet the good faith requirement in order to qualify for immunities. If someone can show that you are not acting in good faith, then you lose this much more economically consequential immunity under (c )(1) for contents that’s on your platform that’s&nbsp;illegal.</p><p>And the biggest concern I think for many people there is if this economically essential immunity is dependent on some government agency determining whether you acted in good faith. That introduces just a ton of room for politics because my idea of what’s good faith won’t be your idea of what’s good faith, won’t be Attorney General Barr’s idea of what’s good faith. And so having something where political appointees, in particular, get to decide what constitutes good faith and then all of your immunities hanging in the balance is really frightening for companies.</p><p>And, interestingly, today we see Republicans calling for a fairness doctrine for the Internet calling for a requirement of good faith or fairness in content moderation. But for a generation, it was literally part of the GOP platform every year to oppose the fairness doctrine that was enforced for broadcast by the FCC. President Reagan said it was unconstitutional. This was just like a core conservative critique of big government suppressing speech for decades, and now it has become their critique, and they’re asking for state regulation of platforms.</p><p>OL: That is so interesting to me, both that and the fact that CDA 230 in so many ways is what allows Donald Trump’s Twitter account to stay up. It’s really, really interesting that the GOP has decided to rail against&nbsp;it.</p><p>DK: It’s fascinating.</p><p>OL: So just recently, the president signed an executive order concerning CDA 230 pretty directly. Can you talk a little bit about what the executive order&nbsp;does?</p><p>DK: Sure. So I think I wanted to just start at a super high level with the executive order in the day or so after it came out, I had multiple people from around the world reach out to me and be like, this is like what happened in Venezuela when Chavez started shutting down the radio&nbsp;station.</p><p>It has this resonance of like, there is a political leader trying to punish speech platforms for their editorial policies. And that — before you even get into the weeds — that high-level impact of it is really important to pay attention to. And that is the reason why [the] CDT (the Center for Democracy and Technology) in DC has filed a First Amendment case saying this whole thing just can’t stand, we’ll see what happens with that&nbsp;case.</p><p>But, and there again like that’s not a bad idea, but then it leads to things in the executive order that I think don’t work. So then there are also in the executive order for other things that might be big deals. So one is that [the] DOJ has instructed to draft legislation to change 230. So eventually, that will come along, and presumably, it will track the very long list of ideas that are in the DOJ report that came out this week. [Editor’s note: this interview was recorded on June 18, 2020] A second is it instructs federal agencies to interpret 230 in the way that the executive order&nbsp;does.</p><p>This way that I think is not supported by the statute that takes the good faith requirement and applies it in places it’s not written in the statute. Nobody’s quite sure what that means because there just aren’t that many situations where federal agencies care about 230, but we’ll see what comes out of that. A third is that Attorney General Barr of the DOJ is supposed to convene state attorneys general to look at a long list of complaints. And this is like, if you look at it, if you’re an Internet policy nerd, it’s just all the hot button issues… are fact-checkers biased? Can algorithmic moderation be biased? And, well, it can. How can you regulate that? You will recognize these things if you look at the&nbsp;list.</p><p>And then the fourth one, and this is one that I think deserves a lot of attention is that DOJ is supposed to review whether platforms, particular platforms are quote problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, unquote. And then, based on that, look into whether they can carry federally funded ads. This is I think for most platforms the ads dollars part is not that big a deal, but being on a federal government block list of platforms with disapproved editorial policies, just like has this McCarthyist feeling.</p><p>OL: Can you talk a little bit about the role of CDA in relation to the business models that the platforms run?</p><p>DK: Sure. So broadly speaking, the Internet could not exist the way we know it without something like CDA 230. And that’s not just about the Facebooks of the world, that’s about everything all up and down the technical stack DNS providers, CloudFlare, Amazon Web Services is another backend web hosting. And also tons of little companies, the knitting blog that permits comments or the farm equipment seller that has user feedback. All of those are possible because of CDA 230. And if you pull CDA 230 out of the picture, it’s just very hard to imagine the counterfactual of how American Internet technology and companies would have&nbsp;evolved.</p><p>They would have evolved somehow and, presumably, the counterfactual is we would have something like what the EU has, which boils down to a notice and takedown model for every kind of legal claim. But they’d barely have an Internet economy for these kinds of companies. There’s a reason that things developed the way that they&nbsp;did.</p><p>OL: Yeah. Do you think that there’s any, maybe not what you think, but I’m sure that we can all agree this is likely to be the case, if the liability shared with that 230 offers platforms is removed, how would that change the way that platforms approach content moderation?</p><p>DK: Well, I think a lot of little companies would just get out of the business entirely. And so there’s an advocacy group in DC called Engine, which represents startups and small companies, and they put together a really interesting <a href="https://www.engine.is/news/primer/section230costs">two-pager </a>on the actual cost of defending even frivolous claims in a world with CDA 230 and in a world without CDA 230. And it’s basically, you’re looking at 10 to 30 thousand dollars in the best-case scenario for a case that goes away very, very quickly even now. And that’s not a cost that small companies want to incur. And the investors there are all these surveys of investors saying, I don’t want to invest in new platforms to challenge today’s incumbents if they’re in a state of legal uncertainty where they could be liable for something at any time. So I think you just eliminate a big swath of the parts of both the existing parts of the Internet that policymakers don’t pay any attention to.</p><p>You make them very, very vulnerable, and some of them go away, and that’s troubling, and you create a lot of problems for any newcomers who would actually challenge today’s incumbents and try to rival them in serious user-generated content hosting services.</p><p>For the big platforms, for Facebook, for YouTube they’ll survive somehow, they’d change their business model, they probably&nbsp;… the easiest thing to do is, you use their terms of service to prohibit a whole lot more and then just like take down a huge swath, so you’re not facing much legal&nbsp;risk.</p><p>OL: Yeah. It’s hard to imagine living in that kind of a&nbsp;world.</p><p>DK: It is, it&nbsp;is.</p><p>OL: Yeah. Thank you so much for joining me today, Daphne. This was a great and enlightening conversation, and I’m sure our viewers will enjoy&nbsp;it.</p><p>DK: Thank you for having&nbsp;me.</p><p>OL: Thanks.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-breakdown-daphne-keller-explains-the-communications-decency-act-84c93775f3b0">The Breakdown: Daphne Keller explains the Communications Decency Act</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: For the background information on the 2020 Hackathon in Korea, see the April blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-goodbye-password-challenge-in-korea/">2020 FIDO Hackathon: Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea</a>.”&nbsp; To learn more about examples of proposed development ideas, please read the June blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-in-korea-learn-implement-phase/">2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea: Learn &amp; Implement Phase</a>.”</p>



<p>In the afternoon of July 1st, 2020, a Mid-Term Meetup Event for FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge was held at Telecommunication Technology Association (TTA). Originally, the Hackathon Steering Committee had planned a full-day onsite final implementation and evaluation day, followed by a month and a half online training phase.&nbsp; Due to the global pandemic, we had to change our schedules in accordance with school calendar disruptions and summer holidays. We decided to have a half-day mid-term meetup event for participants. This allowed us to help the teams to stay on course while providing a safe environment for people to learn from each other face-to-face.</p>







<p>Nineteen different teams participated in the event, half of them face-to-face with strict public health guidance applied, and the other half virtually. The meeting gave opportunities for teams to share their FIDO protocol-based online service development ideas and current development status, learn from each other and receive valuable feedback from FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members.</p>







<p>In addition to sharing their projects’ current development status, the teams had the opportunity to present the “homework” they have completed after online training.&nbsp; The homework was writing a simple article on the web, with answers to the following questions:</p>



  What is FIDO Alliance?  What are the FIDO protocols?  What are the benefits of implementing FIDO protocols?  (Option) What services/products are you developing for the 2020 FIDO Hackathon and what would be the value of adopting FIDO protocols for online authentication?  



<p>We were very pleased with the articles we received. You can read examples (mostly in Korean) by visiting these following links:</p>



  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/yeocw3/222029532562">No matter how passwords are complicated, they are not safe!&nbsp; Learn FIDO concepts</a>  <a href="https://pongdang-pooh.tistory.com/9">FIDO Authentication: Good security knowledge to learn while you are quarantined at home</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/owjs3901/222030081852">2020 FIDO Hackathon Homework – My Plan to Develop FIDO Based IoT Solution for Home</a>  <a href="https://blog.naver.com/lcwlyw/222032889174">FIDO – New technology standard to solve problems with IDs and Passwords&nbsp;</a>  <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/woojim11/222011830343">Let’s learn about FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>  <a href="https://codstice.tistory.com/78">Summary on FIDO Alliance and FIDO Specs</a>  



<p>We hope this short blog gives you a better understanding of the current status of the 2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea.&nbsp; We will be back soon with more updates after the final evaluation — scheduled for this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We interviewed Dia Banerji, one of our UK Ambassadors, to find out more about her passion for innovation and technology.</p>
 What gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Dia Banerji
<p>I am passionate about the power of innovative technology &amp; its potential in creating a better world. As an individual, I enjoy solving problems with technology solutions. I consider myself to be fortunate to be able to pursue my passion in the work I do.</p>
<p>I am the founder of ID4V. It is an early stage start-up focused on building a platform to enable Self Sovereign Digital Identity for Cross-Border Travel Visa Applications using Blockchain Technology. ID4V aims to address the inefficiency in our travel visa application system which affects millions of people around the world. Very few experiences in life can be compared to the joy of creation. I am thrilled to be on this journey.</p>
<p>I also work as a Consultant to the Blockpass identity Lab at Edinburgh Napier University where I advise on commercialization of emerging technology. I help identify industry applications for Blockchain &amp; Privacy Preserving Machine Learning research. Every day I spend at the lab I learn something new. I am surrounded by brilliance and get to work with innovative cutting-edge research. It is truly inspiring.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting time to be in Identity. We are creating a gateway to access the digital economy. What we build today &amp; how we build it, will shape our future. My work in Identity allows me to be part of this incredible evolution.</p>
<p>Roosevelt once said “Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.” To me, working in Identity as an Entrepreneur and a Professional is work worth doing and I love it!</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>The short answer would be ‘CURIOSITY’!</p>
<p>Prior to embarking a career in the technology sector, I spent over fifteen years in the financial services industry and worked for some of the top global banks in the world. Around 2016, within my fraternity there was a lot of noise about Bitcoin. Most of my peers and friends who were in Financial Services were naysayers and opposed Bitcoin with the utmost passion. Wall street greats like Warren Buffet famously called Bitcoin ‘Rat Poison Squared’! This got me curious. I wanted to learn more about Bitcoin to be able to figure out where I stood on the debate. This pursuit led me to studying Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies. I was amazed with the potential of this technology in solving real world problems. I wanted to be part of it. So, I pivoted my career to outlining use cases for Blockchain especially within Financial Services sector. And in that journey, I came to narrow my focus on Digital Identity and got to where I am today.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson that I learned was not to be intimidated by the things I did not know and appreciate the value of stepping outside my comfort zone. I was a financial service professional before I entered the world of Technology and Digital Identity. I have an MBA and not a computer science degree. There will always be somethings that we do not know and that is absolutely fine! Especially when one is working within the Identity Industry which is constantly changing and new standards are being incubated as we speak. Knowledge has a way of demystifying complex concepts. And once you understand something in depth you are no longer intimidated by it. The key thing is to never stop learning. And one of the most enjoyable aspects of my work is that I get to learn something new all the time. This to me this is both inspiring and empowering.</p>
 What should leaders in identity start, stop and continue – and why? 
<p>The concept of identity has been broadly accepted as a fundamental human right. A legal identity enables individuals to participate in society and have access to rights and services. It is a prerequisite to financial &amp; social inclusion.</p>
<p>Identity management is a global problem. The current system does not scale and is in much need for disruption. For, those of us in the developed world we are plagued with inefficiencies of legacy systems, data privacy breaches &amp; leaks leading to trust issues with central authorities. For the citizens of the developing nations many are denied access to financial &amp; social services for lack of verifiable identity. According to World Bank, it is estimated that approximately one billion people across the world do not have access to an officially recognizable identity!</p>
<p>As the world transitions to a digital economy we need to have a more secure, scalable, interoperable and citizen focused digital identity management solutions to ensure inclusion.</p>
<p>So, my advice to the CEO’s in the identity space would be the following:</p>
<p>START: Collaborating with one another and build solutions and platforms which are interoperable. Have diverse teams within the organisation so that the solutions reflect the wider needs of society. Both are imperative for mass adoption!</p>
<p>STOP: Building centralized identity management solutions! Be citizen focused and build applications on the principles of self-sovereign digital identity. Allow individuals to own, control and manage the distribution of their personal identity. This is essential to be able to build scalable and secure systems with no central point of failure and reduce risk of data theft.</p>
<p>CONTINUE: Identifying new uses cases for Identity management solutions and apply innovative technologies to enhance efficiency and security of applications. Digital Identity is a relatively new industry and is constantly changing. We need to continue to fund new research and explore new use cases. This is crucial, for the creation of robust digital identity management platforms for the future.</p>
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>I have always looked to nature to find order and to me diversity is the purest form of natural existence and the only way to live and thrive in this world.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>I would recommend the film, The Matrix. It is a beautiful film and the script is almost Shakespearean. If one sees beyond the action-packed computer graphics there is a deep spiritual message and a tale about the constant strife between ignorance and enlightenment faced by mankind. Like most great works of art, it leaves you questioning. Definitely worth a watch!</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>I would advise my teenage self to be ‘fearless’ and ‘take chances’. In order to walk the path that no one has ever walked before requires one to be brave and follow one’s gut. Greatness is seldom achieved by being careful. So, go ‘ALL IN’ and follow your passion and don’t seek external validation. Believe in yourself!</p>

 Aakash Solanki, Sandeep Mertia &amp; Rashmi&nbsp;M  Session <p>The session intends to initiate a discussion on digital literacies in the wake of ‘Digital India’ programme drawing on the empirical insights from three different field situations. The discussion will be anchored in the social and material context of Digital India but will not be limited to it. The questions we raise in this specific context may be extended to understand the current conceptual as well as practical deployment of many ICT4D programmes as envisioned by both government and non-government actors. The idea of digital literacy is central to both the conceptualization and the execution of such programmes, and the actors in charge work with their own understanding of the context and needs of the people they aim to empower. There have been very few attempts to systematically understand the concept of digital literacy which leave much scope for either lenient contextual interpretations or context insensitive one-size-fits-all approach towards technological interventions. This session is an effort to begin one such discussion which we hope will refine the prevalent understanding of digital literacy/literacies in&nbsp;India.</p><p>From a glance at the structure of Digital India programme, it is apparent that the programme is designed to achieve digital inclusion and is primarily directed towards the digitally marginalized in spite of having a more comprehensive agenda. The schemes such as National Digital Literacy Mission (NDLM) and the way they are conceived are indexical of the kind of target groups which the programme plans to address. A key concern for us is to think through the mismatches between the frameworks of the digital literacy initiatives and the local socio-technical contexts which we observed in our field sites. The objective of the session is not as much to arrive at the definitional fixity of the concept of digital literacy as it is to complicate and problematize the prevalent definitions of digital literacy implicit in both visualization and execution of such initiatives. We plan to meet this objective through empirical insights we have on three different field&nbsp;sites.</p><p>The session will also focus on certain methodological questions that might help us better understand digital literacy. This part of the session addresses questions such as: how can we conceptually define digital literacy/literacies? What parameters should go into the measuring of digital literacy? How should we theoretically understand it — as technical skills or knowledge or some higher cognitive ability? How can we best pedagogically achieve it given the complexity of ground reality? The questions will be directed towards encouraging thought in this area rather than providing answers. The session will also try and discuss various kinds of policy and pedagogical documentation available on digital literacy and critically debate their conceptualization and execution by juxtaposing them against various uses of ICTs on the ground by specific groups of users. This part of the discussion will draw upon scholarly and other kinds of documentation available on the topic and use them to evaluate various government and corporate initiatives to achieve digital literacy in&nbsp;India.</p> Plan <p>In keeping with the spirit of the conference, the three discussants’ will try to put forth empirical insights from their respective field situations and frame nuanced research and discussion questions on digital literacies at the margins of techno-cultural capital and/or access. Further the discussion will be aided by specific readings and the insights drawn from them. The idea is to have a symmetrical, reciprocatory and anthropologically comparative conversation on questions of technology, materiality, access, meaning making, development and literacy, by moving back and forth between different fieldsites and interpretive frameworks.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;I</p><p>The first discussant’s work on social media use in rural Rajasthan discusses socio-technical changes instituted by the introduction of ICTs despite their developmental failures. He claims that these changes have been often viewed from technologically or socially deterministic positions and that there are significant empirical gaps between such technocratic discourses and the grassroots experiences of technology. There is a growing usage of social and digital media in rural areas where ICT4D and e-Governance pilot projects have failed to meet their goals. Based on an ethnographic study of ICTs in two villages of Rajasthan, his work aims to situate social and digital media in a complex rural society and media ecology using co-constructivist approach. Focusing on context sensitive meaning making of ICTs, it will seek to contribute to an empirically sound discourse on media, technology and rural society in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;II</p><p>The second discussant’s work on mobile phones and multimedia consumption among the digitally marginalized users in Bangalore brings into focus the popular usage of ICTs, specifically mobile phones, among the subaltern users. While such popular usage indicates a certain level of literacy already achieved by the digitally marginal groups by mere exposure and peer learning, it is not sufficient to do away with all kinds of guided training required to make such users participate in informationalized environments. Her observations on the mobile phone usage among the subaltern users in Bangalore problematize the notion of digital literacy and invite us to think about it as a more layered and stratified concept. They raise questions such as ‘what constitutes digital literacy?’ — some complex use of gadgets learnt by mere exposure and peer knowledge or an awareness about the social relevance of the technologies and knowledge about their appropriate deployment in different social contexts? While mere access and some nominal training might be helpful in equipping people with some knowledge about gadget-use, her study points out that such initiatives are far from achieving the right degree of digital literacy needed to make these people participate in new media ecologies. Thus it contends the claims of 1. Organic literacy attained by mere exposure and peer sharing of technological knowledge and 2. Literacy attained by current training programmes which might equip the digitally marginalized with knowledge of technological use but not necessarily inform them about the context relevant knowledge needed for their appropriate deployment.</p><p>Field Note&nbsp;III</p><p>The third discussant’s work on e-governance initiatives in an Indian state plans to return the gaze on to the bureaucracy itself and takes the conversation from the margins back to the centre. His work moves away from the target groups generally alluded to in programs such as the NDLM. It takes into accounts the struggles, anxieties, hopes and promises of/for a bureaucracy in coming to terms with a gradual but seemingly eventual shift from paper work to digital paper work. The users in this case are staff members tasked by the higher-level bureaucracy-who have little or no clue about it themselves- to learn a new tool and migrate all paper work to the digital domain. Many of e-governance projects are spearheaded by corporate organizations, which in turn dictate the terms of the conversation on Digital Literacy even within the government. What impact does this have on how Digital Literacy is understood, articulated and executed in ICT4D programs within and without the government.</p> Readings <p>Terranova, Tiziana. 2004.

 A DIF-hosted resource for community development  Introduction <p>It has been almost three years since DIF began working on the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">Universal Resolver</a> (GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver) </a>— a foundational piece of infrastructure for the Decentralized Identity ecosystem (see the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">original announcement</a>). Since then, our vision of being interoperable across ledgers and DID methods has seen a lot of support. Thanks to community contributions, the Universal Resolver now supports around 30 different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>Today, we are happy to announce an updated set of instances where the Universal Resolver is deployed. One stable and one experimental version will be iterated, maintained, and hosted by DIF as a service to the community!🎉</p><p>While this is undoubtedly a useful resource for research, experimentation, testing, and development, it is important that it not be mistaken for a production-grade universal resolver. It should be pointed out&nbsp;that:</p>  This infrastructure is neither intended or approved for production use cases and that nobody should rely on it for anything other than for development and testing purposes.  These two specific deployments are not production-ready. The preferred scenario continues to be that all DID-based information systems, run by a method operator or otherwise, production or otherwise, host their own instance of the Universal Resolver (or other DID Resolution tools).  DIF withholds the right to limit or modify the performance of this free service in case usage for production, commercial, and/or malicious purposes is detected.   Two Deployments <p>The following two deployments are now available as a community service:</p><p>* <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> — Hosted on IBM Cloud by DIF (thanks IBM!). While not considered production-ready, this instance is expected to be relatively stable. It will be tested before and after manual updates from time to time, with versioned releases.<br>* <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> — Hosted on AWS by DIF. This instance is more experimental, will be updated frequently, and is connected to CI/CD processes. It may be down from time to time or have unexpected functionality changes.</p><p>Note: For backward compatibility, the original URL <a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a> will now redirect to <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p> Documentation <p>See the following links for more information about testing, release, and deployment processes of the Universal Resolver:</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@polarmermaid">Anne&nbsp;Nygård</a>  AWS Architecture: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/dev-system.md</a>  CI/CD Process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/continuous-integration-and-delivery.md</a>  Branching Strategy: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/branching-strategy.md</a>  Release process: <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md">https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/master/docs/creating-releases.md</a>  Periodically, this standing work item is discussed in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>, so that group’s recorded meetings and discussions on Slack and <a href="https://dif.groups.io/g/id-wg">mailing list</a> may contain further insight on the above&nbsp;topics.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540">The Universal Resolver Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 and how today’s most powerful authentication mechanisms can be decentralized <p>It is a mouthful of an acronym: it stands for OpenID Connect — Self-Issued Identity Provider. Unless you are familiar with the terminology of the OpenID community, knowing what the acronym stands for doesn’t illuminate much, but rest assured, this is one of the most exciting developments to support the widespread adoption of Verifiable Credentials across the&nbsp;web.</p><p>This post will explain how it’s exciting and what kinds of adoption it could galvanize. First, we will cover OpenID &amp; OpenID Connect, then touch on how decentralized identity (or “self-sovereign identity”) relates to “authentication” and “user accounts,” and finally how they can work together, with two educational videos along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>While there is substantial and sophisticated <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc/blob/master/docs/README.md">prior art</a>, particularly in the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries</a> community, for integrating verifiable credentials with OpenID Connect, using DIDs for OIDC is still emerging and approaching its first stable specification in the coming months. This is the culmination of substantial collaborative work to develop this bridge between the DID Authentication Working Group at DIF and various interlocutors at the OpenID Foundation. This post breaks down key elements of this development and shares more resources if you want to explore it&nbsp;further.</p> What is OpenID &amp; OpenID&nbsp;Connect <p>The first seeds of OpenID were sprouted at the very first Internet Identity Workshop in 2005. All the companies interested in URL-based protocols got together and collaborated together on their various models for designing authentication for users against URLs they controlled, like their personal blogs. This protocol has evolved and the latest iteration is based on sophisticated OAuth (Open Authorization) standards and&nbsp;tooling.</p><p>The basic and most typical flow used by OpenID Connect can be described as follows: an individual, which in this context can be called a “user” of the identity system, first gets a fresh proof of authenticity of their digital identity. This unique proof is minted in the course of an interaction with a service called an “Identity Provider” (IP), i.e. Google or Facebook. This proof usually takes the form of a “token,” a single-use cryptographic access code linked to the corresponding identity record at the IP. The user then takes that token to a second site that they are going to login to, with is called the “Relying Party” or RP, which can then trust they are dealing with the same person identified (usually very strongly) by the Identity provider.</p>OpenID Login&nbsp;Flow<p>The teams of professionals that created OpenID Connect had enough imagination to anticipate more complex use-cases that weren’t immediately needed by the commercialized web of 2005, but for which the technical foundations were still worth laying. Among there, there was a clear idea that users would, in some cases, prefer or need to bring their own identity with them rather than a pointer to a record on an IP’s server. This identity would thus be “self-issued,” a capability they designed into the OpenID core specification.</p><p>The vision of DID-SIOP is a way of bringing decentralized identity concepts into alignment with the ideas of “self-issued” portable identity that the original OpenID innovators had. It was good that they included and preserved this underutilized capability in their immensely popular and internet-powering framework, which is the basis of modern social login (i.e., “Sign on with Google/Facebook/etc”). After all, it would have been simpler not to, but enough of designers and thinkers involved anticipated much of what has developed in parallel, the decentralized identity technology that the DIF serves to&nbsp;support.</p> How do decentralized identity systems&nbsp;work? <p>In this conceptual framework, the “Identity Provider” has been cut down a notch, and is instead referred to as a mere “Issuer” (of credentials and information, perhaps of identities over which it has less control).Similarly, the “user” is defined less by borrowed tools and more by owned ones, assuming the title of “Holder” of information and identity, whether issued or self-issued.. The “verifier” relies less on the identity provider, choosing instead to verify information and identities presented by their holder on their own terms (with some cryptographic assurances about the&nbsp;issuer).</p><p>One interesting difference between traditional OIDC and decentralized systems is that in the latter, all parties have identifiers that make it possible to verify signatures; it is hard to tell from a DID whether it corresponds to an institution, an individual, or an inanimate object, because it could be any or all of those. Whatever it represents, it points to ways of verifying signatures with so-called “key material” (public keys, hints to how to classify and use them). Most often, this happens by looking up the material on a distributed ledger, but this is not, strictly speaking, definitive of the framework..</p><p>The key material from an OIDC issuer proves the veracity of whatever information or identity is being presented in a way that is tied back to that issue by similar key-material guarantees, and a self-issued OIDC token works the same way. (In a self-issued OIDC credential, the holder’s key material is used in the place of an institutional issuer’s).</p> How OpenID and Decentralized ID can fit&nbsp;together <p>One of the big challenges for any new technology that needs an identity system is getting adoption of the needed components so the system can actually work at a sustainable scale. This usually required buy-in from various kinds of actors in an ecosystem: at the very least, it needs critical mass of users/holders, IPs/issuers, and RPs/verifiers, each maintaining their end of the infrastructure and “keeping the lights on,” as it&nbsp;were.</p><p>This is exactly where the two systems can really help each other: achieving and maintaining critical mass of all three, as the distribution of more and less centralized solutions changes, and self-issued credentials come to be accepted in theory and in practice. OpenID Connect has a large “install base”: there are literally millions of websites running OpenID Connect tooling as the authentication mechanism at their “front door” for users. Indeed, while a vanishingly small portion of internet users have ever heard of OIDC, it is the nuts and bolts of the most universal and familiar UX and user flow of the contemporary commercial web, including online banking and government services.</p><p>OIDC-SIOP leverages the code that OpenID Connect relying parties already have in place across all these millions of sites, and the lion’s share of the 10,000 most used websites. Think of the screen that reads, “Log in with Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github / etc.” OIDC-SIOP enables organizations to ask for Verifiable Credentials that an individual holds in their wallet instead of a token from Google / Facebook / Twitter / Github. These can be single-use access codes with cryptography built in, or more reusable credentials, or richer credentials containing various kinds of information otherwise requested from an IP. This mechanism is provided by the Self-Issued OpenID Provider flow described by the core specification:</p><p>If successful, this will be a huge win for decentralized identity, because it addresses the perennial “Relying Party” problem of adoption: how do you get relying parties to adopt a new technology, install and trust a new “doorway,” adapt their security and business processes to a new set of strengths and weaknesses? In the popular imagination and even in much of the technology press, scaling a business or a technology is often imagined as a quest for users, but they are often the easiest shareholder to get on board, particularly for something convenient and powerful. The relying parties (or, in economic terms, the “demand side” of identity) is often a much harder business problem, and in this case, no “big lift” is required of the verifiers or “relying party” consuming a new kind of authentication credentials because they only have to make minor adjustments to the nearly universal OIDC tooling they already&nbsp;have.</p> Further Reading <p>The purpose of the DID Authentication <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">Working Group</a> at DIF is to design, recommend, and implement authentication protocols that rely on open standards and cryptographic protocols tailored to today’s and tomorrow’s systems for handling DIDs and DID documents, the primitives of decentralized identities. In last six months, the group has been actively working on the OIDC bridge, and they presented their latest work at DIF’s June 2020 virtual “face to face”&nbsp;meeting:</p><p>Here is a link to their draft specification, nearing stability and ratification at time of press: <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">https://identity.foundation/did-siop/</a>. For an explanation of some of the design principles and conceptual fine points, see the article “<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">If You Build an Island You Need a Boat</a>” from DIF member Mattr Global&nbsp;(NZ).</p><p>Finally, if you want to go even deeper into the technical nitty gritty (particularly if you are unfamiliar with OIDC best practices), watch this video of a two hour presentation about OIDC-SIOP put on jointly with the DIDAuth group and the OpenID Foundation June 25th&nbsp;2020.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/where-to-begin-with-oidc-and-siop-7dd186c89796">Where to begin with OIDC and SIOP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Today, ID2020 announced its newest Alliance partner, the National Cybersecurity Center&nbsp;(NCC). <p>ID2020 was founded in 2016 to ensure that all people have access to better forms of digital ID, bringing together nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>Founded in 2016 by the former Governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper, the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC) is a Colorado Springs-based nonprofit committed to promoting cyber innovation and awareness.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to welcome the National Cybersecurity Center to the ID2020 Alliance,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “Because technology is evolving so quickly, many of the transactions that once took place in person and required traditional forms of ID are today being conducted digitally. Cyber threats, whether criminal or state-state sponsored, underscore the urgency and importance of ID2020 and the NCC’s collective efforts. We look forward to sharing our expertise and learning from their world-class team of cybersecurity experts.”</blockquote><p>With a mission to “secure the world”, the NCC has four main initiatives:</p><p>● Secure the Vote seeks to increase voter confidence in the U.S. on the accuracy of vote-counting, and to generate greater awareness of possible solutions to critical gaps in the voting infrastructure. Secure the Vote supports jurisdictions’ efforts to offer a secure, auditable mobile voting option for overseas voters through coordinating, and evaluating pilots across the&nbsp;country.</p><p>● Secure Smart Cities: Hyper-connectivity amongst smart devices and urbanization drive the need for cities to become more efficient in their operations as they continue to grow, but the concern of security impedes the overall advancement of several cities with “Smart”&nbsp;agendas.</p><p>● The NCC’s Cyber Education Program provides cybersecurity leadership, and one of the main pillars is K-12 education. As our nation addresses the critical gap in skilled cybersecurity talent, NCC addresses the importance of cyber education through programs and partnerships that invite students to participate in an ecosystem that encourages them to learn, explore, and build their&nbsp;skills.</p><p>○ The NCC’s K-12 initiative, the National Cybersecurity Center Student Alliance (NCCSA) offers opportunities for middle and high school students to improve technical literacy through fun, interactive, and challenging camps, field trips, workshops, and events. NCC encourages STEM education for all students, with special attention towards creating inviting and collaborative opportunities for girls and other underrepresented groups in the cyber ecosystem.</p><p>● The Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), a separate nonprofit organization, has the mission to facilitate collaboration across the global space industry to enhance our ability to prepare for and respond to vulnerabilities, incidents, and threats; to disseminate timely and actionable information among member entities; and to serve as the primary communications channel for the sector with respect to this information.</p><blockquote>“Digital citizenship is an increasingly critical space as more of our identity is online,” said NCC Director of Business and Government Initiatives, Forrest Senti. “The NCC’s work to secure cyberspace intersects directly with ID2020’s work to protect individuals’ online identity and to ensure that policies created around that protection are fair and equitable and ensure the utmost security for citizens around the world. We look forward to working with ID2020 to pioneer new ways to secure the future of identity.”</blockquote><p>The future of digital ID is at an important crossroads. As policymakers in the US and around the world struggle to confront the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, some are considering plans for digital identity-based health credentials to facilitate a return to work, school, and other social activities. The risks to privacy and security are high, as are the rewards of doing it right. ID2020 is working urgently with its partners and other stakeholders to ensure that privacy and data security are built into the technical architecture of these systems and that the appropriate legislative and regulatory are developed to guide their implementation.</p><p>ID2020 and the National Cybersecurity Center share a common mission to secure our individual and collective privacy and security. We welcome them to the Alliance and look forward to working collaboratively to advance our shared&nbsp;goals.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and ethical implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital identity solutions. By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implantation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally.

<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched a new microsite, LoginWithFIDO.com, for high level, non-technical information about FIDO for consumers and service providers. As part of this project, we wanted to learn more about consumer attitudes and habits around authentication. What are their password habits? What do they think about the FIDO approach? Do they want to see FIDO at login?&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out, we conducted a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers – the results of which we’ll be sharing on this webinar. Join us to see the findings from our research and to learn how you may be able to utilize the data for your own FIDO offerings and/or deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to hear:&nbsp;</p>



  How many different passwords consumers really use for their online accounts  What tactics they use for password management and how often they are resetting passwords and&nbsp;  Their familiarity with various types of authentication technologies including SMS OTPs, biometrics and others  The types of apps and services where consumers most want to use FIDO  How consumers want to be communicated with about FIDO at enrollment and login  



<p>We will also give the audience a detailed look at LoginWithFIDO.com and how you can consider using it for your own educational initiatives around FIDO. You’ll learn:</p>



  How to navigate through the microsite and its two landing pages  How you can reference the site and its materials for your own offerings and deployments  Added insights into how to utilize FIDO’s consumer-facing marks

<p>Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director &amp; CMO, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>At its WWDC, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10670/">detailed</a> that its upcoming release of Safari in iOS and MacOS 14 will enable users to use Touch ID and Face ID for web logins, and we couldn’t be happier. It marks a giant step forward in the industry’s quest to move beyond passwords in favor of cryptographically secure authentication based on FIDO standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The functionality, based on the WebAuthn API in the FIDO2 standard, will make logging in to a website as easy as it is to unlock your iPhone or iPad using whichever biometric option is available. Apple’s built-in support in its stock web browser means that every modern device platform now has built-in FIDO support, which furthers our aim of making FIDO Authentication as ubiquitous as other critical internet protocols.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To that end, we’ve recently provided a resource that shows the latest progress for FIDO support across browsers and platforms.&nbsp; This image (shown below) is permanently hosted on our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/">WebAuthn resources page</a>.&nbsp;</p>







<p>It’s been really cool to watch this diagram grow both wider&nbsp; (adding in the Apple operating systems) and greener over the past 12 months or so since Apple ramped up its FIDO support. This rapid maturation and support for WebAuthn is accelerating adoption; with over 85 percent of today’s browsers now supporting FIDO Authentication, many service providers are now actively working to deploy FIDO to their customers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance was founded on a singular mission: To eliminate dependence on passwords by creating and driving adoption of open standards for simpler, stronger user authentication. Today, we’re closer to reaching that audacious goal that the FIDO ecosystem has been working on for the past several years. Thanks, Apple!</p>

 Becca Savory, Sarah McKeever &amp; Shaunak&nbsp;Sen  Session <p>Since its early days the Internet has been conceived in terms of both movement and landscape — from “cyberspace” to the “Information Superhighway” — and in popular perception is often viewed as a boundless space imagined in terms of limitless possibilities. Indeed, across our research fields, from digital media to performance and social activism, we find that the Internet is frequently perceived as a space of mobilisation: where moving bodies are remediated within online content; where the movement of images, ideas and bodies can occur freely, with the rapid transmission of the “viral”; and where movement(s) frequently spill over into physical geographies.</p><p>Yet increasingly the Internet is also a space of fractured and fragmented movement(s): of blockages and blockades, discontinuities and disappearances. Landscapes become territorialized and movement(s) confined or obstructed. On this basis, we propose an interdisciplinary discussion session around the theme of “#InternetMovement(s)”. We ask how we can conceive of movement(s) in relation to the Internet in India, in terms of both mobility and immobility, fissure and&nbsp;flow.</p><p>To encourage fluidity, we propose to structure the session around three “nodes” rather than three separate research papers. Our nodes are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  How can we conceive of movement(s) in relation to Internet research in&nbsp;India?  What are the forms that movement(s) take in our respective fields?  What “stop” or blocks” movement in these&nbsp;cases?  <p>The three co-conveners will each prepare a 5-minute response to each of these nodes, based on our specific areas of research. At each nodal point we will then allow time for wider discussion, enabling inter-disciplinary discussion and flow to underpin the&nbsp;session.</p><p>We perceive the session to speak to the first of the conference’s core questions: “How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?”</p><p>Each of the three co-convenors is approaching this question in their own research, asking how online media and communications mediate, remediate and transform the fields of film-media, social activism, and performance. We also ask the corollary: what are the limits and impediments to those transformations or mediations? The following section outlines the co-convenors’ approaches in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Plan  Statement of Intent&nbsp;I <p>The internet increasingly impresses traces on nearly all media technologies everyday. The once stable film body, gets disaggregated into various new forms of loop videos, GIFS, photo-memes, as clips and stills from disparate films get extracted, re-edited, patched and re-moulded into new user-generated media material. Solitary moments and gestures from films (a menacing wink by Jack Nicholson from The Shining, a clap from Charles Kane, a tear from the Tin-Man in The Wizard of Oz) get completely unchained from the original narrative context and used as discrete independent communicative units (Kane’s a popular Birthday wish gesture, while Nicholson’s Is a common linguistic unit signifying playful flirtation.) One of the primary ontological pegs of cinema — movement, today becomes the center of urgent debate around the status of photographs, movement-image forms like GIFs, and traditional moving images as the basic configuring elements of contemporary cinema. Using the film-GIF form as its primary vector this paper opens up the category of ‘movement’ philosophically as well as a constituent form to understand cinema today within the context of&nbsp;India.</p><p>As the cinematic object disperses into thousands of fragments hurtling through innumerable new online contexts, questions related to stardom also get radically transformed. I will be investigating a particular site of cinematic re-instansiation — the recent Alok Nath meme phenomenon. Long relegated to the margins of films as the venerable Hindu middle class father, the ‘’Alok Nath is so sanskaari..’’ set off a viral maelstrom that suddenly recast his cinematic body and the memory of a whole host of films (the Suraj Barjatya Hindu joint-family films). The paper focus on questions around movement as a philosophical arena as well as radical new form re-inscribing the cinematic in hitherto unprecedented shapes&nbsp;today.</p> Statement of Intent&nbsp;II <p>An examination of social movements with digital components in India begs several questions: What forms do social movements take in the digital world? How do we conceptualise social movements using digital and physical evidence? How does the context of India — as a functioning democracy — allow or restrict digital and physical social movements and define what is an “acceptable” protest movement? Engaging with these questions demands an interdisciplinary perspective, and exploring the interplays between the physical and the digital in regard to social issue protest movements.</p><p>Movement in my particular research area is understood in two aspects: the physical mobilisation of individuals to protest against perceived grievances and the movement of information around specific issue areas. The physical movement of bodies in public places is intimately connected to flow of information throughout digital networks, generating entangled and complex interfaces between the digital and the physical and creating new imagined possibilities of the efficacy of social protest (Castells 2012; Gerbaudo 2012). Examining recent social movements in New Delhi allows us to explore the linkages and disjuncture between the physical and digital, using theoretical developments in social movement theory to anchor the study (Earl, Hunt, and Garrett 2014; Krinsky and Crossley&nbsp;2014).</p><p>Examining the repercussions and strategies of physical/digital mobilisation can lead to a confrontation between the “imagined” possibilities of digital mobilisation and the realities of technological and physical blockages. These blockages can exist at the level of the network — both in digital and physical limitations — but also at the level of digital informational flow and who is allowed to view data? Confronting the “imagined” capabilities with the reality of entrenched power networks contests the notion of the digital as a free superhighway of information into a series of blocks and stoppages, restricting what is possible and feasible. By exploring question of movement(s) in New Delhi, I will explore the disjuncture between the imagined possibilities and the restriction of information — by nature of the algorithms that govern our capabilities and our own social networks — and complicate the triumphal narrative of the affordances of digital mediums on protest movements.</p><p>References</p><p>Castells, M.

My underlying concern when approaching this research is: who is mobile in these contexts? Who becomes visible through movement, and by extension, who may disappear in these same&nbsp;moments?</p><p>I intend to approach this session by examining what is enacted through the movements of flash mob performance, focusing on the more recent phase of the genre in which flash mobs become mobilised through online video-sharing practices. I argue that they perform mediated representations of “New India” for an online national and international audience, valorising the new “non-places” (Augé 1992) of Indian supermodernity, through the acts of a mobilised “digerati” (Keniston 2004). If we consider that performance can play a role in the construction of cultural memory (Roach 1996; Taylor 2003), and that the Internet as an archive can become a repository of performances and thus memories(Gehl 2009), I ask if online performance in these contexts may be seen as an aspect of the processes that structure a “politics of forgetting” (Fernandes 2006) in globalising India. Which narratives are rendered visible and which invisible through these performances? Who appears and who disappears? Movement on the Internet thus becomes a political question concerned with comparative mobilities, visibilities, and participation in the narratives of “India” that are constructed for global circulation.</p><p>References</p><p>Augé, M., 1992.

<p>Banks in Europe have deployed customer authentication solutions for several years. These solutions have served their purpose well and enabled customers to safely log in to their bank accounts. In the world of e-commerce, these solutions, when used, have been successful in combating online payment fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and its associated Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) dramatically change the payment landscape, considering:</p>



  The mandate for strong, multi-factor authentication,&nbsp;  The emergence of Third Party Providers (TPP) accessing accounts via open APIs  



<p>The success of PSD2 will ultimately be determined by how well banks can balance user convenience with security obligations, while maximizing reach. As such, they may want to evaluate how well their legacy authentication solutions meet this new need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication standards have been proposed as a way for banks to meet all requirements in a PSD2 world — but is the change from a legacy method to FIDO worthwhile?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join this webinar to learn more about FIDO Authentication standards and how they compare with legacy authentication methods used to access an account or secure an online payment. The methods compared are SMS OTPs, hardware OTP generators, CAP readers, and proprietary smartphone and biometrics-based solutions in terms of PSD2 compliance, security, usability and scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join us to find out: Why change to FIDO?</p>

A new global framework for regulating the crypto industry is coming into place this year. One of the most important new rules that businesses interacting with crypto has to implement is what is known as the Travel Rule. The Travel Rule, which is also known as The Wire Transfer rule, requires a business managing crypto on behalf of their user to transfer KYC’d (Know-Your-Customer) Identity Information to a receiving institution. Pelle Braendgaard, CEO of Notabene, will share his insights and explain how his company is tackling this business challenge for the industry.

Complying with this rule provides many challenges for the industry. Several industry groups have already started to invent several new protocols to solve this. Notabene helps financial companies be compliant with new, global anti-money laundering (AML) regulations for crypto transactions coming into effect right now. Pelle believes this is a critical use case for SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity). In this talk, he will go over the rule itself, industry protocols, how he sees SSI can help here, and how they are helping to solve it.

<p>The global movement in support of “good ID” advanced another step today as ID2020 announced ZAKA as its third “certified” digital ID solution.</p><p>Most of us take the ability to prove our identity for granted. But for one in seven people globally, the lack of a widely recognized form of ID means being unable to access basic legal protections and social services and being unable to participate fully as citizens and voters. Worldwide, more than one billion people are systematically excluded from the modern economy because they lack any form of formal&nbsp;ID.</p><p>In 2019, ID2020 announced plans to launch the first certification mark for digital ID at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The<a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-launches-technical-certification-mark-e6743d3f70fd"> Certification </a>recognizes solutions that adhere to ID2020’s stringent standards for user-management, privacy-protection, portability, and interoperability and offers technology companies a roadmap for the development of ethical, inclusive digital&nbsp;ID.</p><p>To be eligible for certification, applicants must adhere to 41 functional, outcomes-based<a href="https://id2020.org/uploads/files/Technical-Requirements.pdf"> Technical Requirements</a>. To date, 29 technology providers from every corner of the globe have submitted applications and worked with our staff and advisory committees to complete the process. In March, ID2020 announced its first two certified solutions, Kiva Protocol and Gravity. Today, ZAKA joins this esteemed community of technology providers.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust digital ID technology into the headlines as countries around the world consider plans for digital health credentials and technology-assisted contact tracing. There has never been more urgency to “get the technology right”.</p><blockquote>“Digital ID can be a powerful force multiplier for global social and economic development, but it can also be used to exclude people or even persecute vulnerable populations like refugees, children, and the homeless,” said ID2020 Executive Director, Dakota Gruener. “As governments and businesses rush to adopt digital ID solutions, the ID2020 Certification is proving a valuable tool for those who are developing user-centric, privacy-protecting solutions to meet the needs of all&nbsp;people.”</blockquote><p>The Certification also provides a third-part seal of approval so that those implementing and using these technologies know that they were developed according to the highest ethical and technical standards and with full consideration of both the benefits and&nbsp;risks.</p><p>This market-based approach is already shifting the technical landscape and several multinational technology providers have adapted their technical approaches to comply with ID2020’s Technical Requirements.</p><p>About ZAKA</p><p>Based in the UK, ZAKA is committed to the idea that any person, with any phone, should be able to access any service, at any time. Like ID2020, ZAKA shares the perspective that, in an increasingly connected world, digital trust is an essential enabler of thriving economies.</p><p>ZAKA’s mobile app and software development kit (available in Android, iOS and USSD) helps individuals to build a set of verifiable digital credentials that are private, secure and portable, allowing them to connect with services such as mobile health, financial services, and education. And for service providers, ZAKA’s web dashboard allows them to configure their digital trust requirements and roll-out the solution to remotely verify and onboard customers. This allows services to concentrate on developing and distributing high-quality services, rather than be held back by high distribution and customer acquisition costs. ZAKA has also developed proprietary voice biometric technology which can be deployed together with, or separately from, it’s&nbsp;Apps.</p><p>In recent months, ZAKA has also extended its solution to support the response to, and recovery from, COVID-19. Their NewNorm™️ service is now being used by universities, employers, and event organizers to support a safe return to the “new&nbsp;normal”.</p><blockquote>“We are delighted to receive the ID2020 Certification,” said ZAKA CEO and Co-Founder Nick Mason. “We expect a great return on our investment of time and resources in this process and look forward to using the ID2020 certification to set ZAKA apart from our competition. The rigorous evaluation of our company by ID2020 should give prospective partners confidence that our solution is meeting global standards and advancing the vital mission of bringing “good ID” to&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>ZAKA is already implementing their its technology in Turkey, Rwanda, and the United&nbsp;States.</p><p>In partnership with the United Nations Development Program and led by the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ZAKA is helping refugees obtain verifiable digital ID credentials that are portable and owned by them. Refugees can use these credentials to connect with services in a dedicated marketplace for services that support their self-sufficiency. Through the app, refugees can also receive promotional information from their chosen services about beneficial opportunities.</p><p>In Rwanda, ZAKA is working in partnership with the utility regulator, Airtel, and other private and public partners to implement a solution that leverages voice biometrics for remote customer verification. This can be used by banks, telcos, and healthcare providers to serve rural customers, whether they own a smartphone or feature&nbsp;phone.</p><p>Here in the United States, ZAKA’s COVID-19 status tracking solution, NewNorm™️, is helping employees and customers be safe in the “new normal”. This is being used by two New York University departments that have returned students, staff, and faculty to on-site instruction.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>Based in San Francisco, ID2020 harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of responsibly implemented, user-managed, privacy-protected, and portable digital identity solutions.</p><p>Through its advocacy, project funding, technical support, and now by certifying best-in-class identity solutions, ID2020 is helping build the infrastructure needed to strengthen social and economic development and ensure that all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights and reap the benefits of economic empowerment.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-announces-certification-of-zaka-group-ltd-de019220362d">ID2020 Announces Certification of ZAKA Group Ltd.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Last April, the FIDO Korea Working Group announced our initiative to distribute FIDO Security Keys to Korean citizens to help better secure their identities, data and systems while working remotely due to the Coronavirus outbreak. We were able to do this thanks to FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group Deployment &amp; Marketing Sub-Group’s efforts and in-kind sponsorship by FIDO Security Key vendors like TrustKey (previously known as eWBM), AirCuve (Yubico’s local partner) and Octatco. Today, we are happy to share the results of this initiative, which ended with positive impacts and pleasant surprises.&nbsp;</p>



[Screen capture of campaign task force team member online meeting]



<p>In short, the outcome can be summarized as following:</p>



  The campaign was covered by 15+ local online media, spreading positive awareness of FIDO Authentication  We reached out to 52 organizations and individuals exposed to greater cyber risk by working at home and distributed 156 FIDO Security Keys  70% of them were new relationships that we had not previously had through previous on/offline events (e.g. hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare centers, patent offices, online game developers, ecommerce owners, retail shop owners, architects, hospitality industries, financial institutes, financial investors, school teachers, semiconductor industries, sports video analyst, advertisement agency, etc.)  25% of them had potential to be business partners or relying parties  



[Pictures of task force team members preparing the packages to be shipped out]



<p>Here are some remarks by recipients of free FIDO Security Keys who agreed to disclose their identities:</p>



<p>“We are a group of 5 university hospitals working together on a suicide prevention project.&nbsp; Securing personal and medical information of these patients are very important, especially when we are working remotely.&nbsp; We hope to try out the FIDO Security Key through this giveaway campaign and find out how to adopt it into our database protection system.” – Mr. Dohyun Kwon, Seoul National University Hospital</p>



<p>“It is a shame but we have been writing passwords on a wall thus far, so we do not have to ask each other when logging into shared computers.&nbsp; It is scary that these passwords can be exposed to others with bad intentions.&nbsp; We have a great hope that FIDO Security Keys would eliminate these worries and even enable architects to work at home while feeling secured and safe.” – Mr. Taehoon Hur, Ruha Architectural Design Firm</p>



<p>“I operate over 10 healthcare and fitness centers in Seoul and always felt uncomfortable about having all these members’ personal information sitting on our computer where any staff with passwords can access it , not to mention some staff with such privileges kept on forgetting these long and hard-to-remember passwords.&nbsp; It would be interesting experiments for us to test out these FIDO Security Keys in practice.” – Ms. Jaehee Yoon, STAR Health Care and Fitness</p>



<p>“We are food product wholesalers mainly doing businesses online.&nbsp; Due to the Coronavirus outbreak, we would have to have our staff work at home with much of our purchasing and customer information in their laptops.&nbsp; Hope our staff would not have to expose the passwords by using these FIDO Security Keys.&nbsp;Thank you!” – Mr. Hoyoon Jung, NongGa Food Products</p>



<p>“WIPS is the number one patent database related services and consulting firm in Korea.&nbsp; We are used to working under Bring Your Own Device environment but have struggled managing passwords.&nbsp; Happy to take part in this experiment program and hope to see positive results.” – Mr. Taewoo Kwon, WIPS</p>







<p>Once again, we truly appreciate the undivided attention and efforts given by all FKWG members on this campaign, and especially recognize TTA (Telecommunications Technology Association) and Dr. Heung Youl Youm, for their extra efforts in the early stage of ideation and promotions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr. Stephen Oh, the Co-Leader of FKWG Deployment &amp; Marketing Sub-Group said, “It was an amazing experience not just because we have learned a lot from the market where we could not usually reach through conventional approaches, but also it only took less than a month from ideation to full execution.”</p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s note: For background on the 2020 Hackathon in Korea, see the April blog post: “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/2020-fido-hackathon-goodbye-password-challenge-in-korea/">2020 FIDO Hackathon: Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea</a>.”</p>



<p>These are the faces of 2020 FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge participants, captured during online interviews which took place in the first two weeks of May.</p>







<p>A little over 40 applications were received by the end of proposal submission deadline, and 25 teams were given the opportunity to have online interviews, which helped them to crystalize their ideas and understand the full details of the Goodbye Password Challenge Program. About 100 people from 22 teams are now at the Learn and Implement Phase, which is being delivered through a specialized designated online communication platform.</p>



<p>We will not be sharing full details of the participating teams until they reach the final evaluation date the first week of August, but we would like to share some examples of proposed development ideas:</p>



Type of TeamDevelopment IdeasVentureThe specialists from 5 university hospitals got together on a suicide prevention project.&nbsp; They are going to develop an application that would enable sharing of patients’ personal and medical information, with FIDO implemented as a means for strong and simpler authentication.&nbsp; The unique aspect about this team is that the leader of the team got to know about the FIDO Hackathon after receiving free FIDO Security Keys, which FKWG supported for those who were recently forced to work at home due to public health issues.StudentsFour students from different universities got together and aim to develop a FIDO protocol-based smart home environment.&nbsp; They plan to come up with a miniature model which can demonstrate control of home temperature, curtains, windows, appliances, etc. The leader of the team did participate in the 2019 FIDO Hackathon, yet was not able to reach the top 3. This year, he aims to reach the top 5.Study GroupFour experts (entrepreneur, engineers, healthcare specialist) are aiming to develop a FIDO + DID-based electronic healthcare card system. There are reports of fraud use in local healthcare card systems, and the team wishes to eliminate it by implementing a FIDO protocol based biometric authentication system.StudentsFour university students work at their school’s IT helpdesk and they want to change how they work through developing a new application. As of today, they receive a phone call requesting a repair or replacement, and write down the log on paper.&nbsp; They plan to develop an application that can not only manage these helpdesk support requests but also verify the caller’s identity.StudentsTwo teams submitted similar ideas on developing innovative door locks by implementing a FIDO authentication system. Most current smart door locks in Korea are password-based and cause lots of trouble because they are easy to forget, vulnerable to exposure, etc. It is also noted by these students that currently fingerprint smart door locks in Korea share the secrets to servers, which raises high risk for hacking. It would be quite interesting how these two teams would be able to differentiate themselves with final results.StudentsThree university students have an idea to develop an innovative voting system by implementing FIDO protocols. They hope this novel voting system will lower costs, bring up voting rates and verify actual voters in a speedy manner.StudentsThese two university students are high school alumni and they have been working on various projects in the past. For 2020 FIDO Hackathon, they proposed an idea to manage different levels of security zones by implementing various levels of FIDO authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;Study GroupFive experts (university student, engineers, high school student) are committed to developing a FIDO protocol based Single Sign On System (SSO).&nbsp; They claim that they can differentiate themselves from existing SSOs, so let’s see how things unfold. This is the only team with a high school student.StudentsSix university students have an idea to prevent minors from purchasing alcohol and tobacco by developing a FIDO protocol based application. The local government is pushing the Mobile ID system, thus this would be an interesting proof of concept.StudentsTwo students from two different universities have an idea to develop a Blockchain + FIDO based online ticket purchase application, so they can eliminate black-market activities.StudentsFour students from the same university have an idea to develop a FIDO-based kiosk that can provide school documents for students. The school they attend already has such a kiosk that can print out their records but the system requests too much personal information and they are based on IDs and passwords.



<p>On July 1, we will have the mid-term meet-up event to share each team’s current development status and plans for the rest of the implementation phase.</p>



<p>Please stay tuned and we will come back with more updates on 2020 FIDO Hackathon in Korea.</p>

We are very proud to release a special webinar to introduce the next chapter of the “Self-Sovereign Identity Book” from two of the most eminent authorities on digital identity in government: Tim Bouma and Dave Roberts, senior public servants with the Government of Canada and major contributors to the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF).

In this chapter, Tim and Dave explain the PCTF model and how it maps to the SSI model and the Trust over IP (ToIP) stack.

This webinar describes how a world leader in digital identity (which Canada has been for two decades) sees the opportunity in the new decentralized identity model represented by SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity).

 Ishita Tiwary, Sandeep Mertia &amp; Siddharth Narrain  Sessions <p>The Internet today, as we know, is one of the most challenging socio-technical systems to understand and theorise. As a hybrid medium that perpetually, reinvents, redesigns and re-markets itself and its publics it defies all forms of historical, social, legal and technological determinisms and/or generalisations. The complex nature of the medium and the social and cultural lives of the information packets which flow through it can perhaps be better understood by heeding critical attention towards longer histories of media circulation, technology-society relationships and legal regulations.</p><p>The panel attempts to understand the way digital technologies (the Internet/the current digital moment) mediate aspects of our contemporary being through the history of media circulation, legal regulation and data infrastructure. The papers in the panel focus on three crucial periods — the 1940s early history of statistical mediation, the 1980s video moment and the early 2000s advent of legal regulation of the Internet. Each of these moments is marked by socio-technical, cultural and legal disruption as seen through both moral anxieties and utopian claims that circulate at the time. The panel attempts to understand media technologies through their technological affordances (unpacking current debates around data analytics through a history of statistical mediation) and the social and legal disruptions that follow their advent (video in the 80s and the Internet in late&nbsp;90s).</p><p>The papers in the panel approach the Internet and networked digital media as an assemblage of media infrastructures, bringing together both conceptual and material layers of their experience. The papers in this panel use a media archaeology approach (Elsaesser, 2004) to engage with the longer history of electronic communication in India by looking at both its material nature (how law produces the representation of digital media and the Internet), and the history of non narrative framework of databases (the Internet as a massive data infrastructure) which have become increasingly diverse and distributed through a network of institutions, practices and technological platforms.</p> Plan <p>Abstract I: ‘What is Video?’ Video and the Moment of Legal Disruption</p><p>The advent of YouTube changed the way users interact with media content as now they are making videos, watching videos, editing them, sharing them and discussing them at a frantic speed, creating new communities as they go along (Manovich, 2008).</p><p>The YouTube phenomenon and its implications cannot be understood without contextualizing it within the broader history of video. In India, the Asiad Games heralded the arrival of analog video technology, although there was no legal producer of video content in the country. In a sense video was an illegal object that spawned a vibrant economy of video films, video magazines and pornography.</p><p>Video cassettes were primarily in the pirate economy and circulated all across the country through video libraries and parlours. New Bollywood and Hollywood releases as well as pornographic films were available on video cassettes which initially did not have any film certification regulation. The new mode of circulation made these video exhibition spaces a lynchpin of moral paranoia and economic anxiety for those in authority-video was like a plague that needed to be monitored and regulated. This led to a string of legal regulations to keep the ‘video menace’ in check. Associations, organizations and forums protested the new wave of regulations as it pitched the medium of video against that of cinema, demanding new medium specific laws instead of amendments to previous laws on&nbsp;cinema.</p><p>In this paper, I will examine how the wave of regulations and contesting bodies creates a charged force field of the period that gives one a sense of a social, cultural and legal disruption caused by the arrival of a new technology. Particularly, I want to focus on how video as an illegal object circulates through informal circuits at a rapid pace and how the law deals with this new technological development. By looking at the example of video, it would be productive to think about the resonances the extended genealogies of how the law is interacting with the current digital moment through the prism of analog&nbsp;video.</p><p>Abstract II: Big Data 2.0 — A History of Statistical Remediation</p><p>One of the fast emerging themes in the understanding of the Internet is centred on its various technological affordances to generate, collect, measure, analyse, mine andvisualise data. With the recent (circa 2010) advent of the hype cycles of Big Data and data revolution, the socio-technical imaginaries which reveal the Internet as a massive data infrastructure have been gaining momentum. ‘Data’ which in many ways is an ontological byproduct of the Internet, is now increasingly becoming the object of thought and computation for understanding and analysing the Internet. This moment of flux invites us to reflect upon the genealogies of the concepts, techniques and practices which are consciously or otherwise informing the incredible epistemic investment in data-driven systems. With an aim to unpack some of the long histories of the contemporary data analytics movement and moment, this paper tries to trace some of the inflection points in the genealogies of analytics and statistical remediation in colonial and post-colonial India, with an emphasis on the works of P C Mahalanobis and the statistical framing of planning and governance in the pre- and post-independence era.</p><p>The author will utilise ethnographic and archival material from his on-going fieldwork on emerging data-driven systems in the social sector in India, to reflect upon the shifts in materiality of data, classificatory affordances of paper and software based systems, and their epistemic implications across two different epochs. In addition, as a methodological reflection, the paper will argue that — developing lateral, conceptual connections between pre-digital circulations and meaning making of numbers and their contemporary algorithmic ecologies, is crucial for moving beyond causalities and the Big Data hubris, towards a thicker anthropology of data-driven knowledge production across times, infrastructures and networks.</p><p>Abstract III: The History of Internet Law in&nbsp;India</p><p>The relationship between law and media technology in India has been broadly characterized as the law catching up with technological change. To unpack this statement, one needs to take into account how the law both shapes and is shaped by media technologies. As the law ‘catches up’ with new technology, it also characterizes this technology, brackets it, and helps reinforce popular perception of technology. This paper will examine the early history of Internet law in India, the debates that arose in the pre web 2.0 era, and the ways in which a wide variety of factors, over a period of 15 years, has gradually shaped the scope and extent of the law that governs the Internet, the Information Technology Act (IT),&nbsp;2000.</p><p>The IT Act, being relatively recent legislation is an ideal illustration to study the manner in which government policy, public perception, judicial pronouncements, parliamentary committee proceedings, legislative debates, and rapidly changing technology have influenced the shaping of this specific media infrastructure. By examining these documents I would like to open up a series questions around law and media technology How is the relationship between law and media technology staged through public discourse? What are the ways in which both the extremes — utopian hope and moral panic play out, and how are these then related to the more functional aspects of technology? Who were the major actors, individuals and institutions, who drove Internet law and regulation at this&nbsp;time?</p><p>By addressing these questions, this paper seeks to examine a small slice of the longer history of electronic communication in&nbsp;India.</p> Readings <p>Lovink, Geert and Nadiere, Sabine ed.

Samuel M. Smith will present KERI that stands for Key Event Receipt Infrastructure. Its a ledger-less approach to identity that enables a universal decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI). KERI is the basis for a new proposed universal DID method DID:uni. Because KERI identifiers are portable they are truly self-sovereign. The primary root-of-trust in KERI is a self-certifying identifier that is cryptographically bound to a set of key-pairs. These have fully generalized derivation mechanisms including content addressability with support for both rotatable and non-rotatable key-pairs. Its secondary root-of-trust are end-verifiable key event receipt logs. End verifiability means that KERI is not dependent on any intervening infrastructure. This fixes the primary security weakness of internet identity system security overlays thereby making KERI a candidate for a universal trust spanning layer for the internet to replace DNS-CA. KERI is an open-source project within the Decentralized Identity Foundation.

Samuel M. Smith Ph.D. works at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and decentralized computing systems as both an entrepreneur and strategic consultant. He has written and continues to write seminal white papers on decentralized identity, reputation AI, distributed computing, and tokenomics. He provides strategic technical and business model guidance to startups in these fields and is active in shaping the underlying standards and driving their adoption. Samuel received a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Brigham Young University in 1991. He spent 10 years at Florida Atlantic University, reaching full professor status before retiring to become an entrepreneur. He has over 100 refereed publications in the areas of machine learning, autonomous vehicle systems, automated reasoning, and decentralized systems. He was principal investigator on numerous federally funded research projects. Dr. Smith is an active participant in open standards development and is a serial entrepreneur.

Ceramic is a new permissionless protocol for creating and accessing unstoppable documents that serve as the foundation for a connected, interoperable web without silos. Joel Thorstensson is the founder and CTO of 3Box and the primary author of the ceramic protocol as well as several Ethereum standards for identity and will provide a conceptual and technical intro to Ceramic.

At the root of many of the internet’s problems is that apps and services today are built primarily in silos. This includes identity registries and credentials, user data and access permissions, infrastructure, and services. It not only puts control over data and identities in the wrong hands, but it’s a fundamentally outdated and inefficient model for building digital products.

Ceramic unlocks information interoperability between all platforms and services across the web, allowing participants to create and resolve documents for any type of information without any centralized service. Ceramic uses DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers), IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data), signed messages, and blockchain anchoring to create a trusted and shared graph of verifiable documents. While flexible, these documents are especially well-suited for self-sovereign identity systems, user-centric data ecosystems, and open web services.

 Sailen Routray &amp; Khetrimayum Monish&nbsp;Singh  Session <p>The discussion in this session will focus on the cultures of practices around digital / information networks. The objective would be to open up the understanding around notions of identity and rights in the context of governance on one hand, and the proliferation of various subcultures on the other. The objective is to try and understand the political and cultural imaginations ‘of and as the public’ enabled by internet and digital technologies. In this, we are trying to connect the whole discussion to the first two questions the conference focuses&nbsp;on:</p><p>How do we conceptualise, as an intellectual and political task, the mediation and transformation of social, cultural, political, and economic processes, forces, and sites through internet and digital media technologies in contemporary India?</p><p>How do we frame and explore the experiences and usages of internet and digital media technologies in India within its specific historical-material contexts shaped by traditional hierarchies of knowledge, colonial systems of communication, post-independence initiatives in nation-wide technologies of governance, a rapidly growing telecommunication market, and informal circuits of media production and consumption, among&nbsp;others?</p> Plan <p>Each discussant will present for 20 minutes after which the session will be thrown open for discussion amongst all the participants of the&nbsp;session.</p><p>Abstract I</p><p>Internet in India has led to the proliferation of practices and notions of governance and citizenship simulated by information networks and data. On one hand, the internet has captured the imagination of citizens and the reassertion of user agency; on the other, the experiences with the internet reflects the new ways of how the state imagines itself and the citizens. Hence, not only a critical mass replete with the possibilities of user agency, but also one aggregated by the state as part of a political project. Initiatives such as Digital India, the Aadhar project, rural internet and increased emphasis on mobile internet services are some of ways through which the logic of access and participation now operates. The paper will draw perspectives from four case studies in Assam — the Mahanagar Project (internet and mobile services), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) update, the Aadhaar Project and rural internet kiosks (Common Service Centers). With these, it focuses on the larger context of the cultures of digital practices; and techno-politics through the various sites and projects through which the internet operates in&nbsp;India.</p><p>Abstract II</p><p>Those of us who have jumped or meandered across to the wrong (or perhaps the right) side of thirty by now, first came to consume internet in what were called, and are still called, cyber cafes or internet cafes. Their numbers in big Indian cities is dwindling because of the increasing ubiquity of smartphone, and netbooks and data cards. The cyber café seems to be inexorably headed the way of the STD booth in the geography of large Indian cities. The present paper is a preliminary step towards capturing some of the experience of running and using internet cafes. With ethnographic fieldwork with cyber café owners and internet users in these cafes in the Chandrasekharpur area of Bhubaneswar (where the largest section of the computer industry in the state of Odisha is located), this paper tries to capture experiences that lie at the interstices of ‘objects’ and spaces — experiences that are at the same time a history of the internet as well as a personal history of the city. By doing so it tries to ask and answer the question — what kinds of publics does the consumption of the internet in spaces such as cybercafes create?</p> Readings <p>Escobar, Arturo, et al. 1994.

<p>Megan Shamas, Director of Marketing, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Over the last several years, eIDAS regulation has been widely adopted by the EU member states, and several eIDAS-compliant services and eID schemes have been rolled out across Europe.</p>



<p>eIDAS stands for “electronic identification, authentication and trust services.” It builds the legal basis for cross-border interoperability of electronic identification, authentication, and electronic signatures amongst EU Member States. eIDAS is meant to enable mutual recognition of eID and trust services across the EU in a regulated, secure and private manner. In a world where transactions are increasingly digital and without borders, this recognition and trust is essential.</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication is a natural fit for the delivery of services that meet eIDAS regulations, and many of our members are working with governments and service providers to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions throughout the EU. To give an overview and more in-depth details on how FIDO and eIDAS intersect, we’ve released two new white papers. The first, “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-introduction-of-fido-eidas-services/">Introduction of FIDO and eIDAS Services</a>” serves as an introductory white paper describing the relationship between FIDO2 standards and eIDAS compliant schemes that can accommodate modern authentication protocols. The second, “<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-using-fido-with-eidas-services/">Using FIDO with eIDAS Services</a>” is a more detailed look at how FIDO can be used with eIDAS services, including architectural concepts for integration of FIDO2 into the eIDAS interoperability framework.</p>



<p>Sebastian Elfors, Solutions Architect at Yubico, the lead contributor for the new papers, had this to say about the intersection of FIDO and eIDAS:</p>



<p>“The modern FIDO standard, and its wide adoption by the largest IT-companies all over the globe, provides a viable framework for expanding and modernizing eIDAS services across Europe. In the intersection between eIDAS and FIDO, there are a number of emerging deployment scenarios that will benefit the public sector in the European Union. There are already several eID schemes being notified by the EU Commission this year, the number of Qualified Trust Service Providers are constantly growing, and more government services are enabling cross-border eID support.”</p>



<p>To expand on this topic and information in the new white papers, Sebastian will join our executive director and CMO Andrew Shikiar to lead a webinar on May 28 at 15:00 CEST. The webinar will include:</p>



  An introduction to eIDAS  An overview on how to use FIDO as part of an eID scheme  An overview on using FIDO2 for authentication to Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs)  



<p>There will be time for Q&amp;A, so please bring your questions!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Register for the eIDAS webinar <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2903277352656712461?source=Blog">here</a>.</p>

South Korea became a hotbed of Self Sovereign Identity in the last couple of years. The number of government-funded projects, including the mobile credential for government officials, requires using DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers). Also, hundreds of enterprises joined public/private consortia on decentralized identity to empower the digital transformation of the South Korean society. Jaehoon will explain in detail the current ecosystem and discuss opportunities for the future.

The European Commission developed the SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity) eIDAS bridge, an ISA2 funded initiative, to promote eIDAS as a trust framework for the SSI ecosystem. It assists a VC (Verifiable Credential) issuer in the signing process, and helps the verifier to automate the identification of the organization behind the issuer’s DID (Decentralized Identifier). Simply by “crossing” the eIDAS Bridge, a Verifiable Credential can be proven trustworthy in the EU. Ignacio Alamillo will present at this SSI Meetup webinar the insights gained from this report.

In the context of the eIDAS bridge project, we performed an analysis on how eIDAS can legally support digital identity and trustworthy DLT-based transactions in the Digital Single Market, and this is reflected in the SSI eIDAS legal report, available at this link. The objective of this report is to evaluate the potential legal issues that are important to an SSI solution and make some recommendations to be used as policy input for the eIDAS 2020 review. The report outlines short-term objectives, where changes in the Regulation would not be necessary, but also mid to long-term scenarios requiring major changes in the Regulation to comply with the SSI design principles.

The different scenarios described in the report are aligned with the proposed architectural and procedural considerations designed in the SSI eIDAS Bridge project and the European Self Sovereign Identity Framework.

 Governments, nonprofits and private sectors across finance, health care, enterprise software and more team up with Linux Foundation to enhance universal security and privacy protocols for consumers and businesses in the digital era 
<p>The ToIP Foundation is being developed with global, pan-industry support from leading organizations with sector-specific expertise. Founding Steering members include Accenture, BrightHive, Cloudocracy, Continuum Loop, CULedger, Dhiway, esatus, Evernym, Finicity, Futurewei Technologies, IBM Security, IdRamp, Lumedic, Mastercard, MITRE, the Province of British Columbia and SICPA. Contributing members include DIDx, GLEIF, The Human Colossus Foundation, iRespond, kiva.org, Marist College, Northern Block, R3, Secours.io, TNO and University of Arkansas.</p>
<p>Businesses today are struggling to protect and manage digital assets and data, especially in an increasingly complex enterprise environment that includes the Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and much more. This is compounding the already low consumer confidence in the use of personal data and is slowing innovation on opportunities like digital identity and the adoption of new services that can support humanity.</p>
<p>Without a global standard for how to ensure digital trust, these trends are bound to continue. The ToIP Foundation will use digital identity models that leverage interoperable digital wallets and credentials and the new W3C Verifiable Credentials standard to address these challenges and enable consumers, businesses and governments to better manage risk, improve digital trust and protect all forms of identity online.</p>
<p>“The ToIP Foundation has the promise to provide the digital trust layer that was missing in the original design of the Internet and to trigger a new era of human possibility,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director at the Linux Foundation. “The combination of open standards and protocols, pan-industry collaboration and our neutral governance structure will support this new category of digital identity and verifiable data exchange.”</p>
<p>The Linux Foundation’s open governance model enables the ToIP Foundation to advance a combination of technology and governance standards for digital trust in a neutral forum that supports pan-industry collaboration. An open governance model that can be integrated into the development of the standards for digital trust is essential where the business, legal and social guidelines for technology adoption impacts human trust and behavior.</p>
<p>The ToIP Foundation will initially host four Working Groups. The Technical Stack Working Group and the Governance Stack Working Group will focus on building out and hardening the Technical and Governance halves of the ToIP stack, respectively. The Utility Foundry Working Group and the Ecosystem Foundry Working Group will serve as communities of practice for projects that wish to collaborate on the development of ToIP utility networks or entire ToIP digital trust ecosystems.</p>
<p>The ToIP Foundation will host an all-digital launch event on May 7, 2020 at 9AM PDT that will feature a panel discussion, interoperability demonstration and live Q&amp;A. <a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_EpGdgdcITrymDTDfPP2HjA">Register now</a> for the live event. A <a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lRFkWHgVQnWeQYF9geLEbg">second event</a> will be hosted for the APAC region.</p>

<p>Steering Member Comments</p>
<p>Accenture</p>
<p>“The internet and digital technologies are a critical part of the way we engage with each other and with organizations. Accenture has a deep commitment to developing solutions to build trust, protect privacy and put control of an individual’s data squarely in their hands. The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation is bringing together a powerful mix of experts and doing it at the exact right time given the urgent need to encourage greater adoption and increase trust in data privacy and ownership,” said Christine Leong, managing director, global lead for Decentralized Identity &amp; Biometrics at Accenture.</p>
<p>BrightHive</p>
<p>“Now, perhaps more than ever, networks of public and private sector organizations know the value that can be created by collaborating with one another around their combined data to create novel insights and better align their work. But they also want to collaborate in the most responsible way possible. The work of the Trust over IP Foundation will radically strengthen the infrastructure of responsible data sharing by establishing a global standard for digital trust—ensuring that the very way that data is exchanged and verified creates a much-needed layer of security, privacy and trust. BrightHive is excited by the promise of this standard, and proud to partner with the other members to help see it realized,” said Matt Gee, CEO, BrightHive.</p>
<p>Cloudocracy</p>
<p>“Trust is the foundational element of all relationships between government, organizations, and each of us as individuals.&nbsp;Trust at Internet-scale, serves our greater global community and is best accomplished by communities of trust ecosystems. The Trust Over IP Foundation is the next stage of enabling this journey globally.&nbsp;The paradigm-shifting model of decentralized, person-centric identity is likely one of the most important breakthroughs in data privacy, cyber security and unlocking business value in many years.&nbsp;Cloudocracy seeks to facilitate coalitions of government, supply-chains and individuals to embark on journeys to establish value-based trust ecosystems towards achieving highly secure and empowered private ecosystems and the public-private ‘Internet of Value.’&nbsp;The global shift will go beyond enabling government and organizations to reduce costs, complexity and add value but will also help steer to a better compass heading in protecting individual data privacy, health and biometric information, while also reducing risks and economic impacts of cyber security data breaches,” said Will Groah, executive director, Cloudocracy.</p>
<p>Continuum Loop</p>
<p>“The leaders we work with know that trust on the Internet isn’t working. They want to start building deep trust with their customers and partners. Our clients are investing, as are we, in the Trust Over IP Foundation. We all want to make sure we are involved in building the digital trust layer that the Internet needs. The technology works – now it is about building business cases and governance,” said Darrell O’Donnell, president and CEO, Continuum Loop.</p>
<p>CULedger</p>
<p>“The credit union movement is based on the idea that trusted interactions between people connected by a common bond are the best interactions.&nbsp; A self-sovereign, secure, trusted identity, like MemberPass, is essential in the world ahead, and CULedger is paving the way for credit unions and financial cooperatives worldwide to pioneer this important effort and bring this frictionless digital experience to more than 270 million credit union members.&nbsp; The work developed out of the Trust over IP Foundation will be the cornerstone to facilitate these trusted interactions in the new digital age.&nbsp; We are excited about the opportunity to be working with other leading organizations in support of this effort,” said John Ainsworth, president/CEO, CULedger.</p>
<p>Dhiway </p>
<p>“Dhiway is happy to join the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation as one of the founding members. Our strategic initiatives are designed to bring a higher degree of assurance to the exchange of data between peers, over the Internet and other digital networks. Our participation is aligned with our vision to make the world more transparent and trusted,&nbsp;using digital frameworks that can be universally referenced, understood and consumed.&nbsp; We intend to contribute our knowledge and expertise to support the ToIP foundation in its mission to build an interoperable architecture for Internet-scale digital trust –&nbsp; empowering a growing ecosystem of companies and communities to exercise control over their digital assets. It’s encouraging to see the open collaboration that has led to the formation of this Foundation, and we are humbled and thrilled to be a part of this pioneering effort,” said Satish Mohan, Founder &amp; CTO, Dhiway.</p>
<p>esatus</p>
<p>“On our mission of enforcing information security, strong trust relationships are essential. We need them to be equally strong in the real world and online. The Trust over IP Foundation facilitates easy composition, ramp-up and maintenance of digital trust components. Conveying real-world trust online is ultimately possible at flexibility and scale. esatus enterprise solutions employ digital trust components already, making next-gen security and privacy available to its customers today. Being a founding member of the Trust over IP Foundation is a natural fit,” said Dr. André Kudra, CIO at esatus AG.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evernym</p>
<p>“Evernym believes the only way to truly solve the avalanche of trust problems on the Internet is with an open standard and open governance model that is as universal as the TCP/IP stack that created the Internet itself. We have helped build the architecture of the ToIP stack layer by layer for the past three years, including the W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers standards that are at the heart of this new model, because we believe it will unlock a new explosion of value for every person, business, community and government using digital communications. We are thrilled to help stand up the ToIP Foundation at the Linux Foundation and hope that it attracts every company and contributor who wants to build a strong and lasting trust layer for the Internet,” said Drummond Reed, chief trust officer at Evernym and co-editor of the W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification.</p>
<p>Finicity</p>
<p>“The Internet has fueled incredible innovation over that past few decades. And yet it has been significantly handicapped due to a general lack of trust. As we solve the trust dilemma, we will see a rapid acceleration of innovations that will change the way we do business, connect with others and consume information and entertainment,” said Nick Thomas, president &amp; chief scientist and innovation officer, Finicity. “Finicity looks forward to advancing digital trust standards through its participation in the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation.”</p>
<p>IBM</p>
<p>“In today’s digital economy, businesses and consumers need a way to be certain that data being exchanged has been sent by the rightful owner and that it will be accepted as truth by the intended recipient. Many privacy focused innovations are now being developed to solve this challenge, but there is no ‘recipe book’ for the exchange of trusted data across multiple vendor solutions,” said Dan Gisolfi, CTO, Decentralized Identity, IBM Security. “The new Trust over IP Foundation marks an evolutionary step which goes beyond standards, specs and code, with the goal of creating a community-driven playbook for establishing ‘ecosystems of trust.’ IBM believes that the next wave of innovation in identity access management will be for credential issuers and verifiers to partake in these ecosystems, where trusted relationships are built upon cryptographic proofs.”</p>
<p>IdRamp</p>
<p>“Formation of The ToIP Foundation will transform and improve how digital services operate. Traditional centralized identity systems are hinged to vast security vulnerabilities that are not sustainable in a growing digital economy. Centralized services for things like mufti-factor authentication or social login encumber user flow and unnecessarily expose sensitive information to third parties. Decentralized systems resolve these problems but struggle with interoperability and standards to accelerate mass adoption. The Trust Over IP Foundation will help formalize and simplify adoption of Trust as a basic digital utility for everyone. The TOIP stack provides the foundation for a new generation of digital identity services. These services will provide high security frictionless interaction that put the user in control of their personal data. Organizations will establish personal connections with employees and user communities that are immune to the vulnerabilities of centralized systems. Individuals will be able to connect with one another without exposing personal information to the mediators that regulate digital interactions today. This will help businesses move beyond complex identity security investments that erode the bottom line and slow innovation. Verifiable digital trust in a decentralized data economy will open a world of possibilities for all individuals and businesses. As a founding member of the ToIP foundation, IdRamp is committed to helping businesses build a new decentralized digital economy that will evolve organically from traditional centralized systems,” said Mike Vesey, CEO, IdRamp.</p>
<p>Lumedic</p>
<p>“As the first representative of the health care industry on the Steering Committee, Lumedic sees tremendous potential for the Trust over IP Foundation to contribute to health care interoperability,” said Chris Ingrao, chief operating officer of Lumedic.&nbsp;“In confronting the challenges raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen that modern technologies can make a powerful difference when paired with strong governance models. The TOIP stack ensures that the way we exchange trusted health care information meets industry needs at a global scale.”</p>
<p>Mastercard</p>
<p>“We are building a bridge to a world where a person’s identity can be verified immediately, safely and securely for use in the digital world – where now, more than ever, identity is essential for delivery of digital health, education and government services. This cannot be accomplished in isolation. We are collaborating and innovating with governments, technology companies, financial institutions and industry sectors to make this a reality. Our participation within the Trust over IP Foundation builds atop the groundwork we currently have in place to ensure industry standards to guarantee we all transact and interact in a secure, convenient and trusted manner,” said Charles Walton, senior vice president, Digital Identity, Mastercard.</p>
<p>MITRE</p>
<p>“Advances in digital technologies and the Internet have brought great convenience to our lives.&nbsp; But they also present risk – the inability to verify with confidence the identity of those you are connected with leaves us vulnerable to cyberattacks, identity theft, human trafficking, and financial fraud,” said&nbsp;Jim Cook, vice president of Strategic Engagement and Partnerships at MITRE.&nbsp;“As a not-for-profit company working in the public interest with a mission to solve problems for a safer world, we at MITRE are committed to creating a digital world in which people can interact safely and with confidence.&nbsp; We applaud the Linux Foundation initiative to launch the Trust over IP Foundation, and we are honored to be a founding member.&nbsp; We believe real innovation is made possible through open partnership, collaboration and cooperation, and we look forward to contributing to a safer internet through the Trust over IP Stack project.”</p>
<p>The Province of British Columbia</p>
<p>“The Province of British Columbia sees our collective potential to enable global-scale digital trust. The Trust over IP Foundation will be a significant leap forward in establishing a standards-based way for individuals and businesses around the world to interact and transact in safe and secure ways over the Internet,” said Dave Nikolejsin, Deputy Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and Chair of the Board of Digital Identity and Authentication Council of Canada. “From our perspective, this work augments our foundational regulatory role in the economy. In the natural resources sector, we see the potential to empower companies to have a new digitally trusted means to demonstrate due diligence on environmental and social impacts of projects as they work with Indigenous peoples and government. The Province of British Columbia is a founding member of the Trust over IP Foundation to help promote this new era of trusted digital services that everyone can rely on.”</p>
<p>SICPA</p>
<p>“For over 90 years, SICPA has partnered with governments, companies and organizations worldwide, to enable trust in banknotes, identities, products and brands. Our customers’ physical and digital lives are increasingly entwined, at work and at home, and our mission is to help shape trusted digital interactions by collaborating in enabling initiatives like the Trust over IP Foundation.&nbsp; Building trust at a distance and at scale is a global challenge that will form the keystone in delivering the ultimate promise of an interconnected world: to respect the rights, privacy and security of everyone online and offline,” said Kalin Nicolov, Head of Digital Currency, SICPA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contributing Member Comments</p>
<p>DIDx</p>
<p>“The Internet lacks a digital trust layer that is not centrally controlled and managed. It is more important than ever to take control of our digital identities and data. The ToIP stack provides full control of digital identities and enables secure, privacy-preserving trust channels with verifiable data exchange. The digital trust layer of the internet. DIDx (a South African based startup) is excited to contribute and build interoperable trust ecosystems across Africa using the ToIP stack and are pleased to join the establishment of the ToIP Foundation together with the Linux Foundation,” said Lohan Spies, CEO DIDx.</p>
<p>GLEIF</p>
<p>“Trust is paramount within today’s digital world and we shouldn’t be afraid to challenge existing online processes for the greater good. The Trust over IP Foundation provides a neutral environment for these important conversations and will facilitate industry collaboration to create a global standard which businesses and consumers can trust. This aligns closely with GLEIF’s work to date as a not-for-profit organization which enables smarter, less costly and more reliable decisions about who to do business with. Our Global LEI System solves the problem of trust for legal entities worldwide, and we look forward to applying our expertise alongside many leading organizations within the foundation,” said Stephan Wolf, CEO, Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).</p>
<p>kiva.org </p>
<p>“As internet connectivity and digital services reach the world’s most vulnerable populations, it is paramount that we implement standardized, interoperable systems,” said Matthew Davie, chief strategy officer at Kiva. “The Trust over IP Foundation provides a framework to bring trust to this emerging segment of the digital economy and does so in a way that is consumer-centric and privacy-centric by design.”</p>
<p>The Human Colossus Foundation</p>
<p>“The synergistic domains of trusted identity and immutable semantics are required for organizations to integrate into a new decentralized data economy. The Human Colossus Foundation mission to implement decentralized semantics is aligned with the Trust over IP Foundation. We are proud to contribute to the collaborative projects and initiatives being launched,” said Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Board at The Human Colossus Foundation.</p>
<p>iRespond</p>
<p>“Trust is the foundation of every ecosystem, and governance is critical to build trust.&nbsp; The creation of the ToIP foundation is a critical step toward both trust and governance, built on inclusion, transparency and open standards.&nbsp;We expect ToIP to be part of the essential glue that binds decentralized networks and identity.&nbsp; The disadvantaged beneficiaries we serve will likely gain from this critical step to address challenges of guardianship and disruption of traditional barriers to establishing identity,” said Scott Reid, CEO, iRespond.</p>
<p>Marist College</p>
<p>“Marist College has long been on the cutting edge of technology innovation. We are excited to be a founding member of this effort to address digital trust and decentralized identity management at a time when internet transactions are a vital part of higher education and our growing digital economy,” said Michael Caputo, MS, vice president for Information Technology/CIO, Marist College.</p>
<p>Northern Block</p>
<p>“Northern Block is committed to empowering the mass adoption of digital verifiable credentials, which we believe won’t be possible without robust and common standards. The launch of the ToIP Foundation is the beginning of a new chapter for any organization who has been working diligently to enhance trust in life’s experiences. We look forward to supporting increasing participation in trusted ecosystems and burgeoning innovation in consumer experiences through digital trust,” said Mathieu Glaude, CEO at Northern Block.</p>
<p>R3</p>
<p>“R3 remains committed to supporting the development of secure, trusted and privacy preserving digital identity ecosystems and our participation in the Trust over IP Foundation is a reflection of that commitment. Our customers across industries including banking, insurance health care and telecommunications all agree that identity cannot be solved in isolation. With the industry coming together under the Trust Over IP Foundation we can work on the standards that will enable interoperability and unlock new opportunities for all. Our Corda platform is designed to enable private transactions, and by incorporating the work of the ToIP Foundation, we can develop solutions uniquely suitable for self-sovereignty in the digital world,” said Abbas Ali, Head of Digital Identity at R3.</p>
<p>Secours.io</p>
<p>“Our past inability to deal with privacy has cost human lives, because it limits innovation that can save lives. Trust over IP gives government the verification and governance it needs, and the public gets the trust it needs now allowing innovation to save lives,” said Sgt. J. Stirling Ret., Ontario Provincial Police, Provincial SAR Coordinator.</p>
<p>TNO</p>
<p>“TNO has deep involvement in the standardization and ecosystems of self-sovereign identity, including W3C, DIF, Hyperledger, Sovrin, RWoT and IIW. Our national and international partners and customers are looking for full-stack Trust-over-IP solutions. The ToIP approach is unique, as it includes the complexities of the top ‘business’ parts of the Trust-over-IP stack, as well as the governance of all layers. We believe that ToIP provides an excellent ground to contribute and further develop this knowledge base and apply it to many projects in ‘admintech’ and other industry sectors where trust in the provenance of data is essential,” said Dr. Oskar van Deventer, senior scientist Self-Sovereign Identity, TNO.</p>
<p>University of Arkansas </p>
<p>“The Internet was built in the 1970s and 1980s to allow machine-to-machine transfer of information, but it was missing the trust layer that identifies the people, organizations, or objects running those machines. The&nbsp;Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation&nbsp;is building the technical and governance standards to provide that missing layer, which will enable trusted, secure, peer-to-peer transfers of value. &nbsp;Voices from industry, governments and academia are needed to realize the vision.&nbsp;As an academic partner, the Blockchain Center of Excellence at the University of Arkansas is pleased to join this effort to develop open standards for a trust layer over the Internet,” said Mary Lacity, Walton Professor and Director of the Blockchain Center of Excellence at the University of Arkansas.</p>

 Dibyajyoti Ghosh &amp; Purbasha&nbsp;Auddy <p>The proposed workshop will focus on internet usage in India and the possibilities that the internet offers for representation of data. The workshop will be divided into two parts, the first, of a more general nature, and the second, will focus on one specific aspect of data — representation. While the first part will be more of a documentation exercise, the second part will be a hands-on exercise of some data representation tools that are available on the internet.</p> Plan <p>Part I: The Nature of Internet Usage in&nbsp;India</p><p>The workshop will engage the participants in trying to map the ways that they use the internet in their daily lives, such as circulating emails, using social networks, downloading software, online commerce, academic research, circulating audio and video, etc. This part of the workshop will try to study ‘the starkly hierarchical and segmented experiences and usages of the [internet] in India’. The study will try to distinguish between those who are consumers of data and systems and those who, in addition to consuming, also produce data and systems. Various types of production of data will also be looked at, such as crowdsourcing data (such as in Wikipedia, or restaurant review or hotel review websites).</p><p>The workshop will be conducted in an interactive manner, where the participants will enter their responses in an online collaborative platform (Google Sheets), which will be editable by all the participants. This brief documentation exercise will also be used to prepare a report at the end of the conference.</p><p>After completing this exercise of mapping the usage of the internet, the second segment of the workshop will try to explore various ways of representing data. This exercise will be done by using tools available online.</p><p>Part II: Representation of&nbsp;Data</p><p>This part of the workshop will deal with various kinds of data representation, of various kinds of data that users contribute to the internet through websites, such as social networks, blogs, etc. The workshop will try to look at the various existing ways in visualising and representing such data through the internet, such as chronology timelines, location mapping, network mapping, enhanced text representation such as through display of XML-Text Encoding Initiative (XML-TEI) files, etc. so as to enhance the data and open up other aspects of the data not usually evident in forms such as lists and spreadsheets.</p><p>The participants will be led through to the creation of small chronology timelines and location mapping in particular. Therefore participants will be requested to contribute data in the form of simple and small English texts which have either several markers of time, or several markers of location, so as to enable such visualisation. Examples of such texts include biographies, travel narratives, etc. The workshop will discuss how to filter ‘structured data’ from prose text to get desirable result from the softwares.</p><p>This part of the workshop will try to answer the question as to ‘how do we begin to use the internet as a space for academic and creative practice and intervention?’ The workshop will use open-access tools and software so as to highlight the low-investment infrastructure that is often sufficient enough to represent and enhance&nbsp;data.</p> Readings <p>Participants are requested to look at two visualisation tools in particular (both of which were developed by the Knight Lab in Northwestern University, USA), one for creating a chronology timeline (<a href="https://projects.knightlab.com/projects/timelinejs">https://projects.knightlab.com/projects/timelinejs</a>) and the other for creating a location map (<a href="https://projects.knightlab.com/projects/storymapjs">https://projects.knightlab.com/projects/storymapjs</a>).</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day2.SpottingData">IRC 2016: Day 2 #Spotting Data : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Dibyajyoti Ghosh is a PhD student in the Department of English, Jadavpur University.

<p>In a <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/immunity-certificates">white paper</a>, published today by the <a href="https://ethics.harvard.edu/">Harvard University Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics</a>, ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener urged policy makers, technology providers, and civil society organizations to collaborate to ensure that digital health credentials or “immunity certificates”, if implemented, are intentionally designed to protect privacy and civil liberties.</p><p>Over the past couple weeks, public health officials and policy makers have begun making the case for digital health credentials or “immunity certificates”. If implemented in conjunction with large-scale testing (for the COVID-19 virus and antibodies), immunity certificates could facilitate an incremental and orderly return to economic and social activities. While this presents a compelling opportunity, and one which may be worth considering, such a system cannot be allowed to compromise personal privacy rights, promote exclusion, or exacerbate existing social inequities.</p><p>“We all share an obligation to protect public health. But doing so should not mean giving up our right to privacy,” noted Gruener. “Proven technologies, grounded in a respect for equity and human rights, can be redeployed to help protect society from a resurgence of the disease and put control of personal health information in the hands of the individual. But this approach must be pursued cautiously, with a full acknowledgement of the risks, and detailed plans to mitigate&nbsp;them.”</p><p>Immunity certificates would enable workplaces, schools, medical facilities, airlines, and other public or private venues to identify those who have tested positive for the antibody (OR who have recently tested negative for the virus) through a verified credential issued by a medical provider (or certified testing center) and carried on a mobile phone. Because the credential is stored on the phone, rather than in a centralized database, it is vastly more secure and would enable the user to share it when, and with whom, they&nbsp;choose.</p><p>At this point, testing continues to lag far behind what would be needed to properly implement immunity certificates. But, with sufficient public investment and political will, the necessary level of testing could be achieved in the weeks and months ahead. Scaling access to serological testing will also help firm up our understanding of the virus, including the presence and duration of immunity and the potential for re-infection. At this time, these remain open questions.</p><p>The white paper is intended to further the public discourse about immunity certificates and ensure that such systems are developed consistent with the principles outlined in the <a href="https://id2020.org/manifesto">ID2020 Manifesto</a> for digital ID (developed in 2018 in partnership with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees). The Technical Requirements that underlie the <a href="http://id2020.org/certification">ID2020 Certification</a> also provide a valuable roadmap to assist technology providers and governments in the development of ethical, inclusive digital identity solutions, including digital health credentials.</p><p>Widespread social distancing orders have proven an effective strategy for containing the spread of the virus. But these strategies are not without significant economic, social, and psychological consequences. The time is now to begin planning for the next phase of the COVID-19 response and recovery. “If we need to do immunity certificates”, said Gruener, “let’s make sure we do them&nbsp;right.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/id2020/immunity-certificates-if-we-must-have-them-we-must-do-it-right-7524829901d6">Immunity Certificates: If We Must Have Them, We Must Do It Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/id2020">ID2020</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Akriti Rastogi and Ishani&nbsp;Dey  Session <p>Amour fou is saturated with its own aesthetic, it fills itself to the borders of itself with the trajectories of its own gestures, it runs on angels’ clocks, it is not a fit fate for commissars &amp; shopkeepers. Its ego evaporates in the mutability of desire, its communal spirit withers in the selfishness of obsession. (Bey,&nbsp;1985)</p><p>Confronted with consolidating rhizomatic concerns that inevitably crop their heads in any forum on internet discussions, let alone cinema, AF, or Amour fou encapsulates the very essence of free access cinema — AF is “not the result of freedom but rather its precondition” (Bey, 1985), AF is Cinema in web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>The proposed session will be an interactive conversation exploring the Indian scenario of internet based independent filmmaking. The key concerns mediating this dialogue are the mobilization of the internet as a space of exhibition and distribution and its implications in moving through extra-legal spaces, garnering cultural capital and articulating desires of its audience. The purpose here is to engage with cinema within “the broader industrial, institutional, and market contexts in which film exists” moving away from film scholarship focusing solely on the “meaning of the text” while disregarding the very circumstances in which those texts or discourses are “produced and circulated” (McDonald, 2013:&nbsp;147).</p><p>Drawing from traditional methods in cinema scholarship, we turn to our own research methods in trying to articulate contextual engagements with amorphous forms of medium, media and archive. We explore the research potentials that the internet provides as an immediate archive of the contemporary while providing provocations to engage with the internet as an alternative space for film exhibition, distribution and funding. While Ishani Dey explores the mobilization of internet’s potential as an alternative space for film exhibition tracing connections that link pirate circuits, film festivals and subversive mainstream aesthetic shifts; Akriti Rastogi provides an overview of entrepreneurial space of internet based independent filmmaking and the surge in DIY filmmaking in web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>The session concludes with mediations over the poetics of technological access. The internet’s prolific open access archive’s potential to foster cinephilia and the mutations in viewing habits that ensue lead to novel cinematic experiences and their implication for the profilmic aesthetic. In continuum our encounters with the mainstream and anonymous figures etches out the narrative of experiencing cinema and filmmaking in web&nbsp;2.0.</p> Plan <p>This session proposes to conceptualize the implications of open access digital media spaces for cinema in India. Reading cinema as a product of market driven industry factors it interrogates the shifting industrial, institutional, and market contexts which contemporary India cinema negotiates and the implications of contingent media, mode and exhibition on the cinematic experience. The primary concern is to form methods to navigate the expansive archive of the internet and mark the potentials for alternate production and distribution practices that lie within. The session proposes to walk through a number of case studies illustrating the dissolution of dichotomies that is brought about by the interventions of digital and new media technologies. Drawing parallels between earlier shifts in cinema studies discourses with the coming in of videotape and satellite television in India in the 80s and the contemporary debates surrounding digital film practices and direct to home transmissions, the session attempts to historicize cinephilia within the milieu of technophilia in&nbsp;India.</p> Provocations <p>Informal distribution networks like peer-to-peer distribution and pirate circles come to the foreground in the discussion on the construct of the cinephile. While the space of the auteur-entrepreneur claims the spotlight in discussions surrounding linkages in film exhibition — navigating through pirate circles to film festivals, bootlegging to the big&nbsp;league.</p><p>The figure of the anonymous filmmaker stands precariously on the divide of the legal and extra-legal boundary that the internet thrives in traversing, thus emerging as a vast platform for exhibition that is then mobilized by the DIY filmmaker. The growing popularity of the short film format and the shifts in viewing screens are seen as symptomatic of internet’s effect on cinema’s aesthetic.</p><p>The essential provocation here is that while cinema affects the modes of archiving on the internet, the internet in turn affects the cinematic form.</p> Readings <p>McDonald, P.

Her current work proposes to trace the design of monetization channels of cinema effects in a new media environ. She has previously worked as a radio broadcast producer at All India Radio, New&nbsp;Delhi.</p><p>Ishani Dey is working on her PhD in Cinema Studies at the School of Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University. Her current project seeks to analyse some of the ways in which the body-technology ensemble has changed with the rise of the digital. While every new image making technology since the mid-nineteenth century has reconfigured the human body, this project is dedicated to understanding the implications of twenty-first century digital technologies and the internet on bodies that inhabit the screens of the ‘post-cinematic’.</p><p>Note: This session was part of the first <a href="https://cis-india.org/raw/irc16">Internet Researchers’ Conference 2016 (IRC16)</a>&nbsp;, organised in collaboration with the Centre for Political Studies (CPS), at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, on February 26–28, 2016.

<p>The coronavirus outbreak is not only raising public health concerns, but also exposing many office employees who are forced to work at home to greater cybersecurity risk, especially online phishing attacks which is known to be the origin of more than 80% of cyber attacks.</p>



<p>In order to help Koreans to stay protected from such online phishing attacks, the FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group just launched the FIDO Security Key Support Campaign. Sponsored by eWBM, AirCuve (Yubico Partner) and Octatco, the FIDO Security Key Support Campaign will provide 300 FIDO physical security keys to Koreans who are working remotely where their networks and devices are less protected.</p>

<p>Dr. Daniel Ahn, the Co-Chair of FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group, said, “It is our pleasure to practice social contribution by closely collaborating among the FIDO Alliance members in Korea. Similar to our 2020 FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge, we will continue to develop and provide social contribution programs that can educate the public about FIDO protocols while leaving positive social impacts.”</p>



<p>The application for campaign ends on April 17th, 2020.&nbsp; For those who wish to receive a free FIDO security key, the online application site can be found by clicking the campaign banner on the sponsoring member’s website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are happy to work with our members on this campaign in Korea, and plan to evaluate its success and lessons learned to inform possible programs in other regions of the world. </p>

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Editor’s Note: We began the Hackathon program last year to support the local developer community and drive market adoption of FIDO Authentication standards in Korea. The 2019 FIDO Hackathon was a hybrid of a three-month-long mentorship and a service development competition, which unlocked the potential of FIDO protocols along with unexpected positive outcomes. Please visit the following blog postings to learn more about 2019 FIDO Hackathon:</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-authentication-developer-support-program-fido-hackathon-in-korea/">FIDO Authentication Developer Support Program: FIDO Hackathon in Korea</a><br><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-hackathon-in-korea-qa-with-the-top-3-winners-and-their-mentors/">FIDO Hackathon in Korea: A Q&amp;A with the Top 3 Winners and their Mentors</a><br><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-hackathon-in-korea-meet-the-finalists/">FIDO Hackathon in Korea: Meet the Finalists</a></p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group is thrilled to announce the opening of&nbsp; online registration for the 2020 FIDO Hackathon – Goodbye Password Challenge in Korea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program can be simply summarized as following three phases:</p>



<p>LEARN – Learn how to adopt FIDO protocols<br>IMPLEMENT – Implement FIDO protocols into participants’ online services<br>CHANGE – Change to simpler and stronger FIDO authentication</p>



<p>Now, let us walk through the three simple phases.</p>



<p>Once the registration closes at the end of April, those who qualify will be invited to the online learning stage created by the FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group Technical Sub-Group. Toward the end of the LEARN phase, participating teams will be given a very easy online assignment. Those who score in the&nbsp; top 20 will be invited to the next stage. The LEARN phase is scheduled to be completed by the end of June.</p>



<p>The IMPLEMENT phase will take place in July, inviting the top 20 teams to one-day, in-person events. Participants will fine-tune their service developments in the morning with hands-on support by FIDO experts from FIDO Alliance members. In the afternoon and evening (if necessary), participants will&nbsp; go through onsite evaluation. In case there is still a concern for public health in summer, we have prepared various backup plans, including completely converting the event into multiple online evaluation sessions over a period of time.</p>



<p>At the annual multi-day FIDO Seoul Public Seminar in early September, the top 5 teams will show how they have made the CHANGE to simpler and stronger FIDO Authentication, followed by award ceremonies. The top five teams and finalists will receive trophies and certification of completion, and over KRW20,000,000 worth of gifts and prizes.</p>



<p>Dr. Daniel Ahn, the Co-Chair of FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group would like to welcome local developers to join the 2020 FIDO Hackathon with following remarks:</p>



<p>“Due to the recent global public health concerns, the needs for simpler and stronger FIDO authentication will be increased due to the increasing demands for ‘untact’ and remote working technologies. Building upon the success of 2019 FIDO Hackathon in Korea, the FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members will diligently prepare yet another meaningful event for local developers.”</p>



<p>On behalf of all the sponsors of 2020 FIDO Hackathon, Mr. Junho Shin, the Co-Leader of FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group Public Policy and Certification Sub-Group, would like to share a few words:</p>



<p>“Without knowing what would happen early this year, we began preparing 2020 FIDO Hackathon to be as much virtual as possible, for possible global-scale program expansion in upcoming years. Therefore, we are technically and operationally fully prepared to run this event without any public health concern, so those who consider joining the program would not lose the priceless opportunity to showcase their talents to the world.”</p>



<p>We thank you for your continued interest and support for FIDO Hackathon – The Developer Support Program and welcome you to visit our official registration site by clicking the 2020 FIDO Hackathon banner below:</p>

 The COVID-19 pandemic requires various medical and government authorities to aggregate&nbsp;data about available resources from a wide range of medical facilities.&nbsp;Clearly standard schemas for this structured data can be very useful.<br><br>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the U.S. defined a set of data fields to facilitate exchange&nbsp;of this data. We are introducing <a href="https://schema.org/docs/cdc-covid.html">a Schema.org representation</a> of these data fields.&nbsp;<br><br>The purpose of this schema definition is to provide a standards-based representation that can be used to encode and exchange records that correspond to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/covid19/import-covid19-data-508.pdf">CDC format</a>, with usage within the U.S. primarily in mind. While the existence of this schema may provide additional implementation options for those working with US hospital reporting data about COVID-19, please refer to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/acute-care-hospital/covid19/index.html">CDC</a> and other appropriate bodies for authoritative guidance on the latest reporting workflows and data formats.<br><br>Depending upon&nbsp;context, any of the formats and standards that work with Schema.org may be applicable for encoding this data, including the Microdata, RDFa and JSON-LD data formats, as well as related technologies such as W3C SPARQL for data query. JSON-LD is in most cases likely to be the most appropriate format. There is no assumption that data encoded using this schema should necessarily be published on the public Web, nor that it would be used by search engines.<br><br>We will continue to improve this vocabulary in the light of <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2521">feedback</a>, and welcome <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#heading=h.5h19yhvfnjve">suggestions</a> for improvements and additions particularly from US healthcare organizations who are using it.&nbsp;This CDC-based vocabulary follows other recent changes we have made to <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a>. For details of recent changes see our <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v7.03">release notes</a>&nbsp;and our <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2020/03/schema-for-coronavirus-special.html">previous post </a>announcing the <a href="https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement">SpecialAnnouncement</a> markup, which is now supported at both Bing (<a href="https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/march-2020/Bing-adopts-schema-org-mark-up-for-Special-Announcements-about-COVID-19">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/special-announcement-specifications-5cbd6249">docs</a>) and Google (<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/04/highlight-covid-19-announcements-search.html">blog</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/special-announcements">docs</a>). As the global response to COVID-19 evolves we will do our best to improve schema.org's vocabularies to represent the changes that Coronavirus is bringing to society, and to assist those using structured data to help with the response.<br><br><br>

 Ranjani M Prasad and Farah&nbsp;Yameen Source: <a href="http://www.cckonline.in/">Centre for Community Knowledge (CCK) at Ambedkar University Delhi</a> Session <p>In the last decade, the internet has aided a proliferation of information networks — Google Books, archive.org, Hathi Trust, pad.ma and similar archive based knowledge platforms — and cloud based data storage has become a useful and accessible alternative to file based&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The session opens up with questions of accessibility, ownership and hegemonies in an active archive. It takes up three archives that are being built at Ambedkar Univeristy and other similar archives to explore the emerging issues of knowledge sharing on the internet.</p>  The Lotika Vardarajan archive is an ethnographic archive putting together an academic’s research on indigenous Maritime and Textile traditions and their indepth documentation.  The Delhi Oralities Archive is an oral history archive of city memories and resident narratives that seeks to be accessible to the city as an open resource.  The Institutional Memory Archive is a living archive continuously reinventing itself according the needs of the university campus that it documents.  <p>The archiving impulses in each case are different as are the dissemination needs of the archive. How do Internet tools like social media, audio and video distribution platforms like Soundcloud and YouTube intervene in the archiving space to enable and catalyze access? Do dissemination strategies provided by Twitter and Facebook affect the use and usability of archives? Does such access threaten questions of ownership and privacy? Who owns a public archive like Delhi Oralities? What hierarchies operate in living archives to decide what is archived and who archives it? What are the limits of such knowledge repositories and the open access movement itself, especially in the light of traditional knowledge structures?</p> Plan <p>The discussion session explores questions of archives outside the academic research space. It discusses the possibility of using non-traditional platforms for data sharing to maximize access, sustainability and co-authorship for living archives.</p> Readings <p>Basic knowledge about existing social media platforms, open source repository softwares such as DSpace and familiarity with Creative Commons licensing.</p> Audio Recording of the&nbsp;Session <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/Day1.ArchiveAnarchy">IRC 2016: Day 1 #Archive Anarchy : Researchers at Work (RAW) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive</a></p> Session Team <p>Ranjani M Prasad is a researcher and archivist, currently based out of Nilgiris and working with Keystone Foundation. She has been working with archiving methodologies over the last 8 years and is interested in intersections between histories, cultures, memories and technologies.</p><p>Farah Yameen works with public histories and digital archives. As an independent researcher operating on the margins of academia she engages with oral narratives, ethnographies, and their digital&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Note: This session was part of the first <a href="https://cis-india.org/raw/irc16">Internet Researchers’ Conference 2016 (IRC16)</a>&nbsp;, organised in collaboration with the Centre for Political Studies (CPS), at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, on February 26–28, 2016.

Attend this webinar to learn about the eSSIF-Lab (EU H2020) project with Oskar van Deventer and Rieks Joosten from TNO in the Netherlands.

WHY: the eSSIF-Lab vision, objectives, and intended benefits;
WHAT: its (initial) functional architecture/components;
HOW: ways in which you may contribute (and possibly get funded for that).

eSSIF-Lab is an EU H2020 project whose purpose is to fundamentally improve real-life transactions via the Internet, by focusing on next-generation mental models for such next generation transactions, and using SSI technologies and implementations to realize them.

Today, conducting an online business transaction consist of an individual that fills in an online form, which is subsequently processed (data is validated, and a commitment decision is made). Filling in and validating forms can be quite tedious, frustrating, time consuming and costly. Digitally inexperienced people are known to give up on requesting (social) benefits they are entitled to, enlarging the digital divide. But even people with an academic background and years of IT experience find this difficult.

In the SSI-enabled world as eSSIF-Lab sees it, an SSI IT infrastructure can help to find, provide and validate the needed data electronically. This makes filling and processing forms much easier (people no longer have to understand forms, upload pdfs, etc.), much faster (people no longer have to go places to get paperwork) much cheaper (saving tens of billions of euro’s – or even more – on verification/validation costs and IT-links).

The current wealth of SSI-related products, technologies and standards is insufficient for realizing this vision, because it generally lacks interoperability and scalability, and does not address the process- and business levels.

eSSIF-Lab calls for a scalable and interoperable technological infrastructure that is very easy to use by and integrate with (the IT, the processes and the business/policies of) arbitrary organizations and individuals to request, obtain, store and issue data objects whose meaning (semantics), origin (provenance) and integrity can be proved (verified) – which is basically what SSI is all about.

The main task of the eSSIF-Lab consortium is to coordinate between and fund projects of SME’s/startups (from EU/EEA countries) that contribute to the realization of this vision, in terms of technology and/or associated business propositions, and that will work together so as to benefit from each other’s contributions.

<p>Authenticate Event Team</p>



<p>Authenticate, the inaugural FIDO conference, will be postponed from its original date of June 2-3. The good news is we have secured a date later this year in the same location in Seattle, WA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authenticate 2020 will now take place on November 9-10, 2020, with the FIDO Alliance member plenary following on November 11-12. Please visit <a href="http://www.authenticatecon.com">www.authenticatecon.com</a> for the latest information and to register.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The industry response to Authenticate has been outstanding on all fronts. We had nearly four times the amount of speaking submissions than we had available sessions, which allowed us to put together a highly compelling agenda with some of the brightest minds in authentication. Also, sponsorships are nearly sold out – with all expo space now reserved. Lastly, registration has trended well above projections, which would point to a potential sell-out for this inaugural event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our hope is that the threat of COVID-19 will have dissipated by this fall and that we’ll be able to bring forward all of the above enthusiasm to our new dates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We greatly appreciate the support and enthusiasm from the broader FIDO Community, and we’re looking forward to a successful event in November. Until then, we hope everyone stays safe and well. If any questions about Authenticate, contact <a href="mailto:authenticate@fidoalliance.org">authenticate@fidoalliance.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This month, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released its final “<a href="http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/digital-identity-guidance.html">Guidance on Digital Identity</a>” for financial services regulators. FATF is a standards-making body composed of financial regulators from around the world who are charged with ensuring that the financial system is not used for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit activities. Historically, FATF has focused on traditional banking, but as more and more financial services go digital, they have started focusing on digital identity as a key enabler of safe financial systems.</p>



<p>FATF Recommendations are the recognized standards for&nbsp; global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT). That’s why it’s so important the final guidance recognizes FIDO Authentication in several places as an example of a best authentication practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first important aspect to note is that the guidance incorporated authentication as an element of the customer due diligence (CDD) process, particularly when banks open new accounts for people with pre-existing digital identity credentials. This is the first time FATF has explicitly included authentication as part of CDD, which also speaks to broader market awareness of the imperative for sound user authentication. Secondly, FIDO is not only recognized as an acceptable form of authentication – it’s called out as a preferred approach vs. legacy authentication methods. Per the guidance:</p>



<p>“Passwords or passcodes, which are supposed to be “shared secret” knowledge authenticators, are vulnerable to brute-force login attacks, phishing attacks, and massive online data breaches, and are very easily defeated. Stolen, weak or default passwords are behind 81 percent of data breaches.&nbsp; Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions, such as SMS one-time codes texted to the subscriber’s phone, add another layer of security to passwords/passcodes but they can also be vulnerable to phishing and other attacks.</p>



<p>Phishing-resistant authenticators where at least one factor relies on public key encryption (e.g., authenticators built off PKI certificates or the FIDO standard) can help combat these vulnerabilities.”</p>



<p>This is significant recognition of not only the importance of authentication, but the weaknesses (i.e., phishability) of some legacy MFA technologies – and how these risks can be mitigated through the use of FIDO as high assurance authentication. It’s an important distinction that we hope banking regulators strongly evaluate&nbsp; when they are looking to craft new or updated rules on digital identity and authentication.&nbsp;</p>

Schema.org now has a <a href="https://schema.org/CovidTestingFacility">CovidTestingFacility</a> type to represent these, regardless of whether they are part of long-established medical facilities or temporary adaptations to the emergency.<br><br>We are also making improvements to other areas of Schema.org to help with the worldwide migration to working online and working from home, for example by helping event organizers indicate when an event has <a href="http://schema.org/EventMovedOnline">moved</a> from having a physical location to being conducted online, and   whether the event's "<a href="https://schema.org/eventAttendanceMode">eventAttendanceMode</a>" is online, offlline or mixed.&nbsp;<br><br>We will continue to improve this vocabulary in the light of feedback (<a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490">github</a>; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#">doc</a>), and welcome suggestions for improvements and additions particularly from organizations who are publishing such updates.&nbsp; <br><br> <a href="mailto:danbri@google.com">Dan Brickley</a>, R.V.Guha, Google.<br> Tom Marsh, Microsoft.

SSI Meetup coordinating node Alex Preukschat presents in this webinar the 2020 SSI report for Iberoamerica with the main highlights and insights gained for this edition. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is booming, and we expect it to be one of the main unifying technologies of the blockchain and decentralized world. Unlike our first report for Iberoamerica, we have chosen, for this edition, to prepare a shorter executive document that reflects the main trends in the region. In this study, we focus on Ibero-American initiatives that are either done in the name of SSI or have elements strongly resembling SSI, rather than simple authentication experiments that are further away from the principles of SSI.

Ignacio Alamillo is a lawyer, PhD in eIDAS Regulation, CISA, CISM, and EU Commission legal expert for EBSI eSSIF and the EBSI eIDAS Bridge initiatives. Ignacio will introduce SSI solutions, using the Alastria ID reference model as an illustrative example, taking into account the need for trust management frameworks, and trust anchors. Secondly, he will introduce the eIDAS Regulation, currently the major electronic identification regulation in the European Union, supporting a pan-European identity federation system, and the legal framework for the so-called trust services.

The EU has developed some key proposals arising from the legal assessment of the EBSI ESSIF use case, oriented to extend the eIDAS Regulation to SSI solutions used with public sector bodies relationships and procedures. This results were publicly presented in the 2nd ESSIF Stakeholders Meeting that took place in Brussels mid-January 2020.

The objective of the ESSIF legal assessment is to evaluate the potential legal issues that are horizontal to an SSI solution, including:

DIDs: What is the legal nature and ownership of DIDs (asset vs a special kind of pseudonym), how should be DIDs managed in case of minors and incapable persons, if DID may be subject to seizure, when DIDs may be deactivated, what is the legal regime of keys and wallets, etc.
VCs: What are the duties and responsibilities of VCs issuers, holders and verifiers. How to model the contractual/non-contractual relations between issuers &amp; verifiers, and set up liability models. We should pay special attention to the legal aspects of the VC lifecycle (issuance, suspension and revocation causes, etc).
Alignment of the SSI solution with the eIDAS Regulation: aligning VCs with eIDAS eID rules, but also linking VCs to eSeals or eSignatures.
Trust framework: legal input regarding LoAs, governance aspects, conformity, etc.
The use cases include:

Using eIDAS identification means (and qualified certificates?) to issue verifiable credentials.
Using qualified certificates to support verifiable claims (EBSI eIDAS bridge) and legal evidences with full legal value.
Using SSI VCs as an eIDAS identification means.
Using blockchain plus SSI as an electronic registered delivery service.

 In November TNO, FundingBox, BLUMORPHO and GRNET started a new EU-Horizon 2020 research project ‘NGI eSSIF-Lab’. The project will offer open calls for start-ups, SMEs and other innovators to further develop, integrate and adopt self-sovereign identity technologies for Europe. The first open calls are expected to begin in March 2020. What makes eSSIF-Lab different from other initiatives is that it focuses on scalable SSI-solutions that are mutually interoperable and not limited to solving a problem in just a specific domain. 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Are you interested? 
					  
 
 
<p>Please fill in our contact form to receive updates when an open call is published</p>
 
 
  
				 
				 <a href="https://mailing.tno.nl/ct/m8/k1/Xv-J69P3mtttDn3l7yPn7k0WlXlS8nv_PiVnkaNLjhUdFMAhAkA-pKvRrNzEMXVN/FGcIZhSQfhWMhMZ">STAY UP TO DATE</a> 
			  
				
				
				  Self-sovereign identity 
<p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) promises to empower European citizens with new means to manage privacy, to eliminate logins, and to enjoy much faster and safer electronic transactions via the internet as well as in real life. SSI promises not only to empower European organisations to speed up, secure and automate transactions with customers, suppliers and partners, resulting in annual savings of tens of billions of euros on administrative costs in Europe but also to drive a new business ecosystem with thousands of new jobs, new job categories and new business opportunities for existing and new European companies.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				  eSSIF-Lab project 
<p>The eSSIF-Lab project will provide business and technical support to integrate SSI technology with market propositions, and will accelerate SSI-related businesses and social applications. The outreach though the open calls and the prominent position in the emerging SSI community will enable the eSSIF-Lab consortium to advance the broad uptake of SSI as a next generation, open and trusted digital identity solution.</p>
<p>The project will award 62 subgrants in two types of open call: one infrastructure-oriented open call targeting technical enhancements and extensions of the SSI framework and two business-oriented open calls targeting SSI business and social innovations and applications. The infrastructure-oriented open call (open to any type of innovator) and the first business-oriented open call (limited to start-ups and SMEs) are expected to open in March 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TNO’s lead SSI scientist Rieks Joosten is excited: “While so-called SSI ‘solutions’ are popping up all over the world, the vast majority has a local scope: they solve a problem in a specific domain, are not scalable and scarcely interoperate with each other. Addressing these issues is a top priority for the eSSIF-Lab project. We invite the SSI community in Europe to come forward and apply for the open calls.”</p>
<p>The project receives funding from the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, of which €5.6 m is available for subgrants. The eSSIF-Lab project will run for three years.</p> 
			   
				
				
				  Consortium 
<p>The eSSIF-Lab consortium is a lean consortium comprised of a combination of one RTO, one funding management organisation, one business accelerator and one organisation that offers advanced e-infrastructures and innovative services. The partners have distinct but complementary profiles, spanning the whole range of activities and areas covered within the project.</p>
<p>TNO (Netherlands) is the project coordinator and brings in its extensive SSI technical expertise and understanding of innovation processes to the startup/SME/innovator community targeted by the open calls. TNO has a unique position as an RTO, with a strong connections to both fundamental research, industry, SMEs and societal stakeholders. TNO has an extensive track record in H2020 project coordination.</p>
<p>FundingBox (Poland) manages the open calls. FundingBox is the European leader in managing Financial Support to Third Parties, having distributed up to €62 m by participating in 14 projects, including FSTP, since 2014. It has a community with over 18,000 subscribers where makers, entrepreneurs and innovators meet, interact and collaborate to build growth connections and win equity-free funding to catalyse their growth.</p>
<p>BLUMORPHO (France) is a business accelerator that has 20+ years of experience in building and developing successful ecosystems around innovations. It will provide business support to the start-ups that participate in the open call projects to accelerate their SSI-related business. BLUMORPHO has a large European and worldwide network, and brings in its expertise from training and developing ideas with high potential to fully-fledged business plans.</p>
<p>GRNET (Greece) is responsible for the ongoing deployment infrastructure in the project. GRNET is the national network, cloud computing and IT eInfrastructure and services provider. It supports hundreds of thousands of users in the key areas of Research, Education, Health and Culture.</p>

John Phillips from 460degrees in Australia has been exploring with his team for more than two years for a way to describe Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) that was easy to understand. We think he has found a good method to make SSI easy to understand for any C-suite executive and business people that goes beyond the technology.

John published a video in late 2019 that we found deeply insightful and we have invited him to share this with the SSI Meetup audience. This demo has been going down amazingly well with audiences from c-suite technology execs to design students.

This approach quite literally animates the discussion. People add other objects into the mix, move things around, ask relevant, insightful, questions.

John will share the learnings he is gaining from University research, as well as the results of work in supporting capstone projects for higher education students, and how this has led us to a storytelling model to explain SSI.

Sebastian Weidenbach and Christopher Hempel from esatus AG will explain in this presentation why Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has great advantages to facilitate enterprise identity and access management. It will also go into detail about how a connection between existing identity and access management solutions and distributed identity ledgers can be implemented.

SSI enables users to create proofs over facts about themselves using a distributed ledger. In an enterprise context, this also means that an employee can send a proof to, for instance, a compatible file server containing data exclusively meant for the human resources department. If this proof is valid and contains the fact that the prover is a member of the human resources department, access can be granted automatically. The need for individual approval by a superior, common reason for the tiresome and expensive delay, is removed.

Switching enterprises’ IAM systems to SSI technology cannot realistically be done in one fell swoop, though, as migrating thousands of accounts and their privileges to a new system is an intimidating task. There are ways to connect SSI technology to existing IAM solutions, though, which are starting to enter the market using gateway components to connect the old and new worlds of identity.

Decentralized identifiers (abbreviated as “DIDs”), are the cryptographic counterpart to verifiable credentials (VCs) that together are the “twin pillars” of SSI architecture. In this special IdentityBook.info webinar Markus Sabadello, Founder and CEO of Danube Tech, and Drummond Reed, Chief Trust Officer at Evernym, co-authors of the DID chapter of the “Self-Sovereign Identity: 
Decentralized Digital Identity and Verifiable Credentials” book published by Manning will explain all the fundamentals of DIDs. Based on the did chapter of the book, you will learn how DIDs evolved from the work started with VCs, how they are related to URLs and URNs, why a new type of cryptographically-verifiable identifier is needed for SSI, and how DIDs are being standardized at World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Your guides will be two of the editors of the W3C Decentralized Identifier 1.0 specification: Markus Sabadello and Drummond Reed.

Identity on the internet has been missing since the beginning. For all the amazing ways in which the internet has come to enhance our daily business, social, and personal lives, it was originally designed to simply connect digital endpoints. Networking protocols were built so that computers could identify one another, prove themselves, and safely establish a flow of bits between them. What those bits represent was never a primary concern of the architecture. Despite this limitation, for nearly 3 decades we have been creatively injecting the human narrative into the digital conversation between computers; all the while struggling with the lack of certainty about who the human is who is initiating the process.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) have emerged as a way to address the question: “Who is really behind the other end of my digital interaction?” Together, the pair of technologies are able to do this at scale while enhancing personal privacy, increasing trust between parties, and promoting practical models of anonymity in a world where all too often our identity becomes a commercial commodity.

This presentation is for people who are thinking about how identity and trust relate to their employees, customers, partners, and competitors, and the bespoke way in which we are forced to deal with the issue. Those looking for a better understanding of the benefits afforded by SSI and VCs as well as the technical and governance underpinnings required to support solutions should attend.

Steve Magennis is a former Senior Director with Avanade and has worked closely with Accenture and Microsoft over the years to develop transformational initiatives for many Fortune 100 enterprise clients. Decentralized design is a key focus of his as it enables creating entirely new classes of solutions that can be applied to persistent, entrenched business and social problems.

<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO, FIDO Alliance<br></p>



<p>A new paper from the World Economic Forum (WEF) showcases FIDO Authentication as a ready-to-be-implemented option to save organizations the high costs and user experience frustrations of passwords. The paper was released this week during the WEF annual meeting in Davos.<br></p>



<p>The paper, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/passwordless-authentication-the-next-breakthrough-in-secure-digital-transformation">Passwordless Authentication: The next breakthrough in secure digital transformation</a>, was developed in collaboration with the FIDO Alliance and includes contributions from many of our members including Aetna/CVS Health, Google, HYPR, Intuit, Microsoft, Nok Nok, Onfido, Trusona, the UK government and Yubico.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>According to the report, ending our reliance on passwords can make us safer and businesses more efficient. Cybercrime is set to cost the global economy $2.9 million every minute in 2020 and some 80% of these attacks are password-related. Knowledge-based authentication like passwords is not only a major headache for users, it is costly to maintain. For larger businesses, it is estimated that nearly 50% of IT help desk costs are allocated to password resets, with average annual spend for companies now at over $1 million for staffing alone.<br></p>



<p>The lead of the project, Adrien Ogee, Platform for Shaping the Future of Cybersecurity and Digital Trust, World Economic Forum, points out in a press release accompanying the paper that “better authentication practices are not just possible they are a necessity.” The possibility of moving beyond passwords is more real than ever as the growing availability of next generation, FIDO-based technologies like biometrics and security keys can meet consumer demands for both user convenience and security. There are several mini case studies from our members in the report that highlight their use today, and the benefits they are seeing. A few examples:</p>



  A mid-sized U.S. retail bank saved more than $2.9 million annually and saved customers up to 30% in time to finish a payment (Source: Nok Nok)  A U.S. financial software company brought its authentication success rate to 99.9% and reduced sign in time by 78% (Source: Intuit)  Google’s internal use of FIDO security keys dropped total time spent authenticating by nearly two-thirds, and they experienced zero authentication failures  



<p>It’s validating to see WEF not only educate world leaders on the economic impact of our legacy authentication practices, but to recognize that there are viable alternatives that are ready to implement today. With cryptographically secure and convenient FIDO Authentication now supported in all major web browsers as well as Android and Windows platforms, there is no reason to delay — now is the time to move past passwords and embrace simpler, stronger authentication.<br></p>

<p>Dr. Rae Hayward, Certification Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>From consumer brands to vendors to enterprises, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-2019-progress-report/">FIDO has been embraced across the globe</a> in 2019, and this is more evident than ever with the growth in our certification programs. Today organizations are requiring certification before deploying FIDO Authentication. The increase in certified FIDO products illustrates its value to the industry.</p>



<p>With that, we’re excited to announce our newest certifications today, which puts us over 688 certified products. Certifications across all specifications were strong this quarter, as tech providers look to provide solutions for those with cross-platform and mobile-first strategies.</p>



<p>It’s notable that we now have 107 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/authenticator-certification-levels/">authenticator certifications</a> at L1 and L2 levels – big growth since this program was launched last year. This program addresses an increasingly critical market requirement for a more transparent view into the security of FIDO Certified authenticators. Certification gives enterprises and online services the ability to make better informed risk management decisions when registering credentials from FIDO-enabled devices. Today, we offer certifications at Levels 1, 2, 3 and 3+ and plan to introduce more levels in the future.</p>



<p>These
companies have achieved FIDO certification since our last update:</p>



  FIDO2: Acceptto Corporation; Authentrend; CANTON Consulting; Capy Japan Inc.; CROSSCERT: KECA(Korea Electronic Certification Authority); ellipticSecure; Excelsecu Data Technology Co., Ltd.; GoTrustID Inc.; Hanko GmbH; HID Global; Hypersecu Information Systems, Inc.; Kensington Computer Products Group; knowledgesuite,inc.; Login ID Inc.; Paywax; RSA; SEOWOOSNC Co.,Ltd.; SoloKeys; SurePassID; Target; TOKEN2; TWCA; Uni-ID Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.; Veridium ID Ltd; XionITS; WebComm Technology Co.,Ltd.; Yubico<br><br>  FIDO U2F: Kensington Computer Products Group; Synaptics Incorporated; Yubico<br><br>  FIDO UAF: Giesecke+Devrient Mobile Security GmbH; LG Electronics; Novatek Microelectronics Co.; PNC; SurePassID; WebComm Technology Co.,Ltd.<br><br>  



<p>In Biometric Component Certification program news, Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA) and TUV Informationstechnik GmbH are now accredited independent labs performing biometric evaluations (see our <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-certification/fido-accredited-biometric-laboratories/">labs page</a> for details and additional labs). This program is gaining momentum, with several certifications in process.</p>



<p>Technology providers and relying parties interested in FIDO certification should start with the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">Certification Overview</a>. Ready for interoperability testing? Join us at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/event/interop-event-seoul-s-korea/">our next event</a>, March 3-5, 2020 in Seoul, South Korea where we will be testing FIDO UAF, FIDO U2F and FIDO2 implementations.

Alexander Shcherbakov is a software engineer at DSR working on the team at Evernym. He has a Ph.D. in Mathematics and is one of the maintainers of Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Plenum. In this presentation, he will explain the value of a decentralized ledger in an SSI ecosystem and examine Hyperledger Indy, which is the distributed ledger that has been powering the Sovrin Network for more than two years.

Our identities have to be trusted to be useful. When we meet strangers, we decide how much we trust them by what they tell us, and whether a trusted third party will vouch for them. In traditional identity systems, the trusted third party knows everything about everyone in the ecosystem. In Self-Sovereign Identity systems, we rely on a decentralized ledger to privately validate that the identity claims do in fact come from a trusted issuer.

Indy’s blockchain implementation is Plenum, which is a general purpose, public-permissioned, BFT distributed ledger. The presentation takes a technical look at the architecture, cryptography, transactions, data structures, and storage of the ledger including auditability, request processing, catch-up procedure, and support for custom plugins and custom transactions.

  [Group Picture from Mentor and Mentee Party, August 1st 2019] 



<p>
By Henry Lee and Sanghun Won, Co-Chairs, FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group</p>



 



<p>For our Hackathon program, more teams than we expected completed proof of concepts. We had more than 40 applications, and 12 teams made it through the initial screening process and were given the opportunity to participate in a three-month mentorship program. One team had to drop out in the midst of the mentorship program, due to the team leader receiving a promising career opportunity. This blog serves as a way to celebrate these finalists’ efforts, while introducing their ideas to unlock the potential of FIDO protocols to the world.</p>



 



<p>EASY</p>



<p>EASY is a team made up of three university students and they were mentored by CrossCert. They developed an IoT Storage Service based on FIDO protocols, so that families in low-income brackets would not have to visit certain places with their ID cards to pick up care packages from government agencies. For more technical information on the proposed solution, please <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/FIDOAlliance/2019-fido-seoul-seminar-moving-beyond-passwords">visit page 78 of FIDO Alliance SlideShare</a>. </p>

<p>Social Mix</p>



<p>Social Mix is a venture company with a business model providing simpler and more secure payment services for influencers on social networks. They wanted to find a solution for troubles that merchandise transactions on social networking services are facing. By participating in the Mentorship program by BC Card, the team implemented FIDO protocol based log-ins which not only enabled confirming buyer and seller’s identities but also sped up the transaction with a single click of a button in less than five seconds. For more technical information on the proposed solution, please <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/FIDOAlliance/2019-fido-seoul-seminar-moving-beyond-passwords">visit page 77 of FIDO Alliance SlideShare.</a></p>

<p>Umbridge</p>



<p>The team Umbridge had an idea to utilize unused umbrellas at home in the perspective of a sharing economy. In a populated city like Seoul, people often buy umbrellas due to unexpected rain, and many of them keep piling up at home. The three university students, mentored by SK Telecom, wanted to increase usability of such umbrellas by introducing IoT Umbrella lockers which can be used by any citizens once they are authenticated through FIDO protocols.

<p>KISMI</p>



<p>KISMI is a startup company developing a decentralized identity-based ERP system. The team was mentored by eWBM, due to the fact that FIDO security keys were an essential part of their project. They acquired the FIDO technology from ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), another proud member of FIDO Alliance, which expedited their development process by integrating other blocks of required technologies. For more technical information on the proposed solution, please <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/FIDOAlliance/2019-fido-seoul-seminar-moving-beyond-passwords">visit page 57 of FIDO Alliance SlideShare.</a></p>

<p>GwangHae</p>



<p>GwangHae developed a Linux SSH (Secure Shell) login system with FIDO2 protocols. The team realized public IP addresses in Linux can be an easy target for attackers due to the fact about 82% of data breaches are due to poor passwords. The team, made up of only one university student, customized PAM, implemented FIDO2 authentication service for easier yet more secure logins while eliminating needs for end-user password management. GwangHae was mentored by Yubico and AirCuve, which are considering publishing the results as open source to the public. For more technical information on the proposed solution, please <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/FIDOAlliance/2019-fido-seoul-seminar-moving-beyond-passwords">visit page 55 of FIDO Alliance SlideShare.</a></p>

  [FIDO Hackathon Award Ceremony during FIDO Seoul Seminar in September 2019] 



<p> By Henry Lee and Sanghun Won, Co-Chairs, FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group</p>



 



<p>Interviewees</p>



<p>Mentors: Dongho Kim, Samsung SDS, Kieun Shin, LINE and Sangwook Han, CrossCert<br>Mentees: Yeojin Lee representing Team Jekyll &amp; Hyde (mentored by Samsung), Yushin Cho representing Team N-Key (mentored by LINE), and Nohyun Kawk representing TEEware (mentored by CrossCert). </p>



 



<p>Question: As FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group Technical Sub-Group Co-Leaders (Dongho and Kieun), what was the background or purpose of running a FIDO Hackathon – Developer Support Program this year?</p>



<p>Dongho: Since FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group announced 2019 would be the year of FIDO deployment, the members sought various ways to make it happen. The idea of running a Hackathon seemed to be a perfect fit since we realized a one-day workshop or seminar had its limits to fully demonstrate the strength of FIDO protocols. Based on my earlier experiences of volunteering at school coding classes and joining local Hackathon events, it was understood that submerging ourselves with these young minds was the best way to reach out to local developer community.</p>



<p>Kieun: We have been trying our best to introduce FIDO-based services to the market. Being able to learn creative ideas and approaches to deploy FIDO was the key purpose of launching such an event.&nbsp; Identifying a potential partners and high-skilled engineers were unexpected bonuses.</p>



  [Jekyll &amp; Hyde Team Members] 



<p>Question: What motivated your team to participate in the FIDO Hackathon?</p>



<p>Nohyun: TEEware is a startup founded by members of KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) Graduate School of Information Security, and we thought the FIDO Hackathon was an ideal platform to verify our idea to combine FIDO protocols with decentralized ID for electronic contract projects.</p>



<p>Yushin: All of our team members are at their 2nd or 3rd year of university with experience of participating over dozens of local Hackathon events hosted by government agencies and private companies. We all thought the FIDO Hackathon was unique and much more meaningful, compared to other local half-day or one-day Hackathon event. It gave us an opportunity to engage deeply with Mentors with lots of hands-on experiences in the industry, which eventually helped us realize the FIDO-enabled Kiosk proof of concept in a timely manner.</p>



<p>Yeojin: As a school graduation project, our team members had an idea to make authentication much stronger and simpler by combining FIDO protocol with QR codes, but did not know how to move forward, due to the fact that we never had such scale of project experiences as college students. By working with Mentors and communicating with other teams participating in the FIDO Hackathon, we could quickly fill the technical gaps.</p>



  [N-Key Team Members] 



<p>Question: As a Mentor or Mentee, what was the most challenging aspect of the program?</p>



<p>Dongho: In the beginning, we thought inviting talented teams to participate in the program was the most challenging, due to the fact that we weren’t able to be competitive with other Hackathon programs in terms of prize money or gifts. We stayed&nbsp; focused on what was achievable and provided a simple, clear message to the public about what we wanted to accomplish. In the end, magic happened. Not only did more than 40 teams participate in the initial screening process, but we had 12 of them completing the proof of concepts through the mentorship program.</p>



<p>Yeojin: Right from the beginning of the mentorship program, the team members realized that the way we do projects at school were very different from how things were done in the field. We also had to quickly build a bridge between what we know as concept or academic theory and what or how things are actually done in business. That was the most challenging, yet most rewarding at the same time, because learning something like that as a student is priceless.</p>



<p>Yushin: Our team members came from 3 different universities and we have never worked as a team before. What we thought as a simple issue in the beginning were later found to be the toughest hurdle.&nbsp; Thanks to our mentor’s close and frequently scheduled guidance, we were able to stay as a team and never give up. We learned the importance of human factors and soft skills while conducting such a project.</p>



<p>Sangwook: Unlike other teams that are consisted of university students, TEEware was a young startup with extremely demanding business schedules. By closely communicating with the team, we were able to narrow down the project scope, which fits the purpose of the Hackathon program, and successfully complete the project in a timely manner.</p>



  [TEEware Team Members] 



<p>Question: What are the tangible or intangible assets you earned from the FIDO Hackathon program?</p>



<p>Sangwook: As an engineer, I was only able to see a small aspect of FIDO protocols, log-in and log-out, so far. However, the FIDO Hackathon opened up our eyes by understanding how FIDO can be presented as a solution to various technical or social problems. CrossCert has signed a business partnership with TEEware and you will see future products spinning out from this result very soon.</p>



<p>Nohyun: By participating the FIDO Hackathon, we were able to study the feasibility of our product and closely listen to potential clients’ needs. These lessons will be reflected upon our future business and product development plans.</p>



<p>Kieun: Surprisingly, I learned a lot by teaching and communicating with these young university students.&nbsp; Acquiring new ideas, being able to set our future products or services roadmaps, and understanding how to work with external partners with fresh minds were incredible assets that I earned.</p>



<p>Yushin: Besides the fact that we have earned the Top 3 Awards with prizes and trophies, it was so satisfying to see our rough idea to successfully go through proof of concept process. It is something that I could never accomplish in any other short-term Hackathon events.</p>



<p>Dongho: I was so happy to see the general public and local developers got to understand more about FIDO protocols, fixing misunderstanding around FIDO. Internally, the FIDO Hackathon helped FIDO Alliance Korea Working Group members to collaborate with each other for the very first time, by shooting for a single target and supporting the local developer community.</p>

Daniel Hardman, Chief Architect, Evernym / Secretary, Technical Governance Board – Sovrin Foundation will show how Peer DIDs will allow off-chain transactions for the self-sovereign identity (SSI) world.

Most documentation about decentralized identifiers (DIDs) describes them as identifiers that are rooted in a public source of truth like a blockchain, a database, a distributed filesystem, or similar. This publicness lets arbitrary parties resolve the DIDs to an endpoint and keys. It is an important feature for many use cases. However, the vast majority of relationships between people, organizations, and things have simpler requirements. When Alice(Corp|Device) and Bob want to interact, there are exactly and only 2 parties in the world who should care: Alice and Bob. Instead of arbitrary parties needing to resolve their DIDs, only Alice and Bob do. Peer DIDs are perfect in these cases. In many ways, peer DIDs are to public, blockchain-based DIDs what Ethereum Plasma or state channels are to on-chain smart contracts— or what Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is to on-chain cryptopayments. They move interactions off-chain, but offer options to connect back to a chain-based ecosystem as needed. Peer DIDs create the conditions for people, organizations, and things to have full control of their end of the digital relationships they sustain.

<p>These conditions are endemic to orphanages across the globe, and are primarily made possible by the fact that these children typically lack a basic human right: documented proof of their existence, whether through a birth certificate or other identification. Without the necessary documents to prove their identity, these children are trapped forever, unable to reunite with their families. Addressing this fundamental problem in accessing a proof of identity is critical in combatting the abuse of vulnerable children around the world.</p>
<p>How does WIN Foundation and its partners help children in need? Watch this video to see how you can get involved:<br>
</p>
<p>An estimated eight million children today reside in orphanages – yet more than 80% of these children have at least one living parent. Separated and unable to reconnect with their families, these kids are doomed to a brutal life, constantly uprooted and taken advantage of. In addition to the plague of trafficking, sexual abuse, and slavery these orphans face, they are also 500 times more likely to take their own lives. Several governments have passed deinstitutionalization laws against orphanages, but they continue to flourish as children are increasingly displaced by crises like the civil war in Syria, or the Indian government’s removal of ethnic minorities from its national ID registry. The resulting rise of statelessness means there is no longer a sense of belonging for children who are displaced, and “children in cages” at the border become children victimized in orphanages.</p>
<p>Working with local authorities, organizations like Hope and Homes for Children have managed to close many abusive orphanages worldwide. But millions of children are still waiting to be reunited with a loving family. Many of them risk being taken out of the country by human traffickers, often ending up in modern slavery or the human organ trade. <a href="https://www.hopeandhomes.org/patron/mariana-dahan/">The WIN Foundation is proud to partner with Hope and Homes for Children</a>, becoming part of a successful drive to save orphans in Moldova from an inhumane fate.</p>
Hope and Homes for Children helps families around the world find their place and lifts them to success
<p>WIN Foundation works with a local satellite of Hope and Homes for Children, CCF Moldova, to get children out of the orphanage system. We help provide them with personal ID papers, trace their family lineage, and reunite them with family members. We purchase comfortable homes for the families and cover costs for their most basic needs. Furthermore, with our support, the government of Moldova passed a law requiring every minor to possess a proof of personal ID, if they intend to leave the country. Using blockchain on top of existing systems will flag and record every unlawful attempt to exit, helping to ensure that no child is taken out of the country using fake ID documents produced by human traffickers.</p>
<p>We are proud of our work with Hope and Homes for Children, and believe this systematic approach allows individuals to take control of their own fate. Recently, acclaimed author <a href="https://observer.com/2019/10/jk-rowling-blockchain-magic-orphanages/">J.K. Rowling spoke at the One Young World Summit</a> about the dangers of “orphanage tourism,” insisting that our collective focus should instead be on the circumstances that drive these children to such terrible institutions. In Rowling’s fantastical writings, magic empowers individuals and works to bring justice and happiness to the downtrodden. We believe our work with Hope and Homes for Childen resembles magic in this regard; everyone deserves access to proof of their identity, and blockchain technology offers limitless possibilities to do it correctly – finally holding access to their own identity, vulnerable children in orphanages can realize their full potential for success. We should harness the capabilities of blockchain to elevate humanity à la Wingardium Leviosa.</p>

<p>Last week the FIDO Alliance held an impactful policy forum in D.C. with partners Better Identity Coalition, Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) and National Cybersecurity Alliance. This is the fourth year that we’ve held this event, which aims to provide attendees with a broadened view of the intersection of identity, authentication and policy. </p>



<p>The talks from government officials showed that agencies are in tune with the need, and society’s demand, to provide more seamless digital services to citizens while increasing security. Grant Schneider, the federal government’s chief information security officer, summed it up: “Our goals from an identity standpoint is first and foremost, how do we increase security that also increases usability? Because we have to do both at the same time.” </p>



<p>The good news is that government officials recognize the availability of modern authentication technology and how it can help them achieve their goals. The Social Security Administration’s CIO Rajive Mathur, spoke about plans to digitize SSA, including rolling out FIDO-based logins in the near future. One federation partner they are considering is login.gov, which uses FIDO Authentication today. “Our goal is to eliminate passwords,” Mathur said. </p>



<p>Several speakers pointed out that identity is first a societal issue, rather than just a technology or policy issue. This was clear in the fireside chat with identity-theft victim Axton Betz-Hamilton, who shared her case and talked about the emotional toll it had on her, and the difficult recovery process. Betz-Hamilton is just one of millions of people who are impacted by identity theft each year, and endure its deep and lasting ramifications. </p>



<p>Another impactful talk on the societal impacts of identity was from Reverend Ben Roberts from the Foundry United Methodist Church in D.C. Rev. Roberts talked about the church’s ID Ministry, which assists poor, homeless or others lacking in resources to acquire government identification. His talk was a reminder about how much one’s identity is based on having basic documentation such as birth certificates, social security cards and state-issued IDs — and how verifying identity is critical to receiving societal staples such as employment, housing and/or government assistance. </p>



<p>“For those of you building systems of identity and authentication, be intentional, be mindful,” Rev. Roberts said in his talk. He’s absolutely right. As we look at identity and providing best practices around remote identity verification processes and technologies, we need to be aware there are people without access to basic identity documentation and ensure that this large population of people isn’t left behind.</p>



<p>If you missed our policy day, you can still watch the talks — the webcast is archived on YouTube at <a href="https://youtu.be/2MxHT8o3lfY">https://youtu.be/2MxHT8o3lfY</a>.  </p>

<p>There is more big news out of Japan today:&nbsp; NTT DOCOMO, Japan’s largest mobile network operator with over 78 million subscriptions, has announced a new authentication option: d ACCOUNT® Passwordless Authentication. Starting in February 2020, d ACCOUNT users will have the option to disable password logins and set their accounts to login via FIDO biometric authentication only. The goal of d ACCOUNT Passwordless Authentication is to provide an even stronger way to prevent unauthorized logins with FIDO so that even if a user’s password is stolen, it can no longer be used to access the account. This new option will be available on DOCOMO-supported mobile handsets with biometric authentication capabilities — currently more than 90 models are available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOCOMO has long supported FIDO standards, offering FIDO Authentication to its users since 2015 and contributing to the FIDO Alliance and its specifications at the board level. Now, it is great to see DOCOMO as amongst the first to offer true passwordless authentication backed by FIDO standards, and on its journey to becoming completely passwordless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re often asked what it’s going to take to achieve our mission to end the world’s reliance on passwords. The answer is that it is a journey, not one that will happen overnight, but one that will happen one application at a time. With native support for FIDO now built into Android, Windows, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari, and FIDO Universal Servers available to support all FIDO specifications, the implementation work is largely done. Now, the stage is set for more service providers and enterprises to take DOCOMO’S example and start on their passwordless journeys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like to learn more about DOCOMO’s journey with FIDO, read our new case study <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/ntt-docomo-deployment-case-study-your-security-more-simple-2/">here</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Last week in Seoul, FIDO Alliance held a seminar for 300+ attendees eager to learn more about FIDO authentication. A big highlight was the case study track in the afternoon, which gave us a glimpse into the rise of FIDO Authentication in Asia, notably Korea and Japan. Here are a few notable takeaways from these sessions:</p>



<p>SK Telecom: With its 47,000 employees and more than 500 enterprise applications, SK Telecom (SKT) parent company SK in Korea deals with credential stuffing threats on a daily basis. To combat this issue, SKT has implemented FIDO for its Group Mobile Portal (GMP), which includes applications such as company mail, calendars and many others. Since implementing FIDO biometric login, SKT has reduced login time from 30 seconds to only five seconds, and now experiences zero successful credential stuffing attacks. This data showcases how FIDO can provide both increased productivity and security for the enterprise.</p>



<p>LINE: LINE announced at the seminar it has deployed FIDO2 for their mobile payment service “LINE Pay” for iOS as a native app with whitebox encryption and attestation. LINE Pay has more than 40 million users. Next, LINE plans to leverage FIDO authentication in more of its platforms including LINE Pay Android, payments in the LINE app or on the web, and in other countries. LINE’s FIDO deployment comes in addition to several other new deployments in Japan, as we heard from NTT DOCOMO, including Yahoo! Japan, Fujitsu and Japan Post Bank.</p>



<p>Samsung Mobile: Samsung has long supported FIDO standards, implementing FIDO biometrics five years ago on its Samsung Galaxy S5 handset. Last year, Samsung became the world’s first company to achieve FIDO Alliance Biometric Component Certification for its S10/S10+ handsets. Samsung also reported that over 90% of its products are now IoT-ready.&nbsp; Next up, Samsung plans to work on implementing FIDO2 on its proprietary web browser, Samsung Internet, to make Samsung devices “completely FIDO ready.” </p>



<p>In addition to these deployments we heard about at the seminar, we were also pleased to learn that the Korean Government has implemented FIDO for login to several e-government services and plans to implement FIDO2 early next year. Look out for a case study on this implementation soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another highlight from the event was the awards ceremony for the Korea Hackathon, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-authentication-developer-support-program-fido-hackathon-in-korea/">which we wrote about in July</a> — watch for another post for information coming soon on the winners and their innovative FIDO implementations.  </p>

<p>Kantara Initiative Member Spotlight<a href="https://www.id.me/"></a></p>
<p>This month the Kantara Initiative Member spotlight shines upon ID.me, another Kantara member leading the market in digital Identity.</p>
<p>1. In which sector(s) and country(ies) do you operate?&nbsp;</p>
<p>ID.me operates globally and across multiple sectors of the economy including: Government, Healthcare, Financial Services, Retail/Ecommerce, Ticketing, Travel, and Automotive.</p>
<p>2. What is your current market focus and what needs and areas of concern does your service/product address?</p>
<p>ID.me provides a complete, next-generation platform for identity credentialing, to include identity proofing and multi-factor authentication. As part of ID.me’s “No Identity Left Behind” project, we are exceptionally proud that we are able to achieve a high level of trust — NIST 800-63-3 IAL2 — in identity proofing for all demographics, including individuals whose personal identifiers are either not present or inaccurately stored in records. This enables young individuals who might not yet have a financial identity or women who married and changed their name to establish their identity online without having to go to a trusted agent in-person. We call this video chat capability, Virtual In-Person proofing.</p>
<p>3. In what ways does your service/product push beyond the state-of- the- art?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main benefits of identity are Access and Security. When these benefits are achieved with minimal friction, then consumers begin to realize significant time savings. To that end, ID.me’s advances in identity proofing for all demographics, and our ability to make that identity proofing event portable across multiple organization’s via ID.me’s Single Sign On and the authenticated consumer’s consent, is truly ground-breaking. More objectively, more than 30,000 users are signing up for ID.me every day and we are zooming through the 15M user mark so the market seems to agree with value proposition.</p>
<p>4. Where do you see the market trending in the mid/long term and how do you see your product/service playing into it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to provide users with a credential they can use to prove their identity across the economy and across channels without having to repeatedly prove their identity over and over again in a vacuum. There is a reason people hate managing passwords. Interoperable digital credentials save people time and frustration, and we are excited that ID.me is positioned to save tens of millions of people time and money when they attempt to complete a transaction that requires trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Why were you motivated to join Kantara Initiative and how do you see it helping your organization specifically, and the digital economy as a whole?</p>
<p>The Kantara Initiative plays an important role in the market by signaling that ID.me’s claims about our services have been independently verified and are, therefore, reliable. The trust ecosystem is something like an onion with a layered process that starts with government issuing standards for identity at the core and then moves outwards with the next layer being a group of auditors and assessors to certify solutions that wish to credential the mass market. The Kantara Initiative had a reputation for excellence and for not cutting any corners during the auditing process, so we selected the Kantara Initiative as our community because we wanted to go through an accreditation process the market and our customers would respect. As the digital economy grows, the Kantara Initiative plays an essential role in providing business customers with the confidence that the identity solutions they are considering have been vetted.</p>
<p>6. What other significant aspects about your organization (service/product) should our global community know about?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take great pride in the privacy features we have built into our platform. In many ways, ID.me was architected for a GDPR and CCPA world before those laws made privacy a mainstream topic. To that end, we never share a user’s data with third parties without their explicit consent, we apply privacy filters to prevent an application from asking a user for information not related to the underlying transaction, and we honor the user’s right to delete their data with ID.me at any time. It is very cool to see the market adopting these principles as law, and we are excited to have an identity platform that can enable compliance with the new obligations these laws have put upon businesses.<br>

<p>By Sam Curren, Sovrin Agent Architect</p><p>One of the clear highlights of Consensus 2019 for the decentralized identity community was when Brian Behlendorf took the stage and announced <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Hyperledger Aries&nbsp;</a>, the newest project to be accepted into Hyperledger under the Linux Foundation. Sovrin Foundation led the charge for Aries to be added to Hyperledger.</p><p>Aries is meant to foster identity interoperability with any ledger using any wallet. Aries is a shared infrastructure of tools that enables the exchange of blockchain-based data, supports peer-to-peer messaging in various scenarios, and facilitates interoperable interaction between different blockchains and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Simply put, developers can pick up the tools and libraries in Aries and make their own digital identity wallets and configure them to operate on any networks they please. This is a major milestone for the Sovrin Foundation and our mission of Identity for All. This means interoperable, open source digital identity for multiple uses on multiple networks.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/drummondreed/status/1128298100748165120">@drummondreed</a></p></blockquote><p>Although much of the media coverage of this exciting announcement was&nbsp;, some press outlets attempted to turn the story into a <a href="https://hackernoon.com/aries-and-ion-two-different-perspectives-of-decentralized-identity-in-blockchain-applications-c80dbe0bb241">competition </a>between Aries and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Active-Directory-Identity/Toward-scalable-decentralized-identifier-systems/ba-p/560168">Microsoft’s recently announced Ion&nbsp;</a>, announced the same day. In doing so, these authors revealed how little they understood about the Aries project (or Ion). Aries provides secure communication and interactions independent of but anchored to any number of DID method providers, including Microsoft’s Ion.</p><p>These news outlets also mistakenly identified the launch as something done by IBM. IBM is one of <a href="https://sovrin.org/stewards/">Sovrin’s Founding Stewards </a>and also part of the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy </a>community. Among several projects supporting verifiable credential exchange they were recently seen at Consensus giving technical previews of a new project that aims to help bootstrap developers looking to develop their own products. But this misrepresentation of IBM as somehow taking the lead in the development of Aries reveals a fundamental misunderstanding that anything related to Hyperledger is the work of a single organization, rather than the work of the vibrant and diverse community that ultimately drives project development.</p><p>If anything, one would only need to attend a single Hyperledger Aries, Indy or Ursa weekly community call to see the primary sponsor of both Hyperledger Aries and Hyperledger Indy (the project where Aries was incubated) is in fact the Sovrin Foundation. Our small non-profit is dedicated to a mission of creating a global public utility for Identity on the Internet. The number of companies and organizations that have contributed significant effort to the Aries, Indy and Ursa projects further clarifies their existence as a community project, not one that can be attributed to any single&nbsp;company.</p><p>When the Sovrin Foundation first contributed the code for Indy to Hyperledger, it was the first identity focused project within the organization. Hyperledger already contained Sawtooth, Iroha, and Fabric (contributed originally by IBM) as ledger projects. None of these existing projects support Identity at the core, and the Hyperledger community has been very welcoming of the identity strengths of the Indy ledger project and concepts.</p><p>One of the architectural components of Indy is called an Agent. This is software that acts on behalf of an identity owner to communicate off-ledger with other Agents. As Agent work continued with the development of message encryption standards, extensible message typing, and common protocols, interest grew in applying these concepts and practices to systems based on other ledgers. It became clear that the right future for Agent work was to extract it from Indy project and add support for other ledger technologies to make that integration easier and more powerful. That work is now known as Hyperledger Aries.</p><p>In addition to being able to support more ledger technologies than just Indy, Aries can work with multiple ledgers at the same time. This allows Agents to use each ledger according to the unique power offered by each, instead of requiring anchoring to only one ledger. In the future, Agents will be able to integrate not only with the recently announced Ion DID method, but also Ethereum, Hyperledger Sawtooth, Bitcoin, Hyperledger Fabric, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Each of these ledgers offer valuable mechanisms for trusted transactions, cryptographic credentials and proofs, smart contracts, payment, and DID methods. Microsoft Ion is itself a DID method that combines IPFS with Bitcoin anchoring. Aries exists on an architectural layer above these layers, enabling powerful forms of communication anchored to these underlying ledger technologies that has the possibility to change the nature of how the Internet as a whole handles Identity.</p><p>If the Aries project is interesting to you, we invite you to get involved. There are many ways you can contribute, and many ways that your own projects and efforts can be improved by integrating technology from the Aries&nbsp;project.</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about Aries, Indy, or Ursa, consider visiting <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Hyperledger+Aries+Proposal">https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Hyperledger+Aries+Proposal</a> or #Aries on Hyperledger chat at <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries">https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries </a>Hyperledger welcomes interest from all groups and organizations, including enterprises and standards organizations.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/sovrin-proudly-contributes-to-hyperledger-aries/">https://sovrin.org</a> on May 21,&nbsp;2019.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.sovrin.org/sovrin-proudly-contributes-to-hyperledger-aries-5822ba91abd1">Sovrin proudly contributes to Hyperledger Aries</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Regulatory requirements like open banking rules and the data portability provisions in the European Union’s GDPR tend to be viewed as burdens – forcing compliance expense and stunting growth. But business leaders can use the opportunity to rise above their competition by embracing data portability. The key is ‘Self-Sovereign’ Identity.

<p>Will Collaborate On Assurance For Consumer Access To Health Care Information</p>
<p>WAKEFIELD, Mass., USA – May 1, 2019 — <a href="https://kantarainitiative.eu/">Kantara Initiative</a>, the only industry organization focused on 3rd party assessed digital identity and privacy assurance frameworks, announced today the signing of an affiliated alliance agreement with the <a href="http://www.carinalliance.com">CARIN Alliance</a>, a non-partisan, multi-sector alliance of more than sixty health care and other stakeholders managed by Leavitt Partners.</p>
<p>The agreement allows for collaboration and eventual development of assurance schemes underpinning the Office of National Coordinator’s (ONC) Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) to help consumers and their authorized caregivers easily get, use, and share their digital health information where, when, and how they want to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Opportunities exist for Kantara’s <a href="https://kantarainitiative.eu/file-downloads/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2-0-pdf/">User-Managed Access (UMA) 2.0</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.eu/file-downloads/consent-receipt-specification-v1-1-0/">Consent Receipt 1.1</a> (CR 1.1) global technical specifications to be implemented in organizations who desire to be in compliance with the ONC’s draft <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/interoperability/trusted-exchange-framework-and-common-agreement">TEFCA</a> for improved consumer access and control of health care data.&nbsp; Kantara’s community developed UMA 2.0 and CR 1.1 specifications and Kantara’s Trust Framework Operations bring user consent, control and trust into easier reach for consumers and organizations accessing and processing personal data.</p>
<p>“The CARIN Alliance plans to develop a set of best practices for implementing the use of NIST 800-63-3 Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) and Authenticator Assurance Level 2 (AAL2)&nbsp;<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">guidelines</a>&nbsp;in health care,” said Ryan Howells, principal at Leavitt Partners. “We were the first major health care collaborative to recommend in August 2017 that ONC use the NIST 800-63-3 guidelines, including IAL2 and AAL2, as the minimum identity proofing and authentication requirements in health care. From the beginning, Kantara has played a key role in helping us develop best practices and build an overall trust framework to implement these open standards and help us drive forward our goal of enabling consumers and their authorized caregivers to have more access to their digital health information with less friction.”</p>
<p>Kantara is the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.eu/trustoperations/">only 3rd party-assessing Trust Framework Provider</a> offering assurance of conformance to NIST 800-63-3 and other de jure standards.</p>
<p>“Over the last decade, Kantara Initiative has led the way in developing best practices and trust schemes in the digital identity and privacy space with the goal of building cross-community trust and ensuring people have control of their own data,” said Colin Wallis, executive director, Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; “It is the meshing of the two that creates solutions of real benefit to the end-user.&nbsp; Privacy and digital identity, together, provide maximum value to the consumer.&nbsp; The CARIN Alliance understands this and, together, we will work to help provide consumers more control over their sensitive health care data.”</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative</p>
<p>The Kantara Initiative is the leading global consortium improving trustworthy use of identity and personal data through innovation, standardization and good practice. Kantara provides real-world innovation through its development of specifications, applied R&amp;D and conformity assessment programs for the digital identity and personal data ecosystems.

<p>Extends Kantara´s Assurance Program Across Europe </p>
<p>WAKEFIELD, Mass., USA – April 24, 2019 — <a href="https://kantarainitiative.eu/">Kantara Initiative</a>, the only industry organization focused on 3rd party assessed digital identity and privacy assurance frameworks, announced today that <a href="https://seadot.se/">Seadot AB</a> was approved to perform Kantara Assessments across Europe and worldwide. &nbsp;Seadot AB and Seadot Cybersecurity AB are Europe-based consultancies focused on Information Security Management, Risk Management and Cybersecurity.</p>
<p>As an Accredited Assessor, Seadot plays a critical role in assessing a company’s digital service or solution against a particular Class of Approval to earn a Trust Mark which is evidence of conformance.&nbsp; Kantara’s Trust Framework currently has <a href="https://kantarainitiative.eu/trustoperations/classes-of-approval/">four Classes of Approval</a>.</p>
<p>“A Kantara assessment demonstrates an organization’s compliance to a recognized assurance framework. &nbsp;It is essential for testing digital identity and privacy initiatives,” said Björn Sjöholm, CEO, Seadot AB. “Using a third party assessment is the best way for an organization to measure its security as it is not feasible for a company to measure its security and secure a Trust Mark using internal resources alone.”</p>
<p>Kantara is <a href="https://kantarainitiative.eu/trustoperations/800-63-3/">the only organization that provides third party assessment against the primary National Institute of Standards and Technology standard for identity</a>. Kantara actively works with governments and standards bodies internationally to align this program for multi-jurisdictional adoption.</p>
<p>About Kantara Assessors Accreditation </p>
<p>Kantara’s Identity Assurance Framework (IAF) with its <a href="https://kantarainitiative.eu/trust-registry/trust-status-list/">Accredited Assessor and Approved Service Provider Services</a> apply to standards-based schemes.&nbsp; Kantara has been an authorized US Government Trust Framework Provider since 2011. The Classes of Approval operating under the IAF specify the verification and proofing checks that Credential Service Providers (CSPs) carry out on entities, the way that CSPs run their services, and how the CSP’s services are subjected to rigorous assessment by independent third parties — <a href="https://kantarainitiative.eu/trust-registry/trust-status-list/">Kantara´s Accredited Assessors</a> — &nbsp;following the IAF’s defined processes and using published and peer-reviewed Service Assessment Criteria.</p>

 The Government of British Columbia uses the Sovrin Network to take strides towards a fully digital&nbsp;economy <p>The Government of British Columbia recently <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019CITZ0002-000062">announced</a> the launch of <a href="https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/">OrgBook BC</a>. OrgBook BC is a searchable directory of public, verifiable data issued by government authorities about businesses in British Columbia. OrgBook BC is an exemplar service of the <a href="https://vonx.io/">Verifiable Organizations Network</a>(VON) which envisions a new way to issue, store, and share authentic and authoritative data about organizations globally. The Sovrin Network provides OrgBook BC with a global reach for its credentials issuance and verification services.</p><p>We asked John Jordan, Executive Director of Emerging Digital Initiatives from the Government of British Columbia, to tell us&nbsp;more:</p> Sovrin: Please tell us a little bit about OrgBook BC and the Verifiable Organizations Network? Where did this idea come from? Why was it created? What problem does it aim to&nbsp;solve? <p>John: The Government of British Columbia’s move towards a fully digital economy is missing a key piece: a solid digital foundation of trust. We need confidence that the people and businesses we are interacting with are who they say they&nbsp;are.</p><p>Relationships are fundamental to how we live, work, and play together in society. The current suite of technologies that power the internet have provided a great deal of opportunity; however, they were never designed to solve the problem of establishing trustworthy peer-to-peer relationships. We believe the open technology behind the Sovrin Network, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>, provides an opportunity to explore how to use digital networks to establish trust at a distance.</p><p>The <a href="https://vonx.io/">Verifiable Organizations Network</a> (VON) envisions a globally available suite of services enabling new ways for trusted and enduring digital relationships to form. Governments, organizations, and individuals will benefit from the ability to issue, hold, and verify the authentic and authoritative data needed to create and maintain the trusted digital relationships they need to grow and prosper. The issuance of this data will be based on the emerging <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> standard. VON is an open community effort to establish this better way to find, issue, and store this trustworthy data about organizations.</p><p>However, it will take some time to reach this broad vision. Not all of the components we need to realize this vision are yet available. In particular, we don’t yet have the software businesses needed to hold and share these new Verifiable Credentials, and government services don’t have the software to issue and verify them. We need a way to provide near-term value and begin the bootstrapping process to realize this global scale&nbsp;vision.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/">OrgBook BC</a> comes in. Grounded in the foundational data of the BC Registry, OrgBook BC is a searchable public directory of trustworthy business data. Currently, anyone can search for and find registration information for the more than 525,000 legal entities operating in the Province of British Columbia. OrgBook BC provides a destination for our services for business to issue their permits and licences, all linked to the legal entity they are empowering.</p><p>These are the numerous government services who issue specific credentials to organizations. Permits to take water, liquor licences, business licences, building permits are among the many, many examples. We are working to enable these issuers to issue more credentials to OrgBook BC with simple to deploy open source software components and open APIs. The greater the number of issuers, the greater the value of OrgBook&nbsp;BC.</p><p>As the vision behind Sovrin and Hyperledger Indy matures, we believe a new software stack will emerge. This software “trust stack” will provide a way for global-scale trusted and enduring digital relationships to be formed. These trustworthy digital relationships will give people, organizations, and institutions a way to discover and build relationships with each other, over the internet, as they have always done in their own local communities. We think that is what is holding up the next economic leap&nbsp;forward.</p> Sovrin: What specifically does distributed ledger technology (DLT) enable VON to&nbsp;do? <p>John: This is a really important question. The Sovrin Network, powered by Hyperledger Indy, provides important capabilities. These capabilities provide globally scalable peer-to-peer interactions that are both highly secure and privacy respecting. This is a significant factor in our motivation to work with and understand this technology. If this new design can deliver on these privacy enhancing data exchange capabilities, we believe there is a real opportunity to help our businesses and citizens use the internet for trusted and high value interactions.</p><p>Most DLT implementations derive their design from the Bitcoin Blockchain. The design of that first type of blockchain implementation focuses on a kind of “reconciliation model” for currency-based transactions. Therefore, the design necessarily includes writing data to the ledger about the specific transactions that the users of the system undertake in order to create a common understanding of the state of the system. For example, what transactions have occurred and what are the associated balances of accounts implicated in those transactions.</p><p>The design of this type of DLT can displace typical trust intermediaries or centralized authorities who perform this reconciliation function on behalf of all the members of a network. Members of these networks typically use software called a “wallet” to gain access to the network and conduct a transaction with another member of the network. The transaction between the two members is conducted via the DLT. Without the DLT in this design, there is no way for the members to interact with each other. Further, as a result of the DLT being a party to all the transactions between members of the network, it is quite possible to discover who the members are even if the nature of their interactions may be private. We didn’t feel this was an appropriate technical approach for our purposes which, we hope, will eventually include empowering our citizens with globally recognized digital credentials which could include personal information.</p><p>This is not the design of the Hyperledger Indy&nbsp;DLT.</p><p>Hyperledger Indy is designed to support a new trust architecture for the internet. With Indy, the goal is to enable direct and secure peer-to-peer communication. Peers are typically individuals, services, and potentially devices. Peer-to-peer communication is not established via an intermediary nor is it conducted via the&nbsp;DLT.</p><p>To accomplish this, Indy can be understood as having two high-level components. The first component is the software which powers the DLT network. The second is typically called agent software which is used by peers wishing to create and manage their digital relationships via a set of sophisticated protocols. These protocols are generally rooted in a class of technology called public key infrastructure.</p><p>A unique quality Indy offers is the ability for issuers of Verifiable Credentials to make their public key(s) globally discoverable and available via the DLT. The Sovrin Network leverages this technical capability of Indy’s DLT and augments this with a governance structure. The governance and technology work together to create a trustworthy publicly readable network which contains the cryptographic elements needed for peers to exchange the Verifiable Credentials needed to establish trusted and enduring relationships.</p> Sovrin: How does VON work with the Sovrin&nbsp;Network? <p>John: The vision of VON is that any government, private sector, not-for-profit, or other type of organization can benefit from the ability to establish trusted relationships through the use of Verifiable Credentials over the internet. In order to help this vision come to fruition we have created two new software components to complement the existing ones in Hyperledger Indy.</p><p>One component is a type of agent that can be easily configured to connect to existing enterprise services. Under the label of Indy Catalyst Agent, this component enables services to quickly become Verifiable Credential issuer and verifier enabled services. Indy Catalyst Agent has everything that an enterprise service needs to interact with the Sovrin Network and with other Indy-based agents.</p><p>The second component, being further developed under the label of Indy Catalyst Credential Registry, is what powers OrgBook BC. In fact, OrgBook BC uses both Indy Catalyst Agent (configured as a holder/prover) and Indy Catalyst Credential Registry. This is also a service we think has a broad audience. Of course, legal entity registries can follow the OrgBook model, but there are many other similar examples. Professional accreditation organizations often have a need to make their membership lists public, including law societies, engineers, nurses, teachers, doctors, universities, colleges, and the list goes on. All of these kinds of services can benefit from having a public and trustworthy source of truth on the internet. And there are private use cases such as using an Indy Catalyst Credential Registry to be an “Evidence Locker” to store “digital evidence&nbsp;tags”.</p><p>Both of our active agents are rooted in the Sovrin Network. You can resolve their DIDs using these links: BC Registry <a href="https://uniresolver.io/#did=did:sov:HR6vs6GEZ8rHaVgjg2WodM">did:sov:HR6vs6GEZ8rHaVgjg2WodM</a>, and OrgBook BC <a href="https://uniresolver.io/#did=did:sov:NewAUq29E4jLJ5jMSxns3s">did:sov:NewAUq29E4jLJ5jMSxns3s</a>.</p><p>We’re very proud of being one of the first governments to have a DID on the Sovrin Ledger as well as deploy one of the first production use cases of Hyperledger Indy using the Sovrin&nbsp;Network.</p> Sovrin: Describe the open source community as it relates to your&nbsp;work? <p>John: Open source software development is a cornerstone of the Government of British Columbia’s transition to a digitally native government. Open source software allows us to benefit from the globally leading efforts such as Hyperledger Indy and to demonstrate our commitment to public good by sharing&nbsp;code.</p><p>The Sovrin/Hyperledger Indy community has been a huge help in building our understanding of the verifiable credentials model and in the use of Hyperledger Indy. We began by joining the weekly Hyperledger Indy working group calls. I think it was on our second call that we started asking questions and sometimes feeling like we were selfishly taking up community time. Those discussions, combined with our research into self-sovereign identity capabilities soon led us to a vision for what we could create and ultimately, OrgBook&nbsp;BC.</p><p>Since then, we’ve done all of our work in the open, and we’ve done better at driving agendas rather than just hijacking them. All of the software we have developed to realize the vision of VON is open source, and we welcome others to learn from our work, take and use it in their jurisdiction, and ideally, contribute with capabilities that we can&nbsp;use.</p><p>We were helped immensely by a parallel effort in British Columbia called the <a href="https://bcdevexchange.org/">BC Dev Exchange</a> — an ‘open by default’ model for delivering digital services. It’s a program that combines modern approaches to digital service design, Agile development, and DevOps-driven deployment with effective procurement mechanisms.</p><p>The DevExchange platform enabled us to build the capabilities of VON pretty rapidly. We used two “Code With Us” procurements to bring in experts from outside the project for specific deliverables: enterprise-grade agent storage and DID-Authentication capabilities. We were able to subsequently provide those developments back to the community.</p> Sovrin: What is the future of&nbsp;VON? <p>John: We are growing VON in four&nbsp;ways.</p>  First, we are focused on adding British Columbia government services to our own VON ecosystem. We are working with a variety of the permit and licence issuers to help them make use of authentic and authoritative data in OrgBook BC and to issue this data to OrgBook BC using Verifiable Credentials. We’re trying to make that process as easy as possible for our&nbsp;peers.  Second, we are looking for collaborators from other jurisdictions that would like to build on the model we’ve created and deploy their own instance of the Credential Registry component, so they can have an OrgBook for their digital economy. There isn’t an easier way to learn about verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity capabilities than OrgBook, all while bringing real value to businesses.  Third, we are continuing to collaborate in the Sovrin/Hyperledger Indy/Verifiable Credentials communities. Our goal is to make sure that interoperability is achieved across all communities, so our citizens have a choice in the software they use to interact with the Government of British Columbia and with each&nbsp;other.  Finally, we will continue to work on what we think are some new great ideas to help small businesses and small issues such as towns and small cities that will become possible once the verifiable credentials interaction model hits the mainstream.  <p>###</p><p>OrgBook BC uses the Sovrin Network to allow businesses to share verifiable data online in a trustworthy way like never before.

<p>Mike Lodder holds the position of Security Maven for the Sovrin Foundation and is responsible for writing protocols, developing security policies, implementing crypto, and assessing the strength of the Sovrin&nbsp;Network.</p><p>At a recent ‘Brown Bag Meetup’ hosted at <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> headquarters in Provo, Utah, Mike gave a fantastic presentation about Zero Knowledge Proofs. We asked Mike to tell us a bit about his presentation, why Zero Knowledge Proofs are valuable, and how the Sovrin Network uses them to provide identity holders with flexibility and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Q.What is a Zero Knowledge Proof?<br>Mike Lodder: Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic techniques that allow users to share information without relinquishing their security and privacy. ZKPs use cryptography to prove a statement from party A (known as a prover) to party B (known as a verifier) without revealing anything else. Zero-knowledge proofs must have three properties to be&nbsp;usable:</p>  Completeness: If the statement is true, the verifier believes the result of the&nbsp;proof.  Soundness: If the statement is false, the prover is unable to create a false proof to fool a verifier into thinking that it is&nbsp;true.  Zero-knowledgeness: The verifier does not learn any other information about the prover other than what is in the&nbsp;proof.  <p>A classic example is date of birth. Driver’s licenses/ID cards are often the primary means of proving age. However, this type of ID also contains other valuable, private information (such as a person’s home address) that is frequently used in identity theft. Selective disclosure uses ZKPs to turn (for example) a digital copy of a driver’s license into an abstract proof of itself. It’s as if you’re creating a carbon copy of your driver’s license that is every bit as reliable, and conveys the same personal identifiable information, as the real thing; but, based on who is asking, you control what information actually appears to them on that particular copy.</p><p>Using something as simple as a mobile app, you could create a ZKP for each situation where you need to prove your age. ZKP allows you to quickly, easily, and securely verify you are over 18, (or 21 or 65) without actually having to share your specific date of&nbsp;birth.</p><p>Q. How does Sovrin use ZKPs?<br>ML: Companies using the Sovrin Network can issue credentials that identity holders keep in the digital wallet of their choice. Pieces of personal information on that credential, such as an address or social security number, are called “attributes.” ZKPs are created using these attributes. Using the Sovrin Network, identity holders create ZKPs to prove one or more of the following things about their attributes.</p>  Equality: if the attribute is equal to the value or an identity holder can just reveal the attribute itself in the&nbsp;proof  <p>Example: [Are you employed?] = Sovrin ZKP: [Yes] or [Employer: IBM]</p><p>2. Inequality: if an attribute lies in a specific range without revealing the actual value. This is helpful when dealing with something that has a numerical attribute, like age or&nbsp;money.</p><p>Example: [Are you over 21] = Sovrin ZKP: [Age &gt;=&nbsp;21]</p><p>3. Set Membership: ZKPs can prove if a value is contained in a set without revealing with&nbsp;value.</p><p>Example: Do you live in Europe? = Sovrin ZKP: [Country of residence is: a European country] or [Country of residence is: not in a European&nbsp;country]</p><p>Q. Describe ZKP at it’s most basic level?<br>ML: Sure, the developer community often uses the classic Alice and Bob illustration to explain complex user scenarios in real world&nbsp;terms.</p><p>For this example, Alice and Bob want to know if they both make the same salary but don’t want to tell one another exactly how much they make. So, they agree to the following system:</p><p>Alice and Bob take 10 boxes that represent all the possible salaries ranging from $30,000 to $120,000, in increments of&nbsp;$10,000.</p><p>All of the boxes are locked and Alice and Bob can’t open any of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Alice, without Bob looking, chooses the key to the box that corresponds to her salary&nbsp;amount.</p><p>Bob, without Alice looking, puts a piece of paper into each of the boxes that indicates if his salary matches what the box represents or not. He puts an O on a piece of paper into the box matching his salary and an X on a piece of paper in the rest of the boxes. Bob then&nbsp;leaves.</p><p>Alice returns and uses her key to open the box that matches her salary. If the box she opens has a note with an O, Alice knows she has the same salary as Bob. If she sees a note with an X, it means they have different salaries, but has no idea how much Bob actually&nbsp;makes.</p><p>Once they are reunited, Bob only learns that Alice has the same or different salary by seeing if the slip of paper Alice has in her hands has an O or&nbsp;X.</p><p>This system makes it so Alice and Bob cannot learn if one makes more or less money than one&nbsp;another.</p><p>As contrived as this example is, the basic principle remains the same. ZKP allows for the control over individual pieces of private identifying information, with the ability to communicate and share that same information.</p><p>What makes Sovrin’s use of ZKPs unique?<br>The Sovrin Network is the only system that makes it feasible for identity holders to deploy ZKP for all of their verifiable identity claims. With a Sovrin identity, you can generate ZKPs from any of your digital credentials to verify who you are to any verifier operating within the Sovrin Network. Further, you can choose to selectively share different attributes from these identity credentials without showing the credential itself.</p><p>While there are other companies attempting to use ZKP technology, Sovrin was built from the ground up as a global public utility for identity and is proud to have this privacy preserving technology integrated deeply into the network. The Sovrin Network scaled the use of self-sovereign identity and ZKPs so that anyone using Sovrin to manage their credentials can use them to communicate and transact with other people, organizations, and even&nbsp;things.</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/Uf-c4u1usFQ?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Tim Evans</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/mailbox?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p><p>The Sovrin Foundation sponsors brown bag meetups monthly onsite at its offices in Provo, Utah.

 What does it take to be someone, to claim your right to your own unique personal identity? 
<p>World Identity Network co-founder and CEO Dr. Mariana Dahan offers a glimpse of the immense problems linked to lack of personal identity, from the “invisible” children phenomena, to human trafficking and modern slavery. With a fascinating story of her own childhood, Dr. Dahan highlights both the importance of the issue and the thrilling potential for real, impactful change in the coming years. This TEDx Talk outlines implementable ideas about changing the future of identity systems – with powerful cryptography, the blockchain technology and other innovative approaches – and how it will impact us all as humans.</p>
<p></p>
 Widespread inability to prove personal identity drives human trafficking and modern slavery 
<p>Until recently, a vision for the future – where everyone on Earth has access to proof of personal identity, allowing them to claim their human rights and pursue more prosperous, free and healthy lives – was an unattainable goal. Thankfully, a combination of awareness, international will, and technology offers new hope.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Oslo Freedom Forum, by invitation from the Human Rights Foundation, Dr. Dahan explained how the World Identity Network and its partners approach issues like human trafficking and modern slavery, with the lack of recognized proof of identity being at the core of this global epidemic.</p>
<p></p>
 Individuals must control their own identity: a Self-Sovereign Identity 
<p>Advances in unique identification tools and the emergence of distributed ledger technologies are shedding light on new possibilities for fighting the worst crimes against humanity. Old identification models are not working anymore, specifically after the many high-profile security and privacy breaches, where individuals’ personally identifiable data has been exposed and misused.</p>
<p>As a global community, we need to build better, more secure and more human-centric ID systems. And we need to put the individuals in control of their own identity data. This is why at the World Identity Network we promote the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through its global advocacy and partnerships-building work, the World Identity Network aims to ensure that everyone can prove who they are, while maintaining control over their identity data.</p>
 Lack of Access to Identity Fuels the Global Refugee Crisis 
<p>As global migration increases, the number of refugees displaced from their homes has increased to estimates that exceed hundreds of millions. Lacking a proof of identity prevents people from accessing basic human services or taking advantage of the basic rights of a citizen. Many of these victims are children, whose vulnerable state is capitalized on by human traffickers — displaced from their homes, these children fall victim to traffickers every day.</p>

   The “Blockchain for Humanity” Global Challenge was announced by the World Identity Network and United Nations in November of 2017. 
 The post Global Campaign “Blockchain for Humanity” appeared first on World Identity Network.

<p>This open call for ideas and contributions invited companies, academia, civil society and non-governmental organizations to submit their proposals to combat child trafficking using blockchain-based solutions. The proposed solutions were expected to offer a method for securing identity data around a blockchain-based platform, making an immutable record of the actual or attempted transfer across a border of a minor without parental permission. For the Challenge, we limited the focus to Moldova – the poorest country in Europe and a prime source country for victims of human trafficking .</p>
<p>The terms of the Challenge also required proposed solutions to properly identify and address concerns over the privacy of the personally identifiable information (PII). This included a requirement to posit the frameworks that must be in place for digital identity management. The submissions by interested parties were made online, through the United Nations’ <a href="https://uniteideas.spigit.com/blockchain4humanity/Page/Home">UNITE Ideas</a> platform.</p>
<p>As the Challenge organizers, we acknowledge that technology itself cannot magically undo economic, political or cultural hurdles related to human trafficking eradication. There are no illusions that submissions to the Challenge will provide a silver bullet to resolve global human trafficking. What the Challenge does offer is an opportunity for widespread collaboration in leveraging modern technologies, such as the blockchain, to develop a potential solution to a critical element of the problem: a secure access to self-sovereign identities.</p>
<p>This campaign is the first of its kind on a global stage. It has &nbsp;allowed open source developers and the broader blockchain community to become an invaluable resource to the United Nations and its partners in developing innovative, high-impact applications that can accelerate humanitarian responses.&nbsp;Thanks to the launch of this campaign, the United Nations UNITE Ideas platform has also become a much more visible and attractive platform to be used by development partners. With 50,000+ visits from over 170 countries, the platform is now seen by many UN agencies as an innovative way to promote an idea or crowdsource solutions to humanitarian challenges.</p>
<p>The campaign has received global recognition when nominated to the D&amp;AD Impact Awards, which celebrate world-changing ideas, and became a finalist in the most transformational Civic Engagement category.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the campaign has had a practical and tangible impact by causing the launch of the world’s first pilot that uses blockchain to prevent child trafficking, becoming a<a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20180619000115-v5tdh/"> reference case-study</a> for Thomson Reuters Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

Traffic Lab is coordinated by Trafi. The core idea of Traffic Lab Finland is to enable and encourage for new innovations, trials By and active PPP cooperation. Possibiities of MyData are going to be trialled together with Tilaajavastuu. During the pilot the following questions, for example, will be raised: what benefits MyData may bring to an authority, company or a citizen? What MyData means when the customer may have access to the information for different kind of data? We will present a MyData trial between Finnish Transport Safety Agency and Tilaajavastuu, where these questions are being raised. Trafi and Tilaajavastuu will trial together a case where the driving license information and professional qualifications will be integrated to a Taito register by Tilaajavastuu, which allows the employee to a smooth access to the a workplace such as construction area, where the identification is needed in order to enter the area.

<p>“Welcoming IDESG to Kantara is a logical next step as the organizations share a very similar ethos, mission, vision and artefacts,” said Colin Wallis, executive director, Kantara Initiative. “Kantara’s inclusion of IDESG’s valuable assets creates a stronger return on investment made to date by NIST and our working members, at a time when the value of compliance has renewed focus in both the US and internationally especially with the enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work of IDSEG will continue and be operated by the Kantara Initiative with the IDESG brand retained for selected US facing activities.&nbsp; All IDESG members in good standing will automatically become members of Kantara Initiative through to their anniversary with full access to&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/resources/">Kantara resources, workgroups and technical materials</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A representative of the IDESG membership (that has transitioned to Kantara) will join Kantara’s Board of Directors through December 2019 to assist with the settling-in period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kantara was the first external entity to sign a Liaison Agreement back in 2013 with the newly formed IDESG organization. Today’s announcement demonstrates longstanding commonality in vision as noted back in January of this year with the announcement of a&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/kantara-and-idesg-sign-digital-identity-assessment-mou-to-better-protect-consumer-online-identities/">Memorandum of Understanding between the two organizations</a>&nbsp;to drive further adoption of IDESG’s Trust Framework by Kantara’s existing service providers that have been granted a Trust Mark under Kantara’s Trust Framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incorporated in 2012, IDESG is a voluntary, public-private partnership dedicated to developing an Identity Ecosystem Framework (IDEF) and services to better secure online digital identity. After the transition of assets is complete, IDSEG will be dissolved by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“IDESG, through the focused dedication of our committees and leadership, has done a great job creating comprehensive identity rules of the road as well as the vehicle to showcase organizations that proactively play by those rules.&nbsp; This transition is the critical next step for us as we need to take the message to the street and drive the adoption of these great assets in order to achieve the results envisioned when IDESG was formed,” said Mark DiFraia, president IDESG.&nbsp; “We will continue executing IDESG’s mission of growing a healthy and secure online identity ecosystem that is secure/resilient, privacy-enhancing, cost effective/easy to use and interoperable under the leadership, experience, resources and talent of Kantara.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Kantara Initiative</p>
<p>Kantara Initiative comprizes two ethics based, mission-led non-profit organizations incorporated in the US – one a 501 (c)6 industry association, the other a 501 (c) 3 public good charity.&nbsp; A third quite separate organization incorporated in Tallinn, Estonia holds the European license to use the logo mark and operate the services. All three organizations are passionate about giving control of data back to people.</p>

Olivier is a French entrepreneur. He created Onecub in 2011 in order to give personal data back to people. He studied telecommunications before working in big information systems implementation, where he witnessed personal data usage with no user consent on a large scale. 

After a few months in an open data association Olivier decided to start his own startup with the vision of empowering people with their data. He started to join different expert circles in the US and in France and then talked about this vision to French big industry and user groups. 

Then GDPR was voted in 2016 including a new right for data portability and the situation changed for users, as companies now had to rethink their approach. Onecub raised funds and are now working in the booming French and European PIMS (Personal Information Management System) sector. 

Onecub offers a PIMS and is also working on Data Portability commons and standards based on blockchain technology. The vision now is to decentralise personal data management.

<p>We take the Internet for granted, not realizing that such a global, decentralized system is a rare thing. Protocols, rightly, get credit, but they alone are insufficient. TCP/IP did not create the Internet. The Internet is not just a set of protocols, but rather a real thing. People and organizations created the Internet by hooking real hardware and communication lines together. To understand the importance of this, we need to understand what’s necessary to create social systems like the Internet.</p><p>Social systems that are enduring, scalable, and generative require coherence among participants. Coherence allows us to manage complexity. Coherence is necessary for any group of people to cooperate. The coherence necessary to create the Internet came in part from standards, but more from the actions of people who created organizations, established those standards, ran services, and set up exchange&nbsp;points.</p><p>Coherence enables a group of people to operate with one mind about some set of ideas, processes, and outcomes. We only know of a few ways of creating coherence in social systems: tribes, institutions, markets, and networks[1]. Startups, for example, work as tribes. When there’s only a small set of people, a strong leader can clearly communicate ideas and put incentives — and disincentives — in place. Coherence is the result. As companies grow, they become institutions that rely on rules and bureaucracy to establish coherence. While a strong leader is important, institutions are more about the organization than the personalities involved. Tribes and institutions are centralized — someone or some organization is making it all happen. More to the point, institutions rely on hierarchy to achieve coherence.</p><p>Markets are decentralized — specifically they are heterarchical rather than hierarchical. A set of rules, perhaps evolved over time through countless interactions, govern interactions and market participants are incented by market forces driven by economic opportunity to abide by the rules. Competition among private interests (hopefully behaving fairly and freely) allows multiple players with their own agendas to process complex transactions around a diverse set of interests. Markets don’t displace institutions completely but do help institutions process transactional exchanges.</p><p>Networks are also decentralized. The rules of interaction are set in protocol. But, as I said earlier, protocol alone is not enough. Defining a protocol doesn’t string cable or set up routers. There’s something more to it. One form of organization doesn’t usually supplant the previous, but augments it. The Internet is the result of a mix of institutional, market-driven, and network-enabled forces. The Internet has endured and functions because these forces, whether by design or luck, are sufficient to create the coherence necessary to turn the idea of a global, public decentralized communications system into a real network that routes packets from place to&nbsp;place.</p><p>My interest in coherence is driven by efforts to create a global, public, decentralized identity system that we call Sovrin. Sovrin is an identity network that, like the Internet, achieves coherence through a combination of institutional, market-driven, and network-enabled forces. I think of Sovrin as the Internet for Identity. The <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2016/08/an_internet_for_identity.shtml">Sovrin network is not owned by anyone</a>, but, like the Internet, is created through the cooperation of many people and organizations. Sovrin is seeking to create a global, decentralized, identity network that is open to all. That’s a little bit different thing that creating a standard or a protocol.</p><p>When I say Sovrin is “public” I mean that we intend for it to be a public good that anyone can use so long as they adhere to the protocols, just like the Internet. Public spaces require coherence. Coherence in Sovrin springs from the ledger, the protocols, the trust framework, standards, and market incentives. These gives Sovrin greater coherence than a protocol alone can&nbsp;achieve.</p>  The ledger creates a decentralized service where various participants can exchange important information without the need for a central authority. But like the Internet, the ledger requires multiple organizations to commit real resources. The Sovrin ledger is a significant piece of the Sovrin network. The ledger provides a global registry for identifiers. This has several significant advantages over DNS as a registry. DNS-based identifiers aren’t permanently owned. This can present real security concerns. With a ledger, identifiers can be persistent and non-reusable. Second, DNS-based solutions require that every site that wants to run registry functions has to install and maintain software for that purpose. This incents centralization of the directories. With a ledger-based solution, a global network does this without special effort on the part of participants.  The <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/trust-framework/">trust framework</a> is an <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2018/02/decentralized_governance_in_sovrin.shtml">agreement that is administered by the Sovrin Foundation</a>. The trust framework makes shared goals and principles explicit so that the various participants in the system can work together. The trust framework is the basis for shared action and processes.  Standards like those being developed for <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/charter.html">verifiable credentials</a> are important for interoperability, but more so specifications and standards on how to communicate with the ledger and the peer-to-peer communication of agents are critical to portability and the rise of a functional ecosystem of software that isn’t controlled by a single&nbsp;vendor.  Market incentives have traditionally been difficult to incorporate into a networked ecosystem, but the rise of tokens is a recent development that promises to change this. Token-based ledgers come with incentives to participate and thus are self-sustaining in ways that DNS-based identifier registries can’t be. This also alleviates power imbalances where large companies have an advantage relative to individuals. As <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef">Chris Dixon says</a> “Token networks&nbsp;…[align] network participants to work together toward a common goal — the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token.” In short, tokens provide a means for establishing coherence.  <p>Someone asked me recently how Sovrin differed from an identity protocol like OpenID Connect. The factors that give rise to coherence are the primary difference between a protocol like OpenID Connect and something like Sovrin. Simply put, Sovrin is a network and OpenID Connect is not. This is where I think we’ve largely gone wrong in building decentralized systems in the past. We’ve shied away from putting a stake in the ground and building a thing. Instead we’ve defined protocols and allowed the network effects to accrue to centralized companies who can establish the coherence necessary to create a real thing. My strong belief is that real networks are necessary for enduring decentralized systems.</p><p>Endnotes</p><p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cambridgeuniversity-engineering/14050419464">Coherence in chaos</a> from Dhiren Mistry (CC BY&nbsp;2.0)</p><p>Originally published at <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2018/04/coherence_and_decentralized_systems.shtml">www.windley.com</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.sovrin.org/coherence-and-decentralized-systems-31412a00a395">Coherence and Decentralized Systems</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Adrian is trained as an engineer and a physician and his career has been as a medical device entrepreneur. All of his startup products were aimed at the physician-patient relationship. Adrian currently works as an advocate and volunteer CTO of the patient Privacy Rights non-profit continues this passion.

Adrian sees technology and policy in terms of human agency and human dignity. This means that he sees physicians and other licensed clinicians as fiduciaries to their patients and not as employees of some institution. “We need our lawyers and
doctors to be un-conflicted and working only for us”, Adrian says. Adrian sees technology in terms of agency as well: “It needs to be working only for us and be easily substitutable if we find a better match”. True agency implies self-sovereign technology and the substitutability demands that the tech be standards-based.

For Adrian, the MyData community seems like a perfect place to incubate the principles of agency and the standards.

Esko Reinikainen is the Co Founder of The Satori Lab, a Cardiff based startup that helps organisations navigate change. Their primary mission is to learn how to deliver brilliant public services in the connected age and to share what they learn. The change he is most concerned with is the complex transitions required when society undergoes a transformational paradigm shift, in this case from the Information Age to the Connected Age. They are also the hosts of ODI Cardiff, the Open Data Institute’s network node in Wales.

He has been called by turns ‘a heretic’ and ‘a visionary leader with a social conscience’. Over his career he has spent time in the military, as a theatre director, in cultural administration, as a local government officer, and more recently dabbling in various innovation roles and hacking disciplines. 

Drawing on a range of intellectual resources from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA) to Aalto University (Finland) and collaborative practice in international networks, he is developing tools, methods and processes that help organisations undergo radical change. If you need to understand how the confluence of complex adaptive systems, agile development, user centred design, data maturity, culture transformation, and radical innovation matter to the survival of your organisation, you may just want to invite him for lunch...

 Over the past few years we have seen a number of application areas benefit from Schema.org markup. Schema.org discussions have often centered around the importance of ease of use, simplicity and adoption for publishers and webmasters. While those principles will continue to guide our work, it is also important to work to make it easier to consume structured data, by building applications and making more use of the information it carries. We are therefore happy to welcome the new <a href="https://www.datacommons.org/">Data&nbsp;Commons</a> initiative, which is devoted to sharing such datasets, beginning with a corpus of fact check data based on the schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/ClaimReview">ClaimReview markup</a> as adopted by many fact checkers around the world. We expect that this work will benefit the wider ecosystem around structured data by encouraging use and re-use of schema.org related datasets.

<p>by Phillip J. Windley, Ph.D., Chair, Sovrin Foundation</p><p>In <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2018/02/decentralized_governance_in_sovrin.shtml">Decentralized Governance in Sovrin</a>, I described how the Sovrin Network is governed. The centerpiece of that discussion is the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/trust-framework/">Sovrin Trust Framework</a>. The trust framework serves as the constitution for Sovrin, laying out the principles upon which Sovrin is governed and the specific requirements for various players in the Sovrin Ecosystem.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">A Universal Trust Framework</a>, I say “a trust framework provides the structure necessary to leap between the known and unknown.” The idea is that online we often lack the necessary context to reduce the risk around the decisions we make. A trust framework defines that context using agreement, process, and technology so that people can make decisions with significantly less&nbsp;risk.</p><p>In this post, I want to talk about how organizations can use the Sovrin Network as a trustworthy infrastructure for creating businesses or processes that require strangers to trust one another. This happens by building domain-specific trust frameworks on top of&nbsp;Sovrin.</p> Exchanging Claims and&nbsp;Proofs <p>Let’s begin by reviewing Sovrin-based credentials and how they are&nbsp;used.</p><p>Issuers issue and identity owners accept Sovrin credentials that are based on emerging <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/">Verifiable Claims standards</a>. Identity owners store these credentials in their digital wallet. A credential consists of a set of claims. Identity owners present proofs based on those credentials to verifiers. Proofs can be about any assertions in the credentials the identity owner&nbsp;holds.</p><p>The preceding figure shows how this might work in a specific use case. Suppose your employer is using Sovrin. They issue a Sovrin credential that includes claims about your employment status and current salary. The credential includes a reference to a credential definition (on the Sovrin ledger) that contains your employer’s public <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">decentralized identifier, or DID</a>, (also on the Sovrin ledger) and a reference to a schema (also on the Sovrin ledger) that describes the claims in the credential. The credential is signed by your employer, using their public DID. You store that credential in your Sovrin&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Later, you apply to your bank for a loan. Before the bank processes the loan, you need to prove to them that you’re employed and that you make at least $75,000 per year. Using your Sovrin wallet[1], you are able to prove what the bank needs to know without revealing your actual salary or any other claims that might be in the credential your employer provided. The proof process also ensures, through countersigning, that the bank sees these proofs based on their DID for you even though the credential was issued to you by your employer based on the DID they have for&nbsp;you[2].</p><p>Of course, your wallet also holds other credentials from other issuers. For example, you might have a credential from your bank that you can use to prove your account information to your employer or any other&nbsp;party.</p><p>The beauty of this approach is that verifiers never need to contact issuers to verify the assertions or understand how they’re formatted. Anything they need to use to verify the credential is on the ledger. This results in immense benefits for scalability and reliability[3].</p> What Sovrin&nbsp;Promises <p>The preceding example credential exchange shows how the credential-supported proof provides trustworthy attributes to the bank. But it’s worth teasing that apart and determining why the attributes can be trusted. Let’s start with what Sovrin is promising with respect to the credential that is being issued and the proof that is based on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Sovrin’s promise is based on the Sovrin Trust Framework. As I pointed out in <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2018/02/decentralized_governance_in_sovrin.shtml">Decentralized Governance in Sovrin</a>, the framework governs the operation of the network and the code that it runs&nbsp;on.</p><p>Sovrin promises the following:</p>  The DIDs can be resolved using the Sovrin ledger and the resulting DID document that can contain a public key and an endpoint associated with that&nbsp;DID.  The schema can be retrieved from the Sovrin ledger and hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with.  The definition for the credential can can retrieved from the ledger and hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with.  The credential can be validated as not having been tampered&nbsp;with.  The credential was given to the identity owner with whom the employer has a relationship.  The proof is about the identity owner with whom the bank has a relationship.  The identity owner who presents the proof is the same person to whom the credential was issued[4].  The credential has not been revoked by the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>The Sovrin Trust Framework is a general-purpose or <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2017/01/a_universal_trust_framework.shtml">universal trust framework</a> that is meant to provide a set of universal features that form the foundation for trust transactions. The preceding list of Sovrin promises are all part of that trust framework. They are shored up by legal documents, business processes, and technology.</p> What Sovrin Does Not&nbsp;Promise <p>The promises made by Sovrin are important and foundational. But what the bank really wants to know is “are you employed?” That requires promises that Sovrin can’t&nbsp;make:</p>  The identity owner is a real&nbsp;person.  The employer is a real business.  The bank is a real&nbsp;bank.  The identity owner is employed by the employer.  The salary figure comes from the employer.  <p>If Sovrin doesn’t keep its promises, then the bank can’t trust anything. But even if Sovrin runs perfectly, the bank is still short of the assurances it needs to make decisions. That’s where domain-specific trust frameworks come&nbsp;in.</p> Domain-Specific Trust Frameworks <p>A domain-specific trust framework works on top of the Sovrin trust framework and contains the technology, business processes, and legal agreements necessary to trust the content of the claim. For example, in the scenario above, a domain-specific trust framework would enable the bank to trust the proof that you’re employed.</p><p>Let’s walk through each of the promises Sovrin can’t make and discuss who can make them and&nbsp;how.</p> You Are a Real&nbsp;Person <p>The bank knows you’re a real person because they have a relationship with you, memorialized by the exchange of Sovrin DIDs. As part of their new customer process, they performed a Know Your Customer (KYC) process as mandated by law. They associate the results of that with the DID you gave them to represent you. So when you contact them with that DID, they know the account belongs to a real&nbsp;person.</p> Your Employer is a Real&nbsp;Business <p>Knowing the employer is a real business is a little harder. Even if the bank knows the employer by name, how do they know that the credential was issued from that entity. As I pointed out in <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2017/05/sovrin_web_of_trust.shtml">Sovrin Web of Trust</a>, there are several&nbsp;options:</p>  The employer could publish their public DID (the one associated with the claim definition that underlies the employment verification) on their Web site or some other well known place so that it is easy to verify. This method takes you out of the Sovrin system and into the hierarchical public key infrastructure since you’d verify the website using a standard SSL certificate from a traditional certificate authority.  They could offer supporting claims that show they are a legitimate business. These claims would come from what are called trust anchors in Sovrin, trusted entities who can prove who they are based on others who vouch for them. For example, the government, acting as a trust anchor, could provide claims to registered businesses. The <a href="https://von.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/whats-next-theorgbook/">Government of British Columbia is piloting this</a> right&nbsp;now.  The preceding two steps could be used together in a hybrid verification. <a href="https://infocert.digital/">InfoCert</a>, that largest European cerificate authority, is already a Sovrin Steward and could issue a Sovrin credential to go along with the TLS certificate the issue to the employer. This Sovrin credential would be backed up by the same process they use to verify the business as part of issuing the TLS certificate.  <p>Businesses often have credentials from others that are part of their web of trust — think of all the “Chamber of Commerce” decals you see on the windows of local shops. The employer would have credentials from numerous government agencies, business partners, and trade associations that could all be used to back up the credentials they&nbsp;issue.</p> The Bank is a Real&nbsp;Bank <p>The person knows the bank is a real bank for the same reason the bank knows the person is real: the DID exchange. One of the important and often overlooked benefits of a DID exchange is that both sides can authenticate the other. Mutually authenticated connections are the default in Sovrin and one of its most powerful features. This is in contrast to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, which has been a one-sided affair in practice.</p><p>In our example, the bank is verifying the credential, so it obviously knows that it’s a real bank, but the identity owner want to know it’s real when they open an account. If they did it physically, then they know of themselves, but if they enrolled online, they might have questions. The bank could be validated in the same way as the employer. For example, in the US, financial institutions are certified by different government institutions depending on whether they’re national banks, state-chartered banks, or credit unions. In any case, these certifying agencies could issue credentials to the institution that could be checked by the customer (using their wallet) as part of the enrollment process or at any other&nbsp;time.</p> You are Employed by the Employer and Have a Certain&nbsp;Salary <p>The credential itself is making the claim that you are employed by the employer and that the salary is a certain amount. Sovrin links all this up, but the bank would need to validate the claim schema and definition and understand what it means. This validation process would be internal to the&nbsp;bank.</p><p>In Sovrin, the schema is a document that is written to the ledger. Think of it as the description of what fields the schema contains and what the fields mean. The schema is readable and understandable by anyone — they are public documents.</p><p>Schemas can be reused. Ideally the schema is not specific to the employer, but is used by many employers for employment verification. An industry trade group or a large vendor of ERP systems might, for example, author the schema with inputs from many parties. Doing so would ensure that a wide range of organizations understand and recognize it. The schema becomes a standard, de facto or de jure, for employment verification.</p><p>I believe that there will be a relatively rapid agreement on schemas, reinforced by trust frameworks, in many fields. But this does not preclude anyone from creating any schema they want whenever they want for their own purposes.</p><p>Claim schema are automatically versioned. When a new schema is created, the original schema doesn’t go away, so credentials issued with the old schema can still be used. Credentials issued with the new schema refer to that new schema and not the old&nbsp;one.</p><p>The claim definition references a claim schema and is written to the ledger by a specific entity. In our example, the employer writes a claim definition that references the schema and includes its public&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Depending on the use case, an industry group might do more than merely publish the schema. They might also create standards around how the schema is to be used. These standards would be enforced by legal contract and required business processes with compliance attested to by claims from the standards group to any organization creating claim definitions that use the schema. That way claim inspectors could know that the claim was created in accordance with an accepted process, increasing trust in the claim. How would they know? By means of a Sovrin credential from the standards group, of&nbsp;course.</p> Sovrin’s Role in Subject Specific Trust Frameworks <p>A domain-specific trust framework is a collection of policies, legal agreements and technologies that provides the context for claims in a given domain. Sovrin Foundation provides a structure and supporting systems for groups defining trust frameworks.</p><p>Sovrin works as a globally decentralized dictionary for schema definitions, with no central authority dictating what schemas, definitions, and claims can or can’t be issued. This makes it uniquely flexible. Anyone can issue credentials about anything, enabling the “long tail” of use cases to be easily addressed.</p><p>Sovrin Foundation provides the basis for the Sovrin web of trust. As discussed in the Sovrin Trust Framework, Sovrin Trustees provide the foundation for this web of trust. They select Stewards who validate transactions on the Sovrin ledger[5]. Stewards can vouch for others. Anyone using the Sovrin network is part of this general web of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Beyond this general web of trust, domain-specific trust frameworks can determine their own web of trust. This already happens in the physical world. For example, colleges and universities in the US are accredited by independent organizations. Brigham Young University, where I work, is <a href="https://is.byu.edu/site/about/accreditation.cfm">accredited</a> by the <a href="http://www.nwccu.org/">Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities</a>. They already have a process for accrediting member organizations. They could simply rely on that process and any attendant legal agreements to issue and revoke Sovrin credentials that reflect their determinations concerning the accredidation status of member institutions.</p><p>Other uses of Sovrin may not have a physical world counterpart. For example, suppose you wanted to start a decentralized version of AirBnB. One of the roles that AirBnB plays is identifying and attesting to certain attributes for renters and hosts. A decentralized AirBnB may want to establish a process for vetting renters and hosts and issue and revoke claims in accordance with that process. This decentralized AirBnB might define and include claim insurance for both renters and hosts in the event the process breaks down. The processes that define how vetting works, the legal agreements that hold parties to the processes, and the provisions for recourse and restitution via insurance are all part of the domain-specific trust framework for this ecosystem.</p><p>For anyone wishing to build domain-specific trust frameworks for an existing or planned business, Sovrin Foundation can help with technical advice about schema and claim definitions as well advice on how to go about creating and governing the legal agreements and business processes necessary to create environments where trust&nbsp;abounds.</p> Endnotes   A wallet in Sovrin is an agent that holds credentials on behalf of the identity owner and speaks the Sovrin agent-to-agent protocol.  Your employer and bank have a different DID for you to prevent correlation.  Specifically, issuers do not need to maintain always-on infrastructure to answer questions about credential validity and credential transactions are done peer-to-peer.  Technically it could also be presented by the identity owner’s guardian if the identity owner is in a guardian relationship. But the Trust Framework considers that to be the same as the identity owner presenting it&nbsp;themself  When Stewards “validate” a transaction, they are merely achieving consensus with other Stewards about the validity of the transaction, not it’s content. Stewards aren’t making judgments about the assertions inside of any transaction on&nbsp;Sovrin.  <p>Photo Credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kazk/198640938">Framework</a> from kaz z (CC BY&nbsp;2.0)</p><p>Originally published at <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2018/03/building_your_business_on_sovrin_domain-specific_trust_frameworks.shtml">www.windley.com</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.sovrin.org/building-your-business-on-sovrin-domain-specific-trust-frameworks-8ebbce28d58f">Building Your Business on Sovrin: Domain-Specific Trust Frameworks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Centralized systems are often governed in an ad hoc way because the central point of control can easily tell all participants what to do. Decentralized systems, on the other hand, must coordinate across multiple parties, all acting independently in their own self-interest. This means that the rules of engagement and interaction must be spelled out and agreed to ahead of time, with incentives, disincentives, consequences, processes, and procedures made&nbsp;clear.</p><p>The Internet is an excellent example of this. All the computers that connect to the Internet, along with those that route messages between nodes, follow a set of procedures determined ahead of time that cannot be ignored by participants without loss of functionality. These procedures are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">protocols</a> and they are embodied in the code that participants in the network — both edge nodes and routers — execute.</p><p>Blockchain systems are no different. Their interactions are wholly or partially governed by protocols embodied in code. But these protocols are not emergent properties of the blockchain, rather they are designed by humans who write the code and agreed to by the humans who execute it. Without the design and agreement of humans, the blockchain does not function.</p><p>The Sovrin blockchain is a good example. There are two primary components of how Sovrin operates: the design of the protocols and the operation of the ledger. We can ask governance questions about&nbsp;each.</p><p>Sovrin’s code is open source — specifically it is the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk">Hyperledger Indy</a> project under the umbrella of the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>. This means developers from around the world collaborate to design and build the code that makes Sovrin work. Their decisions are governed in the way of most open source projects: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus">rough consensus and running code</a> with pull requests accepted by a core set of developers who manage the code base. Code embodies the rules that make up the Sovrin protocol. Since the protocol is a critical component of Sovrin governance, how decisions are made about the code is a key component of ensuring Sovrin is governed&nbsp;well.</p><p>But with the Sovrin blockchain there is another kind of governance that is not embodied in the code. Sovrin is built on a public permissioned blockchain. This means that anyone can use the Sovrin ledger, but consensus is achieved by a known set of validator nodes. Validators perform a similar function on a permissioned ledger than miners perform on a permissionless ledger — ensuring that each copy of the ledger records the same data in the same order1. Since Sovrin’s validators are part of a known group, we should also examine how this group of validators is selected, organized, and governed.</p><p>Decisions about how code is architected, which code is run by validator nodes, and how those nodes operate are made in accordance with the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/trust-framework/">Sovrin Trust Framework</a>, a document that specifies how the Sovrin Network is governed. The Trust Framework is Sovrin’s constitution, defining the operation and organization of the network, and is where the final authority for the Sovrin Network lies. In fact, Sovrin can be said to have a constitutional governance model. The <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> is an international, non-profit organization that represents the collective interests of all Sovrin identity owners. Sovrin Foundation exists to administer the Trust Framework. The Sovrin Foundation clearly and openly identifies the actors in decisions and the processes they use to reach those decisions and ensures they are made consistent with the trust framework.</p><p>Sovrin’s Trust Framework is based on a set of shared goals consistent with establishing a global public utility for privacy-respecting, self-sovereign identity. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Many-VISA-Chaordic-Organization/dp/1576753328/windleyofente-20">One from Many: VISA and the Rise of the Chaordic Organization</a>, Dee Hock&nbsp;writes:</p><blockquote>In the constructive sense of the word, governance can be based only on clarity of shared intent and trust in expected behavior, heavily seasoned with common sense, tolerance, and caring for others as fellow human beings. This is not to say that contracts, laws, and regulations do not serve a purpose. Rather it is to point out that they can never achieve the mechanistic certainty and control we crave. Rules and regulations, laws and contracts, can never replace clarity of shared purpose and clear, deeply held principles about conduct in pursuit of that&nbsp;purpose.</blockquote><p>In the case of Sovrin, that shared purpose and deeply held principles are contained in the Sovrin Trust Framework. The Trust Framework lays out the purpose of Sovrin as providing a global public utility for self-sovereign identity that adheres to a set of thirteen principles2:</p>  Independence and Self-Sovereignty  Guardianship  Diffuse Trust  Web of&nbsp;Trust  System Diversity  Interoperability  Portability  Security by&nbsp;Design  Privacy by&nbsp;Design  Accountability  Openness  Identity for&nbsp;All  Collective Best&nbsp;Interest  <p>Sovrin embraced these principles to meet the needs of identity owners and protect their data, privacy, and autonomy. These principles guide both the technical development of the Sovrin code and the operational rules for stewards, the trusted organizations who operate validator nodes and connect to the ledger in a transparent way.</p><p>Some have pointed to the permissioned structure and the existence of the foundation as a reason for distrusting whether it is truly a decentralized public network. To those people I say, “Look at the Trust Framework and tell me where it falls short.” Often this question is just a knee-jerk reaction to how Sovrin splits governance between code and agreement. There’s nothing magic about code when it comes to governance. It can automate things but it has no special properties when it comes to resisting accumulation of power or autocratic tendencies. Even in permissionless blockchains, change is proposed by the developers and accepted (or not) by miners. These are people coming to agreement or not based on the principles they hold&nbsp;dear.</p><p>Sovrin’s Trust Framework makes those principles explicit by providing a documented public agreement (consensus) about them. The <a href="http://forum.sovrin.org/c/working-groups/trust-framework">process for amending Sovrin’s Trust Framework</a> is also public. The stewards running validator nodes agree (or not) by accepting or rejecting changes. This is the same process we (and other public blockchains) use for managing code changes. It ensures that Sovrin continues to be public and open to all. There is no point of centralization in Sovrin because no single entity can force other participants to bend to that entity’s will. Sovrin is technically, politically, and geographically decentralized to achieve diffuse trust, which enables diffuse&nbsp;control.</p><p>Others might wonder how the Trust Framework governs the code that Sovrin runs. While it’s true that Sovrin code is open source and anyone can make contributions, those contributions still have to be accepted by the maintainers of Project Indy to be incorporated in the codebase. Further, the Indy code is not automatically transferred to Sovrin validators to run, but is subject to review by Sovrin’s Technical Governance board and the Stewards themselves.</p><p>Those reviews ensure that only code consistent with the Trust Framework is run by validator nodes. These reviews also put appropriate pressure on Project Indy contributors and maintainers to adhere to Sovrin Trust Framework principles, since not doing so could lead to a fork of the project (although not the ledger), with Sovrin developing its own branch of the Indy codebase to protect its interests. Recent events in the blockchain space show that this is not inconceivable, but it would be disruptive and costly to the ultimate success of Project Indy. This neatly aligns incentives between Project Indy and Sovrin. Make no mistake; Sovrin will take decisive action if our principles are threatened.</p><p>Participation in Sovrin is open to all. As I wrote in <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2017/09/is_sovrin_decentralized.shtml">Is Sovrin Decentralized?</a>: anyone can create identifiers. Sovrin does not have “identity providers” because they are entirely unnecessary; identity owners are empowered to carry their own claims. Furthermore, any organization who will publicly agree to the Trust Framework and meets its requirements is welcome to become a Sovrin&nbsp;Steward.</p><p>This is the ultimate point: no single entity owns or controls Sovrin, not even the Sovrin Foundation. The Sovrin network is a global public utility that we all own, collectively, just like we all own the Internet. And the governance model of the Trust Framework, along with governance of the open source Hyperledger Indy code run by all Sovrin stewards, has been carefully designed to reflect this. All of this is captured in the Sovrin Trust Framework which is developed and published under an open public process available to&nbsp;all.</p><p>The public and open nature of Sovrin supports an unprecedented level of autonomy, privacy, security, and control by the people and organizations using Sovrin. We welcome <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2017/09/is_sovrin_decentralized.shtml">you and your organization to join us</a> in this important work.</p><p>Endnotes:</p>  There are many reasons for using a permissioned model, as spelled out in the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-protocol-and-token-white-paper">recent Sovrin Foundation white paper</a>, but one of the most important is cost. Simply put, if the cost of using a ledger can be kept very low, then it will enable people to use a different cryptographic identifier for each relationship, thus <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2017/09/equifax_and_correlatable_identifiers.shtml">reducing correlation risk and increasing privacy</a>. Any blockchain-based identity system must be carefully architected to take advantage of the blockchain without sacrificing the privacy of the participants in the system. If writing transactions to the blockchain is expensive, as it typically is in permissionless ledgers, people are more likely to reuse identifiers (or hashes) and increase the risk of unwanted correlations.  See Section 2 of the Trust Framework for a detailed discussion of these principles.  <p>Thanks to Steve Fulling, Drummond Reed, Timothy Ruff, Jason Law, and Daniel Hardman for helpful discussions on this topic that improved the post and made it more&nbsp;clear.</p><p>Photo Credit: <a href="http://phil.windley.org/">Bees and Honeycomb</a> from Phil Windley&nbsp;(CC0)</p><p>Originally published at <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2018/02/decentralized_governance_in_sovrin.shtml">www.windley.com</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.sovrin.org/decentralized-governance-in-sovrin-be427ca3fe51">Decentralized Governance in Sovrin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>I’m very pleased to announce that the <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-protocol-and-token-white-paper/">Sovrin whitepaper is now available</a>. The whitepaper pulls together in one place detailed information about why Sovrin exists, what Sovrin is, and how it will impact nearly every aspect of your online life. Here’s the abstract:</p><blockquote>Digital identity is one of the oldest and hardest problems on the Internet. There is still no way to use digital credentials to prove our online identity the same way we do in the offline world. This is finally changing. First, the World Wide Web Consortium is standardizing the format of digitally-signed credentials. Secondly, public blockchains can provide decentralized registration and discovery of the public keys needed to verify digital signatures. These two steps pave the way to establish a global public utility for self-sovereign identity — lifetime portable digital identity that does not depend on any central authority and can never be taken&nbsp;away.</blockquote><blockquote>The Sovrin Network has been designed exclusively for this purpose, including governance (the Sovrin Foundation and the Sovrin Trust Framework), scalability (validator and observer nodes and state proofs), and accessibility (minimal cost and maximum availability). Most importantly, Sovrin implements Privacy by Design on a global scale, including pairwise pseudonymous identifiers, peer-to-peer private agents, and selective disclosure of personal data using zero-knowledge proof cryptography.</blockquote><blockquote>The emergence of this infrastructure can transform at least four major markets: identity and access management, cybersecurity, RegTech, and data integration. To provide economic incentives for credential issuers, owners, and verifiers, the Sovrin protocol will incorporate a digital token designed expressly for privacy-preserving value exchange. The Sovrin token should enable a global marketplace for digital credentials of all types and value levels together with ancillary markets for digital credential insurance and permissioned, first-party data (direct from the customer).</blockquote><p>As you can see, Sovrin will incorporate a native token for exchanging value in identity transactions. We’re confident that a protocol token for Sovrin will enable use cases that would be unrealizable without it and drive the network effects for Sovrin adoption.</p><p>The whitepaper has been a long time coming. We wanted to get it right and make it as clear and understandable as possible. I’m grateful for my co-managing editor <a href="https://equalsdrummond.name/">Drummond Reed</a>, a member of the Sovrin Board of Trustees and chair of the Trust Framework working group for his diligent efforts in making this a reality. Countless others participated in discussions, made comments, or proofread various versions of the document. And a special thanks to Monique Heileson for her fine work on graphic design, layout, and illustration.</p><p>Internet identity has become synonymous with authentication and that’s too bad. Identity in real life is much richer, flexibly and conveniently solving all kinds of thorny problems. Now with Sovrin, we can bring those rich identity transactions online. This paper shows how that happens and why it will impact every sector of the Internet in significant ways. I hope you’ll spend some time reading&nbsp;it.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2018/01/announcing_the_sovrin_whitepaper.shtml">www.windley.com</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.sovrin.org/announcing-the-sovrin-whitepaper-4bcb80bd9fdd">Announcing the Sovrin Whitepaper</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>by Judd&nbsp;Bagley</p><p>The <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> announced today the addition of Canada’s <a href="http://www.atb.com">ATB Financial</a> as a founding steward. A recognized trailblazer in the bank innovation space, last year ATB Financial successfully sent one of the <a href="https://news.sap.com/atb-financial-sends-one-of-the-worlds-first-real-time-payments-from-canada-to-germany-using-blockchain-technology-supported-by-sap/">world’s first real-time international payments using blockchain technology</a>, supported by&nbsp;SAP.</p><p>As a Sovrin steward, ATB will be an active contributor of intellectual and infrastructure resources. This includes dedicating hardware, security and network capacity to assist in the operation of the Sovrin identity network, which uses distributed ledger technology to provide the Internet with a long-missing identity&nbsp;layer.</p><p>“The addition of ATB as a Sovrin steward is a significant event in the development of this technology,” said Dr. Phil Windley, chairman of the Sovrin Foundation. “Earning the confidence of an organization so focused on innovation in support of the customer means we must be doing something right.”</p><p>“ATB plans to be a global leader within the blockchain space, and seeking out like-minded partners is a key strategy to get us there,” said ATB Chief Transformation Officer Wellington Holbrook. “Giving Albertans the option to control their online identity through blockchain technology is an opportunity to go beyond everyday banking to make people’s lives better. Working with the Sovrin Foundation puts us in a position to make rapid progression, allowing ATB to be amongst the first to provide this ability to our customers.”</p><p>ATB’s position at the forefront of blockchain innovation is driven in large part through the financial institution’s Transformation team, where investigations into distributed ledger technology — commonly referred to as blockchains — are an important area of focus. And there is good reason for ATB’s commitment to blockchain. <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/09/28/blockchain-banks-2017/">IBM reports</a> that within four years, 66% percent of banks expect to have blockchain in commercial production and at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>“There is no emerging technology with greater capacity to improve the processes and outcomes of the services we provide our 730,000 Albertan customers.” said Director of Innovation, Michael Brown. “Our size, transformation focus and innovation culture make us ideally suited to exploring these opportunities early, and scaling them rapidly. We’re excited to help the Sovrin network&nbsp;grow.”</p><p>Sovrin is a global public utility built to provide users — including individuals, organizations, and connected devices — with self-sovereign identity. Sovrin is the only identity solution with a distributed ledger purpose-built for self-sovereign identity at its core. ATB is one of several organizations spanning a diverse cross-section of organizations whose responsibility it is to ensure the network is available, public, and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>The aim of the Sovrin network is to enable trusted transactions by providing every entity operating on the Internet with true ‘self-sovereign identity’, which refers to a digital identity that is permanent, secure, portable, private and completely trustworthy. Stewards are governed by the Sovrin Foundation’s constitutional <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SovrinProvisionalTrustFramework2017-03-22.pdf">Trust Framework</a> within which the ‘diffused trust model’, seeks to prevent undue influence over the network from any single organization.</p><p>About the Sovrin Foundation</p><p>The international, non-profit<a href="https://www.sovrin.org/"> Sovrin Foundation</a> is governed by a constitutional Trust Framework that ensures its independence from government or industry influence and codifies its dedication to providing self-sovereign digital identity for all. The Sovrin network is operated by independent stewards and uses the power of a hybrid distributed ledger as a fast, private and secure framework for providing every person, organization, and connected device a permanent identity with which to transact online and operate securely in everyday life.

 Schema.org 3.3 has been <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.3">released</a>. As always, the release was prepared, debated and finalized by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">schema.org community group</a>, and features a range of additions, adjustments, bugfixes and clarifications to improve the expressiveness and usability of our schemas.<br><br><br> See the <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.3">release notes</a> for full details, but of particular note are some changes made around the NewsArticle type (in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.thetrustproject.org/">Trust Project</a>&nbsp;on whose work this is largely based). For many years, our definition of NewsArticle was simply "a news article". With this release we add (via our "pending" mechanism) some more subtlety around <a href="http://schema.org/docs/news.html">News</a>, making it possible to mark-up categories of news including opinion pieces, background articles, reportage, as well as as also introducing types for satirical and advertiser content. We also <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1525">add</a> properties that encourage greater transparency around News creation and publication. These are flagged as "pending" to emphasize that early adopter feedback on the new vocabulary is particularly welcomed, via <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues">Github</a>, the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">group</a>, or the site's&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/docs/feedback.html">feedback form</a>. These developments complement our earlier work to support interoperability amongst fact-checking sites via the <a href="http://schema.org/ClaimReview">ClaimReview</a> type. Following discussion at <a href="http://about.poynter.org/node/102080">GlobalFact4 conference</a>, we have also <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1687">amended</a> the definition of the "<a href="http://schema.org/expires">expires</a>" to highlight its applicability to fact checking content.  <br>  Other highlights of 3.3 include new terminology (also pending implementor feedback) for describing <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1156">legislation</a>, based on the&nbsp;<a href="http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/eli/">European Legislation Identifier (ELI) ontology</a>&nbsp;and the work of the&nbsp;<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli-register/about.html">ELI taskforce</a>. We have also added an overview page giving more details on our <a href="http://schema.org/docs/financial.html">finance</a>-related terminology, contributed by the FIBO community, alongside a proposed design for describing <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1457">schedules</a>, new subtypes distinguishing user from critic reviews, and a generalization of our recipes schema called "<a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g647">HowTo</a>" for recipe-like tasks that don't result in food. We've also added types for <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1459">TouristAttraction</a> and for <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g1624">PublicToilet</a>...

This update brings many improvements including new vocabulary for describing courses, fact-check <a href="http://schema.org/ClaimReview">reviews</a>, digital publishing accessibility, as well as a more thorough treatment of menus and a large number of pending proposals which are offered for early-access use, evaluation and improvement. We also introduce a new "hosted extension" area, <a href="http://iot.schema.org/">iot.schema.org</a>&nbsp;which provides an entry point for schema collaborations relating to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">Internet of Things</a> field. As always, our&nbsp;<a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.2">releases page</a> has full details.<br><br>These efforts depend entirely on a growing network of collaborations, within <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg">our own</a> W3C Community Group and beyond. Many thanks are due to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schema-course-extend/">Schema Course Extension</a> Community Group, the <a href="http://idpf.org/">IDPF</a>'s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility.html">Epub Accessibility</a>&nbsp;Working Group, members of the international <a href="https://www.poynter.org/about-the-international-fact-checking-network/">fact-checking network</a> including the <a href="http://reporterslab.org/">Duke Reporters Lab</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://fullfact.org/">Full Fact</a>, the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/Main_Page">Spatial Web</a> initiatives, the <a href="http://bioschemas.org/">Bioschemas</a> project, and to Wikipedia's <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a> project.<br><br>This release also provides the opportunity to thank two of our longest-serving <a href="http://schema.org/docs/about.html">steering group</a> members, whose careers have moved on from the world of structured data markup. Peter Mika and Martin Hepp have both played leading roles in Schema.org since its earliest days, and the project has benefited greatly from their insight, commitment and attention to detail.<br><br>As we look towards future developments, it is worth taking a brief recap on how we have organized things recently. Schema.org's primary discussion forum is a W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">group</a>, although its most detailed collaborations are typically in <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/">Github</a>, organized around specific <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues">issues</a> and proposed changes. These discussions are open to all interested parties. Schema designs frequently draw upon related groups that have a more specific topical focus. For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schema-course-extend/">Courses</a> group became a hub for education/learning metadata experts from <a href="http://lrmi.dublincore.net/">LRMI</a> and others. This need to engage with relevant experts also motivated the creation of the "<a href="http://pending.schema.org/">pending</a>" area <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2016/08/schemaorg-update-hotels-datasets-health.html">introduced</a> in our <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.1">previous</a> release. Github is a site oriented towards computer programmers. By surfacing proposed, experimental and other early access designs at <a href="http://pending.schema.org/">pending.schema.org</a> we hope we can reach a wider audience who may have insight to share. With today's <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html">release</a>, we add 14 new "pending" designs, with courses, accessibility and fact-checking markup graduating from <a href="http://pending.schema.org/">pending</a> into the core section of schema.org. Future releases will follow this pipeline approach, encouraging greater consistency, quality and clarity as our vocabulary continues to evolve.<br><br><br><br>

Many thanks&nbsp;to everyone in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">community</a> who has contributed to this update, which includes substantial new vocabulary for describing <a href="http://schema.org/docs/hotels.html">hotels and accommodation</a>, some improvements around dataset description, as well as the usual collection of new examples, bugfixes, usability, infrastructural, standards compatibility and conceptual consistency improvements.<br><br>This release builds upon the recent&nbsp;<a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.0">3.0 release</a>. In version 3.0 we created a <a href="http://health-lifesci.schema.org/">health-lifesci</a> extension as a new home for the extensive collection of medical/health terms that were <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2012/06/health-and-medical-vocabulary-for.html">introduced</a> back in 2012. Publishers and webmasters do not need to update their markup for this change, it is best considered an improvement to the structure of our documentation. Our <a href="http://schema.org/docs/extension.html">extension</a> system allows us to provide deeper coverage of specialist topics without cluttering the core project pages. Version 3.0 also included some <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#g969">improvements</a> from the <a href="http://www.edmcouncil.org/fiboschema">FIBO project</a>, improving our representation of various financial products.<br><br>We have also introduced a special extension called "<a href="http://pending.schema.org/">pending</a>", which provides a place for newly proposed schema.org terms to be documented, tested and revised. We hope that this will help schema proposals get wider visibility and review, supporting greater participation from non-developer collaborators. You should not need to be a computer programmer to be part of our project, and "pending" is one step towards making work-in-progress schema proposals more visible without requiring knowledge of highly technical systems like <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/">GitHub</a>. We have linked each term in <a href="http://pending.schema.org/">pending.schema.org</a> to the technical discussions at Github, but also to a simple feedback form. We anticipate updating the "pending" area relatively frequently, in between formal releases.<br><br>The site also features a new "<a href="http://schema.org/docs/howwework.html">how we work</a>" document, oriented towards the Web standards community and toolmakers, explaining the evolving process we have adopted towards creating new and improved schemas. See also commentary on this in the UK government technology blog post about <a href="https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/18/making-job-adverts-more-open/">making job adverts more open</a> with schema.org.<br><br>Many people were involved in these updates, but particular thanks are due to Martin Hepp for leading the hotels/accommodation design, and to&nbsp;Marc Twagirumukiza for chairing the "<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemed/">schemed</a>" W3C community group that led the creation of our new <a href="http://health-lifesci.schema.org/">health-lifesci</a> extension.<br><br>Finally, we would like to dedicate this release to Peter Mika, who has served on our <a href="http://schema.org/docs/about.html">steering group</a> since the early days. Peter has stepped down as Yahoo's representative, passing his duties to Nicolas Torzec. Thanks, Peter! Welcome, Nicolas...<br><br>For more details on version 3.1 of schema.org, check out the <a href="http://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v3.1">release notes</a>

    Since our version 2.0 release, schema.org is putting increasing emphasis on extensions created through a broad network of community collaborations. Today we celebrate an important milestone in the development of this extensions framework: GS1 have published an initial release of their Web vocabulary.

 <br>Since our <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2015/05/schema.html">version 2.0 release</a>, schema.org is putting increasing emphasis on <a href="http://schema.org/docs/extension.html">extensions</a> created through a broad network of community collaborations. Today we celebrate an important milestone in the development of this extensions framework: <a href="http://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a> have published an initial release of their Web vocabulary. An&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gs1.org/gs1-smartsearch">overview document</a>&nbsp;provides more background, and the schemas itself are published at <a href="http://gs1.org/voc/">gs1.org/voc/</a><br> <br> <br>GS1's SmartSearch initiative has been working with the schema.org community (<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">at W3C</a> and <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg">Github</a>), creating a Web-based structured data vocabulary that extends schema.org to support richer product data description. Unlike our hosted extensions (e.g. <a href="http://bib.schema.org/">bib.schema.org</a>, <a href="http://auto.schema.org/">auto.schema.org</a>) that are reviewed, versioned and published as part of schema.org itself, external extensions to schema.org such as GS1's are fully independent and have their own workflows, review processes and infrastructure.<br><br>In the case of GS1 the extension vocabulary builds upon an extensive set of pre-existing B2B standards. While this means that in some places there is some divergence between the GS1 terminology and schema.org's, we share a common approach that builds upon the core vocabulary of schema.org and upon underlying foundational standards from W3C such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD">JSON-LD</a>.<br><br>As the work evolves we expect the combination of schema.org and GS1's vocabularies to provide for significantly richer online product descriptions for use in Web search, combining the descriptive depth of GS1 terminology with the broad coverage of schema.org's. We will continue to collaborate with the GS1 team via the schema.org W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">community group</a> to document best practices for combining schema.org terms with the new GS1 vocabulary, both in terms of making the most of the technical features of JSON-LD, and through gradual improvements that bring our vocabularies into closer alignment. While there is still much to be explored, this week's milestone is important as it is the first large scale external extension to schema.org.&nbsp;
