  President Biden’s administration believes a delay in crypto policies puts local investors at risk.  Officials in the administration are also concerned that the lack of regulation could trigger another Terra-like collapse   Regulatory agencies in the United States, such as the SEC, are pushing for the expansion of their jurisdiction to include the crypto industry.  



 



<p>President Biden’s administration has not hidden its <a href="https://bitnation.co/sec-and-cftc-hunts-bad-actors-in-the-crypto-market-as-directed-by-white-house/">interest </a>in the crypto industry. However, the administration wants to see adequate policies implemented before taking further steps. As a result, the Biden administration has urged Congress to pass new laws that clarify how cryptocurrency should be regulated. Officials within the administration are concerned that the continuous delays by lawmakers could put investors at risk and cause further damage to the economy. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Digital-Assets-Report-2022.pdf">report </a>released on Monday, the US Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of the nation’s top financial regulators that includes the Treasury, urged lawmakers to reach a consensus on a number of issues, including bitcoin regulation&nbsp;and other crypto assets traded on the spot market.</p>



<p>The report comes&nbsp;as Congressmen consider new laws addressing stablecoins and tax regulations for cryptocurrency brokers. However, those familiar with the Congressional deliberations say they are still months away from passing new laws. But President Biden’s administration fears that the nation might not have the luxury of time and is concerned about a possible&nbsp;repetition of the collapse of the&nbsp;TerraUSD stablecoin.</p>



<p>The crypto market is far from its lucrative best and has seen several top companies and service providers file for bankruptcy amidst the steady decline in the price of many assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the market leaders. This has led to more confusion over who should oversee the crypto market.</p>



<p>Regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are both pushing for control over the sector. The SEC claims many of the tokens meet the requirements for securities under US law, including the&nbsp;exchanges where they are traded, and&nbsp;should be subject to SEC regulation.</p>



<p>The report further warned that crypto prices are driven by speculation instead of basic economic use cases, making them a risk concern. The FSOC report recommended inter-agency cooperation to tackle possible loopholes that allow crypto service providers to find the most favorable regulations for their operations. According to the piece,</p>



<blockquote><p>Some crypto asset businesses may have affiliates or subsidiaries operating under different regulatory frameworks, and no single regulator may have visibility into the risks across the entire business.</p></blockquote>



<p>Finally,&nbsp;the FSOC advised Congress to enact regulations giving federal market officials the authority to impose regulations on crypto-asset markets that are not covered by current US securities laws. According to the group of regulators, such laws should cover conflicts of interest, unfair commercial practices, customer asset segregation, cyber security, and record-keeping.</p>

  The Canada SailGP Team, which is competing on the global, ultra-competitive international SailGP circuit, will be the first company to leverage the latest blockchain services.  Notably, the cross-border payment services provided by Stablecorp and Shift Markets will be made through the USDC on the Algorand blockchain.&nbsp;  To enact this cross-border payment, the Canada SailGP Team will leverage Grapes Finance, a newly launched Stablecorp treasury management platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
 



<p>Stablecorp and Shift Markets, leading global digital asset infrastructure firms, have announced a strategic partnership to establish a cross-border payment infrastructure between Canada and the United States. According to the announcement, Stablecorp and Shift Markets are working on a cross-border payment and on-chain exchange (FX) infrastructure using USDC’s issuer Circle.</p>



<p>Notably, the cross-border infrastructure will allow assets to flow between the two countries entirely on-chain, with Shift Markets providing the on-chain FX conversion between multi-currency stablecoins.</p>



<p>The White House previously noted the remittance market as the most prominent use case for blockchain technology. Moreover, blockchain technology reduces transaction time and fees significantly compared to the traditional banking sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Canada SailGP Team, which is competing on the global, ultra-competitive international SailGP circuit, will be the first company to leverage the latest blockchain services. Tom Ramshaw, a two-time Olympian and Tactician on the Canadian SailGP Team, will be the first SailGP athlete to use the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, the cross-border payment services will be made through the USDC on the Algorand blockchain.</p>



<blockquote><p>“It’s really exciting to be the first team member and athlete in SailGP to be paid with digital assets, even better that it is on the Algorand blockchain, our Tier 1 partner,” said Ramshaw of the partnership.</p></blockquote>



 Stablecorp and Shift Markets on Cross Border Financial Market&nbsp; 



<p>To enact this cross-border payment, the Canada SailGP Team will leverage Grapes Finance, a newly launched Stablecorp treasury management platform. Worth noting that Grapes Finance will enable users to seamlessly convert Canadian fiat into one of Stablecorp’s Canadian stablecoins QCAD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The QCAD is converted into USD Coin (USDC) or Euro Coin (EUROC) on the Shift Markets on-chain FX platform Cables. The USDC or EUROC is then settled through Circle’s payment infrastructure. Hereby, enabling Canada SailGP Team and others to make digital assets and fiat payouts to third-party suppliers and athletes like Ramshaw.</p>



<p>The Algorand was a perfect choice to run the cross-border infrastructure due to its immutability, cheap transaction, and fast transactions. Moreover, Algorand previously made a formal partnership with FIFA.</p>



<p>Despite the hot news, Algorand’s main token (<a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/algorand-price-prediction/">ALGO</a>) traded around $0.3537, down 2.5 per cent compared to yesterday&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Shift Markets leverages a deep pool of FX liquidity using their own Cables Finance product. This is meant to maintain highly efficient trading pairs across multi-currency stablecoins, including QCAD / USDC and QCAD / EUROC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, both companies estimate those total fees and spread on cross-border transactions can be reduced by as much as 95 per cent. Additionally, both crypto firms believe settlement time can be reduced from, on average, three to five business days to near instantaneously.</p>



<blockquote><p>“There is such a large need and lack of resources for cross-border payments and foreign exchange on-chain. By partnering with Stablecorp, we are taking some of the foundational steps in creating fast, secure, and cost-effective infrastructure to propel this financial ecosystem onto the blockchain,” said Ian McAfee, CEO of Cables Finance.</p></blockquote>



<p>On the other hand, Stablecorp President and Chief Executive Officer Alex McDougall believe digital assets are the saviour of the ailing traditional financial system.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“The $1.7tn Canada / US corridor is a fantastic avenue to begin putting these types of solutions in place, and we are thrilled to work with Circle and Shift Markets to deliver this valuable treasury solution to the Canada SailGP Team,” McDougall <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stablecorp-and-shift-markets-to-leverage-circles-payment-solutions-and-create-cross-border-digital-asset-payments-and-fx-corridor-with-canada-sailgp-team-as-pilot-user-301638955.html">noted</a>.</p></blockquote>

  Kim Kardashian, has come under the crosshairs of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the promotion of EthereumMAX (EMAX), a reportedly pump and dump crypto scheme.   The SEC claims that the billionaire failed to disclose that she was paid to promote the EMAX tokens via her Instagram, which consists of around 330 million followers at the time of writing.   Kardashian did not agree or disagree with the accusations imposed by the regulatory authority but immediately paid a total sum of $1.26 million.  



 



<p>A number of well-known entities, including celebrities, have entered the crypto industry, and many of them have come out in support of these blockchain-based assets as well. However, one of such famous names, Kim Kardashian, has come under the crosshairs of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for promoting a crypto scam that caused significant losses to investors. </p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183">press statement</a> from the financial regulator, Kardashian, known for her ties to famous hip-hop artist Kanye West, now Ye, has been charged “for touting on social media a crypto asset security offered and sold by EthereumMax without disclosing the payment she received for the promotion.” Interestingly, this token rose to significant heights and then was dump to lower lows. </p>



<p>EthereumMax (EMAX), described as a progressive ERC-20 token built on the secure Ethereum network with a “vision to bridge the gap between the emergence of community-driven tokens and the well-known foundational coins of crypto,” was promoted by Kardashian via her Instagram handle which currently has around 330 million follows!</p>



<blockquote><p>“This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean that those investment products are right for all investors. We encourage investors to consider an investment’s potential risks and opportunities in light of their own financial goals,”</p>said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.</blockquote>



<p>The SEC claims that Kardashian failed to disclose that she was paid $250,000 to publish a post on her Instagram account wherein she was seen promoting the EMAX cryptocurrency which was offered by EthereumMax without registering with the regulatory authority. </p>



<p>The post promoted by Kardashian contained a link to the official website of the EthereumMax website via which the tokens could be bought. However, following the advertisement from the by the billionaire, the fans rushed to purchase the EMAX tokens which cause the prices to spike. According to the data from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereummax/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the EMAX token reached an all-time high of $0.00000051 and currently, the price of 1 EMAX is around $0.00000000422, which is significantly low from the ATH. </p>



<p>Interestingly, talking about the same, Gensler said that the case “serves as a reminder to celebrities and others that the law requires them to disclose to the public when and how much they are paid to promote investing in securities.” </p>



<p>Additionally, the SEC press statement also added that Kardashian did not agree or disagree with the accusations imposed by the regulatory authority but immediately paid a total sum of $1.26 million which includes approximately $260,000 in disgorgement “which represents her promotional payment, plus prejudgment interest, and a $1,000,000 penalty,” SEC confirmed.  </p>

  Juno has successfully raised around $18 million in a new Series A funding round and will use the funds to expand its services and products as well.  The round was led by ParaFi Capital’s Growth Fund and Coinbase Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee, Messari’s Ryan Selkis, Polygon’s Sandeep Nailwal and Jaynti Kanani, and a16z’s Sriram Krishnan also participated.   As a part of the fundraising, Juno is also introducing a new loyalty token called the Juno Coin (JCOIN).  



 



<p>Crypto banking platform Juno has successfully raised around $18 million in a new Series A funding round and will use the funds to expand its services and products as well. The crypto market downturn has not deterred crypto platforms from raising funds, and investors are also doubling down on the promising technology in anticipation of gains that will come from wider adoption of blockchain and the crypto space.  </p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/01/crypto-banking-platform-juno-raises-18m-in-series-a-funding/">report</a>, the funding round has been confirmed by the crypto banking platform and Juno has also successfully kicked off a new tokenized loyalty program, confiming a remarkable expansion in operations as well. </p>



<p> “We think these banks are not crypto friendly,” Varun Deshpande, the CEO and co-founder of Juno told CoinDesk. The aim of the loyalty program, he said, will be “to incentivize those already predisposed to using crypto to fundamentally replace their traditional banking stack.”</p>



<p>The funding round can be tied to many investors in the crypto space with positive reputations including ParaFi Capital’s Growth Fund, and other well-known personalities in the crypto space like Coinbase Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee, Messari’s Ryan Selkis, Polygon’s Sandeep Nailwal and Jaynti Kanani, and a16z’s Sriram Krishnan. The round was led by ParaFi Capital’s Growth Fund pointed out the report. </p>



<p>Juno is a crypto banking platform which encourages users to spend crypto on everyday transactions and therefore, has incentivized the whole process as well. The flagship project of the firm is the Juno card which can be used for transactions via Circle’s stablecoin called USDC.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the report also added that as a part of the fundraising, Juno is also introducing a new loyalty token called the Juno Coin (JCOIN) which will only be distributed to verified account users and it is crucial to note that members can earn JCOIN for taking their paychecks in crypto along with spending crypto with their Juno debit card. </p>



<blockquote><p>“Earning and using crypto are critical financial primitives for creating and growing a circular crypto economy. Our tokenized loyalty program is meant to further accelerate the growth of this crypto economy,”</p>added Deshpande.</blockquote>



<p>Juno is not the only crypto firm to raise funds recently as Web3 firewall provider Blowfish also emerged from the darkness and successfully raised $11.8 million in a funding round led by Paradigm, a prominent crypto investment firm. Other firms which form an important part of the investment round were Dragonfly Capital, Uniswap Lab Ventures, Hypersphere and 0xLabs, according to a company <a href="https://blog.blowfish.xyz/blowfish-raises-11-8m-round-led-by-paradigm/">blog post</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Blowfish has helped us protect thousands of our users from malicious scams &amp; fraud. We’ve partnered with them because we trust their ability to continue building a great product that stays one step ahead of scammers,”</p>said Francesco Agosti, chief technology officer and co-founder of Phantom.</blockquote>

  WazirX, is the latest to join the list of companies suffering from the ongoing crypto market, by announcing a 40% layoff of its employees while adding that they would receive their salary for the next 45 days.   It has laid off several employees from its 150-member team, notably 50 to as many as 70 in count as per three sources close to the matter.   As per the statements by one of the sources, WazirX has cut employees from a range of departments, including human resources, customer support, among others.  



 



<p>The leading crypto exchange platform in India, WazirX, is the latest to join the list of companies suffering from the ongoing crypto market, by announcing a 40% layoff of its employees.</p>



<p>According to a recently shared statement by the exchange, it has laid off several employees from its 150-membered team, notably 50 to as many as 70 in count. Three sources close to the matter told CoinDesk that the laid off employees were informed on Friday that they would receive their salary for the next 45 days. However, the company has reportedly revoked the laid off employees’ access as their services would not be required effective immediately.</p>



<p>WazirX said in a statement on Saturday that the crypto market is currently in its winter season because of the “current global economic slowdown.” </p>



<blockquote><p>“The Indian crypto industry has had its unique problems with respect to taxes, regulations, and banking access. This has led to a dramatic fall in volumes in all Indian crypto exchanges,”</p>It further added.</blockquote>



<p>As per the statements by one of the sources, WazirX has cut employees from a range of departments, including human resources, customer support, among others. Moreover, analysts, managers, and associate managers, are some of the posts being laid off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, an employee who “abruptly” lost their job reported that Nischal Shetty’s company has fired the entire public policy and communication team.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/01/indian-crypto-exchange-wazirx-lays-off-40-of-its-employees-sources/">Coindesk</a>, the exchange claims to prioritize financial stability and quality services to its customers and to achieve the same, it took this difficult decision of reducing its staff to “weather the crypto winter.”</p>



<p>Notably, during the last crypto bear market in 2018, the Indian exchange giant had doubled down and built its innovative peer-to-peer (P2P) engine. </p>



<p>The statement reads:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The crypto industry operates in cycles, and the bear market is inevitably followed by a spectacular bull market. We will continue to focus on our customers’ needs and continue to build. We are confident that we will come out stronger when the bull market arrives.”</p></blockquote>



 Regulatory scrutiny 



<p>It is important to note that the reported layoff decision comes soon after the company received severe scrutiny from the India’s Enforcement Directorate for alleged money laundering activities. The regulator searched the premises of the WazirX’s director, and following the exercises, confiscated the sum of $8.13 million belonging to the exchange.</p>



<p>Later, in September, the authorities unfreezed its bank accounts as a result of its active cooperation in the ongoing money laundering investigation.</p>



<p>After India’s strict crypto tax rules went into effect in March 2022, WazirX Co-Founder Nischal Shetty stated that “we have entered a period of pain.” Daily trading volume on the exchange have been continuously dropping, clearly weakening operations within the company.</p>

  A new survey has shown that crypto policies will play a huge role in the forthcoming US midterm elections.  Respondents of the survey appeared to have favored candidates with pro-crypto beliefs above industry critics.  The survey also revealed a growing number of US citizens who have embraced digital assets such as NFTs and crypto tokens.  



 



<p>A new survey carried out by business intelligence company Morning Consult&nbsp;showed that voters in the US midterm elections are less likely to vote for candidates they believe to be anti-cryptocurrency. The survey analyzed 800 voters in New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and the result showed that respondents favored candidates perceived to support crypto and decentralization.</p>



<p>A large percentage of the respondents confessed to owning crypto assets as well as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Furthermore, 91% of respondents threw their weight behind a “community owned, and community governed” internet that enables people to control their information.</p>



<p><a href="https://mirror.xyz/haunventures.eth/DtYIt_vAijoqRV41SMNAcu6kwCAM8Mc_p8GsjFTfP6o">Analyzing </a>the survey, venture capital firm Haun Ventures noted that the survey was,</p>



<blockquote><p>Significantly, and reflective of how the values that voters associate with Web3 will drive electoral behavior, voters are less likely to support candidates perceived as standing in the way of a decentralized internet. In other words, as both parties consider how good Web3 policy will translate into good politics, the values of Web3 are what voters want to see elected officials supporting, not standing in the way of.</p></blockquote>



<p>The survey showed that the respondents leaned towards Democratic ideals. However, a decentralized and democratic internet appears to be a bipartisan problem, and both sides showed little faith in the government’s ability to regulate the Web3 industry. The poll also showed that Web3 voters make up a significant part of the middle-class electorate in these states.</p>



<p>The survey was conducted among those who intended to cast a ballot in the US&nbsp;midterm elections, which will take place in November and see candidates take office in January.&nbsp;The study follows the US’s focus on finding a perfect policy for regulating the crypto market.</p>



<p>President Biden’s administration has identified blockchain as <a href="https://bitnation.co/sec-and-cftc-hunts-bad-actors-in-the-crypto-market-as-directed-by-white-house/">part of its plans</a>. However, the US government intends to roll out policies to regulate the industry before further approval. Different agencies in the United States have urged the administration to find a one-size-fits-all policy on time before the market grows beyond its current point.</p>



<p>United States Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was the latest to call for urgent attention and policies from authorities. Powell stated that the government had to establish clear policies before the market could expand to retail.</p>



<p>Powell’s comments were targeted at DeFi projects, which he said had structural concerns and the tendency not to be transparent.</p>

  Earlier this week, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said the Bitcoin price might double in value should more regulations come in.  While cash inflows have been going to DeFi ecosystems recently, the United States government is keen to regulate the industry thoroughly.  In the past few years, DeFi hacks and rug pulls have been on the rise, mainly due to flawed system designs.  
 



<p>The United States SEC and CFTC have stepped up their game of regulating the cryptocurrency market. On Friday, Adam Todd, founder of crypto futures and spot market exchange Digitex, was charged by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Additionally, the <a href="https://bitcoinwisdom.com/sec-files-charges-against-two-crypto-companies-for-pump-and-dump-allegations/">SEC filed charges</a> against Arbitrade Ltd., Cryptobontix Inc., and their principals for perpetrating an alleged pump-and-dump scheme involving a Dignity (DIG) token.</p>



<p>These follow a September 16 directive from the White House on a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The reports encourage regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), consistent with their mandates, to aggressively pursue investigations and enforcement actions against unlawful practices in the digital assets space,” the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/16/fact-sheet-white-house-releases-first-ever-comprehensive-framework-for-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/">report noted.</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Earlier this week, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam said Bitcoin price might double in value should more regulations trickle down from all over the world. Furthermore, more regulations mean a safer environment for investors, both institutional and retail.</p>



 SEC and CFTC Brings Sanity to Crypto Market 



<p>The cryptocurrency market has kept most government leaders from around the world awake due to its sheer potential. For one, the industry has grown to a trillion-dollar industry and shows no signs of stopping soon. However, crypto scams and hacks have been on the rise in the past few years. Thereby prompting global leaders to act together in <a href="https://bitnation.co/californias-dfpi-launches-crackdown-on-crypto-platforms-operating-like-ponzi-and-pyramid-schemes/">crypto regulations.</a></p>



<p>Michael Selig, a crypto attorney at the law firm of Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/30/cftc-charges-digitex-founder-adam-todd-with-multiple-violations-of-commodity-exchange-act/">said</a> that while the CFTC’s action against Todd and Digitex is the regulator’s first against a decentralized-finance (DeFi) platform for failing to register as an exchange, it’s not a surprise to anyone paying attention to what the regulator has been saying about DeFi platforms.</p>



<p>The decentralised financial ecosystem (DeFi) and the play-to-earn (P2E) have been trending for the past few years. However, the former has significantly challenged the traditional financial market that has long been centralised.</p>



<p>While cash inflows have been going to DeFi ecosystems recently, the United States government is keen to regulate the industry thoroughly.</p>



<p>In the past few years, DeFi hacks and rug pulls have been on the rise, mainly due to flawed system designs. The increased use of multi-chains has skyrocketed backend system attacks. For instance, the Ronin Bridge attack on the Axie infinity network that saw over $600 million in digital assets stolen, allegedly by North Korean hackers Lazarus.</p>



<p>Despite its success and glory, the DeFi ecosystem has reportedly aided laundering of billions of dollars in digital assets. Among them is the recently banned Tornado Cash mixer, which Chainalysis found out that the Lazurus group used to launder stolen money.</p>

<p>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, is a federal regulation that requires financial institutions to safeguard sensitive customer information and clearly explain their information-sharing practices. For higher education institutions offering financial aid to students, GLBA means your institution is required to meet compliance standards for the security and protection of financial information, and to provide transparency related to how personal information is used and shared. Failure to meet these standards carries significant risk for institutions, including restrictions or loss of eligibility for Title IV funding.</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll share insights into the current GLBA compliance standards relevant to higher education institutions. Edge’s virtual Chief Information Security Officer will also highlight strategies for safeguarding financial information that every college and university should employ, from assessment and auditing procedures to specific cybersecurity policy to ensure compliance.</p>

  Philippine central bank Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Director Mhel Plabasan stated that stablecoins will help make payment system and related processes easier than they currenty are.   Philippines is ranked second in the list of the countries with the highest rate of crypto adoption while Vietnam was in the first place as per a Chainalysis report.  The central bank has granted licenses to six digital banks and is looking at finance to further drive digital payments.   



 



<p>Philippine central bank Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Director Mhel Plabasan has put his faith in stablecoins and stated that these blockchain based tokens will help make payment system and related processes easier than they currenty are. According to a report, Plabasan stated that in a country in which citizens are heavily reliant on remittances from other nations, stablecoins backed by the US dollar play an important role. </p>



<p>The director of technology risk and innovation supervision department at BSP was present at Forkast’s “Crypto Rising: CBDCs &amp; Stablecoins: The Asia Perspective” <a href="https://forkast.news/philippine-central-bank-stablecoin-key-payment/">live stream</a> which was hosted by the Crypto Council for Innovation.</p>



<blockquote><p>“We have seen it really has the potential to revolutionize both domestic and cross-border payment more affordable, faster, and even the possibility of using stablecoins to make cross-border remittance efficient,”</p>Plabasan said.</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, Philippines has recently completed a test run for stablecoins being used to receive payments in the country and it seems that the run has been quite successful. Moreover, according to a recent report from blockchain analystics firm <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/?utm_campaign=twitter&amp;utm_source=OrganicSocial&amp;utm_content=Thread#top-20">Chainalysis</a>, Philippines is ranked second in the list of the countries with the highest rate of crypto adoption while Vietnam was in the first place. </p>



<p>Plabasan pointed out that gradually the Filipinos&nbsp;are starting to adopt cryptocurrencies but it is crucial for the government to team up with the private sector in order to break the regulatory complexities and implement more progressive regulations for stablecoins as well as cryptocurrencies in Philippines. </p>



<blockquote><p>“We’ve been collaborating with the private sector because at the end of the day if we talk about new technology, we cannot actually regulate what we don’t understand,” he said. “That’s why it’s important for us to constantly engage the private sector [and] we learn together. We are part of the journey to get to improving digital payments using stablecoins,”</p>Plabasan said. </blockquote>



<p>Plabasan also confirmed that the central bank is working on a central bank digital currency or CBDC project which has been titled “Project CBDCPh” and it seems that the country is on the road to crypto adoption as the global demand for blockchain technology is gradually increasing. </p>



<p>The director also pointed out that until now, the central bank has granted licenses to six digital banks and is looking at finance to further drive digital payments. He further confirmed that “there are a lot of initiatives right now to digitize payment in the Philippines, not necessarily related to the CBDC.”</p>

 💼 + 🤗 =&nbsp;🚀 <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed-use-cases/">the draft</a> Verifiable Credentials for Education, Employment, and Achievement Use Cases report was published. It’s worth a read for anyone interested in Open Badges, microcredentials, or certification. The next version of the Open Badges specification (v3.0) will be compatible with Verifiable Credentials (VCs). One thing to note about VCs is that they don’t have to have a visual representation in the form of an&nbsp;image.</p><p>The use cases provided in the report are interesting, and Verifiable Credentials promise to solve many seemingly-intractable problems around how individual people can prove claims in privacy-respecting ways. What we noted, however, especially given our work around <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, is that there are some use cases that are likely to be transformational to learners and workers in the future of work. Both groups need control over the way that they are recognised to unlock future opportunities.</p><p>For example, the report talks about the recognition of prior learning, something which is an equity issue for those who haven’t had the same access to resources than&nbsp;others:</p><blockquote>Josephina decided to return to college to finish her bachelors degree. The college she attended evaluated her work experience and determined that skills and knowledge that she attained while working qualified to replace several of the courses required for the&nbsp;degree.</blockquote><p>There are countries and systems where recognising prior learning is a normal part of the learning landscape. Even in these cases, however, the aim of the activity is to assess whether an individual has met the criteria for admission to a course or institution. What VCs allow is for recognition to be turned into a credential, and therefore used as ‘currency’ not just to be ‘spent’ at that institution, but potentially anywhere.</p><p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">original vision</a> for Open Badges was to create an “open and decentralized [ecosystem] to allow for badges from any contexts where learners are learning, to support any and all types of learning occurring, to provide portable and sustainable value and to give each learner complete control”.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/issuing-open-badges/">Issuing Open Badges</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>The key word here is control. Although a lot of learning happens in formal education institutions, a lot of learning happens on the job through informal and non-formal learning. So how can VCs work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_career">portfolio careers</a>, in a world where people change jobs relatively often and need to take proof of their learning with&nbsp;them?</p><p>We suggest that there are the following three examples where VCs can play an important role in Open Workplace Recognition (i.e. Open Recognition in the workplace):</p>  Recognition of prior learning — as discussed above, this is a way to translate knowledge, skills, and experience gained on the job into credentials that can be used more widely. This depends on an authority (the ‘Issuer’) assessing a portfolio of evidence about a person (the ‘Subject’), who will then also be able to use the VC as proof of their claim (i.e. also be the ‘Holder’).  Defining your own path — no two careers are ever the same, yet the way we present them can often be far too similar. VCs issued for the recognition of niche (or even unique!) things such as knowledge, skills, experience, and dispositions allows individuals to better tell their own story. One way of doing this would be to self-issue a VC (the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) and then have someone else, or an organisation, endorse that&nbsp;claim.  Making recognition portable — combining the other two points, an individual may want to memorialise a particular important form of recognition they have received. This could be a tweet, a comment in an email, or anything that they want to be able to refer to in future. By self-issuing a VC (again, the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) they can ask the person who gave the recognition to endorse their&nbsp;claim.  <p>The purpose of standards, and the working groups which create them, is necessarily to focus on the technical elements and most common use cases. With this post, we want to widen the conversation to consider what VCs make possible that is entirely new, and that which was perhaps always latent in Open&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>Using a lens of Open Workplace Recognition allows us to focus about the norms, behaviours, and expectations within the world of work. We can then go a step further to think about who controls what is recognised, by whom, and how that recognition can be shared more&nbsp;widely.</p><p>What other examples for Open Workplace Recognition using VCs can we come up with together?</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-workplace-recognition-using-verifiable-credentials-fc0134fad7ec">Open Workplace Recognition using Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Meta had over 83,500 employees as of June 30 and employed an extra 5,700 in Q2.  The company has turned its attention to other ventures, including the metaverse and Reels.  This would be the first budget slash to be implemented since its launch in 2004.  



<p>Mark Zuckerberg-led Facebook (Meta) has announced plans to restructure the company and introduce a possible reduction in headcount. This would be the first time the company has taken such a step in almost two decades of operation. Unfortunately, it would also mark an end to the company’s growth record.</p>



<p>In a Q&amp;A&nbsp;with employees, Zuckerberg announced that the company would halt hiring and reorganize some teams to save costs and refocus priorities.&nbsp;As a result, he predicted that Meta would likely operate with a smaller team&nbsp;in 2023 than it did this year.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Zuckerberg&nbsp;said that the tech giant&nbsp;would cut expenses for the majority of teams, including currently&nbsp;expanding teams. The Meta CEO reportedly noted that individual&nbsp;teams would decide how to manage changes in staffing. It is possible that Meta does not intend to fill vacant positions or will move people to other teams in a bid to keep things smaller.</p>



<p>Meta joins the list of tech companies <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-30/snap-plans-to-lay-off-20-percent-of-employees-the-verge-says?sref=dZ65CIng">struggling </a>to cope with the decline of digital ads and the current global financial crisis. According to Bloomberg, Zuckerberg was quoted saying to his employees, </p>



<blockquote><p>I had hoped the economy would have more clearly stabilized by now. But from what we’re seeing it doesn’t yet seem like it has, so we want to plan somewhat conservatively.</p></blockquote>



<p>Meta’s spokesperson has declined to comment on the situation, but it can be recalled that during the company’s earnings call in July, Zuckerberg confirmed the new direction Meta would take. The 38-year-old noted that Meta would focus on reducing headcount in 2023. He said at the time,</p>



<blockquote><p>Our plan is to steadily reduce headcount growth over the next year. Many teams are going to shrink so we can shift energy to other areas, and I wanted to give our leaders the ability to decide within their teams where to double down, where to backfill attrition, and where to restructure teams while minimizing thrash to the long term initiatives.</p></blockquote>



 What’s Going on With Meta? 



<p>Like the <a href="https://bitnation.co/apple-receives-backlash-for-its-tax-on-nfts/">rest of the world</a>, Meta has not had one of its finest years in terms of revenue. The company’s shares have fallen 60% this year, and several of its endeavors have not yielded the anticipated results. Meta’s decision to freeze its hiring process is a subtle admission of the growing competition it faces from other tech companies and how the general market slump has affected its operations.</p>



<p>With TikTok taking much of Instagram’s users away, Zuckerberg shifted his attention to the metaverse and poured billions of dollars into the initiative but has had few results. Surprisingly, Zuckerberg believes the company’s metaverse ambition will incur more losses in the coming years.</p>

  The company’s BLKC ETF is listed on Euronext, with a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.50 per cent.  BlackRock is a major investor in the blockchain and cryptocurrency market with its backed stablecoin, USDC, ranked fourth by market cap.  The global investment manager takes pride in around $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM).  
 



<p>BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK) has today announced the launch of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on the blockchain market for its European customers. According to the announcement, the exchange-traded fund is referred to as Shares Blockchain Technology UCITS ETF [BLKC]. However, the company has clarified that BLKC ETF does not directly invest in digital assets but rather the underlying technology.</p>



<blockquote><p>“We believe digital assets and blockchain technologies are going to become increasingly relevant for our clients as use cases develop in scope, scale and complexity. The continued proliferation of blockchain technology underscores its potential across many industries. The exposure offered by the iShares Blockchain Technology UCITS ETF will allow our clients the opportunity to engage with global companies leading the development of the emerging blockchain ecosystem,” Omar Moufti, product strategist for thematic and sector ETFs at BlackRock, <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/94256/blackrock-launches-blockchain-etf">said</a>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Notably, the company’s BLKC ETF is listed on Euronext, with a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.50 per cent.</p>



 BlackRock and the Blockchain Market 



<p>BlackRock is a major investor in the blockchain and cryptocurrency market with its backed stablecoin, <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/usd-coin-price-prediction/">USDC</a>, ranked fourth by market cap. The global investment manager takes pride in around $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM). The company has strategic partnerships with crucial blockchain firms, including Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), to provide seamless trading for its institutional investors.</p>



<p>In the past, the company was focused in the American market on blockchain and cryptocurrency matters. However, BlackRock seeks a global share by venturing into the vast European market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency regulations from critical global markets, including the United States, Europe, and Australia, open up the industry to another level. While crypto investors fear scams, regulators have shaped policies that ban anonymous creation, as <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has an underlying cryptocurrency market valued at approximately $1 trillion. However, over $2 trillion has been liquidated from the cryptocurrency market in the past two years.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, with the growing interest in decentralised financial markets (DeFi) from institutional and retail investors, the cryptocurrency market cap is poised to scale further in the near future.</p>



<p>The latest blockchain product by BlackRock, BLKC, comprises 35 global companies from developed and emerging markets. Approximately 75 per cent of the BLKC product is exposed to companies whose primary business is related to blockchains, such as crypto miners and exchanges. The remaining 25 per cent of the BLKC product is exposed to companies who support the blockchain ecosystem, such as payments and semiconductor companies.</p>



<p>As such, the asset management company will have diversified its earnings toward a market with great potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, BlackRock shares are trading at around $563.92, as of September 29, 2022, 4:24 p.m. EDT, according to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/blk?mod=search_symbol">MarketWatch</a>. The company has a reported valuation of approximately $88.69 billion.</p>

<p>Learnings from the first 6 months of the UK Digital Identity &amp; Attributes Framework by Kay Chopard, Executive Director, Kantara Initiative Ltd</p>



<p>It is just over 6 months since<a href="https://www.ukas.com/resources/latest-news/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-pilot/"> UKAS announced the 5 organisations</a> that would certify Identity Service Providers (IDSPs) against the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> (DIATF) under an initial assessment program.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks#list-of-certified-idsps">11 identity proofing organisations have now been certified to provide services within the Framework</a>. At Kantara Initiative, we have been running identity assessment programs across the world for nearly 15 years.&nbsp; I therefore wanted to share some of my thoughts on our own experiences and learnings over the past 6 months.</p>



<p>Digital identity and the provision of trusted credentials will be a vital component in the delivery of future public – and private – services. Through our global identity certification work, we observe first-hand just how quickly the digital identity market is growing. We have been certifying an increasing number of IDSPs against global standards as opportunities for digital identity expand. I’ve noted especially the drive from sectors where identity verification is NOT mandated by regulation – for instance in healthcare. To support this growth, I believe we should consider the following points:</p>



<p>Future-proofing the identity ecosystem</p>



<p>We have been proud to work with the Department of Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS), UKAS and our certification clients over the past 6 months as the DIATF has moved from the Alpha to Beta phase. Organisations that were certified in the first few months were assessed against the Alpha version of the framework. Our certification clients, however, are assessed against the Beta version of the DIATF as this is already much more robust and includes more fully defined assessment criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the program continues to evolve we will identify further assessment criteria that will be vital to roll out robust, trusted, identity solutions that will work for future use cases. Our auditors are dedicated identity specialists with experience across multiple sectors. They have shared with me that the DIATF will continue to benefit from the experiences of other programs across the world – what has worked and what hasn’t.&nbsp; This is vital, especially if we are to support those identity organisations that are planning for international expansion. The UK’s DIATF cannot exist in geographic isolation; individual customers and citizens will eventually require a digital identity that is portable. The DIATF needs to support organisations in providing this.</p>



<p>One size doesn’t fit all</p>



<p>This first wave of assessments has shown very quickly that each certification client operates quite differently and so a simple “tick box” approach to assessment will not work. We are often asked for a fixed price for our certification services, but I would argue that a fixed price indicates a fixed approach – and a fixed mindset. The underlying assessment criteria must, of course, be met consistently. But each organisation operates differently, and the Kantara ‘modular’ approach ensures each element of the process can be audited in line with requirements AND the business’ operating model. This also supports DCMS’ current model of having separate use cases. As new cases come online, we will continue to add in new assessments that support growth.</p>



<p>Challenge through collaboration</p>



<p>We are a not-for-profit organisation. While commerciality is an important focus, it is more significant that we continue to develop our understanding of emerging trends and issues across all markets. We have been encouraged by the response of parliamentarians, digital identity industry leaders, influencers and media to the Kantara approach and we have appointed a number of key assessors who bring with them experiences of specific sectors, territories and regulatory environments.&nbsp; And, most recently, the appointment of Emma Lindley MBE, Alison McDowell and Andrew Hindle to our UK Advisory Board was a deliberate move to ensure we continue to be challenged and stay abreast of the issues our clients face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe it is vital that certification bodies work with DCMS and UKAS in a spirit of partnership – bringing together the cumulative value of dozens of great minds! To this end, we have&nbsp; been encouraged by the proactive approach of DCMS in creating forums where the 5 certification bodies can discuss ideas and feedback on the program in action.</p>



<p>“Our role on the Kantara UK Advisory Board is to provide independent thinking and guidance to Kantara’s UK team. As a UK citizen who has worked in the identity sector for over 20 years, I believe we can help ensure the customer is constantly “in the room” and at the heart of any discussions around the future of the digital identity framework.” (Andrew Hindle, Kantara UK Advisor, Content Chair at Identiverse and Founding Board Member at IDPro.)</p>



<p>“There is a clear vision for a market for digital identity that is both open and competitive. The DIATF is intended to create choice, improve quality and increase innovation – ultimately improving customer experiences for the UK citizen and reducing the cost for UK PLC. Kantara Initiative has a vital role to play in delivering this vision.” (Emma Lindley MBE, Co-Founder of Women in Identity and MD, International Expansion, at CAF) </p>

<p>Verifying identities and information in a digital world is critical for establishing trust. But there are issues of privacy as well as efficiency, scale and accuracy in models that rely on centralized data collectors and databases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The adoption of a new generation of digital identity solutions that leverage decentralized technologies such as distributed ledgers and verifiable credentials is accelerating. And Hyperledger technologies are playing a major role in this transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on for a cross section of the many Hyperledger-powered solutions that are in production now. For other examples, check out these past #HyperledgerIdentity round-ups:</p>



  <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/04/29/hyperledger-powered-digital-identity-solutions-at-work">Hyperledger-Powered Digital Identity Solutions at Work</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/04/30/identity-applications-in-action-powered-by-hyperledger">Identity Applications in Action &amp; Powered by Hyperledger</a>  



<p>IBM Digital Health Pass</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass">IBM Digital Health Pass</a>, built on<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric"> Hyperledger Fabric</a>, offers a multi-credential verifier that organizations can use to manage and execute their verification policies for COVID-19 and vaccination status in a way that balances the privacy of the individual with the requirements set by the organization and local health authorities. With IBM Digital Health Pass, organizations can verify multiple types of health credentials, such as Good Health Pass, IBM Digital Health Pass, Smart Health Card and EU Digital COVID Certificate. Privacy is central to the solution, where the verifier application minimizes the personal data that is ever displayed to the user through the execution of business rules and it never lets any personal data leave, or be stored in, the verifier app.</p>



<p>Indicio Network&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a> is a collection of four professionally-staffed, enterprise-grade public-permissioned ledgers that provide a neutral, independent, and reliable network for the exchange of verifiable credentials. <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">MainNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">DemoNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">TestNet</a>, and <a href="https://indicio.tech/deploy-your-own-private-network-for-critical-performance-testing/">TempNet</a> are all Hyperledger Indy-based networks with nodes operating on five continents—and a growing number of node operators. The Indicio Network is one of the networks that can support <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a>, a complete suite of decentralized identity components for authenticating and sharing high value data in a privacy-preserving way using verifiable digital credentials. Built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>, as well as AnonCreds and DIDComm, Proven is designed to make implementing and using these open source codebases simple, providing users with a fully-owned solution that’s easy to integrate with existing systems, to innovate on, and to scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDUnion&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDUnion</a>, the European identity verification network created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organizations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields to enable a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information. In August, 2022, IDUnion spun off Sociedad Cooperativa Europea (SCE) to operate the production network for credential verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IDUnion network, which is built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>, enables the clear verification of individuals, companies and institutions while allowing people and organizations to manage their identity information by themselves and to decide when they want to share this information and with whom. It has a decentralized structure and stores no personal data – not even as a hash. In order to protect privacy right from the start, all personal data is stored on the user’s end device. Users have a choice of wallets for storing and presenting credentials to third parties as required. Credentials are issued, verified and stored using open standards to ensure interoperability. Hyperledger Aries is the framework for managing the credentials.</p>



<p>NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</p>



<p>In 2019, the NHS was preparing to pilot a digital passport project that would allow staff to carry their HR and other records as credentials on their phones as a long-term plan to make it easier to transfer from one facility to another. When the pandemic hit, this went from a pilot to a production deployment quickly. The <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/">NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</a> rolled out in summer to support swift and efficient staff movement between NHS organizations in response to the response health emergency. The COVID-19 Digital Staff Passport provided a solid legal framework for staff to be temporarily deployed into other NHS organizations with evidence available that checks have been completed before staff move. As laid out in the pilot, the information was transferred securely by the staff member as verified credentials stored on their own smartphone, putting them in control.</p>



<p>This staff passport used the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sorvin Network</a>, which is built on Hyperledger Indy, to verify the digital credentials, and the Evernym (now Avast) <a href="https://connect.me/">Connect.me</a> digital wallet app, which is powered by Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, to enable staff to store and share their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NHS is now gearing up to roll out the <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/whats-next.htm">next generation</a> of its Digital Staff Passport, which will streamline transfers and staff movements through the NHS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBook BC&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/search">OrgBook BC</a> is a searchable public directory of organizations registered in British Columbia, Canada, provided by the BC Government’s Ministry of Citizens’ Services. OrgBook BC provides verified data, including legal names and DBA names, business numbers, BC registration status and select licensee and permits, for more than 1.4 million organizations. All of the information in the OrgBookBC is received, stored, verified and displayed using the latest digital trust technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC uses verifiable credentials to ensure that information about organizations are digitally signed by the entity that issues it. Issuers are public sector organizations that hold information about businesses, issue licenses or permits or certify processes. That electronic signature stays with the data throughout its life in OrgBook and is validated before its is display on the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC is part of an overall commitment to digital trust technologies by the Government of British Columbia. In addition to deploying Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, the team there is leading much of the open source development for those projects. Read more on the Government of BC’s investment in verifiable credentials and digital wallet technologies <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/08/23/investing-in-verifiable-credentials-technical-interoperability-and-open-source">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This update provides additional insights on the results of the “snapshot” mechanism currently being used to track the consistency of staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Consortia staking pool. Patrons staking EWT can use the tools provided at <a href="https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/">https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/</a> to check the status of their wallets and snapshots if applicable.</p> Snapshots and Variable EWT&nbsp;rewards <p>We published <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-ewt-consortia-relay-staking-snapshots-insights-32675cdd20db">this blog post</a> that includes a detailed technical analysis of the previous 2 snapshots, together with an explanation of the snapshots mechanism and variable staking rewards. To summarize the mechanics, the Energy Web Consortia staking pool tracks the consistency of staking by taking snapshots of staking balances at random points in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Users who stake consistently, based on the snapshot date, will earn additional rewards from the staking pool. The additional rewards are designed to incentivize consistent staking, as EWT staking will be a major contributor to the cybersecurity of upcoming Energy Web solutions for enterprises.</p> Snapshot 3 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>Snapshot 3 was taken on block #<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/block/19190154/transactions">19190154</a> generated on July 29th at 09:24:50 PM +2 UTC. At this block, there were 6,822 wallets staking, which is 181 more wallets compared to Snapshot 2 and 414 more compared to Snapshot 1. The total balance of all EWT staked in the pool was equal to 6,047,363 EWT, an increase of 316,401 EWT compared to Snapshot 2 and 506,775 EWT more than at Snapshot&nbsp;1.</p><p>Here are the balances of Snapshot 3 (in green), 2 (in orange), and 1 (in blue). Wallets on the bottom, balance on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>The green spikes are wallets adding more EWT between snapshots 1 and 3. The dips are wallets withdrawing EWT. On the far right of the chart, there are green lines and no blue lines: these are the completely new wallets that didn’t participate in snapshots 1 or&nbsp;2.</p><p>During Snapshot 3, there were 181 more wallets staking EWT compared to Snapshot 2, and 414 more wallets compared to snapshot 1. Interestingly, there are 5 wallets that were staking EWT during Snapshot 1, withdrew their stake during snapshot 2, and are now staking during snapshot&nbsp;3.</p><p>Here’s the balance distribution comparison between snapshot 1, 2, and 3 balances. Bounds on the bottom, number of wallets in each category on the vertical&nbsp;scale:</p><p>We can see a slight increase in each category, except for the &lt;1,500–2,500) bound. The highest increase in staking occurred in the highest, &lt;2,500–3000&gt; bound: 84 new wallets staked between 2,500 and 3,000 ETW. For comparison, there were only 42 additional wallets staking under 500&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot 3&nbsp;insights <p>EWT staking in the Consortia pool continues to be consistent, which is exactly the intention behind the design of the snapshot mechanism. This is evidenced by the balance distribution of all snapshots and <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0x181A8b2a5AEb25941F6A79b4aE43dBb1968c417A/coin-balances#address-tabs">EWT balances in the staking contract</a>:</p><p>Such consistent staking will provide a high degree of economic cybersecurity to all enterprise-grade Energy Web solutions (for more information on the connection between consistent staking, cybersecurity, and Energy Web solutions, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">please review our announcement on the upcoming Consortia chain</a>).</p><p>Before the end of the year, there will be 3 more Snapshots taken at random blocks. Patrons who receive at least 1 Snapshot will qualify for additional rewards. The rewards will be calculated and distributed after the Consortia staking pool ends. Again, since variable rewards are impossible to predict, the best strategy for all patrons is to stake as high a balance as possible and do so consistently.</p><p>Also read: <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-ewt-consortia-relay-staking-snapshots-insights-32675cdd20db">Energy Web Token (EWT) Consortia Relay Staking Snapshots Insights part&nbsp;1</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

 Collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!) <p>In a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, we looked at a typology of Open Source communities. This got us thinking about other indicators that could be plotted against one another on 2x2 grids. Tools like this are useful when deciding as a community how you want to interact.</p><p>The idea here is not to precisely define reality, but rather paint a broad-brushstroke picture of the kind of community that you want to create. Then you can think about kind of platforms, tools, and processes that might enable&nbsp;that.</p><p>Let’s start with an&nbsp;example:</p>CC BY&nbsp;WAO<p>In the above diagram, we’re plotting how formal the community is (or will be) against how private it is. LinkedIn, in the top-right quadrant, is an example of a ‘formal’ space that is based on reputation. It’s widely accepted as a ‘professional’ platform, and users are associated with their ‘real’ work identities.</p><p>So if you are creating a community that fits with this way of understanding the world, LinkedIn might be a great platform. However, if you’re creating a community where people prefer to remain anonymous and have an informal chat, you might use something in the bottom-left quadrant such as&nbsp;Reddit.</p><p>So let’s take another example. If we plot ‘Scale’ (as in how large you want the community to potentially get) with ‘Intentionality’ (i.e. deciding in advance what it’s for) then you might get something like&nbsp;this:</p><p>This is similar in some ways to the 2x2 grid from our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, except it’s focused on social relationships rather than audience. Its value comes in being explicit about the goals of the community, all the while bearing in mind that groups can morph from one into&nbsp;another.</p><p>The reason this is important as it helps current and potential community members have a mental model of what’s going on, helping them be on the same page as their peers. Someone joining a ‘Club’ when they thought they were joining a ‘Movement’ is likely to be disappointed, and vice-versa.</p><p>During our brainstorming sessions around this, we came up with plenty of examples of X and Y axes you could use to plot 2x2 grids. We’re still thinking about this, but so far have three buckets around Interaction, Identity, and Intention.</p> Interaction   Infrequent posting vs Frequent&nbsp;posting  Maintaining existing relationships vs Building new relationships  Low support requirements vs High support requirements  Asynchronous vs Synchronous   Identity   Informal vs&nbsp;Formal  Anonymous vs Reputational  Social vs Professional  Single group identity vs Multiple groups /&nbsp;factions   Intention   Thematic vs Goal-oriented  Receiving updates vs&nbsp;Learning  Small scale vs Large&nbsp;scale  Place-based vs Non-geographical  <p>As ever when it comes to community work, it’s the conversations around these grids that are the most interesting. These are all different lenses you can use to imagine a new community or look at an existing one. At the end of the day, they do not describe ‘objective reality’ but rather collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!)</p><p>What other labels could you come up with? What other lenses can you produce to help you conceptualise your community? 🤔</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-2x2-grids-for-open-source-community-development-b3a3824b1682">Using 2x2 grids for Open Source community development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

It says nothing about how code is produced. “Open source” projects have nothing more in common with one another than “companies” do. All companies, by definition, produce something of value that is exchanged for money, but we don’t assume that every company has the same business model.&nbsp;(p.54)</blockquote><p>So if we can’t easily refer to ‘Open Source communities’ in general, how are we to understand them?</p><p>There are many different scenarios for Open Source projects and the communities around them. One of the most useful parts of Working in Public is a typology based around comparing user growth with contributor growth.</p>Original image from ‘Working in&nbsp;Public’<p>The version of this typology below is WAO’s interpretation, which flips the columns in the original to make the high contributor growth and high user growth appear in the top-right quadrant. This is to make it easier to read. We also rename ‘toy’ projects as ‘side’ projects to avoid being dismissive of some types of Open Source projects.</p>Image CC BY WAO, based on ‘Working in Public’ by Nadia&nbsp;Eghbal<p>Taking each in&nbsp;turn:</p>  🛹 Side projects — low contributor growth and low user growth. These kind of projects serve to scratch an itch or made just for fun. This is not to say that they can’t be used for more serious activities, but that the original intention wasn’t to scale. Usually, there’s only a single ‘project lead’ (although even that term seems a bit too formal) and it’s unlikely anyone else really uses the product. As a result, there doesn’t really need to be much governance.  👥️ Clubs — high contributor growth but low user growth. These kind of projects tend to be a group of people working on something that may be potentially niche but personally or professionally relevant. Most users in this scenario will also be contributors and they are collectively scratching an itch. There is likely to be more governance and collective decision-making necessary around this kind of&nbsp;project.  🏟️ Stadiums — low contributor growth but high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be either super-niche projects which nevertheless are relied on as infrastructure or popular projects because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction">parasocial</a> (i.e. one-sided) relationship between ‘creator’ and ‘audience’. Although there will be many ideas and suggestions as part of this community, in terms of governance it’s likely that a very small number of people, make the decisions.  🔱 Federations — high contributor growth and high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be larger and more mature projects which may be backed by an incorporated organisation. As a result, they are more likely to have a governance model which includes established procedures such as decision-making workflows.  <p>This quadrant-based approach is a broad-brushstroke attempt to roughly define how a project sits relative to others. The boundaries are&nbsp;fuzzy:</p><blockquote>The difference between these project models is not precisely defined. At either extreme, we can see clear differences. We can say that Linux, a project with multiple subprojects and working groups, does not look like tslib, a small helper library for the programming language TypeScript. But the middle is a little murky. There are some projects with four or five maintainers, and other projects with many contributors who are not deeply involved. (p.77)</blockquote><p>Eghbal’s focus is mainly on technical projects which are hosted on GitHub, but I think this is much more widely applicable to some of our client and community work. I’m looking forward to applying this as I think it helps clarify thinking around governance in particular.</p><p>For example, presenting the four different types of community around a project makes it easier to ask whether the project lead conceptualises the community as more of a club or a&nbsp;stadium?</p><p>If you need some help with your community, get in touch!

   Scotland's Blockchain sector has blossomed from nothing into a major global presence.

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>When I first started this site a few years back Scotland’s Blockchain industry was non-existent. 
 Given it’s critical role as a foundation technology for a digital society this was disappointing and concerning. 
<p>On <a href="https://podcasts.scot/episode/scotland-europes-blockchain-capital/">a podcast</a> in 2021 Zumopay stated the lofty ambition for Scotland to become Europe’s Blockchain capital, and this would have seemed like nothing more than a pipe dream.</p>
<p>However when you consider the evolution of the sector over just the last year or two, you can see that the roots have formed such that this is actually now an achievable goal.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
 
 Zumopay themselves are of course a keynote exemplar.

 CD Corp is making the very smart move to specialize in helping small businesses integrate NFT’s into their business model. Following on from their <a href="https://digitalscot.net/whisky-on-the-blockchain/">Whisky Barrel client win</a> they just <a href="https://twitter.com/cdcorp__/status/1573000432317878272">announced a new project</a> with Aberfam. 
 In Nov 2020 <a href="https://siccar.net/siccar-connects-with-par-equity-to-secure-a-1-3m-investment-round/">Siccar raised</a> a £1.3m funding round, and in July 2021 Blockchain Technology Partners <a href="https://medium.com/blockchaintp/blockchain-technology-partners-raises-2-million-seed-round-led-by-force-over-mass-and-signature-865e346ece10">raised £2m</a>. Both specialize in the massive enterprise Blockchain market, addressing requirements such as secure data sharing and distributed ledger, smart contract, provenance, and cloud technologies. 
 Nov 2021 – Carbon Based Lifeforms <a href="https://scottishgames.net/2021/11/16/project-gateway-returns-with-1-7m-funding-for-blockchain-based-mmo/">launched</a> as a new game studio with $1.7m funding, announcing Project Gateway, a MMO/RPG underpinned by a Bitcoin and NFT asset-based play-to-earn, player-owned market economy. 
 Executives from one of Scotland’s giant tech successes Fanduel have also expanded into the sector, launching <a href="https://vault.fan/">Vault</a> and <a href="https://www.betdex.com/">BetDEX</a>. Both are innovating atop the Solana Blockchain platform, building a creator platform where fans unlock access to exclusive content by owning the key to a creator’s vault and a decentralized sports betting exchange. 
 
<p>A relatively short list but the breadth and depth of these ventures is considerable, each market they serve alone is very large, from enterprise technologies through global betting.&nbsp;BetDEX in particular is the heavyweight player, raising a massive <a href="https://www.betdex.com/post/former-fanduel-executives-launch-betdex">$21m seed round</a> from world-class investors and leading the development of the <a href="https://beststartup.scot/monaco-protocol-provides-foundation-for-web3-sports-betting-applications/">Monaco sports betting protocol</a>.</p>
 What more can we do? 
<p>Given this leap from nothing to a very significant industry footprint it begs the question what more can we do? If this is ‘first gear’ for Scotland’s Blockchain industry, what would it look like to step up through gears two, three and beyond, what benefits would that bring and how can we make it happen?</p>
<p>Naturally each is focused on their individual business success, but what could be achieved if we consolidated our efforts to grow their collective success and further expand the industry as a whole?</p>

 The single most important project relative to the goals of the Scottish Blockchain Network has been pioneered by <a href="https://www.thewhiskybarrel.com/">The Whisky Barrel</a> and their tech experts <a href="https://cdcorp.co.uk/">CD Corp</a>. 
<p>It’s so important because the primary challenge the industry faces is that it can be an extremely confusing, jargon-filled sector, to the extent it’s perceived as a very cliquey community populated only by hard-core techies and is thus inaccessible, and critically, irrelevant to others especially businesses.</p>
<p>Therefore’s it’s essential to showcase case studies that explain in plain english how businesses are adopting the technology, what use case it has been employed for and what benefits this has brought the company.</p>
<p>The Whisky Barrel project demonstrates i) how they have integrated it into and enhanced their e-commerce strategy, and ii) the technology field is still so young that it’s possible to achieve world firsts, and thus significant competitive advantage and associated PR potential.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/scotch-whisky-bottler-releases-one-26433299">Insider reported</a> they have released one of the world’s first single-cask Scotch whiskies with a digital provenance certificate, using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to digitally certify its whisky, which securely transmits essential product information on a public ledger, helping collectors and connoisseurs alleviate the risk of investing in counterfeit whisky.</p>
<p>Each of the 152 individually-numbered bottles feature a unique QR code that links to its corresponding digital certificate. This token provides digital proof of ownership, as well as the provenance of each bottle.&nbsp;Each NFT is minted on the Solana blockchain platform, which was chosen for its carbon-neutral and low-energy consumption qualities.</p>

<p>In July, we published our report exploring the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/">intersections of digital rights, tech, and climate justice</a>. It’s been wonderful to hear from readers on what findings from our research you’ve found useful for your own work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’d like to keep the exchange going with an interactive discussion sharing our main findings and collaboratively plotting a course for further future work in this urgent area, so we’re hosting a community call October 18, at 5-6pm CET. Whether you’re working primarily in the climate justice space or the digital rights space, or are just interested in the topic, we’d love to see you there!&nbsp;</p>



 What will we discuss? 



<p>In our research, we focused on a number of intersections of digital rights and climate justice, and identified priority areas for further digital rights engagement and collaboration. In the call, we want to hone in on two 2 specific issue areas with you:</p>



  Climate intelligence: From long-standing environmental data initiatives to newer ‘AI for climate’ and ‘AI for planet’ efforts, governments, corporations and communities seek to harness digital data to monitor biodiversity and forecast future climate events with greater accuracy. How do you think the digital rights community can best support existing community-driven efforts and deepen its engagement on AI and sustainability issues? How might <a href="https://responsibledata.io/2018/01/24/rd-101-responsible-data-principles/" title="responsible data principles">responsible data principles</a> contribute to data governance discussions in this space?  Decarbonizing tech: In recent years, a number of tech companies have pledged carbon neutrality and greater sustainability. Yet, meaningfully measuring and mitigating the climate and environmental impacts of tech remains a challenge. What do you think are the main priorities for digital rights community engagement to ensure tech sustainability efforts are supporting climate justice?&nbsp;  



<p>To register for this session, please <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZElcu6rqTsiE9z0boxWoZPyIMeMZTb0l21D">sign up here</a>. The call will happen on October 18, at 5-6pm CET and it will be held in English.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This article explains how verifiable credentials can be used to benefit event organizers and visitors alike based on a practical usage of the Lissi&nbsp;team.</p> Introduction <p>Currently, the majority of event tickets are issued in paper form or as&nbsp;.pdf files, which contain the relevant information about the event as well as the visitor. However, since these files can be easily transferred to another person, a personalisation of the ticket in combination with a verification of an identity document at the entrance is required to ensure that the buyer and visitor are the same person. This creates unnecessary overhead and complications for both the visitor and organizer. Therefore, we propose using verifiable credentials to avoid ticket scalping and provide direct access to online resources with the&nbsp;ticket.</p> Benefits of using verifiable credentials for&nbsp;tickets   Ownership binding and verifiability — tickets are bound to a specific owner and are not transferable  Prevention of ticket fraud — tickets are digitally signed by an&nbsp;issuer  Usage of the ticket for authentication (e.g. to access a digital stream, online presentations etc.) — Your ticket is your username and password!  Avoiding ticket scalping and ticket bots and therefore retain control over the secondary market — tickets are bound to a specific person and are not transferable  Directly communicate with a user in a messenger like way — a peer-to-peer connection between the event organizer or ticketing provider is being established and can be used for the exchange of further information  Cheap and convenient user identification and the possibility to verify multiple credentials at the same time (e.g. ticket, covid test, studentID, etc.)   How it&nbsp;works: <p>The user registers for an event via a website. For our pilot integration we used an established ticketing provider for the registration process. However, this process can also be fully executed based on decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. We sent an e-mail containing the required steps to derive the ticket into a wallet, which supports verifiable credentials. The following screens illustrate the process of receiving the ticket and presenting it to a verifier such as an access control authority at a physical&nbsp;event.</p>Illustration of the user flow of using the event ticket with&nbsp;Lissi. The verification process <p>As illustrated in the flow the access authority presents an QR-code, which is scanned by the visitor. Once scanned with the wallet, the visitor is requested to share his or her ticket (as well as additional information if required). Given the visitor agrees to share the information the verification status (valid / invalid) is presented as well as the attributes of the ticket. The access authority can use any device, which supports a web application (such as an laptop, mobile phone etc.) to verify the tickets of the&nbsp;visitor.</p> Our experience with verifiable tickets <p>We used verifiable tickets as part of our monthly <a href="https://neosfer.de/events">Between the Towers</a> event series. It was visited by around 70 people. While the download of the Lissi Wallet and derivation of the verifiable ticket was optional, more than 90 percent of visitors got the verifiable ticket in advance. While there were minor user experience issues (mainly due to work profiles on the phone) the vast majority of visitors were very satisfied with the user experience.</p><p>During the verification process most of the users started to show the verifiable credential within the wallet instead of directly scanning the QR-code presented, because the concept of scanning a QR-code to present a credential isn’t intuitive to users yet. However, once users present a credential with the wallet they understand how the process&nbsp;works.</p> Possible expansion for future&nbsp;events:   Identification of the visitor in advance of the ticket purchase.  Issuance of a picture of the visitor as part of the&nbsp;ticket.  Usage of the ticket for the authentication (login) to an online platform.  Communication with the&nbsp;visitor  Provision of further information to the visitor via direct communication channel  Usage of the ticket for discounted access (e.g. 10 % discount for the ticket next&nbsp;year)  <p>If you are interested in diving deeper into the topic, the research paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12525-022-00573-9.pdf">Exploring the use of self‑sovereign identity for event ticketing systems</a>” by Simon Feulner, Johannes Sedlmeir, Vincent Schlatt and Nils Urbach will provide a great overview.</p><p>We would be delighted to hear your ideas about the usage of verifiable tickets in your next events.

   It’s a great pleasure to share with you DINZ Reflections Report, a seminal piece of work that DINZ’s Digital Identity Trust Framework working group has developed over several months.

<p>It’s a great pleasure to share with you&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report-DISTF-1.pdf">DINZ Reflections Report</a>, a seminal piece of work that DINZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/dinz-distf-working-group/">Digital Identity Trust Framework working group</a>&nbsp;has developed over several months. While Trust Frameworks are not a novel concept, their application to the digital identity space is much more recent, and new to Aotearoa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report-DISTF-1.pdf">DINZ’s Reflections Report</a>&nbsp;is industry’s response to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/reports/document/SCR_122616/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Final Report</a>&nbsp;published in April by the Select Committee members of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee that responds to and makes recommendations based on the submissions made on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/LMS459583.html?src=qs">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bil</a>l at the end of last year. The Select Committee is not expert in the subject matter of Digital Identity Trust Frameworks. However DINZ does have essential subject matter and operational expertise with an inherent obligation to share its experience for better outcomes in Aotearoa. DINZ welcomes the continued passage of the bill through Parliament recognising that the opportunity to change it substantially during this period is small. It is more likely that the detail contained in the DINZ Reflections Report will be considered once the regulatory operation of the Act is underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a classic example of the demonstrable value of DINZ – Aotearoa’s own digital identity industry association – and for that matter all associations operating under the&nbsp;<a href="https://techalliance.nz/">NZ Tech Alliance</a>&nbsp;banner. DINZ’s members comprise both local and international digital identity service providers, providers of identity and eligibility attributes, relying parties and individual subject matter experts. Many have first-hand overseas experience of Trust Framework operations in digital identity and in other domains that can inform the future of Trust Framework operations and conversations around&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2022/07/15/leading-the-digital-trust-conversation/">Digital Trust</a>&nbsp;more broadly in Aotearoa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Be it submissions, responses to consultation papers, or reports like this&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report_DISTF.pdf">Reflections Report</a>, each participating member leaves their vested interest at the door to voluntarily pool their skills and knowledge in pursuit of better outcomes for all New Zealanders.</p>

The ERN is first and foremost a network of people interested in pursuing this goal, and who use and manage the campus and regional research computing, data, storage and network resources that can make it happen.</p>
<p>Vision &amp; Mission<br>
The vision of the ERN is to simplify, support, catalyze, and foster multi-campus collaborations and partnerships between academic institutions of all types and sizes across the U.S. that advance the frontiers of research, pedagogy, and innovation. The mission of the ERN is to achieve this vision through a consortium of academic institutions, research facilities, core service providers, network providers, and industry partners, both public and private, organized around a shared interest in supporting and enabling collaborative data and computation enabled science/ This is accomplished by providing standards, blueprints, policies, and training associated with the design and implementation of an infrastructure to access data and research instruments, a distributed federated environment designed to simplify, support, catalyze, and foster collaborative science, scholarship, and education. To realize our mission and vision, the ERN will enable collaborations for democratization of access to research instruments, technical expertise, infrastructure, services, and resources to lower barriers to participation for scientists engaged&nbsp; in collaborative research across institutional and disciplinary boundaries.</p>
<p>ERN Evolution<br>
The ERN was formed in 2017 to address the challenges researchers face when participating in multi-campus team science projects, associated with shared access to research computing and data located within the national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem. The ERN began as a regional effort for two principal reasons: (1) a desire for face-to-face interactions and physical proximity to and access to shared instruments, and (2) a desire to serve the unique characteristics of our region—for example, the Northeast contains eight different state university systems in a geographic area whose size is comparable to that of the state of California, with nine different regional network providers, and close to two-thousand colleges and universities of all types and sizes, many of which are under-resourced or under-represented. As the ERN has grown, we came to realize that by addressing the challenges which we felt were&nbsp; unique to the region, expanding our scope beyond the Northeast would not entail significant new logistical challenges and may, in fact, be more effectively pursued at the national level.</p>
<p>More recently, the ERN expanded its scope after interactions with several research communities led to the realization that the ERN needed to treat physical scientific instruments such as telescopes, research vessels, genome sequencers, and scanning electron microscopes similarly to research computing, storage, and networking in cyberinfrastructure planning. There is a need to access, move, store, and process the massive amounts of data generated by scientific instruments, and to access instruments remotely through federated services available to both researchers and their collaborators. Through interactions with the scientific and cyberinfrastructure communities, the ERN learned that these capabilities are often an afterthought when installing and commissioning new instruments, which can limit the value of major investments and lead to complications when sharing access the instruments and data there from. The ERN is now working on developing a federated solution to enable academic institutions to offer core services to the broader U.S. scientific community.</p>
<p>The ERN core activities:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Organizing and/or supporting working groups focused on areas of interest to the community. 
 Facilitating Workshops for deep dive explorations of cross-working group areas of interest. 
 Hosting yearly All Hands Meetings to bring the community together to give updates and discuss future initiatives. 
 Offering recommendations on data standards, architectural blueprints, and policies. 
 Enabling delivery of training on topics related to new and emerging technologies and applications relevant to current areas of interest to ERN stakeholders. 
 
<p>Results of workshops, including findings and recommendations are shared with the broader community through publications and regional and national conference presentations. For example, three ERN papers were presented at the PEARC22 Annual Conference and the “ERN Cryo-EM Federated Instrument Pilot Project” paper received Best Short Paper. In addition to workshops, the ERN, along with its partners, offers a Data Science Seminar Series hands-on training of various software applications focusing on the support of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence workflow methodology.&nbsp; The workshops are open to anyone in the research community with emphasis on the&nbsp; MSIs, HSIs, HBUCs, and EPSCoR institutions. Compute resources necessary for the on-hand efforts are made available to all participants and moderating support personnel address questions or issues.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>When Rowan University began their search for a candidate to lead the next chapter of the College of Science &amp; Mathematics, there were several characteristics that were essential to filling this dean role. The University sought a leader who is collaborative, adaptive, and has a passion for use-inspired research, as well as someone who could bring a wealth of knowledge and experience in both teaching and research. Meeting all of these requirements and more, Dr. Vojislava Pophristic joined Rowan University in July 2021 and began her mission of helping to further build the institution’s academic excellence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming from a background in which both research and teaching played prominent roles, Pophristic was a chemistry professor and chair as well as the interim dean of the Misher College of Arts and Sciences at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. Drawn to chemistry and physics for as long as she can remember, Pophristic says she became interested in how the laws of physics govern chemical processes and structures. “During my Ph.D. studies, I was attracted to computational chemistry because the discipline allows researchers to play outside the limitations that are imposed by the real world. Using this virtual chemistry playground, we can shed important light on the natural and synthetic structures and processes, without the obstacles that experiments often have. When these two areas come together—experimental and computational—they can give a much more complete picture than one approach could on its own.”</p>
<p>Revolutionizing Science and Math Education<br>
Pophristic earned her Bachelor of Science degree in physical chemistry from the University of Belgrade, Serbia, and later, a doctorate in chemistry from Rutgers University, New Brunswick. She also was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Chemistry and Center for Molecular Modeling at the University of Pennsylvania. “Coming to Rowan was a natural progression for me.” explains Pophristic. “Moving into this role at this time is particularly exciting because the impeding transformation of higher education. Rowan is uniquely positioned to be at the forefront of this transformation in science and mathematics, with its rich environment, 17 colleges and schools, including 2 medical schools, a veterinary school in development, highly-ranked engineering college, and a commitment to its community, regional workforce, and global sustainability.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Dean of Science &amp; Mathematics, Pophristic has three top strategic priorities, including strengthening use-inspired research, transforming science and math education for the 21st century, and increasing access, retention, and success for underrepresented minority students in STEM. “We have embarked on growing our research efforts in the areas of regional, national, and global challenges,” says Pophristic. “Transforming math and science education to meet the needs of today is essential, but we must also look toward the future and anticipate the nature of work in the world of rapidly evolving technology, in particular artificial intelligence. This transformation will require that we think differently about program content and structure, delivery methods, credentialing, and how we integrate data sciences, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computing into the education for scientists.”</p>
<p>Pophristic recognizes the access and retention of underrepresented minorities as a national challenge and one all institutions must address. “The first bottleneck is access; increasing it is critical. However, just as important are developing approaches to support retention and foster successful professional careers, particularly in STEM. Rowan is positioned well to address these areas: with its accessibility and affordability pillars, 2+2 and 3+1 programs with community colleges, and its location, it can grow and reshape the STEM workforce in southern New Jersey in unique ways. We will continue to develop and strengthen our programs to increase retention and give students the tools they need to have meaningful and successful careers in science after they leave our campus.”</p>
<p>Building Academic Excellence<br>
Rowan University is the fourth fastest growing public university, with science and mathematics acting as major players in this progression. “As an economic engine for Southern New Jersey, Rowan is expanding rapidly in research and innovation,” explains Pophristic. “I wish to capitalize on this momentum and enrich research and education efforts, and provide support to students and faculty that will help solve global and national challenges such as those in health and life sciences, sustanability, and cybersecurity. Our focus is on fostering interdisciplinary research by building tighter integration between science and mathematics, and other Rowan schools and colleges. We also plan to support economic development and further build the STEM workforce by increasing our interactions with industry, health organizations, and other entities in our region.”</p>
<p>Rowan is among many institutions that are looking at ways to transform undergraduate education to provide students with the necessary knowledge and skill sets required not only for today’s workforce, but in the professions of tomorrow. “The careers that our current or incoming students will have in ten years do not exist now, so what our graduates will be doing a decade from now is unknown,” says Pophristic. “With the line blurring between traditional sciences and an unprecedented rate in technology development, we must think about education in entirely new ways. While there is a lot we do not know about how the fields of STEM will look in the future, we can be certain that data, computation, interdisciplinary themes, and a focus on scientific questions rather than on disciplines will be its critical elements.”</p>
<p>With a focus of restructuring education to better incorporate scientific problem-solving in the interdisciplinary domain, Pophristic wishes to integrate unique human skills, such as ethics, cultural competencies, and knowledge about the environment into the math and science curriculum. “To a large extent, we are now educating students for complex skills and knowledge.” says Pophristic. “We need to wrap our heads around the fact that repetitive tasks, regardless of how complex they are, will be shifting to machines. Thus, our focus should move to discovery, innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship, communication, and other uniquely human abilities, that machines will never be able to do as well as humans. We need to be intentional in integrating these elements, and areas like data, computing, and artificial intelligence, with modern science education and practice.”</p>
<p>Expanding Interdisciplinary Research<br>
As Rowan continues to transform and raise the University’s competitiveness for research, Pophristic says many opportunities are on the horizon. “Rowan has two medical schools, is opening a veterinary school, and has a strong biomedical engineering program. We also just partnered with Virtua Health System, providing numerous possibilities in life sciences. All disciplines in the College of Science and Mathematics are part of this life science road, with each one being critical for developing our overarching knowledge. Areas like statistics, data science, applied mathematics, biophysics, material science, biology, psychology, and chemistry—all critically contribute to life sciences. We are embracing these opportunities and growing with them. For example, this year we opened the Ph.D. in pharmaceutical chemistry, and within the first month, we had eight students in the program.”</p>
<p>Oftentimes when growth is rapid within an institution, challenges can accompany the positive changes. “Just 25 years ago, Rowan was a college primarily focused on teaching; we’ve risen to an R2 university, and we are now quickly approaching R1 status,” says Pophristic. “We are continuing to build the infrastructure to support this growth, while ensuring that relevant entities in the wider community are aware of Rowan’s capabilities and connected to us. The complex problems we are facing today can’t be solved by one scientist or a group of scientists from one discipline, or by academicians alone. Collaborations will expand beyond a chemist and a biologist working together.&nbsp; We’ll need sociologists, psychologists, engineers, basic scientists, applied mathematicians, artists, and others. We will need industry partners, government and non-profit entities, community involvement, all on the same team to tackle these complex problems that the world is facing now.”</p>
<p>Pophristic continues, “Rowan would greatly benefit from organizations such as Edge to keep us informed of new developments, technologies, and resources, and help us make better informed decisions as we grow our infrastructure. Additionally, Edge’s activities in gathering stakeholders to interact and strategize, as well as fostering collaborations between institutions, are highly valuable for Rowan and our expansion in scientific computing.”</p>

		<p>Excelling in Scientific Computing<br>
With scientific computing having a transformative and growing importance in both research and education, Rowan aims to become a leader in computational science and help students develop critical skills that are needed to keep the business world running. “As a comprehensive university, Big Data computing is essential for the development of sciences, engineering, health, and social sciences; among others,” says Pophristic. “Rowan has a number of computational scientists in various colleges and departments, including Bioinformatics, Data Science, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Engineering, Environmental Science, and Geography. We have strategic initiatives in place that are focused on providing infrastructural support to researchers, training for students, streamlined resources—both hardware and software–and programmatic resources for developing collaborations between computational and experimental scientists. We not only want to become a leader in scientific computing in research, but also excel at integrating this discipline into our undergraduate education.”</p>
<p>To support these research and education priorities, Pophristic says working together is key. “We have celebrated many important milestones, such as the acquisition of the high performance computing cluster in 2015 and later the purchase of a cluster with 59 nodes through grant funds. In both instances, we see faculty working across departments and colleges, but also researchers working with various funding sources to purchase the necessary infrastructure. We are currently working on a model that will allow us to organize and align our efforts to provide access to shared resources and create synergy across Rowan. Our goal is to establish a structure that will allow sustainable growth and integration of computing in various disciplines and colleges.”</p>
<p>Pophristic says organizing researchers in a center structure allows the University to share purchases, streamline maintenance of hardware and software, and enable the timely replacement of hardware. “We’ve combined the know-how of computational scientists and IT professionals and we are able to provide more efficient training for students.&nbsp; The way forward is to form the Center for Scientific Computing by creating a centralized computing facility as a shared platform for researchers across Rowan. Such a facility will provide efficiency in computing power, dedicated support personnel, efficient maintenance and replacement of infrastructure, and offer a platform for streamlined training of new users and the facilitation of interdisciplinary corroboration.”</p>
<p>The centralized facility will have dedicated personnel who will work together with faculty to help develop and execute research projects and educational programs. “We will have faculty and IT members working together on different aspects of computing,” explains Pophristic. “The Center will design programs that bring together researchers from different disciplines through seminars, workshops, and corporate events. We are also going to roll out regular workshops to train students and other users on basic scientific computing skills.”</p>
<p>“The NSF-funded Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) planning grant, Advanced Cyberinfrastructure for Teaching and Research at Rowan University and the Southern New Jersey Region, will be instrumental in identifying the needs of the Rowan research community and its partners, and helping to shape the vision for research computing and the Rowan University cyberinfrastructure strategic plan. In addition to the Edge-Rowan partnership on the project, as a co-PI, a highlight for me is the collaborative spirit of the Rowan team in finding solutions that will impact not only Rowan’s researchers, but will help advance research initiatives of partner institutions within the broader community,” states Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Edge’s Associate Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Pophristic says Rowan has a great opportunity to intensify its efforts in attracting and retaining a diverse group of students and helping more students of color have successful careers in STEM, and in particular, in computer science and computing. “We must provide students with the necessary knowledge, expertise, and soft skills to thrive in the workforce. Rowan already provides several programs for minority high school students in southern New Jersey and we want to continue to create more opportunities. There are truly transformative majors in higher education, and computer science is one of them. Not only can this discipline be life-changing for the student, but for the entire family, because of the highly competitive compensation that these students receive after graduation. We look to not only give students a superior education, but the confidence and support they need to progress through the program and enter a career in STEM with the skills and inspiration they need to make a positive impact on the world.”</p>

		<p>As a Carnegie-classified national doctoral research institution, Rowan University is renowned for their research expertise and exploration of groundbreaking innovations that could improve and advance society. With many competitive grant awards, Rowan continues to promote research activity both on campus and throughout the community. Along with an esteemed group of research advocates, Dr. Tabbetha Dobbins, Vice President for Research and Dean of the Graduate School, Rowan University, aims to address the challenge of building cyberinfrastructure (CI) and effectively supporting the diverse computational needs of Rowan’s students and faculty. To help advance this initiative, the group was recently awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Planning Grant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project, known as the CC* Planning: Advanced Cyberinfrastructure for Teaching and Research at Rowan University and the Southern New Jersey Region, will focus on strategic planning that creates a coordinated approach to informing the community of the latest CI developments, enables partnerships between institutions, and assists Rowan in building shared and accessible CI. “This grant gives us an opportunity to write a 5-year cyberinfrastructure plan using information from our own campuses and from Edge and their partners,” says Dobbins, the project’s Principal Investigator.</p>
<p>“When I first became vice president, Dr. Forough Ghahramani was such a valuable resource and shared information about CC* grant opportunities,” explains Dobbins. “We decided on this grant and joined forces with three co-Principal Investigators including, Dr. David Klassen, Professor and Chair of College of Science and Mathematics; Dr. Nidhal Bouaynaya, Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies; and Dr. Mira Lalovic-Hand, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer. Our partner institutions are Rowan College at Burlington County (RCBC), Rowan College of South Jersey (RCSJ), and Stockton University. This project really began with Dr. Ghahramani and she was able to expand the list of potential resources, like the Eastern Regional Network (ERN), that Rowan could tap into as we develop our plan. Dr. Lalovic-Hand and her team have also been a committed part of the project since its inception from the grant writing stage, all the way through to the workshops and collecting feedback from presenters and participants.”</p>
<p>Creating an Effective CI Strategy<br>
The awarded Rowan CC* Planning Grant will invest in coordinated campus-level networking and CI improvement, innovation, integration, and engineering for science applications and distributed research projects. The project has three distinct components to create a thorough and effective CI strategy: a survey, a focus group, and education. “Our goal is to be a regional service to all computational researchers in the region,” explains Dobbins. “We want to begin by surveying our researchers and the Division of Information Resources &amp; Technology (IRT) to better understand what their needs and perceptions are of our current cyberinfrastructure. The focus group will then allow a deeper dive into that survey. We will meet with the stakeholders—the researchers, faculty, and students—and the university-level administration. We will also gather input from the support group inside the IRT to gain a clear picture of their vision for the cyberinfrastructure plan.”</p>
<p>For the education component, the group will be inviting speakers from Rutgers who currently have a research cluster to discuss their projects and the resources available. “We realize our high-performance computing (HPC) is quite outdated and we have researchers working on their own home-built clusters, with minimal use of our campus-wide HPC,” explains Dobbins. “There are other developments that have come along to help researchers with their projects, including cloud-based services. One of our speakers spoke to faculty and students about the Cyberteam to Advance Research and Education in Eastern Regional Schools (CAREERS). The group could receive training in ways to support computing-based research and faculty members could recruit students for mentoring opportunities on their individual research projects. We will be hosting additional presentations in the coming months to further inform our students and faculty about all the exciting resources available for advancing research and innovation.”</p>
	 
 



   
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				       
	 
		 
		 
			
 
	 
		<p>“When I first became vice president, Dr. Forough Ghahramani was such a valuable resource and shared information about CC* grant opportunities. We decided on this grant and joined forces with three co-Principal Investigators including, Dr. David Klassen, Professor and Chair of College of Science and Mathematics; Dr. Nidhal Bouaynaya, Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies; and Dr. Mira Lalovic-Hand, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer. Our partner institutions are Rowan College at Burlington County (RCBC), Rowan College of South Jersey (RCSJ), and Stockton University. This project really began with Dr. Ghahramani and she was able to expand the list of potential resources, like the Eastern Regional Network (ERN), that Rowan could tap into as we develop our plan. Dr. Lalovic-Hand and her team have also been a committed part of the project since its inception from the grant writing stage, all the way through to the workshops and collecting feedback from presenters and participants.”</p>

		<p>Developing a Coordinated Approach<br>
When creating a CI strategy, many organizations focus predominantly on hardware and access to software, as well as the staff who will support these elements, but Dobbins says input from the administration is equally as important. “Our University’s administration will be involved in our focus group sessions to help determine how to allocate internal resources and to discuss the most suitable location for research computational support personnel within our organization. As we begin to put the CI plan together, we must determine how the overhead return from grants, for instance, are distributed to various units. If we need to change that formula so a slice of that funding goes to supporting future computational infrastructure, we would need university-level buy-in. We must create a robust financial model that doesn’t put computational research expenses entirely on the University or entirely on the researchers themselves. Creating this shared structure will be an important part of our discussions moving forward.”</p>
<p>After the survey and focus groups are completed and information is gathered from the seminar series, the group will begin writing the CI plan. “All of our data collection should be completed by August 2022,” says Dobbins. “The presentations may continue beyond that time, but the writing of the CI plan will take place between August and December of this year. The implementation of the CI plan, including financial support of CI and access to hardware and software, will be conducted at Rowan, but we hope to be a service to our community college affiliates and other regional universities and remove barriers for accessing state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure. Collaboratively, we can conduct larger scale transformative work and help more institutions to make a notable impact in data-driven computational research.”</p>

		<p>Following a comprehensive national search in 2020, Kean University selected Lamont O. Repollet, Ed.D. as its 18th president and the institution’s first Black president. The Kean alumnus and former Kean trustee is tasked with transforming the institution’s competitiveness for research grants and has vowed to elevate the University to Carnegie R2 research status within the next five years. In November 2021, Kean University joined the list of elite public research universities with its designation as the state’s first urban research university. This achievement will help to provide more opportunities for residents living in urban communities and will further expand the reach of Kean’s research and creative projects within art, science, and humanities. “Our value-driven mission is to become a national model for urban research universities across the country,” says Repollet. “With this prestigious designation, Kean is now well-positioned to test knowledge and research in every field and apply these findings to real-world issues facing our urban communities.”</p>
<p>Investing in Expanding Research<br>
An important element in transforming Kean into a research university included investing in human capital and adding new tenure-track faculty across multiple disciplines. “While many institutions were cutting back on faculty and staff during the pandemic, we looked to grow our number of educators,” shares Repollet. “By this fall, more than a quarter of our full-time faculty will have joined us within the past two years. We’re also offering faculty grants to allow researchers to embark on projects that focus on urban issues and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Additionally, we have redirected faculty bandwidths to allow more time for research collaboration and provide participation opportunities for a greater number of students. By showcasing our students’ accomplishments, we inspire excitement and interest in our research and can take collaborative opportunities to new heights.”</p>
<p>Under Repollet’s leadership, Kean has also invested in research equipment and infrastructure. “Our commitment to our faculty and expanding our research footprint is shown through our budget and how we’re allocating funds,” says Repollet. “We are also expanding our network of affiliated startup companies and building the infrastructure for the commercialization of our intellectual property that has yielded several U.S. patents in areas such as computer science. To achieve our goal of making research more inclusive, Kean is partnering with government organizations on research initiatives that support their work. When we tell our students, ‘You can conduct research that affects your world,’ we truly mean their world. We are exploring everything from education, disparities in health care, and economic challenges within these communities. We want to leverage our capabilities to be a part of the solution to the issues impacting New Jersey’s residents, particularly in our urban centers.”</p>
<p>Building Pillars of Success<br>
Since taking office, Repollet has focused on propelling the University forward by ensuring success within three pillars: safety, academic excellence, and equity. Prior to joining Kean as the University’s president, Repollet served two-and-a-half years as the New Jersey Commissioner of Education, overseeing the shift to remote education amid the pandemic and helping to plan for the 2020-2021 school year. Through this challenging time and moving forward, Repollet says safety is a top priority. “At Kean, we responded to COVID-19 by partnering with the County of Union on testing and vaccinations for our campus and the surrounding community. We also opened our own COVID lab on campus to process test results, and we stand ready to work with the county in any other public health emergency.”</p>
<p>With a goal of providing academic excellence to all students, growing faculty is an important part of the endeavor. “To move forward as a research university and provide support for our students, we needed to create new systems that aligned with our current priorities,” explains Repollet. “When it comes to academic excellence, we focus heavily on bringing in new faculty members and retaining those educators, as well as offering support for students from their first day on campus through graduation. We are now looking to strengthen these systems by looking at data and gathering feedback from faculty and students to ensure they have the tools they need to be successful.”</p>
<p>Among Kean’s top priorities is supporting equity and inclusion and creating an environment for all students to learn and grow together. “As a former commissioner and superintendent, equity has been a cornerstone of who I am, and I have always believed creating a diverse workforce is essential,” says Repollet. “I also believe all students should have the opportunity to pursue higher education. We have built entrepreneurial educational initiatives (EEI) that identify gaps within the pre-K to 12 space to make sure we build the strongest pipeline possible for those students entering into the college level. To offer exposure to more students, we provide college-level courses and have created an academy of scholars. The Kean Scholar Academy is a pre-college program that offers high school students the opportunity to earn college credits and participate in pre-college mentorships and internships.”</p>
<p>Strengthening the equity pillar of Kean University also requires making higher education both accessible and affordable. “By design, Kean is the most affordable comprehensive 4-year university in the state,” says Repollet. “We also make sure our policies are inclusive, where everyone has an opportunity to move up without being hindered. We also established our Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, which is dedicated to promoting representation and inclusion at Kean. We want to assure we bring equity into everything we do, from academia to the student experience across campus.”</p>
<p>Kean is one of the most diverse universities in the northeast, where 77 percent of the students are students of color and 46 percent are first generation. “We celebrate the diversity among our student population and our faculty,” shares Repollet. “When you have an emphasis on diversity, you have an emphasis on diverse interests, and as a result of that approach, the research breaks out of the cookie-cutter model. The culture at Kean is changing, and there is an excitement among students and staff to be part of this shift to a renowned research university.”</p>
<p>Creating a Sustainable Research Enterprise<br>
To continue Kean’s advancement toward Carnegie R2 status, the University is working to expand its research portfolio and gaining insight and expertise from the education community. “We formed a Presidential Advisory Committee that includes students, faculty, staff, and community members,” explains Repollet. “The committee will make recommendations and advise me on the steps we need to take to reach our R2 goal. For example, the group recently shared a recommendation for a $3 million investment in supplies and advanced research equipment. We approved this investment because funding research, supporting staff, and pursuing grant opportunities are all essential to moving the needle in the right direction.”</p>
<p>In the past, Kean would often hire faculty during the winter and spring months. Upon the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, the University has recently moved that timeline, with new faculty members starting in September. “We now have faculty members joining us with research grants and opportunities,” says Repollet. “Many individuals are just out of post-doctoral fellowships or are looking to relocate to the east coast. To ensure we remain on track and show our growth, we’ve created several benchmarks. The first was to gain recognition by our own state as a public research university. We are very thankful to Governor Murphy for signing legislation designating Kean University as the fifth research university in New Jersey, and the first urban research university focused on finding real-world solutions. Kean recently moved up to Doctoral University status, one step away from the R2 designation. This accomplishment shows that the work we’re doing and the investments we’re making are paying dividends and because of this, I’m very confident we will achieve our goal. More importantly, we are creating a sustainable research enterprise to ensure continuous growth for years to come.”</p>
<p>With technology being a key item for researchers to advance their projects and collaboration opportunities, Repollet says Kean University is looking forward to becoming more involved with Edge as the University continues to advance its research mission. “The pandemic has highlighted the central importance of technology and education,” says Repollet. “From pre-K to college and beyond, technology allows students to connect with educators. But at the same time, the pandemic has stripped bare the disparities that exist among different groups and their access to technology.&nbsp; This issue is one that Kean is working hard to address. With technology often being costly and evolving so quickly, Edge helps keep our institutions cutting edge in a way that is much more efficient and cost effective than any other organization could accomplish.”</p>

		<p>Advancing Community Research and Education<br>
Edge and Kean University have recently joined forces on a proposal that will provide infrastructure support and additional computer capacity for research in New Jersey. The National Science Foundation (NSF) Campus Cyberinfrastructure Regional Connectivity program invests in networking and cyberinfrastructure improvements, innovation, and integration for research projects. “Edge is pleased to partner with our member organization, Kean University, and to offer our solutions and services as they work to achieve their R2 status,” says Forough Ghahramani, Ed.D., Associate Vice President, Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, Edge. “Through collaborations such as the NSF proposal and Edge’s advanced high performance network capability and access to regional and national resources, we are excited to help advance research and education within the community.”</p>
<p>Due to Kean’s commitment to building infrastructure and continuing to climb toward R2 status, the University is now becoming eligible to apply for more research grants and collaboration opportunities. “Our accomplishments as an institution are passed on to our students,” says Repollet. “As an urban research university, we are able to close the tuition gap and provide higher education opportunities to more students. Plus, the impact goes far beyond our campus. Our focus is on applied research that finds solutions to real-world challenges that are faced not only by the state’s urban residents, but all residents of New Jersey. The skills and expertise of our faculty and students support the greater community, and their influence permeates throughout the state.”</p>
<p>Promoting Economic Growth<br>
To further build upon the University’s commitment to scholarship and community service, Kean established the John S. Watson Institute for Urban Policy and Research at the University in March 2021. “The Institute has an over 30-year history of urban policy,” says Repollet. “We’re delighted to have the Watson Institute installed at Kean and to be able to explore gaps in education and health care, economic challenges, and environmental justice. These challenges can now be addressed in a safe space where our faculty and students can come together to find solutions to some of the issues affecting urban communities. Now, as a state urban research university, we can further tap into their networks and embed urban policy within our colleges.”</p>
<p>The Institute works closely with the New Jersey Urban Mayors Association (NJUMA), which is now affiliated with the University and includes mayors from 32 urban centers across the state. “We now have built-in connections to government leaders across New Jersey, and we look forward to working with them to provide policy research and solutions on important issues in their communities. The Watson Institute gives us credibility and has provided a seat at the table that we wouldn’t have had in the past. Our goal is to harness all the expertise at Kean and channel that knowledge toward achieving these important goals and driving change within the region.”</p>
<p>Kean was among 25 institutions selected by the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) University Center for a 5-year grant to promote innovation and strengthen regional economies. With $1 million of funding, the plan is to create the Center for Business and Workforce Development, Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship. Housed at the John S. Watson Institute for Urban Policy and Research at Kean, the University Center will address regional needs such as agriculture in South Jersey, advanced manufacturing in the central region, and small businesses in North Jersey. “We are very proud to receive this grant and be a partner in this collaborative effort to strengthen regional economies and promote economic growth, especially for minority-owned small businesses,” shares Repollet. “Our involvement supports who we are as a research university, and it is exciting being at the forefront of spurring this economic change. We are working to create the first data trust and ensure that these urban centers have the information, tools, and resources that they need to be successful. Most importantly, our students from these areas will be working as interns and will have the opportunity to help their own communities flourish.”</p>
<p>Inspiring through Leadership<br>
President Repollet says his diverse career experience, including educator, coach, principal, superintendent of schools, and New Jersey Commissioner of Education, has helped him perfect how he looks at leadership and strategies for achieving organizational goals. “Each stop along the way has allowed me to view leadership from a micro to macro level. You must look at the quantitative and qualitative data to form who you are and to support your mission of being a provider of a world-class education. I’ve been developing smart goals for every endeavor and ensuring the members of our team understand their role. Each person is an expert in their lane, a cog in the system, so when everyone is fully engaged, we have touch points across multiple areas that bring us together.</p>
<p>“In regards to being the first Black president of Kean, this is about leadership, and being a successful leader comes down to whom you serve,” continues Repollet. “I always say to whom much is given, much is required, and I take that sentiment to heart because I understand the circumstances that our students are in. The pandemic health crisis has brought to bear the role and the moral obligation we have as a University and what we need to do. I believe passionately in the mission of our institution to provide access to a world-class education for all students, regardless of background, and I think people are excited about the culture we are creating. We aspire to be a model and a source of inspiration.</p>
<p>“People can see that we are investing in them and their communities, and the system has started to change because the processes that we put in place are starting to produce the results that support our mission, our vision, our values, and our goals. I’m excited about where we are at this moment and where we are going. My University, my students, and my community can feel the bus moving in the right direction, toward a culture of inclusivity that rewards and promotes excellence. I’m honored to be in this role and to help Kean climb higher on its path from great to elite.”</p>

<p>Among the country’s leading Catholic universities, Seton Hall University (SHU) is home to over 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students and offers more than 90 majors and programs. In the summer of 2020 during the height of the pandemic, Dr. Katia Passerini began her tenure as the new Provost and Executive Vice President of SHU. Along with many institutions that faced the challenges of remote learning, Passerini was immediately tasked with overseeing efforts to combine HyFlex teaching methods with classroom instruction in an effective and successful way. “My first challenge was starting a new job completely remote, while at the tail end of a strategic planning process that was put on pause by the pandemic,” shares Passerini. “The priority was to reopen the campus and bring our community back safely. My first ninety days—but I would argue, my entire first eighteen months—were focused on remote teaching through the Hyflex modality, the support systems for students and faculty, recruiting challenges in local and national markets, the paralysis of international recruiting, and the increased competition of online programs, which are now available everywhere across the country and the globe.”</p>
<p>Passerini says in this accelerated reactive environment, the most demanding challenge SHU faced was whether to continue the refinement and implementation of the strategic plan. “This decision would start the clock for the launch of an increased series of activities and goals. Quite frankly, there was only one option, and that was to move forward, because COVID-19 did not stop the overarching transformation of the higher education industry. On the contrary, the pandemic accelerated these changes and the only way to prepare for a possible hypercompetitive future is to reaffirm and chart a direction for growth that feeds on the strength of the mission and shows a path towards its full implementation. The challenge was that of intentionally deciding to complete these activities in parallel and this decision is why we have been able to proceed with new or renewed investments in academics and research.”</p>
<p>Gaining Experience in Program Development<br>
Beginning her academic career at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Passerini worked on many different projects across the university. “Since my discipline is management information systems, I was involved in technology projects including enterprise resource planning upgrades, smart campus testing, and wireless tech infrastructure studies,” says Passerini. “Moving through the various phases of an academic career at NJIT from assistant to full professor, I taught courses and completed research activities that made me realize that I loved working closely on innovation projects with students.”</p>
<p>“This experience eventually paved the way for an exciting dean position in the Honors College, where I led the development of the University’s top students in a myriad of academic initiatives, service activities, and innovative research,” Passerini continues. “Later, when a dean position spanning multiple programs opened up at a nearby university, I applied and was selected to lead the largest undergraduate professional college at St. John’s University (the Collins College of Professional Studies). This experience gave me an opportunity to launch many new programs and think strategically about program development. I discovered how much I enjoy building new programs and exploring areas that may lead to transformation.”</p>
<p>From her decade in New Jersey, Passerini was very familiar with SHU and looked at the University’s Provost role as an exciting next step. “I am honored to have the opportunity to work with a dedicated community of teacher-scholars on new academic programs,” says Passerini. “The R2 status of Seton Hall was a clear signal of the commitment to high-level research within an institution dedicated to the scholarship and practice of teaching and service.”</p>
<p>Educating the Mind, Heart, and Spirit<br>
Moving forward, SHU’s strategic plan focuses on five main areas: academic distinction, research excellence, student success, diversity and community, and long-term sustainability. More specifically, Passerini says the quest for academic distinction is connected to the fundamental belief that the University cannot be everything to everyone. “While we aspire to achieve excellence in all our programs, as comprehensive liberal arts institutions like ours should do, we also need to define areas in which we will focus to achieve unparalleled distinction. And that means making difficult decisions on how to prioritize resource allocation and growth, which is the most difficult job: saying “yes” and “no” to academic investments in specific areas, while launching new investments in others.”</p>
<p>To help raise SHU’s profile in the coming years, Passerini looks to determine ways to transfer the excellence of the institution’s notable faculty into a well-known story that shows how the University’s academic programs are conceived, delivered, and enhanced by these scholarly experts in their fields. “We have an incredible faculty who are scholars in their respective disciplines,” shares Passerini. “I am amazed at the number of faculty who publish books with the most prestigious academic presses and high-quality publications. We want to showcase the talent of these pioneers and give our students more opportunities to collaborate on research projects with these extraordinary mentors.”</p>
<p>The comprehensive nature of SHU, and their dedication to liberal arts and humanities-based education, is designed to expose students to a very large and diverse set of courses that push their imagination and thinking well beyond their chosen field of study. “Many majors have enough electives to enable explorations across courses and disciplines, and that is our unique advantage,” says Passerini. “Additionally, as a faith-based institution, we provide a unique ethos and focus on service to the community, reflection, and introspection that facilitates engagement with society, religious, and cultural issues. Our philosophy focuses on educating not only the mind, but also the heart and the spirit, and that is our recipe for academic excellence.”</p>
<p>Promoting Real-World Education<br>
Seton Hall is highly focused on immersing students in real-world learning where they will gain knowledge and skills they can use to advance in the workforce. For example, SHU embeds data literacy throughout their liberal arts and humanities tradition. “We offer a digital humanities minor, medical humanities, and the like,” shares Passerini. “By complementing our professional studies with broad-based teaching, this helps not only in learning important skills, but creates new ones—moving from data, information, knowledge, and eventually through to wisdom. We also teach information and data literacy through the carefully organized work that our librarians lead. SHU offers a variety of seminars, including research data management, survey research in Qualtrics, ArcGIS for Spatial Data, Data Analysis in SPSS, and introduction to Microsoft Power BI.”</p>
<p>The University also offers an online business analytics program through the Stillman School of Business and an online data science program through their College of Arts and Sciences. “The courses offered through these programs are increasingly being re-used by other programs to further augment the data and text analytics know-how of our students,” explains Passerini. “Ideally, a certificate/minor in data science and business analytics could become part of any set of electives or course sequence that students include in their schedule. We provide access to software and resources for such analysis across many programs.”</p>

		<p>Creating a Shared Vision<br>
In 2019, Seton Hall received the “R2” designation, placing the University among the group of institutions across the country classified as “High Research.” “We have an expansive research portfolio that feeds from the excellent research that is happening in existing centers and within the nine colleges and schools that we have at the University,” says Passerini. “I recently asked the Deans to highlight areas of excellence that span across colleges. Our key areas of distinction in research include: Health and Well-Being; Life Sciences, Data Sciences, and Analytics; Ethics, Spirituality, and Science; Society, Technology, and Communication. These areas are supported by local institutes, centers, and academic programs. One particular characteristic of these thematic areas is that they thrive from the interdisciplinary collaboration across units. In a nutshell, our research competitiveness relies heavily on our ability to work across the disciplinary specializations and open a dialogue that moves beyond isolated silos and finds a shared vision. That central direction is that we put people, humans, humanity, and society at the center of our research endeavors and everything we do.”</p>
<p>In the area of Health and Well-Being, the School of Health and Medical Sciences (SHMS) established a Center for Interprofessional Education in the Health Sciences (CIEHS) engaged in and creating opportunities for meaningful and cross-disciplinary educational, research, and clinical experiences. The goal is to further develop team-based, person-centered learning in healthcare. The College of Nursing also delivers undergraduate and graduate nursing programs leveraging an interprofessional approach to treating individuals with chronic illnesses, including funded research on substance use disorders and more.</p>
<p>Led by the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and the Stillman School of Business, research advancement in the Life Sciences, Data Sciences, and Analytics is taking place at the various centers and degree programs offered at SHU. Students and faculty gain the opportunity to better understand societal challenges and positively impact the world by synthesizing data in all forms, analyzing that data to find meaning, and communicating information effectively to drive important discovery insights, as well as applied policy, management and practice implications.</p>
<p>In Ethics, Spirituality, and Science, centers for ethics, interfaith dialogue, and institutes of religious studies and communication promote theological engagement with the natural sciences and medicine and probe the relationship between faith and reason. This area brings together work at Seton Hall Law School, at the School of Theology, College of Arts and Sciences, and the College of Communication and the Arts.</p>
<p>Research in the thematic area of Society, Technology, and Communication fosters ethical, servant leaders for diverse local, regional, and global communities. “Communities flourish when members feel confident, safe, and empowered by collective pursuits,” says Passerini. “This is enabled by formal and informal systems education, public and international safety, savvy diplomacy and international relations, technology as a tool and a means to liberation, and communication in all forms, especially digital communication. The College of Education and Human Services, the School of Diplomacy, and the College of Communication and the Arts collaborate in research in these areas.”</p>
<p>Fostering Interdisciplinary Collaboration<br>
Drawing knowledge from multiple fields of study to drive innovation can be beneficial in creating a holistic approach to research, but there are often challenges to overcome as well. “Interdisciplinary research is a romantic concept that we all aspire to implement, but this approach is not the way academic institutions have traditionally worked in the past,” says Passerini. “Research universities can achieve excellence and distinction through concentration and vertical specialization. There is an inherent risk with interdisciplinarity, where an institution may span in too many directions without control and may not achieve the level of depth that is typical of hyper-specialization. That level of depth is very difficult to achieve or copy. On the other hand, because academic institutions have their own networks of collaborators that are difficult to replicate, the interdisciplinary approach opens so many more possibilities, creating an innovation ecosystem with a spiral of increasing level of knowledge that is unique to the context in which it blossoms. What we need to do to overcome the limitations and fully take advantage of the opportunities is to enable people to work with colleagues in other schools and colleges and identify reward systems that encourage this collaboration. Specifically, we must reconsider how to promote team teaching and sharing of faculty hires, even though hiring and promotions are often closely tied to disciplinary areas within academia.”</p>
<p>With significant research taking place at Seton Hall, the University is being strategic about partnering locally, nationally, and internationally moving forward. “We have partnered with research organizations that can help us understand program development and research,” shares Passerini. “We have also connected with international associations, like the International Federation of Catholic Universities, that give us access to networks of partners around the world with the purpose of exchanging students and faculty who will study and conduct research in the U.S. or abroad.”</p>
<p>A new initiative at SHU, called “Academies,” looks to support interdisciplinary research and help drive progress in health sciences, international relations, law, humanities, and theology. Named after Plato’s Academy—the grove where Athenians gathered outdoors for impromptu philosophical conversation about pressing questions—the Academies enjoy seed funding for three years to engage in timely matters of public concern, including green chemistry, meaningful work, applied technology, health research, and Catholic social work in action.</p>
<p>Launching Innovation Initiatives<br>
As part of SHU’s strategic plan, the Provost’s Office, aided by the help of various committees and experts across the University and nationally, recently reviewed the overall academic structure and assessed its ability to innovate as measured by a number of success metrics. “The extensive study, which was not without its limits and challenges, guided an overall reorganization of academic units through the clarification of goals and targets by launching incremental innovation initiatives,” explains Passerini. “This strategy pushed radical collaboration that brings together some colleges and schools in new ways. For example, the School of Diplomacy and International Relations is working closely with Seton Hall Law School. The College of Education and Human Services, and the College of Communication and the Arts will come together by Fall 2023 into a new unit that will focus on the future of education, communication, and professional development.”</p>
<p>In partnering with Edge, Passerini looks forward to gaining support for the University’s research initiatives and accessing a broad range of collaborative multi-institutional local, regional, and national advanced technology resources. “Edge is fundamentally dedicated to pushing the research achievements in New Jersey through shared infrastructure, collaboration, and access to advanced resources, including physical, digital, and human networks,” says Passerini. “This goal is very much what we wish to do internally first, and then continuing that beyond Seton Hall, so partnering with Edge is a great opportunity for us to advance this agenda.”</p>
<p>The other colleges and schools at SHU are working on ambitious targets in areas like enrollment, students’ success, and program development to bring many of the existing and new programs to the next level. “We have some busy years ahead of us,” says Passerini. “However, this work will enable reinvestment in stronger academic units, and we expect to shift over two million dollars of funding—just from this initiative—permanently into the academy. Additional funding will likely take place through expected programs growth, funded grants, and fundraising for chaired positions/programs. We are looking to hire thirty new faculty members this year!”</p>
<p>Globally Transforming Education<br>
An important mission at Seton Hall is advancing diversity, inclusivity, and equity and providing opportunities to a greater number of students. “If we look at the education sector, women are surpassing men in obtaining a higher education degree, although there are differences by field of study,” says Passerini. “Diversity brings new ideas, and we need to source ideas from wherever they exist, including different ethnic communities, countries, and states. Ultimately, by hosting and welcoming a variety of experiences and perspectives, we become better as a whole. SHU celebrates these principles by dedicating an entire strategic priority to community diversity and every single unit is working on academic, research, student services, financial, admission, and administrative goals that lead to a larger participation across the institution.”</p>
<p>As a previous international student, Passerini continues to be passionate about study abroad and international exchange programs and the benefits that they can provide to both the University and the students. “I would like to double our current incoming and outgoing International student numbers by 2025 and build more partnerships across various continents,” shares Passerini. “In addition, COVID has fast-tracked the entire world into digital communication. I cannot think of a better time to start digital connections with partners worldwide and invite a different way of ‘virtual travel’ and remote collaborations.”</p>
<p>Passerini says the ability for institutions to leverage digital transformation and online learning depends on their own ability to adapt to multiple modalities of teaching and learning without impacting their core resources and the needs of their students and faculty. “While we can now reach a larger audience, so can everyone else, including well-known international players. Ultimately, some universities will simply modify and augment what they already do, and others will convert to a fully online model. This is similar to the transition we experienced with the rise of electronic commerce. First online sales were just another channel, then they became the preferred channel, and for some, they became the only channel.”</p>
<p>“However, learning is different and is a socially constructed process that feeds from interactions, communication, and collaborations,” Passerini continues. “If having access to information was enough for people to learn, we would not need degrees, just books and public libraries. COVID showed that we must indeed come together and discuss, share, and argue about what we are learning, and we must do this with others, including our peers and mentors. Institutions across the education community will likely be exploring the impact of digital learning—both positive and negative—for years to come. I do suspect that hybridity is here to stay, especially for new and emerging learners that may need to retool and retrain for an increasingly different workplace. We must each decide what type of digital transformation we are ready for and what will provide the most impactful educational and career opportunities for our students as they prepare for the future.”</p>

<p>Nearly one billion people on earth lack any form of widely recognized identity.</p><p>Let me say that again…a billion people! Looked at another way, that is one person in eight alive today living without any official record of their existence.</p><p>These individuals are mostly women and children, the majority are poor, and many are refugees or displaced persons. Their status — or rather, lack of official status — represents a constant barrier to participation in modern social, economic, and political life.</p><p>Many of us are lucky enough to live in countries where we have multiple forms of ID; a driver’s license or transit pass, which enables us to get where we need to go, a work ID to access our place of employment, credit or debit cards to make purchases, health ID cards to receive medical care, logins to access our work, financial, and social media accounts, and more. We use them without thinking about it and generally take them for&nbsp;granted.</p><p>But, if you want to get a sense of what life is like without a formal identity, try leaving all your forms of ID at home for one day. It will open your&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>If you are lucky, you will make it to work without being pulled over by a police officer (caution: your day is likely to get much worse if you do). Without carrying a driver's license, you will probably be looking over your shoulder and driving more slowly and carefully, experiencing — though to a lesser degree — the fear and uncertainty that those without ID experience on a daily basis, across all of their activities. You may return home hungry because you were unable to pay for lunch, or do any of the other activities that require a credit card. And, hopefully, the security guard in the lobby recognizes you — or can call someone to admit you — otherwise, you might be heading home early to “work remotely.”</p><p>Seriously… try a day of not using any form ID to recognize just how much you depend on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Digital ID can be a powerful tool that both empowers individuals and protects their basic human rights and civil liberties.</p><p>Those who lack an official identity find it difficult or impossible to access basic services, such as education, employment, health care, and financial services. They are unable to exercise their rights as citizens and voters and participate in the modern economy. Giving these individuals an official identity unlocks countless opportunities.</p><p>Article Six of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.” Adopted in 1948, the Declaration defines a variety of rights to which we are all entitled; equal treatment before the law, dignity, nationality, privacy, education, mobility, and more. Being able to prove one’s identity is fundamental to the full exercise of these&nbsp;rights.</p><p>In 2015, the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDG 16.9) established a target of providing legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030. The UN, World Bank, and nations around the world have made admirable progress toward closing the “identity gap.” In a recent <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/un-expects-350m-more-people-worldwide-to-get-legal-identity-by-2025">Biometric Update 16.9 Podcast</a>, UNDP’s Niall McCann predicted that, by 2025, 350 million more people will have a recognized form of identity. This would be a remarkable accomplishment. But, from our perspective, closing the identity gap is necessary, but, ultimately, insufficient.</p><p>The world would be a simpler place if having an ID guaranteed these rights. Of course, it doesn’t. For some individuals who do have an ID — religious and ethnic minorities, political dissidents, for example — relying on a national ID system can have the opposite effect, making them more susceptible to exclusion, oppression, and persecution. For these individuals, alternative forms of ID are necessary to ensure that their rights — and, in some cases, their lives — are protected.</p><p>Done properly, “good ID” can help address both challenges, offering the promise of both empowerment and protection. And yet, all ID systems — digital or paper-based — come with attendant risks, which must be understood and intentionally mitigated through technology, design, policy, and enforcement choices by public and private sector decision-makers.</p><p>At ID2020, we often say that “good ID = good technology + good policy + good governance.”</p><p>There is a dangerous tendency to think that we can “tech our way out of any problem.”</p><p>The reality is that technology alone cannot adequately prevent exclusion, oppression, surveillance, and a variety of other undesirable outcomes. Building ID systems — especially digital ID systems — in an ethical manner requires governance frameworks and robust policy and regulatory safeguards that add an extra layer of protection. This is why collaboration between governments, multilateral and bilateral funders, civil society, and the private sector is so essential.</p><p>We are encouraged by the progress being made. At the same time, we are humbled by the task ahead of us and know that we must do&nbsp;more.</p><p>Living up to the intent of SDG 16.9 and the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights </a>will require not only expanding access to ID, but also ensuring that these systems are designed, built, and implemented in ways that protect fundamental human rights, enhance equity, and promote social and financial inclusion.</p><p>We hope that you will join us today in celebrating Identity Day by taking a moment to reflect on how our community — and, indeed, each of us individually — can help enhance equity, inclusion, and social and economic justice through our&nbsp;work.</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This contributed byline from Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of FIDO Alliance, details cybersecurity blind spots generated by growing IoT technology adoption. To address these issues, the FIDO Alliance launched FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) in 2021 to tackle two main problems: deployment efficiency and security at the point of onboarding. The main feature of FDO is fully automated device onboarding, which considerably speeds up the previously manual process. FDO also replaces generic password credentials with highly secure cryptographic keys, making the devices considerably more robust against attack.</p>

<p>The end of forgotten or stolen passwords? Apple is launching “passkeys” today, a new identification system that should make the use of cryptic passwords to guarantee the security of one’s accounts a thing of the past. In practice, logging in anywhere will be as easy as unlocking your screen: every site that offers to use passkeys will ask the user if they want to use them to authenticate. It will then be necessary to use the usual method of unlocking the phone (PIN code, pattern, fingerprint or facial recognition) to validate the connection, explains the Fast Identity Online Alliance (FIDO Alliance), which is behind this process.</p>

 Some recommendations for the LocalGov Drupal community​​ <p>Over the last few months, we’ve been working with the <a href="https://localgovdrupal.org">LocalGov Drupal</a> team to shore up support for the project and help the community scale. We’ve been looking at the ways the project can help more people to get involved in a way that is sustainable for the existing community. In <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">Quick wins to improve your Open Source community’s Architecture of Participation</a>, we talk about some tactics any project can implement quite&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>In this post, we continue using our Architecture of Participation, and present some strategies that will help this successful project. In one way or another, they all deal with developing empathy.</p> Clear mission <p>LocalGov Drupal has a fantastic mission. As the project grows, it’s important to ensure that the community stay on course with that&nbsp;mission:</p><blockquote>The publishing platform created by councils, for councils.</blockquote><p>This is expanded to explain&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>LocalGov Drupal is a publicly owned asset that delivers a better digital experience for citizens, improves service outcomes, and saves&nbsp;money.</blockquote><p>In order for councils to continue creating the platform, there needs to be clarity around how it is publicly owned and operated. What mechanisms exist for the community to influence the direction of the&nbsp;project?</p>Diagram via <a href="http://sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/">Sociocracy for&nbsp;All</a> Recommendations   Involve the community in decision making through defined workflows and&nbsp;roles.  Share information and be transparent about financials (e.g. shortfalls in funding, investment opportunities) by creating a ‘funding’ circle that members can&nbsp;join.  Use consent-based decision making within relevant Sociocratic circles to guide relationship establishment with partner organisations.   Invitation to participate <p>The advice in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">our blog</a> post to take the time to personally invite people stands true, this is a game changer for participation. Another helpful way to ensure that you are inviting a diverse group of people is to establish some repeatable norms for the community.</p><p>At the beginning of meetings, invite people to check in by saying how they are arriving at that meeting. This gives people an opportunity to say how they are feeling, what might be bothering them or what they hope to get out of their participation.</p><p>In addition, create repeatable norms by inviting people to check out places they can get involved. Ask for feedback early and often, model pro-social behaviours around invitations that extend across the&nbsp;project.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/?s=participation">Participatory Culture</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a> Recommendations   Get in the habit of using check–ins / checkouts in ALL meetings to make people feel welcome, bring their ‘full selves’, and be ready for participation. Sign-ins and written check-ins are&nbsp;great!  Feed the #showyourwork channel by encouraging people to share what they’ve done, however&nbsp;small.  Share v0.1 of your work for feedback (rather than v1.0) to get feedback around direction as well and not just the ‘final&nbsp;polish’.   Easy onboarding + modular&nbsp;approach <p>A successful open source project like LocalGov Drupal has A LOT of information to wrap your head around. There are a lot of ways into the project, different places communication is taking place and a variety of technical and social skills required to participate.</p><p>In order to make onboarding to a project or community easy for anyone, it can help to present information in several different ways. Thinking about (and documenting!) pathways people might be using to come into a project can help the community see where information could be tidier. This in turn can help the community identify places where a different view of the information might be&nbsp;helpful.</p><a href="https://whimsical.com/contribution-pathways-8sy99ptgRoxG4DTtJAsQeW">Visualised contribution pathways for&nbsp;LGD</a> Recommendations   Create a step-by-step checklist of onboarding and interview new community members regularly to help improve&nbsp;it.  Develop and promote the documentation system (aka the wiki) to ensure that contribution guidelines are up-to-date.  Ensure the full context of the LGD project isn’t just held in the heads of core team members by creating standing agenda&nbsp;items.  Help prevent confusion for new community members by using (and updating) <a href="https://whimsical.com/contribution-pathways-8sy99ptgRoxG4DTtJAsQeW">contribution pathways</a>.  Identify the “most used” resources and make sure they are accessible in multiple ways (e.g. record a screencast of the most popular slidedeck or write a blogpost about the most popular&nbsp;graphic)   Strong leadership + celebration of milestones <p>There are many different types of leadership. Strong leadership in an open source project is both distributed and diverse, marked by empathy, fair processes, and the establishment/encouragement of positive relationships.</p><p>The approach being experimented with by LocalGov Drupal, and which we have seen work extremely well within the co-operative movement is Sociocracy. LGD already has a product group, steering group, and technical group, however consent-based decision-making is not necessarily the norm within these groups’ meetings.</p><p>Governance is a work in progress and so we should celebrate both milestones in the project (e.g. technical development) but also milestones in the maturity of the organisation. Those with more mature governance are able to devolve decision-making to relevant circles, encouraging democratic processes and removing bottlenecks.</p> Recommendations   Arrange a Sociocracy refresher workshop and invite everyone in the community. Document the content of the workshop and include it in the LGD knowledge base.  Ensure that each circle has an established “lead” and ask that person to participate in creating standing agenda items together with the other&nbsp;leads.  Celebrate milestones by issuing badges for everything from onboarding, to pro-social behaviours the LGD community wants to encourage, through to membership of groups/circles.  Plan for a specific role around governance and operations to allow ‘business as usual’ to flourish as well as innovation work.  Share progress around governance issues as well as technical development on the blog, newsletter, and in presentations about the&nbsp;project.   Ways of working open + backchannels <p>There are bits of information that need to be kept confidential for the good of the project, but as an open source community, you should default to the highest level of openness you&nbsp;can.</p><p>As you work openly, try not to make judgements about what’s “relevant” to the community. Community members will decide for themselves what is relevant and what isn’t. Just remember to add an appropriate license (e.g. Creative Commons) to help people know in what ways they can share and contribute.</p><p>In order for people to bring their full selves to the project and contribute in diverse ways, they need to be able to talk about things which may be slightly off-topic. These are opportunities to strengthen relationships between community members, much as people who work in the same office bond by sharing stories around the watercooler.</p><p>Positive, pro-social behaviours need to be modelled by those in leadership positions. This is why the habits of those leading meetings, giving presentations, and otherwise having responsibility within the LGD community are so important.</p>CC-BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Recommendations   Establish at least one #backchannel in Slack to enable community members to get to know one another without being disruptive in a work-related channel.  Provide guidance on licences which relate to documentation of the project, over and above the code. For example, Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC&nbsp;BY-SA</a>.  Make decisions about technology used for community interaction based on established processes and criteria.  Revisit the Code of Conduct on at least an annual basis to ensure that nothing is standing in the way of diverse community contribution.  Issue badges based on regular (monthly/quarterly) mini-workshops on what it means to work openly and model/encourage open behaviours.   Onwards! <p>Open source is about collaboration, not just code. Finding ways to help people feel welcome and seen is a good way to help your open source project be sustainable.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-architecture-of-participation-for-community-growth-ed9d964ec360">An Architecture of Participation for Community growth</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Department of Homeland Security Signs on as First Premier Sponsor of New Public/Private Partnership</p> 


<p>14 September 2022 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, today announced that NIEM (formerly known as National Information Exchange Model), will transition to NIEM Open, an OASIS Open Project, in October 2022. A collaborative partnership between private industry and all levels of governmental agencies, the NIEM framework enables the effective and efficient sharing of critical data as currently demonstrated in the justice,&nbsp;public safety,&nbsp;emergency and disaster management,&nbsp;intelligence, and&nbsp;homeland security&nbsp;sectors. NIEM is designed to facilitate the creation of automated enterprise-wide information exchanges. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology">Science and Technology Directorate</a> (S&amp;T) has committed to support NIEM Open at the Premier Sponsor level to advance the critical work of the project.</p>



<p>This October, when NIEM transitions from the U.S. Department of Defense to OASIS, an ANSI-accredited and ISO-recognized standards development organization, NIEM’s expansion into global markets will provide access to a larger pool of stakeholders and developers to contribute to the project, creating a path for NIEM to become an official standard in national and international policy and procurement. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Transitioning to an OASIS Open Project allows NIEM to become more readily available to international communities and organizations that want to adopt NIEM,” said Stuart Whitehead of the U.S. Department of Defense. “We look forward to working with new alliances in the private sector to assist in the integration of NIEM into even broader user communities, allowing NIEM to become the gold standard for public-private partnerships. This is an exciting time to continue to advance the NIEM model technically as it transforms into an open, international standard.”</p>



<p>“At OASIS, there’s an extensive set of processes for collaborative development of standards. This is the type of environment that technology companies and government agencies need to accelerate interoperability initiatives across boundaries,” said Katherine Escobar, Deputy Division Chief for the Joint Staff’s J6 Data and Services Division. “We will continue to look for ways to simplify use, embrace emerging technologies, and welcome new communities. We look forward to expanding the NIEM footprint and seeing NIEM Open help organizations exchange information to improve decision making, increase efficiency, and advance their missions.”</p>



<p>“DHS S&amp;T is excited to see the evolution of NIEM to an OASIS Open Project,” said Philip Mattson, Standards Executive and Senior Standards Advisor at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;“This will strengthen NIEM’s overall development, raising the level of collaboration in diverse communities.”</p>



<p>NIEM Open’s Sponsors will provide strategic vision, governance, and technical guidance for future efforts and have the option to serve on the Project Governing Board, where they approve work produced by the community as well as proposals for new open source projects. To learn more about becoming a Sponsor and joining the Project’s Governing Board, please contact <a>join@oasis-open.org</a>.</p>



<p>Additional Information:</p>



<p>About NIEM:</p>



<p>Established in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, NIEM is a community-driven, standards-based approach to facilitate information sharing. U.S. and International organizations across Federal, State, Local, Tribal, Territorial, Public, Private and Commercial sectors use NIEM as a common base data model and methodology to promote interoperability of data and software, reduce design and development time for information exchange applications, and allow the reuse of intellectual capital and skills across multiple projects.</p>



<p>About OASIS:</p>



<p>One of the most respected, nonprofit open source and open standards bodies in the world, OASIS advances the fair, transparent development of open source software and standards through the power of global collaboration and community. OASIS is the home for worldwide standards in IoT, cybersecurity, blockchain, privacy, cryptography, cloud computing, urban mobility, emergency management, and other content technologies. Many OASIS standards go on to be ratified by de jure bodies and referenced in international policies and government procurement.

<p>As the world works towards climate goals, a government project from Canada is using digital trust technology to make it easier and more secure for natural resource companies to share sustainability data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) was established by the Government of British Columbia in recognition that we must do more to facilitate the transition to a clean, resilient economy. British Columbia (B.C.), Canada’s western-most province, was the first province in Canada to implement greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and mandatory sustainability reporting for major sectors of the provincial economy. As leaders in climate change legislation, B.C. is well positioned to explore cutting-edge technology in the journey towards a low-carbon economy. To improve trust, accuracy, and efficiency when sharing sustainability data, EMDT is coordinating a digital ecosystem – a network of organizations including environmental auditors, government bodies, mining and energy companies, and non-government organizations.</p>



<p>Improved Sustainability Reporting&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, reporting sustainability data can be challenging. Data is difficult to exchange internationally, and consumers cannot always access, or trust, reported data, not to mention the administrative burden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT’s digital ecosystem makes it possible to exchange sustainability information simply and securely, using digital credentials.</p>



<p>Digital credentials:&nbsp;</p>



  Can be shared quickly and are tamper-proof.&nbsp;  Allow companies to control their data.&nbsp;  Guarantee the integrity of the information.&nbsp;  Preserve privacy in business-to-business interactions.&nbsp;  



<p>Digital Trust Ecosystem: EMDT Pilot&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>EMDT has been testing and refining their technology and governance through multiple pilot projects to demonstrate how sustainability reporting can be made more efficient and trustworthy. Two pilot projects explore greenhouse gas emissions reporting in the mining sector and the natural gas sector. These pilots allow participants to test sharing and receiving digital credentials that include verified GHG emissions data for a specific mine site or natural gas facility.</p>







<p>*Because this is a pilot, the process depicted in this diagram does not satisfy or replace existing regulatory reporting obligations.</p>



<p>The greenhouse gas (GHG) mining pilot builds upon the existing regulatory emissions reporting process in British Columbia. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), an environmental auditor, issues a digital credential to Copper Mountain Mining Company containing verified GHG data. Copper Mountain can then use the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report Verification Credential as part of their GHG emissions report to British Columbia’s Climate Action Secretariat. Copper Mountain can use the same digital credential to complete voluntary reporting to organizations such as the <a href="https://openclimate.org/">Open Earth Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increased Connections&nbsp;</p>



<p>To facilitate the broad exchange of sustainability data, EMDT used Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries to create a highly interoperable tool, called Traction. Traction is an API accelerator built on top of Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-PY). Traction streamlines the process of sending and receiving digital credentials for governments and organizations.</p>



<p>Hyperledger Aries makes Traction highly interoperable with the technological solutions of companies and organizations around the world. “While two wallets might be different implementations or might be written in different code, they can still exchange data because both wallets use Aries,” explains Kyle Robinson, EMDT’s Senior Strategic Advisor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Traction makes it easier to integrate digital trust technology into existing lines of business:&nbsp;</p>



  API-first Architecture: Traction is designed with an API-first architecture. This RESTful API allows for integration into existing line-of-business applications already being used by organizations. The Tenant user interface is built on this API to enable adoption prior to integration and for low-use functions.  Multitenancy: ACA-Py is implemented on a cloud-based server so multiple wallets can be managed with one Traction instance.&nbsp;  Higher Scalability: Traction is open-source technology, encouraging collaborative refinement, faster release, and higher scalability of the technology.  



<p>Collaborative Climate Change Progress</p>



<p>With an increasing emphasis on responsibly sourced products, simplified methods for exchanging sustainability data ensures that B.C. natural resource providers can compete in a global market. Digital trust technology streamlines access to trustworthy sustainability data, allowing businesses, governments, and non-government organizations to work towards climate change goals more efficiently and effectively. <a href="http://digital.gov.bc.ca/emdt">Visit our website</a> to learn more about Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust.</p>

<p>Starting today, thanks to the invaluable work of the brilliant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ncontin/">Nicola Contin</a> of We Can Consulting SpA, you can use Zapier to connect your Commercio app to 5000+ other services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to get started with Zapier 
<p>Zapier is a tool you can use to automate different tasks, connect different Apps, and integrate them. It then allows you to tell Zapier what you want to achieve, without having to write a single line of code.</p>
<p>For example, whenever you get a new lead, Zapier can ask Dropbox to tell it what files you have uploaded, and in real time notarize them on Commercio.network.<br>
With more than 5,000 integrations, you can integrate any storage system or any action produced by one of these integrations with Commercio.network.</p>
<p>To use Zapier, you must first <a href="https://zapier.com/app/billing/plans">create an account.&nbsp;</a> There are different plans, including a free plan that includes 5 single-step zaps and 100 activities.</p>
<p>But before we begin, here are some terms you need to know:</p>
<p>Zap<br>
A Zap is an automated workflow between your Apps.&nbsp;They are a set of instructions you define in Zapier to perform predefined tasks.&nbsp;A zap is triggered when a certain event (a trigger) occurs in an app.</p>
<p>Trigger<br>
Triggers are basically events within software that initiate a workflow.&nbsp;The trigger sends a set of information to Zapier that can be used in zaps to perform actions in other online services, which are also connected to Zapier.</p>
<p>Action<br>
The action is any step taken by zap.&nbsp;For example, each time a row is added to a Google sheet, a zap updates the stock of a product.</p>
<p>Task<br>
A task is how Zapier keeps track of your actions.&nbsp;This is important when you choose your plans.&nbsp;Each time a zap performs one of its “Action” steps, Zapier considers it to be a task.&nbsp;For example, your zap updates the product stock twice a day, Zapier considers this as two tasks.</p>
<p>Remember this when you select your rate plan.</p>
 Commercio Network + Zapier 
<p>Grazie al nuovo Add-On Zapier, ora puoi connettere la blockchain di Commercio ad altri servizi online e impostare l’automazione, sempre senza scrivere una sola riga di codice.</p>
<p>Prima di tutto ti devi collegare a https://commercio.app/ , creare un account, confermarlo e acquistare una membership.</p>
<p>A quel punto, colleghi l’account tramite l’estensione Zapier inserendo username e password dell’account di Commercio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now your connection is complete, and you can start configuring triggers and ready-to-use actions.</p>
<p>Your App automatically notifies Zapier whenever one of these two triggers occurs:</p>
 
 List of share doc processes initiated 
 Wallet amount 
 
<p>For example, you can create a zap that checks your wallet funds in real time, or that checks whether a new document has moved from the process queue to actual notarization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can automate the following actions in your Commercio.app using the information collected in Zapier:</p>
 
 Creating a new share doc 
 Searching for a specific process id to check the status of a transaction 
 
<p></p>
 Killer APP: Dropbox integration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of a Killer APP might be the Dropbox integration:</p>
<p>connect your Dropbox account, and with each file upload start a new share doc and notice it in real time.</p>
<p></p>

  💡  Read the <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Getting Started Guide</a> to start building with ComposeDB&nbsp;   What is ComposeDB on Ceramic? <p>ComposeDB on Ceramic is a decentralized, composable graph database. It provides different configurations (building blocks) that allow developers to quickly build applications on Ceramic—including the ability to discover, create, share and reuse composable data models using GraphQL. </p><p>ComposeDB provides a complete data solution that supports multi-player use cases—like those demanded by social and DAO applications. Popular <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/highlighted-projects/">use cases</a> include projects around user profiles, reputation (publicly verifiable attestations for skills, credentials, and contribution scores), and user-generated content (portable social graphs, social media apps, networking, messaging, and blogs). </p><p>Today, Ceramic applies to a wide variety of use cases across different markets and segments. Its many examples include:</p>  Storing user-generated content as Ceramic streams for app interoperability  Storing contributor credentials for DAOs  Issuing and storing verifiable credentials  Creating unified conversation layers that can work across applications  Enabling fully encrypted wallet-to-wallet messaging  Storing user profile data  Storing dynamic NFT content and metadata attached to user identities  Dynamically appending metadata to NFTs over time<br>  <p>Following the production-ready release of ComposeDB, we expect to see applications that offer extremely rich end-user experiences—all built by developers who contributed to the community-driven data ecosystem on Ceramic. </p><p>Ceramic’s core team will present a production-ready version of ComposeDB in early 2023, one that will:</p>  Enable developers to define and query complex graph database schemas that feature many different forms of relations between accounts (e.g. a user) and their content (e.g. a social post)  Make indexing and querying possible on Ceramic  Make data models and data more easily reusable on Ceramic  Support advanced permissioning   Overview of ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>This section outlines the five features and components that make ComposeDB on Ceramic possible. Click <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.2.x/guides/concepts-overview">here</a> for a full overview of concepts.</p> Composites &amp; Data Models <p>Composites are composable building blocks used by developers. They are groups of data models (e.g. profiles, blog posts, and comments) that together define the graph database schema for an application. Content streams in Ceramic have metadata that automatically associates them to a data model, which defines the shape and schema of that data, as well as to accounts and other content (e.g. User X liked a post by User Y). Composites aggregate these lower-level data models into higher-level groups for application development. Composites are created by developers in the community and all feed into Ceramic’s ecosystem, making it easy for different applications to reuse and share data.</p><p>As we shift toward Composites, we’ll be sunsetting the previous data models module and discouraging using TileDocument streams.</p> Database <p>There are a few important changes required when running a JS Ceramic node after the ComposeDB release. Every node must now be backed by a SQL database, SQLite or Postgres, that will be used to index the data and construct the database for the data models in your Composite. Each node decides what to index and store in the database based on the models contained in its Composite, which must be passed to the node during development time.</p><p>Ceramic acts as a syncing protocol that maintains your local database state against a global network of documents and interoperable data models, maintained via the same verifiable event streams that have always been at the core of Ceramic—allowing you to trust the integrity of your index.</p> GraphQL <p>Developers only need to use one library, the ComposeDB Client, which provides a GraphQL interface to Ceramic. This client needs to be passed a Composite in order to saturate its own APIs and know which data models you’re using. Once your ComposeDB Client is loaded with your Composite, you can make GraphQL queries and mutations against your Ceramic node. Using ComposeDB will be much easier and more streamlined than building directly with previous developer packages on Ceramic—such as IDX or DID DataStore.</p> Data Model Reusability and Marketplace <p>Composites and their underlying data models are designed to be reusable, making it simple to build complementary and interoperable apps. Apps that reuse each other's Composites create instant interoperability, without any integrations needed. To date, developers have had to manually submit data models to the Registry on Github. Data models are now automatically indexed, enabling easier discovery and reuse. In the first release milestone, getting existing models happens through commands in the ComposeDB CLI, but we’ll follow closely with a UI.</p> Object Capabilities <p>One of the biggest challenges in Web3 is offering the ease of use of Web2—one-click sign-in and user sessions—while also preserving the user’s control of their data. To enable this, we have a new library called “did-sessions” built with CACAO (Chain Agnostic Capability Object), offering a permissions model called<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/"> capability-based access control</a>. CACAO will integrate with ComposeDB to grant granular permissions to specific models. Permissions open up a range of new use cases, sign in flows, and data access patterns on Ceramic. This includes capability-based permission scoping, which allows a developer to specify which Composites or data models they’re asking permission for.</p><p>The first major use case we’re enabling with CACAO is Sessions. We’ve paired CACAO and did-sessions library with a new DID method, called did:pkh, and the Sign-In With Ethereum specification (with more chains to come). This will allow users to seamlessly sign-in with their wallet and delegate actions (e.g. “liking”) and storage permissions to the developer for time-bound periods.</p> Ceramic Today vs. ComposeDB on Ceramic <br><p>Ceramic Today</p><p>ComposeDB on Ceramic</p><p>DB Type</p><p>Key-Value Store</p><p>Graph Database</p><p>Models</p><p>Account to single JSON object (Data Models)</p><p>Property graph supporting one-to-many relationships (Composites)</p><p>Storage</p><p>TileDocument streams</p><p>Model streams, MID streams</p><p>Indexing</p><p>None</p><p>Indexing by each Ceramic node</p><p>Queries</p><p>Many JS Library Method Calls</p><p>GraphQL Queries</p><p>Clients</p><p>HTTP Client, ModelManager, DID DataStore, Self.ID SDK</p><p>HTTP Client, GraphQL Client</p><p>Accounts</p><p>3ID as default</p><p>did:PKH as default</p><p>Authentication</p><p>All-or-nothing permissions</p><p>Granular permissions per model</p><p>Composability</p><p>GitHub Data Models Registry</p><p>Marketplace for models</p><p>DX</p><p>Patchwork of client libraries</p><p>Streamlined flow and tooling</p><p>UX</p><p>Specific Ceramic sign-in popups</p><p>Familiar, Web3 wallet-native</p><p></p> Milestones for ComposeDB on Ceramic <p>The following milestones represent different releases of ComposeDB on Ceramic. The dates are targets, not commitments. Please join our mailing list or Discord Server to find out when new releases go live.</p> Developer Preview <p>The <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Developer Preview</a> will be available for developers who want to familiarize themselves with the new ComposeDB stack. Over the coming months the Ceramic core team will release new versions with improved functionality and documentation.</p><p>Available Early September </p><p>The earliest Developer Preview will offer the CLI and GraphQL Client, Composites, Sign-In With Ethereum, DID-Sessions, and the ability to explore models in the CLI. The core team will provide a Getting Started Guide, high level docs and js-ComposeDB API documentation. </p><p>Limitations: Currently, ComposeDB only supports defining relations between an account and the documents created by this account. Relations between documents and accounts are under development. In addition, there will be no scalability guarantees, no access to historical third-party data, it will not be available on mainnet and there will be no retroactive data availability.<br></p><p>Available Early October at Devcon in Bogota, Colombia</p><p>This release milestone provides simple relations between documents and accounts, enabling developers to test graph models so they can build richer and more engaging applications on Ceramic. </p><p>This version of the preview will offer simple (as compared to the following release) model relations, an improved docs portal with updated API documentation (js-compose, js-did, js-ceramic), Sign-In With Solana functionality and an updated way to index models that doesn’t require developers to restart their nodes. </p><p>Limitations include no access to historical third-party data, no optimization for deeply-nested queries with many relations and, at this time, ComposeDB will allow duplicate relations (e.g. liking the same post twice); therefore, developers will need to build preventative logic.</p><p>Available Late December </p><p>This release enables support for interfaces, allowing developers to evolve their application through extending existing data models, and unifying queries across different data models. This will also make it easier for developers to build shared interfaces with other applications (e.g. an interface for comments) as well as extend models for their app (e.g. adding more fields to a model).</p><p>For example, there could be a generic verifiable credential interface, this interface could be implemented by an education credential and a job employment credential. An application could make a union of these two credentials and seamlessly query across both of them. Verifiable credential MID streams won’t belong to the generic VC interface, but they will belong to more specific data models that implement the verifiable credential interface (e.g. education credential, job employment credential, DAO contribution credential, etc.).</p><p>Developers can expect support for sets, and indexable anchors that enable historical data sync retroactively. Historical data sync will enable a node to connect to the network and sync previous data (before the point in time that the particular node started indexing the data model). Historical data sync also means that if Node B goes down it will still be able to index the data via Node A, allowing historical data to sync between applications that share the same data model.</p><p>Available January 2023</p><p>This release enables developers to build on an open data ecosystem and define the data standards for their app (and others to come) to interoperate. </p><p>At this stage, queries will be executed more efficiently than before (server-side query execution), improvements will come to the dev portal, and easy-to-use node metrics will be available—in addition to self-serve mainnet access. </p><p>Limitations at this stage include multi-node deployments and a lack of hosted node options. </p> Production<br> <p>Available Early 2023</p><p>Developers can build quickly on ComposeDB to offer rich end-to-end user experiences on their apps—providing data models and interoperable data within the Ceramic ecosystem. </p><p>At this point, Ceramic will handle a standard deployment of millions of writes and reads per day, in addition to a UI for searching Composites (data models) and improved Getting Started documentation. A UI for searching data models and Composites will make building with ComposeDB on Ceramic faster than before. Templates for scaled deployments and a hosted infrastructure option will also become available.</p>  💡  Read the <a href="https://threebox.notion.site/ComposeDB-on-Ceramic-Developer-Preview-c0032b37a007451683eb3d7a1091db53">Getting Started Guide</a> to build with ComposeDB and let us know what you think via this <a href="https://m6mc0n6phdp.typeform.com/to/c9XafeHl">2-minute survey</a>

<p>When Apple releases iOS 16 in September, it will debut the highly anticipated Passkey, a new form of security authorization that will allow users to sign into accounts without having to use a password. This effort was announced in May as part of a joint press release by Google, Apple, and Microsoft promoting a “passwordless future” based on new support for FIDO credentials. FIDO credentials are built on a digital standard that uses public-key cryptography to communicate secure authorizations to a user’s account.</p>

<p>While some experts continue to stress the use of password managers to solve the password problem, other developments might quash it entirely by killing the password altogether. This effort gained momentum when Apple, Google, and Microsoft committed to expanding their support for the FIDO standard to accelerate the availability of passwordless sign-ins. Users will soon be able to use two new capabilities for passwordless sign-ins. The first will let users automatically access their FIDO sign-in credentials on devices without re-enrolling their accounts. The second will let users enable FIDO authentication on their mobile devices to sign into an application or website on a nearby device, regardless of the operating system platform or browser they are using.</p>

<p>This contributed byline from Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of FIDO Alliance, details cybersecurity blind spots generated by growing IoT technology adoption. To address these issues, the FIDO Alliance launched FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) in 2021 to tackle two main problems: deployment efficiency and security at the point of onboarding. The main feature of FDO is fully automated device onboarding, which considerably speeds up the previously manual process. FDO also replaces generic password credentials with highly secure cryptographic keys, making the devices considerably more robust against attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passwords can be replaced. With the tools here, they are still in play, but fade into the background. Truly password-free web services are those that allow logging in via a special USB security key – keyword FIDO2 (Fast IDentity Online 2). The range of compatible web services is still rather thin. It is possible that FIDO replaces passwords or functions as a second factor (2FA, two-factor authentication).</p>

<p>The Indian Payments ecosystem is going through rapid change and advancement. The Reserve Bank of India (Digital Payment Security Controls) Directions 2020 were issued for regulated entities to set up a robust governance structure for such systems and implement common minimum standards of security controls for channels like internet, mobile banking, and card payments, among others. In this paper, we demonstrate how FIDO Authentication represents the best way for organizations to implement simpler, stronger authentication that meets Reserve Bank of India’s Master Direction on Digital Payment Control requirements, while also enhancing the user experience.</p>

 How to take steps to recognise and encourage pro-social behaviours Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Anyone can create a badging system, if by ‘badging system’ we mean ‘lots of badges for discrete things’. Too often, though, these badges focus on credentialing rather than recognition.</p><blockquote>Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.”</blockquote><blockquote>(<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>We’re so conditioned into getting certificates and trophies for achievement (aka ‘credentials’) that sometimes we have to remind ourselves what we mean by recognition.</p><p>So instead of talking about this in an abstract way, let’s talk about it in the context of the <a href="https://badges.community/">Keep Badges Weird (KBW) community</a>, which currently has over 300&nbsp;members.</p> Identifying pro-social behaviours <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosocial_behavior">Pro-social behaviours</a> are those intended to benefit others, or society as a whole — for example, helping, sharing, donating, co-operating, and volunteering. Within a community, they’re the behaviours that make it an attractive space to belong to, and which encourage its growth and/or development. It’s a central part of the value cycles that underpin the Communities of Practice&nbsp;model.</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Within the KBW community, we already have a series of fine badges including those shown above. These also happen to be<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wtf-are-stealth-badges-41130a75a1a9"> ‘stealth’ badges</a>, awarded to community members without them actively seeking&nbsp;them.</p><p>The particular pro-social behaviours we have identified with these badges&nbsp;are:</p>  Coming to someone’s rescue — is someone stuck with a problem, or in an awkward situation?  Kicking off a discussion — has someone gone out of their way to prompt discussion or debate on an&nbsp;issue?  Keeping it positive — is there someone who’s done a good job of keeping the community focused on solutions rather than endlessly talking about problems?  <p>People don’t have to reach a high bar of have done something out of the ordinary to earn a badge that recognises a pro-social behaviour. For example, the first badge that most people in the KBW community earn is the ‘Keep Badges Weird’ badge, issued to those who <a href="https://app.participate.com/discussions/introductions/9e0fa7d1-f307-4839-b1c8-5d95472c61a2">introduce themselves</a> in a dedicated thread.</p> Encouraging participation <p>The best badging systems evolve over time with communities. A great example of this is the <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/explore/badges">Fedora Linux community</a>, which has a badging system which at this point is around eight years old and contains hundreds of badges. These range from commonplace badges such as making a single contribution to the codebase, through to ultra-rare badges such as overall project&nbsp;leader.</p>Screenshot of Fedora&nbsp;badges<p>It’s interesting to note the different types of badges that are issued within this community:</p>  Content  Development  Community  Quality  Event  Miscellaneous  <p>These categories can emerge over time, and may not even be necessary at all. It’s important to understand that these emergent badge systems are built with community members, not for&nbsp;them.</p> A worked&nbsp;example <p>One of the resources that the KBW community helps maintain is <a href="https://badge.wiki">Badge Wiki</a>, a knowledge base for the entire Open Badges community. While it’s true that anyone with an account can edit the wiki, not so many&nbsp;do.</p><p>So the first thing we did was to create a time for us all to come together and work on it. We call this <a href="https://lu.ma/barn-raising">Badge Wiki barn raising</a>, and we do it monthly. Ideally, there are always new people on this call, as well as those who have been to at least one previous&nbsp;session.</p>Screenshot of Barn Raiser badge, description and&nbsp;criteria<p>The badge that those who come to a session can earn is shown above. This serves several purposes, from validating attendance (for those who need it) through to recognising the contribution they have&nbsp;made.</p><p>But where do we go next? How do we go from a single badge to start building out a badge system around stewardship of this particular resource?</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>Perhaps the easiest place to start is to recognise people turning up on multiple occasions. They don’t have to be consecutive, and it doesn’t need to be the organiser of the session that keeps track. Instead, this could be a claimed badge based on pointing to evidence.</p><p>This kind of approach can be repeated ad infinitum. There’s value in doing so — the Fedora badges system has a badge for people who have performed 10,000 builds! But what else can we recognise and encourage? After all, people contribute to communities (including Open Source communities) in many and varied&nbsp;ways.</p>Image CC BY Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>People also have different interests and talents, so why not recognise those? We chose three types of people from <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?WikiAgent">this helpful list</a> as a way of helping people identifying roles for themselves, and to help people understand that there are lots of different ways to contribute and create value. Every Badge Wiki barn raising call starts with this, as a ritual and routine and a way for people to feel&nbsp;welcome.</p>Image CC BY&nbsp;WAO<p>Even this small demarcation of roles helps in a number of&nbsp;ways:</p>  People can start small and work their way onto bigger&nbsp;tasks  Contributors arrive with varying energy levels, so may be in the mood for different tasks on different days  People can follow their interests as well as their talents for contributing to the&nbsp;project.  <p>Inevitably, even in the first session, those who turned up as contributors to the Badge Wiki barn raising started identifying themselves as ‘FairyGardeners’&nbsp;. That is to say they felt like doing a couple of different things, or mashing up those roles. This is absolutely to be encouraged!</p> Conclusion <p>This has been a brief guide with worked examples of how to create a culture of recognition, taking steps to recognise and encourage pro-social behaviours. WAO don’t have all of the answers, so we’d love to hear from you! Please do comment below if you’ve got examples (or questions)</p><p>Recognition within a community of practice is best as a varied and emergent system, and so our next task is to create badges from these reflections for the <a href="https://lu.ma/barn-raising">Badge Wiki barn raising sessions</a>. If you would like to come along, please <a href="https://badges.community">join the KBW community</a> and turn up for the monthly sessions!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/creating-a-culture-of-recognition-39ffdb6cf943">Creating a culture of recognition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A roundup of previous seasons and a sneak peak into Season 5&nbsp;planning <p>After summer holidays, sunshine and lollipops, we’re getting back into the groove. This includes some thinking and planning around Tao of WAO Season&nbsp;5.</p><p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">The Tao of WAO is a podcast</a> about the intersection of technology, society, and internet culture — with a dash of philosophy and art for good measure. We <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/announcing-our-new-podcast-e38aaba57066">announced the podcast in May 2021</a>, and since then we’ve been pumping out season after season. We haven’t summed up the previous seasons, ever, so this is a quick post to do that and talk about what we’re planning for Season 5. Don’t want to read about it? <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/">Then just go give it a&nbsp;listen</a>!</p>Our <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tao-of-wao">Soundcloud</a> header Season 1 <p>When we started the Tao of WAO, we weren’t sure what kind of format we wanted to have. We kicked off the podcast talking about cooperatism because, well, we’re a co-op. Over the course of the season we talked about being geriatric millennials, doing digital detoxes and had our first guest, John Evans from <a href="https://code-operative.co.uk">Code Operative</a>.</p> Season 2 <p>We started to hit our stride in Season 2. We kicked off the season with a trailer, and then had great conversations with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamjessklein/">Jess Klein</a> on Ethical Design and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kudzayingwerume/">Kudzayi Ngwerume</a> on Creativity and Movement Building. We also chatted about working remotely, unframeworks and keeping badges&nbsp;weird.</p> Season 3 <p>Our first episode of Season 3 had all the <a href="https://weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-o</a>p folks on. We talked about some of our internal policies around dormancy in the co-op. This was also the season we talked to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrilemoie/">Kerri Lemoie</a> about Verifiable Credentials, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexworradandrews/">Alex Worrad Andrews</a> about Networks of Networks, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/procter/">Adam Procter</a> about Social Impact Games. When we weren’t interviewing these amazing people, we recorded an episode on Misinformation and used our final episode of the season a somewhat random conversation about stuff we’d been working on and newsletters we like to&nbsp;read.</p> Season 4 <p>Again in Season 4, we managed to have amazing guests. We talked to <a href="https://outlandish.com/person/kayleigh-walsh/">Kayleigh Walsh</a> about Restorative Justice, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherleson/">Heather Leson</a> about Opening Up Social Impact Organisations and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryannalexander/">Bryan Alexander</a> about Futurism. In between our guest focused episodes, Doug and I talked about participation in Civic Society, Self-hosting IT and Reentering Events after&nbsp;Covid.</p> Season 5 (coming&nbsp;soon!) <p>You can probably tell from this short summary that we cover a wide variety of social, cultural and techie issues. In the new season, we’re planning to talk about edtech, communities of practice, feminism and more. We’ll have more book recommendations from our guests and more laughs coming soon to wherever you listen to your podcasts.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch! <p>We’re always looking for interesting folks with interesting things to say, so if you’d like to be a guest on the Tao of WAO, <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">let us know</a>. We are also extremely grateful when listeners get in touch to give feedback!

<p>A recent SpyCloud study showed that over 64% of people reuse their passwords. Some experts continue to stress the use of password managers to mitigate this issue, but this could be squashed by eliminating passwords all together. Going passwordless gained momentum in the second half of 2022 when Apple, Google and Microsoft committed to expanding their support for the FIDO standard. FIDO’s work has resulted in the development of FIDO Universal Second Factor (FIDO U2F), FIDO Universal Authentication Framework, and FIDO2- which have been embraced and further utilized by a few of the largest tech companies in the world.</p>

<p>In recent years, developers have been the targets of multiple attacks due to their access to sensitive systems.&nbsp; As the tech giants have begun their collaboration on making the user experience of passwordless better, users still need to register across all their devices.&nbsp;The solution to this is passkeys that allow users to easily and securely access passwordless systems across all devices. The FIDO2 Authentication standards are based on public key cryptography for authentication that is more secure than passwords and SMS one-time passwords. FIDO2 Authentication enables password-only logins to be replaced with secure and fast login experiences across websites and apps.</p>

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Jason Sherman, Developer at <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/energy-mines-and-petroleum-resources">Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust, Government of British Columbia’s Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation</a>.</p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on and how you got into blockchain</p>



<p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) is a pilot project enabling a collaborative digital ecosystem between the B.C. government, natural resource companies, and organizations around the world, making it simpler and more secure to share sustainability data. I am currently working on EMDT’s technology, called Traction. Traction is basically a layer above Hyperledger Aries&nbsp; Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) that enables the Government of British Columbia to use our technology for line of business applications. This allows the government to onboard into the world of digital credentials easily, and to track their business data with their credential and presentation exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Hyperledger frameworks or tools are you using in your projects? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>We are using Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and Hyperledger Indy. Using Hyperledger frameworks has increased Traction’s interoperability, making it possible to incorporate a broader range of participants, tools, and technologies into the digital ecosystem EMDT is coordinating. We’re using Hyperledger’s open-source software to accelerate the Government of B.C.’s ability to adopt these tools. My experience with Hyperledger technologies is that things change quickly! And any problem or use case I identify is usually already being addressed.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger Foundation to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>I think the Hyperledger Foundation should focus on multiple ledger support (which is already underway) and onboarding users (not developers) of the implemented technology.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a very steep learning curve, but it’s extremely worthwhile. You will very quickly identify areas where the technology could benefit your clients.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s projects continue to mature, what do you see as the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result?</p>



<p>I am interested in the ability for Hyperledger projects to enable more automated business flows using truly trusted and tamper-proof data. The number of personnel hours that can be saved just through automated conversation and interchange of data programmatically is massive.</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>I am hopeful that blockchain has the potential to improve trust between businesses. By exchanging information using blockchain technology and digital credentials, the validity and origin of the credential can always be verified, and businesses can proceed with their interactions confidently.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I would hope to see blockchain as a viable and easily selected technology, along the lines of Postgresql or MongoDb. I would hope that blockchain could be adopted as a mainstream technology that development teams can look at as a solution to solve their problems.</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>Your code isn’t precious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>



<p>Plumbing.</p>

<p>A cyber security breach that unfolded at LastPass – a provider of credential management services – appears to have affected only the firm’s developer environment, and is unlikely to rebound on users, according to community experts, who have praised the firm for its quick and transparent response to the incident. Many providers, including LastPass, are offering and migrating to passwordless logins which use more advanced security technologies such as FIDO2 security keys. This reduces friction for end-users and increases the overall account security.</p>

<p>Our online lives are protected, first and foremost, by passwords. They are a part of our everyday lives and protect our sensitive information in the digital world. However, they aren’t a flawless system of protection, and our lives would certainly be easier without the need for them. Many reuse passwords across accounts or set up very weak ones, easily guessed ones, and the truth is we are under a constant threat of cyberattacks by increasingly savvier hackers. Current basics of online security must ensure there is a high standard of education and password hygiene. From there, there are tools to help reinforce the education, such as password managers, and Single Sign-On (SSO) or Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) options. For a passwordless world, however, there needs to be more. Fast Identity Online (FIDO) technologies support authentication mechanisms, such as biometric face and fingerprint ID and the addition of hardware security keys.</p>

<p>Apple recently presented its version of “passkeys”, which are to replace passwords in the not too distant future. In doing so, the US company is not going its own way, but is relying on the open standard of the FIDO Alliance, which is also supported by other industry giants such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook (“Meta”) and Amazon.</p>

<p>The Universal Resolver is a utility developed by the community at DIF to resolve Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) across many different DID methods, based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C DID Core 1.0</a> and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/">DID Resolution</a> specifications. It is a work item of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/identifiers-discovery/">DIF Identifiers &amp; Discovery Working Group</a>, and is provided as a tool to support interoperability efforts and enable testing.</p>
 New DID methods 
<p>We continue to receive great contributions from the community in the form of new drivers as well as updates to existing ones, in order to support as many DID methods as possible. Several more DID methods have recently been added to the Universal Resolver, including:</p>
 
 
<p>did:indy (the long-awaited upgrade of the original did:sov method) - See <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:cheqd (from the Cheqd community) - See <a href="https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver">https://github.com/cheqd/did-resolver</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:com (from Commercio Network) - See <a href="https://commercio.network/">https://commercio.network/</a></p>
 
 
<p>did:ala</p>
 
 
<p>Did:everscale</p>
 
 
<p>The Universal Resolver can now resolve 45 DID methods, and more are being added regularly. Visit <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a> to see the full list of supported methods, and visit <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver/blob/main/docs/driver-development.md">this github page</a> to contribute a driver for a DID method.&nbsp; In the event of a problem resolving a did or with driver functions, the contributor has 30 days to resolve the issue before the driver and DID method get delisted. This ensures that the list of methods on the Universal Resolver is regularly tested, and remains updated and functional.</p>
<p>For example, try the following commands to resolve DIDs to their DID documents:</p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE</a></p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:cheqd:mainnet:zF7rhDBfUt9d1gJPjx7s1JXfUY7oVWkY">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:cheqd:mainnet:zF7rhDBfUt9d1gJPjx7s1JXfUY7oVWkY</a></p>
<p>curl -X GET <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:com:1l6zglh8pvcrjtahsvds2qmfpn0hv83vn8f9cf3">https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:com:1l6zglh8pvcrjtahsvds2qmfpn0hv83vn8f9cf3</a></p>
<p>Or try opening the UI to resolve the above DIDs:</p>
<p><a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE">https://dev.uniresolver.io/#did:indy:idunion:BDrEcHc8Tb4Lb2VyQZWEDE</a></p>

 New hosting environment 
<p>It seems the community has been just as excited about the Universal Resolver as we are, and it has seen traffic grow steadily over the past few months: In order to serve this increased demand the hosting environment of the Universal Resolver has been upgraded and should now be able to handle additional load. DIF's public instance of the Universal Resolver can be reached at <a href="https://resolver.identity.foundation/">https://resolver.identity.foundation/</a> and <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">https://dev.uniresolver.io/</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind however that this instance is meant for experimentation and testing only, NOT as a production service. It should not be used in situations where a reliable DID Resolution service is needed, or when DIDs are being resolved that are potentially sensitive from a privacy perspective. In general, self-hosting the Universal Resolver, or using other client-side DID Resolution tools, is preferable over relying on the public DIF-hosted instance.</p>
<p>Do you have any interesting applications or examples of where you have used the Universal Resolver? We would love to hear your experiences of it; constructive feedback is always welcome. Get in touch with us directly at <a href="mailto:ops@identity.foundation">ops@identity.foundation</a> or attend one of the meetings of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">DIF Identifiers &amp; DIscovery Working Group</a> to discuss. For further backstory on the Universal Resolver, see this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c">blog post</a> and this <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/did-resolution-given-did-how-do-retrieve-document-markus-sabadello-webinar-13/">webinar</a>.</p>
<p>This new-and-improved Universal Resolver joins other tools, such as the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, a DIF community-maintained tool to create, update and deactivate Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIF has also recently published <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">version 2 of the DIDComm protocol spec</a> and version 2 of the Presentation Exchange Protocol. Other community tooling includes items like the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/vui-donation/">Verifier Universal Interface</a>, standard APIs to enable interoperability between ID Wallets and Verifier components, and the completed <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree specification</a>, a protocol for creating scalable Decentralized Identifier networks that can run atop any existing decentralized anchoring system and be as open, public, and permissionless as the underlying anchoring systems they utilize. The most popular implementation of Sidetree currently is <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION (the Decentralized Identity Overlay Network)</a>, a layer 2 system.

<p>The Finnish Ministry of Finance has granted the Findynet Cooperative a three-million-euro government grant to build a pilot environment for a self-sovereign identity network. The aim of this public-private cooperation is to strengthen Finland’s leading position in digitalization and support the emergence of investments in new digital services.</p>
<p>The Findynet Cooperative aims to develop a network that ensures that digital wallets developed by different service providers are interoperable, and work seamlessly for both organizations and individuals. Digital wallets enable individuals and organizations to share information about themselves in a reliable and secure manner in various situations. The funding will enable the Findynet Cooperative to develop a common and secure self-sovereign identity network, which can be used to ensure the correctness of information in electronic interactions.</p>
<p>– We are very happy to have received this government grant, which allows us to continue our long-term work with public and private sector actors and build a trust network covering all of society, comments Markus Hautala, Chairman of the Board of the Findynet Cooperative.</p>
<p>The trust network, which will now be built, promotes digital and human-centered data economies. This means that end-users manage their own data and can decide for themselves what information they share about themselves with different parties to preserve their privacy. For example, this exchange of information could involve electronic receipts, credit information, and proof of professional qualifications.</p>
<p>The founding members of the Findynet Cooperative include nine public and private sector organizations: Finance Finland, Finnish Post, Nixu, Nordea Bank, OP Financial Group, Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela), Technology Finland, Tietoevry and Vastuu Group.</p>
<p>The announcement by the Ministry of Finance on the subject can be found <a href="https://vm.fi/-/valtiovarainministerio-myontaa-valtionavustusta-itsehallittavan-identiteetin-luottamusverkon-kehittamiseen">here</a> (in Finnish).</p>

This release includes major updates to the front-end Switchboard web application as well as the back-end libraries and components, giving companies access to the full suite features offered by legacy identity access management solutions in a decentralized architecture.</p><p>Why we built Switchboard<br>Digital identity is integral to every facet of the energy sector, from basic administrative procedures (processing customer rebates for smart thermostats, or registering new solar systems) to high-stakes operational tasks (granting access to customer data, or sending control signals to generators). Given the importance of keeping identity data accurate and secure, as well as the risks and limitations of centralized management approaches as energy systems become increasingly diverse and distributed, SSI has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/decentralized-identity-market-worth-6-822-million-by-2027--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-301557216.html">fastest-growing segments</a> of the enterprise IT landscape in recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>We began developing what is now Switchboard in 2019 to address two gaps in the market that were hindering SSI adoption in the energy sector and&nbsp;beyond:</p>  Most SSI solutions are focused narrowly on end-users (individual identity wallets to store credentials) or organizations (platforms to issue credentials to internal users). We saw a need for a harmonized solution that not only addressed both of these requirements but also provided sophisticated features like role-based access control and identity management for non-human actors (i.e. hardware and software systems).  The end-to-end solutions that do exist align with open standards, but are based on proprietary technology, costly contracts, or permissioned back-ends (either private blockchains or centrally-administered databases). We saw a need for a fully open-source, low-cost solution built on a public network and tightly integrated with the Ethereum ecosystem to improve interoperability (e.g. support for multiple wallets) and usability.  <p>The alpha version of Switchboard was <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-unveils-ew-switchboard-2f71bc82daa0">launched on the Volta test network in late 2020</a> with basic tools for users to manage identities and credentials, and for application, developers to define roles and implement simple role-based access control for users. Since then the Energy Web team has overhauled both the user interface and back-end components to turn Switchboard into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade solution.</p><p>What’s new in production?<br>The production release of Switchboard incorporates several exciting new features that are critical for enterprise adoption:</p>  Credential Revocation: Identity and access management is a dynamic process, and when circumstances change they need to be reflected in user credentials. For example, when an employee resigns from the company, access rights need to be revoked in order to keep confidential information secure. Switchboard now offers tools for administrators to manually or programmatically revoke credentials based on customized business&nbsp;logic.  Credential Expiration: To maximize security credentials should never grant indefinite or permanent access to a given system. Just like driver’s licenses and passports, credentials should carry expiration dates and require ongoing renewal processes. Switchboard now allows role definers (e.g. organization administrators) to set default validity periods for credentials, which can be optionally overridden by&nbsp;issuers.  Full Support for Role-authorized Issuance: This feature allows administrators to delegate responsibility for the issuance of certain credentials to other entities based on their role within or relationship to the organization. For example, a user within a utility company who holds credentials to acquire the role of “IT Manager” may then inherit the ability to issue credentials to other internal users, or an external contractor with credentials granting the role of “Solar Hardware Installer” may inherit the ability to issue credentials to new photovoltaic systems. Multi-level hierarchies are now supported (for example, “Solar Hardware Installer” may be issued by “Installation Coordinator”) and the full hierarchy is verified upon each credential presentation.  Credential Issuance Based on Email Verification: Switchboard is currently used to support Energy Web’s staking system, which issues a verified email role credential based on email verification. This role credential is then used to authorize users to stake. (If you have participated in any Energy Web staking pools, you already have a DID with this credential and you can view its status in Switchboard under the “My Enrolments” page.) This functionality is now available for any other credential issuance and authorization use case that requires email verification.  Better Alignment with Verifiable Credentials Standards: We’ve made significant improvements to Switchboard’s underlying libraries and components to better align with new W3C Verifiable Credential Standards. Switchboard now supports the issuance of JSON-LD format Verifiable Credentials using an EIP-712 signature.  Asset Administration: Switchboard allows asset owners to assign identities to individual assets so they can be enrolled in applications and services, or managed throughout their lifecycle. These tools make it easy for owners to prove attributes to external parties and transfer ownership (including tracking ownership history).  <p>What’s next?<br>We’re proud to celebrate the launch of Switchboard as a milestone in Energy Web’s long-term technology roadmap. You can learn more about <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/switchboard/using-switchboard">how it works</a>, and <a href="https://switchboard.energyweb.org/">start using it</a>&nbsp;today.</p><p>However, there are many steps ahead in the journey to unlock the full potential of SSI in support of the energy transition. While Switchboard currently offers all the tools necessary to implement SSI in enterprise environments, we will continue to develop additional tools and features across our broader identity and access management stack, including a decentralized <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">universal resolver service</a> for both credential holders and issuers that makes it possible to resolve identity data from any blockchain or database.</p><p>Stay tuned for more announcements, and be sure <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">to follow us</a> for the latest&nbsp;updates.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Avast (LON:AVST), a company best known for its antivirus and other cybersecurity products for consumers, has joined the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation as a Steering Member. Avast recently acquired Evernym, a founding ToIP Steering Member, and SecureKey, a ToIP Contributor Member since 2020.</p>



<p>Avast’s ToIP Steering Committee member will be Drummond Reed, Director of Trust Services at Avast. Mr. Reed has served as Evernym’s Steering Committee member since the founding of ToIP in May 2020. He currently co-chairs the ToIP Governance Stack Working Group and Concepts and Terminology Working Group and is a vice-chair of the Technology Stack Working Group.</p>



<p>“Avast brings a new perspective to the Foundation’s mission of defining Internet-scale decentralized digital trust infrastructure,” said Mr. Reed. “Avast has a 30 year history of protecting the digital devices of over 435 million consumers. Now Avast wants to extend that protection to individual’s digital identity and relationships online because identity is at the very heart of cybersecurity.”</p>



<p>Avast, headquartered in Prague, is rapidly building one of the largest decentralized digital trust teams in the world. In June of 2021, they hired Charles Walton, a former Mastercard executive (and Mastercard’s original ToIP Steering Committee member), as General Manager of their new Digital Trust Services division. Then in December 2021, Avast acquired Evernym, one of the global leaders in self-sovereign identity (SSI). In March 2022 they announced the acquisition of SecureKey, operators of the Verified.Me network in Canada that is one of the largest bank ID networks in the world.</p>



<p>In a keynote speech at the European Identity Conference in Berlin, Mr. Walton said Avast would be focusing its efforts on the “empowered consumer”—giving individuals the tools they need to have portable, reusable digital identity credentials that do not depend on any one device, operating system, or identity federation. “It is finally time we had digital wallets with digital credentials that work exactly the same way our real-world wallets do,” said Mr. Reed. “We can take and use them anywhere to privately prove just what another party needs to know in the context of a particular transaction. We don’t have to go through any third-party gatekeeper to do this. That’s the way it should work in the digital world too.”</p>



<p>The challenge, of course, is interoperability—the entire raison d’etre of the ToIP Foundation. According to Mr. Reed, this is the reason that Avast intends to participate very actively in advancing the work of ToIP Working Groups. “Avast is a global company, and the #1 challenge in establishing digital wallets and credentials that work around the world is interoperability,” said Mr. Reed. “It is a key focus of the European Digital Identity Wallets initiative as well as other government-sanctioned digital wallet projects. Avast believes that the ToIP stack is the answer, and we want to help drive its completion and adoption as quickly as possible.”For more information about Avast’s digital trust services and products, please visit <a href="https://www.avast.com/digital-trust">www.avast.com/digital-trust</a>.

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>This video shares a talk from the <a href="https://www.scottishaisummit.com/summit-2022">Scottish AI Summit</a>, addressing how best we can support the commercialization of AI technologies to meet real-world needs. 
<p>The University of Edinburgh has programmes to nurture data-driven entrepreneurs at different stages on their journey from the seed of an idea to scaling globally. As well as supporting both technology transfer from academic research and home grown businesses, the University is also attracting high growth global AI start-ups.</p>
<p>In this panel session, Katy Guthrie and Laura Bernal from the University’s Data-Driven Entrepreneurship programme will be joined by founders of some the companies they have supported, across different sectors including MedTech and ClimateTech.</p>
<p>The discussion will focus on the opportunities and challenges for companies using AI, how scaling AI driven business can benefit the people of Scotland and the world and what can be done to stimulate activity and address issues.</p>
 Introductions – (3m:15s) 
<p>Katy Guthrie, the Manager for the University of Edinburgh AI accelerator program commenced the summit by stating the purpose of the panel, which is to explore how best to support the commercialization of AI technologies.</p>
<p>The university has entrepreneurs at different stages on their journey from the seed of an idea to scaling globally, as well as supporting both technology transfer from academic research and home-grown business. The University is also attracting high-growth global AI start-ups.</p>
<p>She introduced the other members of the panel who are founders of AI-driven companies at different stages. They’ve all taken entrepreneurship programs at the university too.</p>
<p>After the introduction, at about 4m:20s Katy listed the topics to be discussed which are:</p>
 
 The role of AI as an enabler. 
 The areas of opportunity. 
 Challenges faced and how well to overcome them. 
 
<p>She describes how they had a recent program that supported 12 AI-driven companies over a period of 6 months and it’s helped companies to build commercial skills, connect them into networks, and to learn from each other.</p>
<p>At 6m:47s Laura Bernal talks about how they supported Ph.D. students and early career researchers who are looking to commercialize IP or research, and that their program helps companies to be more business-minded. They help scientific background people to think about business because they believe academia can have a relationship with industries. She was formerly a founder before she joined the program.</p>
<p>At 8m:14s they are joined by the other panel members introducing themselves and what they do. Xiaoyan Ma, founder and CEO of <a href="https://danurobotics.com/">Danu Robotics</a> introduced herself and talked more about her company.</p>
<p>Then at 9m:00s, she hands over to Lorenzo Conti, a founder and managing director at <a href="https://www.crover.tech/">Crover</a> who talked about his Edinburgh-based startup which focuses on helping grain storage operators like grain merchants, port operators, and cooperatives.</p>
<p>On to Debbie Wake (10m:28s), a medical doctor and clinical academic with the University of Edinburgh. She is also a Co-founder of a digital health company <a href="https://mywaydigitalhealth.co.uk/">MyWay</a>. She gave a brief talk on how they manage conditions like diabetes, drug response and diagnostic prediction as well as how they offer tools to Education platforms.</p>
<p>Joseph Twigg, CEO of <a href="https://aveni.ai/">Aveni</a>, introduces his company (11m:56s), also an Edinburgh-based startup, where they focus on natural language processing, delivering and helping with solutions in the service industries. They derive insight and automation from customer conversation.</p>
 Scaling AI in Scotland 
<p>From 13m:40s Katy moves on to the detail of the discussion, with the main perspective being to identify why it is important to support the scaling of these businesses, which is to boost economic growth and productivity because these companies are creating high-value jobs.</p>
<p>They also support companies that tackle societal issues in Scotland. They have a strong capability in AI in Scotland which is attractive to companies who want to work not just at the University of Edinburgh but in Scotland.</p>
<p>They are often seen as being great at inventing things but not as good as commercializing them. For example from a review it was identified that the UK is ranked third in the world for research in AI but only 11th in its ability to realize Impact from it. So they want to change that and make Scotland seen as an excellent place to build a high-value AI-driven business.</p>
<p>It’s partly about supporting homegrown businesses and also attracting AI start-ups from elsewhere. The key point is about building the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In Scotland, they’ve got lots of big corporates in industries and they need innovative smaller businesses like start-ups that can bring new ideas. Developing and fostering that ecosystem is a key part of what they do at the Bayes Centre of the University of Edinburgh with the data-driven entrepreneurship support program at the university.</p>
 The Role of AI as the Enabler (16m:23s) 
<p>Here Katy asks the panel why they use AI, to explore what role the technology plays as an enabler.</p>
<p>For example at 17m:04s Joseph said he worked in the financial services industry for 15 years and identified a number of potential scenarios for improved efficiencies through using the technology.</p>
<p>Debbie highlights how they didn’t start as an AI business, but rather as an educational web site for diabetes information, and they came to realize how important data was to that process, and it became clear that AI could play a key role in facilitating better personalized access to that data.</p>
<p>For Lorenzo (20m:00s) they were working with a very novel and complex technology that involves hardware locomotion through a very kind of unstable environment data and they employed AI to tackle several technical challenges in a different part of their product, and to reach the required level of performance. In a very efficient way, AI helped them in the prediction of the robot’s movement around the environment, and since then they have employed it in other areas like the accuracy of their sensors.</p>
<p>At 23m:41s Katy asked Laura if she has any other companies looking up to AI for solutions to early-stage academic problems.</p>
<p>In response to this she mentioned a company that didn’t start as an AI company but later employed AI to model how the results of diagnosis will perform and how effectively it could put them to an advantage over their competitors. She said she has seen many companies that are AI-driven and need AI to increase their competitive advantage.</p>
 Finding Opportunities 
<p>Laura takes over at 25m:11s and asks the panel if there are other areas where AI can be applied.</p>
<p>For Xiaoyan it will have a huge opportunity in traditional industries such as agriculture risk management and manufacturing. AI can help people in the space to improve their operational efficiency, profitability, and sustainability, and&nbsp;can help in changing the procurement processes.</p>
<p>For Lorenzo (29m:35s), what is needed for the AI solution to work is assistance on how to manage funding.</p>
<p>There’s a need for access to another company’s customers’ data and regulatory bar set very high to train models (Joseph 32m:58s), and AI also needs to make a product that compensates for the risk companies are taking.</p>
 If you could do something different this time what it be? (Laura 34m:14s) 
<p>According to Joseph, partner selection would be the first thing to do differently, especially in the first critical phase of developing and validating the concept.</p>
<p>Debbie seconds this at 35m:25s, describing their challenge with Information Governance in the NHS, and how bringing in an expert consultancy to address this early on for them would have saved them up to two years of work.</p>
<p>At 38m:00s&nbsp;Laura asks Katy what opportunities she has seen and the ones coming up next. Katy replies that she sees many, in key areas like Natural Language Processing, and that you can view them through a lens of industry vertical or horizontal technology specialisms, and that there is potential to cut across multiple use cases.</p>
<p>She cites an example of a body scanning app that took part in their accelerator, which can be used for e-commerce scenarios where it can be used to match customers sizes to reduce returns, and it can also be used in Healthcare.</p>
 Challenges Faced by AI-Driven Business 
<p>At 43m:45s the panel moves on to the final topic: Challenges Faced by AI-Driven Business.</p>
<p>These include&nbsp;the volume of data (Debbie 44:23), and when dealing with AI there’s high-risk complexity often that brings in regulatory burden, therefore there’s a need for additional research evaluation risk assessment.</p>
<p>Joseph makes a critical point at 45m:42s, that the Scottish startup support ecosystem is great, but it’s not so great when it comes to encouraging large enterprise organizations to work with those startups. For example providing them incentives to choose to work with a local startup vs AWS.</p>
<p>From 49m:18s, Debbie talked about what can help:</p>
 
 Support within the Scottish ecosystem. 
 Support from using wider support. 
 Support from Scottish Enterprise. They support in a lot of ways around market scoping internationally and have amazing networks and obviously the AI accelerator program. 
 
<p>From 51m:58s Lorenzo adds that there’s a need for support programs that truly understand deep hardware innovators, a challenge globally not just in Scotland.</p>
<p>At 54m:45s Katy asks Joseph: Should early-stage businesses worry about the public perception of AI, or should they just get on with making the best possible solutions?</p>
<p>Lorenzo believes it’s a lot to do with perception, that most people assume AI is intelligent robots when really what is in use is the type of business applications improved by algorithms that have been discussed on this panel. Similarly Joseph adds that while AI is used to augmented processes like those in financial services it is still ultimately a decision made by a human.</p>
<p>Debbie also added that though changing public perception is really hard but as SMEs she thinks they’ve got restricted resources as to how to do that. Working with policymakers and bodies to try and support the industry image is a good thing.</p>
 Wrap Up 
<p>At 57m:32s: Katy handed over to Laura to round off the summit.</p>
<p>Laura started by accepting the fact that there are always going to be challenges in the process. Therefore she encouraged us to think about how we could help companies that are developing in AI and how we can start changing that infrastructure to overcome those challenges as an ecosystem in general.</p>
<p>In her closing remark, she said the AI accelerator would be opening applications for their next intake in April to start the program in September. And also if anyone wants to scale an AI company should contact Katy through her LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katy-guthrie-edinburgh/">Katie Guthrie</a>.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNx3f74AmVQ">this video</a> Kate Forbes, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy, delivers a statement to the Scottish Parliament, about transforming Scotland’s tech sector. 
<p>In August 2020, the Scottish Government published the “Scottish Technology Ecosystem Review”, which is a blueprint to establish Scotland as a leading hub for tech start-ups. The report was written by Mark Logan, the former Chief Operating Officer of Skyscanner, which was one of Scotland’s first tech companies to achieve a valuation of more than £1 billion.</p>
<p>Professor Logan’s report was greeted with acclaim on publication. It was described as an “exciting route map for how the government and the private sector can work together to build Scotland into a global leader.</p>
<p>Last October, the Scottish Government invited suppliers to tender for a contract to establish a national network of five ‘tech scaler’ hubs in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Inverness.</p>
<p>The hubs will provide Scottish companies with commercial education sourced from the best providers in the world. That education will be complemented with physical co-location, first-rate mentoring and vibrant peer communities. Through state-of-the-art remote technologies, all of that will be available virtually in every community in Scotland.</p>
<p>Those tech scalers are a game changer. The government has established a new organization named Scottish Teachers Advancing Computing Science (STACS) which helps driving improvements in equipment, teacher training and the curation of best practice. Working with Toni Scullion and Brendan McCart, the government has invested more than £1 million pounds to add to schools’ existing stocks of computing hardware.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government also invested a further £500,000 in the digital skills pipeline, a bespoke set of modular courses running from beginner level all the way through to advanced coding. They provided grant funding of £150,000 to CodeYourFuture, a truly exceptional organization that supports refugees with the skills and networks necessary to progress in education and employment.</p>
<p>The Scottish National Investment Bank has agreed to support the all-female investor group, Investing Women Angels, to establish a new investment fund focused exclusively on women and minority founders based in Scotland. That makes Scotland one of very few European nations with a bespoke seed investment fund focused on stimulating the growth of female-led companies, delivering yet another of Mark Logan’s recommendations.</p>
<p>STACS ensures that there is greater choice for young people in their formal subject choices and informal extracurricular activities. It is a teacher-led organization, which starts with teachers. It aims to provide support and expertise to and promote skills among computing science teachers across Scotland.</p>
<p>Many young people in Scotland are choosing to work and study simultaneously, and a number of tech businesses are already taking advantage of that apprenticeship model. According to the government, work has also started on expanding the young person’s guarantee.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is progressing a number of recommendations specifically around investment and investment funding, to avoid the situation whereby, for a Scottish start-up to expand, grow and develop, it needs to access funding elsewhere. Although no one would dispute that Skyscanner has been a success, some of the recommendations looked at, for example, establishing a series A funding partnership between the Scottish Government, Scottish venture capitalists and external investors; investment vehicles specifically for certain groups, such as female founders.</p>
<p>In the opinion of Kate Forbes, the government has much to do with the 95 per cent of access to broadband that already exists. Clearly reaching the goals of the R100 program it needs to ensure that every property has access to broadband. They will progress that and ensure that it is delivered despite the fact that it is a reserved area and they are stepping into the breach to do that and the work is progressing.</p>
<p>The tech ecosystem fund has supported multiple events for and by women, with more than £160,000 of funding given to Women’s Enterprise Scotland, Female Founder Squad, Mint Ventures and other organizations providing learning and peer networking opportunities and helping to overcome some of the challenges faced by women in tech. There is a clear gender gap in business participation in Scotland. Closing that gap and unlocking the full economic potential of women in enterprise will have a transformative impact on Scotland’s economic performance.</p>
<p>According to Kate Forbes, being able to provide extracurricular activity that creates equity of access to opportunities to learn is so important. The young women are being role models as female founders and in celebrating female computer science teachers, which is critical to all of this. Right now, Education Scotland has a dedicated team that is working with schools and early learning centers specifically to deal with early gender stereotyping and to ensure that that engagement carries on throughout primary school and high school and ultimately into the university years.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is keen to see more small and medium-sized enterprises embracing the opportunities of technology, and that needs to go hand in hand with cybersecurity. In the past, they have provided financial support, such as vouchers, to help SMEs to do that. She has referred to some of the cyber apprenticeships that all goes hand in hand with promoting best practice across the public, private and third sector.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>Speaking at the Barclays Glasgow Campus on 13 July 2022 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlines the Scottish Government’s commitment to supporting entrepreneurship and innovation through the launch of the Tech Scalers network. 
 Video Summary 
<p>Barclays will be the host of the Glasgow Tech Scaler hub and that is good news, a further demonstration of how important this campus is going to be not just to Glasgow but to Scotland as a whole.</p>
<p>Over the last few years Scotland’s tech sector has really developed a very strong sense of community, and you can see, hear and feel this. Businesses are constantly sharing and learning from each other’s experiences.</p>
<p>Within the context of the Scottish Government’s overall&nbsp;approach to the economy the establishment of the Tech Scalers are central to the ambition of creating a more entrepreneurial nation, making sure that the commitment to and success in entrepreneurship in a future Scotland is very much chiming with that reputation for enterprise innovation and entrepreneurship that we have down through past generations.</p>
<p>A few months ago, we published the new Scottish government national strategy for economic transformation looking at how particularly we emerge from the Covid pandemic. We want to build a country that is greener, fairer and wealthier for this and generations to come, and to help us achieve those aims that we’ve set very clearly.</p>
<p>There is a need to establish a sense of common purpose among businesses trade unions, government and the many other partners that all need to contribute to building a successful economy and that sense of common purpose is already very striking in the tech and entrepreneurship sectors.</p>
<p>This has been developed in recent years by the likes of CodeBase, FutureX, the Bayes Centre EIE team,&nbsp;as well as by networks like Startup Grind, The Female Founders Squad, the Scottish Games Network and many others besides.</p>
<p>So, it’s something that as government we want to support and encourage across other parts of the economy. In recent years, for example, we funded SCDI to run productivity clubs to bring companies together to learn from each other about how to operate more effectively and how to benefit from new technology. So, it’s a simple but really powerful way of tackling what is one of the biggest issues facing our economy and how do we sustainably increase productivity.</p>
<p>The benefits of that approach where businesses and organizations cooperate and collaborate for a common purpose is already very clear in this sector. In the tech sector, the efforts you’ve made in recent years are already making this sector a very significant Scottish success story. Scottish startups and scale-ups employ more than 135,000 people which is more than anywhere else in the UK outside of London and the south east.</p>
<p>Our universities are recognized rightly as world leaders in areas like data analytics and informatics and we have got enormous strengths as a country in really key areas for the future like AI robotics and FinTech. So we’ve got lots to be proud of we’ve got lots to be enthusiastic and optimistic about.</p>
<p>The sector can still do much better and to illustrate that with just one example in recent years – Scotland has produced three unicorn companies of course valued at more than one billion dollars and two of these have been tech companies. It is something be celebrated but over that same period that Scotland has produced three unicorns, Ireland has produced seven, Estonia ten, Israel sixteen and Sweden thirty five.</p>
<p>Obviously, the creation of unicorn companies isn’t by any stretch of the imagination the only measure of a country’s success but it is a strong indicator and one that we should take seriously. We can and should be doing even more to build on the current strengths that this sector has. Scotland’s ecosystem before the pandemic was closer to this tipping point than at any time in its modern history.</p>
<p>It highlighted that relatively limited interventions by government could help reach that tipping point and it set out what those interventions should be in the three key areas of education, infrastructure and financing. The Scottish government has started implementing these recommendations.</p>
<p>For example, we’ve established a new organization called Scottish Teachers Advancing Computing Science and are designing a new plan for skills development for computer science and teaching. It will help to shape and transform how computer science is taught in our schools. We also establish the tech ecosystem fund which provides support for organizations that help entrepreneurs connect with their peers and with potential investors.</p>
<p>We invited tenders last year to establish the Tech Scalers. The bidding process generated a lot of interest which is really encouraging and has already led to new collaborations between Scottish and international organizations.</p>
<p>The contract has been awarded to CodeBase, who already run a very successful tech incubator in Edinburgh and under the contract they will establish seven Scalers in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling.</p>
<p>These hubs will be delivered in partnership with universities, local authorities and businesses. The Scalers will provide the basic infrastructure but also a complete support service for startups, will offer five separate courses for companies at different stages of development from new startups onwards. The course for advanced companies will include free access to a program called Reforge, which is Silicon Valley’s most prestigious education program for tech startups.</p>
<p>CodeBase have also promised to develop a national calendar of events for the tech community and companies led by women and minorities, currently significantly underrepresented amongst tech startups will be prioritized for entry to the incubators.</p>
<p>These companies will also be given extra support that recognizes the greater challenges they currently face in raising investment and developing peer networks. Supporting entrepreneurship is one of the most important interventions any government can make in an economy, so that’s why the new role Mark Logan is taking up as chief entrepreneurship officer is so vitally important.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government is determined to do everything we can to create a more entrepreneurial nation indeed that’s why we’re investing in these tech scalers at a time when we’re facing a tough public spending environment, because we know that by providing the right environment for business government action can help to support a much stronger and more sustainable economy.</p>

<p>While many self-sovereign identity solutions offer tools for individuals, a government team from Canada is using digital trust technology to improve sustainability reporting in the natural resource sector for organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
Nancy Norris 


<p>The Government of British Columbia (B.C.) – a Trust Over IP (ToIP) Steering Committee Member – initiated the Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) project under the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation (EMLI) to facilitate the transition to a resilient, clean economy. EMDT’s pilot enables a collaborative digital ecosystem between the B.C. government, natural resource companies, and organizations around the world to improve sustainability reporting using digital credentials. Digital credentials make sustainability reporting more efficient, enhance business-to-business trust, and protect data from manipulation. Digital credentials can be checked in real time, expediting access to trustworthy information. These trusted, verifiable digital credentials are the core digital trust technologies being piloted and the trust ecosystem in which they operate are defined in ToIP architecture, governance, and related documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Join members of the open-source community as they share projects, discuss problems, and collaborate on new solutions at three Linux Foundation conferences this September. Attend one of three sessions featuring EMDT’s business application of digital credentials with Nancy Norris, Senior Director of ESG &amp; Digital Trust in the Ministry for Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation for the Government of British Columbia, and Kyle Robinson, Senior Strategic Advisor.</p>

<p>Security threats are always changing and evolving causing us to shift gears into how we can better approach authentication. While there are plenty of authentication methods, the root of the security problem is the password. Traditional MFA solutions have proven to provide little additional assurance and leave companies vulnerable unless they make a change. By eliminating the password, we can eliminate the most common cyber-attack vector. Passwordless MFA (PMFA) is the only way to break this cycle. PMFA is phishing resistant and is core to the Zero Trust model which is part of FIDO2. CISA has endorsed FIDO2 as the gold standard for authentication. By eliminating the weakest part of the security chain, automated attacks are virtually eliminated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The role of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has notably changed since the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Dale Heath, Technology Lead at Rubrik A/NZ, “A holistic security approach – combining infrastructure, cloud and data security (or end-to-end Zero Trust security) – is required to help keep an organisation safe.”&nbsp; “This means bringing together prevention, detection and investigation as well as ensuring data resilience, data observability and data recovery.”&nbsp; The next plan of action is to go passwordless. The industry is on the cusp of replacing passwords and legacy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) methods with modern open authentication standards, like FIDO2. These standards will enable widespread adoption of phishing-resistant and usable security, and hopefully, will be able to help CISOs to eradicate an entire class of issues that have long been associated with passwords.</p>

<p>In the last few days, the encrypted messaging platform, ‘Signal’ confirmed a variety of their customers fell victim to the phishing attack on Twilio. It is estimated that 1,900 were affected by the breach via phone number and SMS verification links to “reset passwords” on a phony Twilio link. By posing as Twilio’s IT dept, the hackers were able to obtain victim’s login credentials. Unfortunately, it is still unclear who was behind this attack. Cloudflare also revealed they were subjected to a phishing attack around the very same time as Twilio, but was not breached as an end result owing to the corporation-vast use of hardware-centered, FIDO2-compliant multi-factor authentication (MFA) keys.</p>

   University of Essex is proud to publish a report, and an accompanying workbook, created with the support of The Engine Room, which outline the ethical considerations that should be taken into account when conducting open source investigations for human rights advocacy or legal accountability.

<p>Today, human rights abuses are often documented as they happen and quickly shared with others around the world: war is streamed live through digital communications technologies. Protesters carry cameras into the streets and film arrests or the misuse of teargas. Perpetrators share videos of violence in messaging groups. All of this is possible through cheap camera sensors in mobile telephones that allow their owners to film and share videos on social media platforms thanks to high-speed internet connections. The collection, analysis and publication of this information – and other digitally mediated data like satellite imagery and social media profiles – by journalists and human rights investigators has become known as open source investigations. This investigative technique has grown in prevalence over the past decade. Collecting videos and photographs of possible human rights abuses or violations of the laws of war is now part of the researcher’s methodological toolbox. Yet all too often, the collection, verification and use of open source information can happen without thinking through all the ethical considerations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, the <a href="https://twitter.com/HRBDTNews/status/1509458926022107139" title="Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project">Human Rights, Big Data and Technology Project</a> (University of Essex) published a report, and an accompanying workbook, created with the support of The Engine Room, which outline the ethical considerations that should be taken into account when conducting open source investigations for human rights advocacy or legal accountability. </p>



<p>The report outlines a <a href="http://repository.essex.ac.uk/32642/" title="report outlines a Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to open source investigations">Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to open source investigations</a> that tries to ensure that human rights organisations do not adversely affect the enjoyment of the human rights they seek to protect.

<p>While we have reason to appreciate the increased visibility of serious international crimes that warrant investigation, these probes come with difficult decisions and raise human rights and ethical challenges. The appeal of open source investigations in allowing investigators to map violations across time and space pull these concerns to the fore. Open source research can, for example, uncover the identity of witnesses, victims or perpetrators and the location of a crime in near real time, potentially placing these people at risk. Open source research relies on the collection and analysis of large data sets that create and expose patterns in data. Human rights investigators and their organisations not only need to be aware of the ethical challenges this form of research presents; they also must consider and integrate their responses to them as they plan, execute and make public their research.</p>



<p>We hope this report and workbook offer material to open source human rights investigators and other organisations applying such an approach to their research, with discussion points that ensure that this rapidly-developing field always remains focused on the victim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Zara Rahman and Gabriela Ivens highlight in the <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/digital-witness-9780198836070?cc=nl&amp;lang=en&amp;" title="book Digital Witness">book Digital Witness</a>, “the end mission of defending human rights and revealing rights violations means that investigators should be particularly cautious about their actions and understand the responsibility they carry. In essence: human rights should not be violated during the process of a human rights investigation”.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I only discovered Kim Cameron’s seminar article on the seven laws of identity many years after it was published, it felt as current as anything new I was reading when I first began studying identity. Going through his thought-provoking blog posts about identity and privacy also provided me with ideas and considerations that I could not find anywhere else. As a result, I am deeply honored to be one of the first recipients of the award in his honor in recognition of my work in this field.</p>
<p>My journey with digital identity began as a back-end web developer who was curious about how the systems I was helping to build handled users’ passwords, as well as having to implement single sign-on using SAML. Many years later, when I began pursuing a PhD, my advisor suggested that I specialize in electronic identity at our very first meeting. After reading numerous books, papers, protocol specifications, and implementations, I am now researching quantum-safe IAM protocols and self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>One of my first thoughts while attending the conference was how excited I was to meet the giants who wrote the protocols I have been studying and actively implementing in my academic research. However, Identiverse provided me with much more. The opportunity to (physically) reach out to many like-minded people outside of academia who are interested in the challenges of security and privacy in IAM is perhaps the most valuable outcome.</p>
<p>Furthermore, learning about the most recent developments in the OIDC working groups FAPI, eKYC &amp; IDA, and SSE, as well as the work on the OAuth side of the force with OAuth 2.1, PKCE, and RFCs 9068, 9126, and 9207, was extremely beneficial. Furthermore, it was only through attending Identiverse that I discovered that a sizable portion of the IAM industry is focusing on multi-factor authentication, which surprised me because I assumed this was already well established.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the OpenID Foundation for this incredible opportunity and eager to collaborate with the identity community.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>At the start of 2020 a new workgroup was formed under the OpenID Foundation that was to continue on from activities that had been ongoing in the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">AB/Connect Working Group | OpenID</a>&nbsp;for some months. That new working group came to be known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC &amp; Identity Assurance Working Group</a>.</p>
<p>The initiation of that activity was off the back of a IPR donation from yes.com of an extension to OpenID Connect that they had created.</p>
 What Is It? 
<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0-13.html">OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0</a>&nbsp;(OIDC4IDA for short) is an extension to&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core</a></p>
 OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0 Current Status 
<p>Implementers Draft 4 is currently available for review –&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/2022/08/19/fourth-public-review-period-for-openid-connect-for-identity-assurance-specification-started/">Fourth Public Review Period for OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance Specification Started</a>.</p>
<p>There is a beta version of the Conformance testing suite that supports OIDC4IDA available on request that was developed through directed funding and will allow implementers to check their implementations conform to the specification, making implementation of interoperable solutions cheaper and easier.</p>
<p>The current spec is already being adopted in a number of places including Germany, UK, EU and being seriously considered for use in Australia.</p>
 What is OIDC4IDA Good For? 
<p>OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance is primarily focussed on addressing use-cases where the details of the assurance process used to verify and validate the end-users identity need to be explicitly communicated.</p>
<p>The working group believes it’s a good fit for account opening, staff on-boarding, account recovery and access to restricted services where communication of how the underlying identity was established is needed.</p>
 Who Built It? 
<p>The inspiration for OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance was from yes.com in Germany and donated to the OpenID Foundation in 2019. It has seen further development from a wide range of people from many countries and businesses of many types, including software vendors, services companies, network operators, consultancies, banks, and healthcare providers.</p>
 How Does It Work? 
<p>OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance is intended to be a lightweight extension to OpenID Connect and uses the authorization code flow of OpenID Connect Core including allowing for end user approval. It encourages the use of the claims request parameter where the relying party expresses which parts of the identity data and metadata it needs, and it defines a schema for communication of “verified claims”. The “verified claims” specification has two child elements one with information about “verification” (and validation), and the other containing the verified end-user claims themselves.</p>
<p>Security concerns relating to exchange of sensitive personal data via OIDC4IDA should be addressed simply through use of the output of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> which you can read about in this white paper.</p>

You can ignore this security group for now.</p><p>Click the Create security group button in the top right corner of the page.</p><p>Step 3<br>Configure the new security group with the following parameters:</p><p>Basic details</p>  Security group name: ceramicservers  Description: allow access to Ceramic services  VPC: Leave as default unless you have a more complex AWS environment  <p>Inbound rules</p><p>Rule 1:</p>  Type: Custom TCP  Port range: 7007  Source: Anywhere-IPv4  Description: Ceramic port  <p>Rule 2:</p>  Type: SSH  Source: Anywhere-IPv4  Description: SSH port  <p>Outbound Rules</p>  Leave as default  <p>Tags</p>  Leave as default  <p>Once you have filled in these configuration options click the Create security group button.</p><p>You should now see the newly-created security group in the management console.</p> Creating a Ceramic Node <p>Now that all of the AWS environment setup is complete it's time to begin building a Ceramic node in the cloud.</p> Creating an EC2 Instance For Ceramic <p>Step 1<br>From the AWS Management Console use the search bar to locate the EC2 Service by typing <code>EC2</code> and selecting the corresponding service.</p><p>You should now be able to see the associated EC2 Resources that you set up in previous steps. If you are working from a new AWS environment you will see that there is 1 key pair and 2 security groups.</p><p>If you do not see these resources, ensure that you are viewing the proper region. Sometimes the AWS Management Console will display resources from different regions and can make it appear as though resources are missing when they are in fact in a different region.</p><p>Step 2<br>Below the Resources box you will see a Launch instance section. Click the orange Launch instance button in this section and select Launch instance from the drop down menu that appears.</p><p>Step 3<br>You are now ready to begin configuring an EC2 instance for your Ceramic node. This screen can seem a little daunting with all the options, so take extra care to configure options properly before launching your instance.</p><p>Improper configuration could result in charges to your AWS account. 3Box Labs and the Ceramic Network are not responsible for any charges you incur while working with cloud resources. Please double check all your work and understand the AWS billing process before proceeding.</p><p>Configure your EC2 instance with the following options:</p><p>Name and Tags</p>  Name: Ceramic  <p>Application and OS Images</p>  AMI: Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) - Kernel 5.10, SSD Volume Type (Free tier eligible)  Architecture: 64-bit (x86  <p>Instance Type</p>  Instance type: t2.micro (free tier eligible)  <p>Key pair</p>  Key pair name: ceramickeypair  <p>Network Settings</p>  Firewall: Select existing security group  Common security groups: ceramicservers  <p>Configure Storage</p>  1x: 15gb  GiB: gp2  <p>Advanced details</p>  default  <p>Once you have added these configuration details, set the Number of instances to 1 and click the orange Launch instance button located at the bottom of the Summary</p><p>Step 4<br>The Launch an instance page should now have a button that allows you to View all instances. Click the View all instances button to continue.</p><p>You will now see a new EC2 instance named Ceramic Server running in your environment.</p><p>In the next section you will connect to this instance and configure your Ceramic node.</p> Connecting to The Newly Created EC2 Instance <p>Connecting to this newly created EC2 instance will vary based on your operating system. If you are using Windows you will need an SSH client, such as <a href="https://putty.org/">PuTTY</a>. If you are using Linux or MacOS you will be able to use the built-in SSH client located in the Terminal.</p><p>The instructions that follow will only cover the Linux and MacOS terminal. Once connected to the instance all commands and steps will be the same regardless of which operating system you are using.</p><p>Step 1<br>In the AWS Management Console select the Ceramic Server EC2 instance and click on the Connect button located near the top of the screen.</p><p>After clicking the Connect button select the SSH client tab to see the connection instructions for your instance. Your details will be different from what you see in the screenshot below since AWS populates this information dynamically.</p><p>Step 2<br>This step will guide you through the instructions located on the SSH client tab of the Connect to instance page.</p><p>Open your terminal and locate the key pair file you downloaded in Step 3 of the <a href="https://hackmd.io/ahqZ7_OeRp2f7vAKQyOP_Q#Preparing-AWS-for-Ceramic">Preparing AWS for Ceramic</a> section, it should be named <code>ceramickeypari.pem</code> if you followed along with the earlier steps.</p><p>This file may also have a <code>.cer</code> extension. This is perfectly fine and can be treated as a <code>.pem</code> file.</p><p>In this example the <code>ceramickeypair.cer</code> file is located in the Home directory of the logged in user.</p><p>When you download this file from AWS it downloads with improper permissions for use. If you try to use this file with your SSH client you will see an error explaining that the file has too many permissions to be used safely. Let’s fix that now by reducing the permissions granted to this key file.</p><p>In the terminal run the following command:</p><p><code>chmod 400 ceramickeypair.cer</code></p><p>There will be no output from this command, but if you inspect the permissions you should now see that this file is only able to be read by the owner. <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php">Learn more about file permissions</a>.</p><p>Now that your file permissions are properly restricted, use your terminal to connect to your EC2 instance. The connection information can be found in the example at the bottom of the Connect to instance page you opened above in Step 1. Your details will differ from what you see below.</p><p><code>ssh -i "ceramickeypair.cer" ec2-user@ec2-54-215-186-11.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com</code></p><p>When prompted to accept the fingerprint, type the word <code>yes</code> to continue connecting to your instance.</p><p>You should now see the terminal change to reflect that you are connected to the EC2 instance.</p><p>You are now connected to your EC2 instance using SSH. Any commands you run inside this terminal will execute on the remote instance located on AWS.</p> Installing Ceramic Dependencies <p>Step 1<br>When you launch a fresh AWS instance, it’s always a good practice to start by updating the package manager. This Amazon Machine Image(AMI) uses <a href="https://linuxconcept.com/yum-package-manager-a-complete-guide/">yum</a> as its package manager. To update the packages on the system run the <code>update</code> command as an administrator. In this case we will add the <code>-y</code> flag to skip being prompted if we are sure we want to apply the updates.</p><p><code>sudo yum update -y</code></p><p>There will be an overwhelming amount of information on the screen after you enter this command. The most important piece is at the end where the result of the command says complete and you have control of your prompt once more.</p><p>Step 2<br>One great thing about cloud computing is that the virtual machines provided for use are slim and often do not contain unnecessary software.</p><p>One downfall about cloud computing is that the virtual machines provided for use are slim and often do not contain the necessary software for our use case!</p><p>For a Ceramic node, your server will need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> version 16 installed on it. The simplest way to manage different version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> is through the use of a tool called [Node Version Manager(NVM)].</p><p>To download and install NVM on your EC2 instance run the following command in the terminal:</p><p><code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash</code></p><p>It is important to note that NVM is frequently updated, you should always check the GitHub repository to ensure you are getting the most up-to-date version of NVM. This guide will NOT be updated as NVM versions change.</p><p>Once you see the information about what was added to the <code>.bashrc</code> file, NVM has been successfully installed.</p><p>However if you try to run NVM right now the terminal will display an error telling you the command <code>nvm</code> is not found.</p><p>To fix this error you need to “source” the <code>.bashrc</code> file to reload it into the current terminal session. Use the terminal to accomplish this. There will be no output from this command.</p><p><code>source .bashrc</code></p><p>Now if you type <code>nvm</code> into the terminal you should be greeted with the help text for this command.</p><p><code>nvm</code></p><p>Using NVM, install NodeJS Version 16.</p><p><code>nvm install 16</code></p><p>Your instance is now set up and ready to run Ceramic. Let’s get Ceramic running next!</p> Install and Run Ceramic <p>If you’ve made it this far then rejoice… the hard parts are over! Now you simply need to download and run Ceramic, and your AWS Ceramic Node will be fully accessible for your application.</p><p>Step 1<br>Use NPM to install the Ceramic daemon.</p><p><code>npm install -g @ceramicnetwork/cli</code></p><p>The amount of output from this command will be overwhelming; however, near the bottom of the output, you should see a message telling you that new packages have been added to your system.</p><p>Step 2<br>Run the Ceramic daemon to make this a usable Ceramic node.</p><p><code>ceramic daemon</code></p><p>Since you are running Ceramic in bundled mode, the output of this command will contain information about IPFS, to include peer discovery as well as Ceramic configuration information. When you see the message saying “Ceramic API running on 0.0.0.0:7007” you are ready to go.</p><p>Congratulations, you now have a Ceramic node running on AWS!</p><p>As you may have guessed, this is not an ideal setup. If you disconnect from this terminal session, shutdown the EC2 instance or perform many other tasks this process will terminate and your Ceramic node will be unreachable.</p><p>You may want to look into creating start-up scripts for your instance to ensure that the Ceramic daemon runs when the instance starts.</p> What’s next? <p>The only thing left is to connect to your instance using a Ceramic client.</p><p>Example using the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/javascript/http">Ceramic HTTP Client</a>:</p> <code>import CeramicClient from '@ceramicnetwork/http-client'
const API_URL = 'https://yourceramicnode.com' //AWS Public IPv4 info
const ceramic = new CeramicClient(API_URL)

</code> <p>Example using the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-glaze">Glaze CLI</a>:</p> <code>glaze config:set ceramic-url http://&lt;AWS Public IPv4&gt;:7007
</code>  Summary <p>You have now configured a Ceramic node in AWS that is accessible to anyone you share the IP Address or DNS address with.</p><p>It’s important to remember that Ceramic in bundled mode is intended for development purposes. Similarly to cloud providers other than AWS, future blog posts will guide you through setting up a node for production purposes.</p><p>Stay tuned for more Ceramic guides and tutorials.

<p>Being one of the first recipients of the Kim Cameron Award is a great honour and distinction. Kim’s contribution to the identity world impacted and inspired many individuals, including me. Reading his blog and studying the laws of identity helped me advance in my professional and academic career. Therefore, for me, the reward has a special personal value.</p>
<p>I believe that the Kim Cameron Award program is a remarkable initiative connecting academia with the industry. Being a member of both, I can say that there is a significant gap between what is being researched and what is required in the IAM space. As a result, many young and talented researchers struggle to apply their research into real-world applications. Therefore, I firmly believe that promoting academia and industry collaboration should be a key objective for both sides. Global organisations and consortia are the perfect bodies to encourage and incubate industry research projects. That is why I would like to thank the OpenID Foundation and sponsors for taking the initiative and organising this year’s edition of the award. I hope the program will continue and help other researchers to expand their horizons of knowledge, as it did for me.</p>
<p>Thanks to the award I was able to participate in the Identiverse 2022 conference in Denver. I must admit that feeling the spirit of innovation was worth travelling almost half the world (on an over 16-hour flight from Sydney). The conference agenda had an abundance of insightful talks from over 150 speakers. Admittedly, it was difficult to decide which presentation to attend because there were a few simultaneous tracks. I found it particularly interesting to learn the trends and future development directions from the identity leaders during the keynote and panel sessions. On the subject of trends, my takeaways from the conference are threefold. Firstly, the identity community introduced a vision of a new passwordless world. A concept called passkeys (FIDO2 enhanced with multi-device FIDO credentials) was presented and discussed in several sessions, offering a promising first step for public adoption. A second widely discussed technology, which has the potential to revolutionise how identity is implemented, was verifiable credentials. With the recently released OpenID Connect specification to support W3C Verifiable Credentials and Microsoft’s presentations of technology, I am deeply convinced that user-centric identities will shortly reach the mainstream. Finally, the GAIN (Global Assured Identity Network) project seems to gain traction. It is an incredible work of the OpenID Foundation to make identity networks interoperable, and thus allow the use of the same identity globally (just like a credit card).</p>
<p>Identiverse gathers innovators and leaders from the identity industry. And, in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed networking with them. Hallway talks and social events in the evening were perfect opportunities to meet new people and exchange ideas. Listening to the various points of view on the burning issues of identity gave me a perspective on how complex and wide the IAM landscape is. Personally, I am grateful for having been able to meet all the amazing people in person.</p>
<p>The Kim Cameron Award definitely expanded my knowledge and allowed me to smoothly enter the community of identity professionals. Meeting OpenID Foundation members and attending the workshops made me realise the full potential of the Foundation’s work, and encouraged me to participate in its initiatives.</p>

 Our 20 Year Journey 



<p>Like many provinces and territories in Canada, British Columbia (BC) has a long history of providing secure access to online government services. We started our journey 20 years ago with the introduction of BCeID, a simple username and password solution. A lot has changed since then!</p>



<p>Today, we are investing in Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and a digital wallet. We see these as the cornerstones in the evolution of our digital strategy, adding a much needed layer of trust to the digital economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to share what we are doing, why we focus on interoperability and open-source, and why we are excited about VCs being our natural next step.</p>



 Why We Care 



<p>As a public sector organization, BC has a strong interest in seeing the adoption of technologies that are secure, privacy-preserving, and convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital is obviously everywhere. In 2021, 94% of BC citizens said they are online, and 90% of Canadians have smartphones. Also, according to the Business Council of Canada, in the last decade Canada’s digital economy grew 40% faster than the overall world economy.&nbsp; In Digital ID terms, this growth is an opportunity to make people’s online lives easier and safer.</p>



<p>We also know that cybersecurity threats are growing and there are no signs of it slowing down. BC sees an astonishing 496 million unauthorized access attempts per day – that’s 5,741 every second! Identity theft and fraud also continues to rise. We need digital trust solutions that counter this increasing risk.</p>



<p>In responding to this new reality, we recognize that people are familiar and comfortable with the many credentials that governments issue today. Things like physical copies of drivers’ licenses, health cards, passports, permits, and reports are widely accepted and trusted.&nbsp; In BC, we are building on that trust and moving towards providing the same things digitally. We are also enabling confidential connections through the wallet to give people choice and confidence in their digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 BC’s Approach&nbsp; 



<p>Clearly, digital trust goes far beyond just the government. Canadians expect more access, with greater security, to high-value services in both the public and private sectors. VCs and the wallet provide a highly flexible way to achieve that goal.</p>



<p>Collaboration is critical to achieving that goal and it’s important to us. BC’s Chief Information Officer, CJ Ritchie, strongly advocates for us working together to meet the expectations of Canadians.&nbsp; She notes, “If we don’t all act together to deliver solutions that protect privacy and interact securely, trust will erode and there will be negative impacts for businesses, people’s livelihoods, and the broader digital economy.”</p>



<p>As our approach evolves, we also remain keen to support open source solutions that interoperate with other national and international efforts. There is no dominant design yet, no one network or technology, so we must remain nimble and flexible in our exploration. We also need to coexist with existing identity solutions that millions of British Columbians already rely upon.</p>



 Technology Interoperability 



<p>In exploring VCs, BC is contributing to solutions that allow agents to verify credentials from multiple networks. Indeed, through one of our Code With Us initiatives, DID indy, we contributed over 11,000 lines of open-source code to support and prove the viability of a “network of networks”.</p>



<p>We also are focused on the interoperability of Hyperledger Aries agents themselves, another key success metric.&nbsp; We are leading contributors to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness">Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH)</a>, open-source software that runs a series of Hyperledger Aries interoperability tests and delivers the results to the <a href="http://aries-interop.info/">AATH website</a>. Great interoperability requires that we test—and re-test!—that interoperability on a regular basis.</p>



<p>__</p>



<p>Side note: If you want to test the interoperability of any Aries agent with this ecosystem, please sign up to join the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/event/hyperledger-aries-interoperability-event">Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Event on August&nbsp; 31</a>.</p>



<p>__</p>



 Driving Adoption 



<p>In BC we have a lot of technical skill in working with VCs and with Hyperledger Aries agents. However, for VCs to be successful, it needs to be easy for others to join in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the agents side, to complement our extensive contributions to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py)</a> and other Aries and Indy projects, we also contribute to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript">Hyperledger Aries Framework Javascript (AFJ)</a>, the agent commonly used for mobile digital wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why, when thinking about mobile digital wallets, we opted to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native">Hyperledger Aries Bifold</a> project, helping it also essentially become “Bifold as a framework”. Bifold uses AFJ, and BC and others can use it to easily deploy a custom-designed digital wallet. Jurisdictions within Canada and elsewhere in the world are already taking this approach for their own wallet explorations. It’s an open-source stack right the way down.</p>



<p>VC adoption will be helped by a thriving open-source community, and we are giving back wherever we can.</p>



 Open-Source Success 



<p>We believe the community’s success becomes our success. For years we’ve been committed to open-source, interoperable solutions in this space. Our approach is always evolving, but our contributions and commitment to various digital trust open-source projects and technologies continue.</p>



<p>We hope that even more organizations will join in and contribute. Our goal in BC is a new layer of trust for the internet, making it easier for people to work and play online with confidence.&nbsp;</p>

 By <a href="https://medium.com/u/61f092fa8507">Michal&nbsp;Bacia</a> <p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/global-threat-report/">According to security analysts, nearly 80% of cyberattacks are identity-based</a>. In these attacks, bad actors steal administrators’ usernames and passwords or issue fake credentials to themselves. With credentials in hand, unauthorized parties can infiltrate enterprise information technology systems and go undetected for long periods of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Many of these attacks can be prevented via security architectures that embrace decentralized authentication and authorization of users and assets. These architectures, based on decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs), can unlock value across many segments of the global economy. But the energy sector, in particular, stands to benefit greatly. The number of energy sector assets (e.g., electric vehicles, smart inverters, batteries) and actors interacting with them is growing exponentially. A centralized, “Web 2” approach to digitizing these assets and their users (creating a centralized data silo and a super administrator of the silo) is expensive, fragile, and creates lucrative honeypots for malicious actors to attack. At Energy Web, we believe a more effective solution is to embrace a decentralized architecture for user and asset authentication and authorization.</p> The role of verifiable credentials <p>A critical component of any security architecture is the process by which users’ credentials are verified in order to be assigned specific roles. As shown below, when a user with a <a href="https://www.bcdiploma.com/en/blog/blockchain-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credential</a> presents it to a verification service, the service validates the VC and issues an access token. As shown in figure 1, this token can be used to unlock access to smart contracts on a blockchain or to perform certain roles using legacy information technology infrastructure.</p>Figure 1 | Security architecture process to verify credentials to specific&nbsp;roles<p>Conducting this verification process is not computationally intensive and has a binary outcome: whether the VC is valid (cryptographically signed by the authorized issuer) or not. There are several ways to conduct the verification process. It can be performed internally by an organization or via a third-party service provider. These traditional, centralized options create a single point of vulnerability since the verification service itself can be compromised, approve false VCs, and (inadvertently or not) whitelist attackers.</p> A decentralized verification service is a far better&nbsp;solution <p>As shown in figure 2, a decentralized verification service uses a diversity of nodes to perform the verification task independently and then reach a consensus about the outcome with other nodes on the same system. In this setting, validator nodes vote on whether or not a VC is valid. If consensus is reached, the user presenting the VC will be whitelisted or receive an access&nbsp;token.</p>Figure 2 |Decentralized verification service With a decentralized verification service, each node is required to stake economic value in order to verify VC presentations and earn&nbsp;rewards <p>Only honest nodes receive rewards. Misbehaving nodes that vote against consensus are penalized by having their stake reduced or removed entirely (for an overview of staking and “slashing” mechanisms on different blockchain-based networks, check out this explainer). The most practical way to implement this mechanism is to use public blockchains, paired with cryptocurrency, for staking and distributing awards to nodes performing the verification work. By doing so, the execution of the verification mechanism is completely automated, immediate, and impartial. This is a far better solution than relying on an opaque, centralized entity and/or process to perform the same verification service.</p><p>Under the decentralized architecture described here, honest nodes can sound an alarm if they don’t agree with the consensus. They receive the stake from misbehaving nodes in case they can prove wrongdoing. Attackers in this setting need to either a) hack each node individually or b) bribe all nodes needed to reach the consensus. The cost of bribing the nodes is equal to N*S+N*N*S, where N= number of nodes and S = stake of one node. Bottom line = more economic value staked across more nodes, more security.</p>Figure 3 | Decentralized verification service<p>Furthermore, consensus requirements can change based on the value of the VC itself. For high-value transactions or important access rights, consensus may require several rounds of voting. For VCs with relatively lower values, only 10% of nodes, for example, may need to approve the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>In summary, decentralized VC authentication powered by public blockchain and cryptocurrency shown in figure 3 can produce significant business benefits for enterprises in comparison to Web 2-based approaches to authentication and authorization. Don’t take our word for it: multiple Energy Web member companies have recently confirmed that public blockchains present a superior way to securing energy infrastructure and internet-connected devices alongside the findings of many research papers on the subject such&nbsp;as:</p>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8355182">Blockchain: A game changer for securing IoT&nbsp;data</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8605485">Secure IoT Communication using Blockchain Technology</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8012302">Can Blockchain Strengthen the Internet of&nbsp;Things?</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9013413">Cloud-Based Secure Service Providing for IoTs Using Blockchain</a>  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7828539">Securing Smart Cities Using Blockchain Technology</a>   Cybersecurity through staking on Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Currently, Energy Web is working in partnership with Parity Technologies (the company behind Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate) to design, build and launch the Energy Web Consortia Relay Chain, a public blockchain tailored to enterprises. The new blockchain is designed explicitly around the VC verification process described in this post. Our aim is to enable decentralized authentication and authorization for any energy company in any regulatory environment in a way that integrates with existing enterprise information technology systems.</p><p>Since identity management is a foundational component of this new blockchain, Validators on the new network who perform the decentralized VC verification service will be required to stake Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in order to secure the service and the network. In this way, all identity-related processes, together with other blockchain transactions, will be secured by the combined economic value of all <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dSLA-Lightpaper.pdf">EWT staked by Validators and their&nbsp;Patrons</a>.</p><p>With this staking mechanism in hand, the Consortia Relay Chain will unlock security solutions that are impossible to achieve using a centralized, Web 2 paradigm. It will provide unparalleled cybersecurity alongside a robust, flexible DID infrastructure for identity and access management.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

 More system convening, community recognition and a dose of whimsy and weirdness <p>Thanks to <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a>, we were able to take part at <a href="https://www.thebadgesummit.com/">Badge Summit 2022</a> in Boulder, Colorado earlier this month. The <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">Keep Badges Weird community</a> was well represented! We had so much fun seeing KBW community members and having the opportunity to bond. There were great conversations, new ideas and connections and some table tennis tournaments.</p><p>In the lead up to Badge Summit, we had three goals for our participation.</p> 1) Make sure people in the Keep Badges Weird community felt respected and recognised <p>A healthy community is one in which people feel like they belong. Belonging comes from connection. Finding ways to help people connect and share is what community building is all&nbsp;about.</p><p>We wanted to do something special for people who have been working to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-is-about-breaking-boundaries-42afb0415826">legitimise badges</a> and recognition for a long time. We have <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wtf-are-stealth-badges-41130a75a1a9">a stealth badge</a> (that isn’t so stealthy anymore) called “the O.G.”. It is a badge issued to people who have been involved in open badges since before January 2017. We invited people who earned the O.G. badge to a rooftop party on the Sunday evening before Badge Summit. Then in the most meta-badge fashion ever, we gifted these O.Gs a hat with a badge with a badge on a&nbsp;hat.</p>All the&nbsp;swag<p>We also gave out iron-on patches of the other stealth badges, Keep Badges Weird stickers and a “I kept badges weird at Badge Summit”&nbsp;badge.</p><p>A community shouldn’t only recognise members through badges and swag, though. At the party and throughout the few days we were together in Boulder, we spent time together! Swag doesn’t substitute the recognition we can give one another through our conversations and attention.</p><p>We’re so excited to hear what people in this community are working on and to find ways to collaborate. We were reminded at how important in real life events are when you’re trying to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">change the world</a>&nbsp;;)</p> 2) Help potential community members join and be able to interact with the community <p>A community needs to have low barriers to entry. It should also help people see themselves as part of something bigger. In KBW, we want to help members find meaningful contribution or reliable resources or whatever else they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>We hosted two sessions designed to demystify some of what this community is working on. In the first, Wikis for Community Defined Skill Frameworks, we collaborated with KBW community members <a href="https://twitter.com/donpresant">Don</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/capt_info">Justin</a>. The session helped people understand the need for <a href="https://www.openskillsnetwork.org/rsd">Rich Skill Descriptors</a>. It got attendees writing RSDs through a collaborative exercise that helped participants connect.</p>Drawing of the session from KBW member <a href="https://twitter.com/CateTolnai">Cate&nbsp;Tolnai</a><p>Our second session, <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-helping-people-understand-the-badges-landscape-79cc8cf7281">Keep Badges Weird: helping people understand the badges landscape</a>, felt like a big success. Our idea to explain Badge Pathways with the help of a pizza metaphor went well. At Badge Summit there were lots of interesting questions and a discussion around <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>. We had lots of&nbsp;fun.</p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gxuBP7oZbphwgkYWX0VMEWoS3xg_DpHIrJiAUbhmLHI/edit#slide=id.g13cb12b5ea4_0_16">our very awesome title&nbsp;slide</a><p>At the end, participants were invited to join the community. Everyone went away with some beautiful KBW stickers. To make it extra easy for new people to get involved with the community, <a href="https://twitter.com/markjotter/">Mark</a> made the world’s most beautiful QR&nbsp;code.</p>The most beautiful QR&nbsp;code 3) Raise awareness of Open Recognition (i.e. non-credential use of&nbsp;badges) <p>Our third goal is the hardest to assess. Did we have an impact on people we interacted with and their understanding of Open Recognition? Did people at Badge Summit begin to understand that badging isn’t about supporting the old system of credentialing? That it should to be <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">a new system for a different world</a>? Time will&nbsp;tell.</p><p>We’re pleased to be members of a community that cares not only about “knowledge, skills and competencies”, but also things like talents, behaviours, aspirations, connections and more. <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-recognition-is-for-every-type-of-learning-ffd137a6fe17">Open Recognition is for every type of learning</a> and <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/feed">this Community of Practic</a>e knows all about it. We were happy that we weren’t alone at Badge Summit. KBW community members had recognition friendly narratives on stage and in their sessions. Surely, the people who attended Badge Summit 2022 went away with a few ideas on how to integrate recognition into their badging programmes.</p><p>In the coming months, we’re looking forward to reconnecting with people we met at the Badge Summit. We will continue to explore how we can support people in finding ways to integrate Open Recognition. Do you have ideas on what the Keep Badges Weird community could do to help you? <a href="https://app.participate.com/communities/keep-badges-weird/62003f3f-a7ba-4f6a-990a-64d6f893016d/discussions">Start a conversation about&nbsp;it!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/summing-up-badge-summit-fb9d974c647d">Summing up Badge Summit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau<br><br>It has been three weeks since the Digital Trust Hui Taumata at Te Papa Tongarewa and yet it still resonates with many delegates, judging by feedback I continue to receive. It’s a clear indicator of a great event that Digital Identity NZ and NZTech worked hard to bring to the community, overcoming the significant challenges of the time.&nbsp;<br><br>Digital Identity NZ’s Executive Council (EC) remained in Wellington the next day for its annual strategy workshop. It developed a co-creation framework and questions to put to DINZ members – shown further down – regarding what activities our community want to undertake that returns overall value to our members, to DINZ and to Aotearoa’s digital economy in the next 12 months and beyond. &nbsp;<br><br>Let’s refresh our memory of the mahi undertaken in the past 12 months – still some&nbsp;‘work-in-progress’ – but nonetheless impressive for a group comprising of volunteers and minimal staff:</p>



  Creating the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework working group to review the draft Bill and prepare submissions and&nbsp;reports, which have been received positively;  Creating the Te Kahui te Tiriti o DINZ working group to develop and recommend an action plan for DINZ. The plan will help us to deliver on our Te Tiriti obligations SOI and support &amp; promote Māori representation and participation in Digital Identity, though still formative, looks promising;  Creating the Inclusive &amp; Equitable Uses of Digital Identity working group to develop guidance for industry and the Government to help give&nbsp;all&nbsp;New Zealanders equal access to the potential benefits of digital identity – again formative but active engagement underway with civil society organisations;  Completing benchmark consumer and business research in a challenging Covid environment. The results to be made public in a few weeks;  Delivering three&nbsp;in-person member Connect events, again, in a challenging Covid environment;  Delivering the much praised all-day Digital Trust Hui Taumata both in-person and online together with 23 online-only events to the community worldwide&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>  



<p>The 2022 EC reviewed last year’s annual member survey feedback and took the opportunity to review DINZ’s purpose,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">vision and mission</a>&nbsp;to ensure it remains incredibly relevant to the opportunities in Aotearoa’s digital economy.&nbsp;<br><br>The 2022 EC then proceeded to draft a ‘Pillars and Roles’ framework whose purpose is to give better definition and structure to the mahi and associated activities that this communication calls upon members to contribute to; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Four Pillars under which the mahi and associated activities can be categorised – Ecosystem Enablement, Sustainability, Privacy and Trust, Inclusion &amp; Diversity – to be positioned under;  Five Roles that DINZ would play (one or more) applicable to any given mahi and activity – Connect, Communicate, Guide, Develop, Promote;  



<p>DINZ’s Executive Council of 2022 seeks your feedback* on its proposal by August 31st 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YJ225RX">using this&nbsp;Survey Monkey link here</a>.<br><br>The EC’s proposals will be tested against your compiled member feedback and modified where necessary for confirmation through the annual member survey later in the year.<br><br>*Feedback is primarily sought from individual and organisation members of DINZ but feedback from non members is also welcomed.<br></p>



<p>Ngā mihi nui,</p>



<p>Colin and the DINZ Executive Council</p>

<p>The "Data Governance and Semantics" project featured three webinars introducing DDE as a decentralised trust infrastructure acutely aligned with the current movement toward data exchange models in the Economic domain where actors regain transactional sovereignty to share accurate information bilaterally.</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en">European Data Strategy</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/data-strategy/data-strategy.html">Canadian Data Strategy</a>, and new <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/fr/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id.html">Swiss e-ID</a> initiatives demonstrate governmental support for a new paradigm shift in national data management schemes. Moreover, this particular Hasgeek project aligns with the revision of India's current <a href="https://digitalindia.gov.in/writereaddata/files/6.Data%20Protection%20in%20India.pdf">data protection regulation</a>.</p><p>The DDE conceptual infrastructure gives an equal weight of importance to the three core data domains of decentralised semantics, decentralised authentication, and distributed data governance. The HCF founders presented the core DDE concepts in three webinar sessions which interested parties can access via the Hasgeek platform or the Human Colossus Foundation video platform.&nbsp;</p><p>By incorporating first-principle design methodology into the foundational modelling of the core data domains, a network-agnostic system is possible, offering the cryptographic assurance of verifiable digital interactions and the human accountability of socio-economic governance frameworks.</p>


  Part 1: Decentralised semantics <p>Presented by: Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 5th, 2022&nbsp;</p><p>This talk focused on decentralised semantics and how the segregation of task-oriented objects within a standard layered architecture can provide a long-term solution for unifying a data language within distributed data ecosystems. From that lens, decentralised semantics is ontology-agnostic, offering a harmonisation solution between data models and data representation formats while providing a roadmap to resolve privacy-compliant data sharing between servers, networks, and across sectoral or jurisdictional boundaries.&nbsp;</p> What is “Decentralised semantics”? <p>Data semantics is the study of the meaning and use of data in any digital environment. In data semantics, the focus is on how a data object represents a concept or object in the real world.</p><p><br>Decentralised semantics describes a data modelling methodology of layering and cryptographically binding task-specific objects (overlays) to a standard capture base, which, when combined, defines a complex digital object. The segregation of task-specific overlays enables dynamic semantic interoperability in the construction process of any digital object without compromising the objectual integrity of the semantic structure, its modular components, or the relationship between those objects.</p><p>Decentralised semantics provides a powerful solution for semantic interoperability, data harmonisation, internationalisation, and dynamic presentation.</p>

  Part 2: Decentralised authentication <p>Presented by: Robert Mitwicki, Head of the Technology Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 12th, 2022&nbsp;</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>The second talk focused on decentralised authentication and how a decentralised key management infrastructure, providing self-certifying identifier (SCID) issuance underpinned by one-way cryptographic functions, can offer information uniqueness from captured entropy. Furthermore, a decentralised authentication system must be ledger-agnostic, with its identifiers interoperable across ecosystems, platforms, and networks.</p> What is “Decentralised authentication”? <p>Data provenance refers to the tracing and recording of the origin of data and its movement between locations. If digital data is tamper-proof (i.e. provable to have not been corrupted after its creation), it can be assumed to be authentic. Data authentication focuses on timestamping data inputs at index time, determining each event as factual.</p><p>Decentralised authentication describes a key management methodology of cryptographically binding SCIDs to an associated log that compiles the history of all uses or changes to the public/private key pair, ensuring verifiable identifier provenance throughout any ambient infrastructure. Immutable ordering guarantees the factual authenticity of the recorded event underpinning any systematic data input. Furthermore, all system identifiers must remain network-agnostic, enabling identifier interoperability within and across any distributed data ecosystem.</p><p>Decentralised authentication provides a powerful solution for identifier interoperability, data provenance, data-intensive event streaming, and event sourcing applications.</p>

<p>Presented by: Dr Philippe Page, Head of the Knowledge Council</p><p>Date: Tuesday, July 19th</p><p>The final talk focused on distributed governance and how a multi-stakeholder Data Governance Administration (DGA) provides the legal provision to assume responsibility for the consensual veracity of data transactions under its administrative control on behalf of the citizens and legal entities it serves. The role of a DGA aligns closely with that of a “data intermediary” as described in the European Parliament’s recently proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0767">Data Governance Act</a>, serving as a mediator between those who wish to make their data available and those who seek to leverage that data.</p> What is “Distributed data governance”? <p>Data governance is a system of decision rights and accountabilities for information-related processes, executed according to agreed-upon models, which describe who can take what actions with what information and when, under what circumstances, and using what methods.</p><p>Distributed data governance describes an operational framework for the provision of rules, common standards and practices, infrastructures and a distributed governance framework to empower individuals through increased digital access to (and control of) their electronic personal data, nationally and across borders, fostering a genuine single market for electronic record systems, relevant components and high-risk artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Multi-stakeholder participation within DGAs guarantees the consensual veracity of purpose-driven ecosystem policy while providing a consistent, trustworthy and efficient set-up for personal data use for research, innovation, and regulatory activities.</p><p>Distributed data governance provides a powerful solution for multi-stakeholder collaboration of rules and regulations for safe and secure data sharing within and across distributed data ecosystems.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: Digital assets are only as safe as their private keys. Securing private keys through responsible key management has thus been a major focus at Blockchain Commons, under our <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a> initiative. Unfortunately, securing keys ultimately isn’t just a logistical problem or a technical problem. It’s also a legal problem because US courts have inserted themselves into the process by demanding keys, often as a part of discovery.</p>

  <p>Turning over keys to courts not only introduces major threats to the digital assets controlled by the keys, but it also fundamentally misunderstands the purpose and use of private keys. There are better tools for court-based discovery, public keys prime among them. There are better, more traditional ways to enforce the turn over of assets. Requiring the disclosure of private keys instead is a needless threat not just to digital assets, but to our rights as well.</p>
</blockquote>

 

<p>Increasingly, attorneys in the United States are asking courts to force the disclosure of private keys as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions, and increasingly courts are acceding to those demands. Though this is a relatively recent phenomenon, it’s part of a larger problem of law enforcement seeking back doors to cryptography that goes back at least to the U.S. government’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures">failed introduction of the Clipper Chip</a> in 1993.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, today’s attacks on private keys in the courtroom have been more successful, creating an existential threat to digital assets, data, and other information protected by digital keys. That danger arises from a fundamental disconnect between this practice and the realities of technologies that leverage public-key cryptography for security: private-key disclosure can cause irreparable harm, including the loss of funds and the distortion of digital identities.</p>

<p>As a result, we need to support legislation that will protect digital keys while allowing courts to access information and assets in a way that better recognizes those realities. The private-key disclosure law <a href="https://youtu.be/61c3sYGqO-E?t=1063">currently being considered in Wyoming</a> is an excellent example of the sort of legislation that we could put forth and advocate for in order to maintain the proper protection for our digital assets and identities.</p>

<p><a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0105">Wyoming Senate Filing 2021-0105</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    No person shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key known to any other person in any civil, administrative, legislative or other proceeding in this state that relates to a digital asset, other interest or right to which the private key provides access unless a public key is unavailable or unable to disclose the requisite information with respect to the digital asset, other interest or right. This paragraph shall not be interpreted to prohibit any lawful proceeding that compels a person to produce or disclose a digital asset, other interest or right to which a private key provides access, or to disclose information about the digital asset, other interest or right, provided that the proceeding does not require production or disclosure of the private key.
</blockquote>

 The Realities of Private Keys 

<p>The forced disclosure of private keys is deeply harmful because it fundamentally runs at odds with how private keys work. Attorneys (and courts) are usually trying to force the disclosure of information or (later) the relinquishment of assets, but they’re treating private keys just like they’re physical keys that they could demand, use, and give back.</p>

<p>Private keys do not match any of these realities. As Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///1971">Chris Rothfuss</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no perfect analog for a modern cryptographic private key in existing statute or case law; it is unique in its form and function. As we build a policy framework around digital assets, it is essential that we appropriately recognize and reflect the characteristics of the underlying public / private key and cryptographic technologies. Without clear, unambiguous legal protection for the sanctity of the private key, it is impossible to ensure the integrity of the associated digital assets, information, smart contracts and identities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That appropriation recognition and reflection requires us to understand that:</p>

<p>1. Private keys are not assets.</p>

<p>Private keys are fundamentally the way we exert authority in the digital space, an interface between our physical reality and the digital reality. They may give us the ability to control a digital asset: to store it, to send it, or to use it. Similarly, they may give us the ability to decrypt protected data or to verify a digital identity. However, they are not the assets, the data, nor the identity themselves.</p>

<p>It’s the obvious difference between your car and your electronic key fob. The one is an asset, while the other lets you control that asset.</p>

<p>As Jon Callas, Director of Technology Projects at the EFF, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  “They don’t even want the key, they want the data; asking for the key is like asking for the filing cabinet rather than the file.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. Private keys are not the proper tool for discovery.</p>

<p>Treating private keys as a tool to ensure the discovery of information fundamentally misunderstands their purpose. Private keys are not how we see something in digital space, but instead how we exert authority in digital space!</p>

<p>Turning back to comparisons, it’s the difference between a ledger and a pen. If you wanted accounting information, you’d ask for the ledger; you wouldn’t ask for the pen, especially not if it was a pen that allowed you to write undetectably in the handwriting of the accountant!</p>

<p>Former Federal Prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan, when offering <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a> in favor of Wyoming’s private-key disclosure law, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  “the court could order a disclosure or an accounting of all the digital assets that are held, and then those assets could be disclosed and the location of whether they are held across different platforms or even different wallets. But giving the key is actually giving access to those assets. That is the difference.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, there is an electronic tool that meets the needs of discovery: public keys. Wyoming has recognized that in their <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">legislation</a>, saying that a private key should never be required if a public key would do the job (and they parenthetically noting at hearings that their current understanding is that a public key will always do the job). If our concern is revealing information that will help to catch and prosecute criminals, then public keys are the answer.</p>

<p>3. Private keys are not physical.</p>

<p>Electronic private keys and physical keys are very different. A physical key could pass through many hands and there could be the expectation that it was very likely not duplicated (especially if it were a special key, such as a safety-deposit-box key), and that when the key was returned to the original holder, they would once again have control of all of the linked assets. The same is not true for a private key, which could be easily duplicated by any of the many hands it passed through, with no way to ascertain that had happened.</p>

<p>Returning to the example of a car’s key fob, it would not be appropriate to force the disclosure of the unique serial number stored within a car fob for the same reason it’s not appropriate to force the disclosure of a private key. Doing so, would give anyone who gets that serial number the ability to create a new fob and steal your car!</p>

<p>4. Private keys serve many purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, private keys are likely to have a lot more purposes than physical keys, especially if a court decides to go after not just a specific private key, but the root key from an HD wallet or a seed phrase. Root keys (and seeds) might be used to protect a wide variety of assets as well as private data. They may also be used to control identities and to offer irrefutable proof that the owner agreed to something through digital signatures.</p>

<p>The authoritative uses of private keys are so wide and all-encompassing that it’s hard to come up with a physical equivalent. The closest analogy, which was brought up by Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen at one of the Wyoming hearings, would be if a court demanded access to a hotel room by requiring the hotel’s master key, which can provide access to all rooms. But, a private key is more than that, so it would be as if the court also required that someone with signatory powers at the hotel sign a bunch of blank contracts and blank checks. The potential for harm with the disclosure of a private key is just that high for someone who is using it for a variety of purposes — and there will be more and more people doing so as the importance of the digital world continues to increase.</p>

 The Realities of Courts 

<p>Going beyond the fact that a private key is the wrong tool for courts and that it’s often being used in the wrong way, there are a number of other problematic realities related to the courts themselves and how and when they’re trying to access private keys.</p>

<p>5. Courts are not prepared to protect private keys.</p>

<p>To start with, courts don’t have the experience needed to protect private keys. This danger is made worse by the fact that a single private key is likely to pass through the hands of many different court staff over time.</p>

<p>But, this isn’t just about courts. The problem of creating safe ways to transfer public keys is far bigger. It’s something that the cryptographic field as a whole does not have good answers for. Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen attested in his  testimony in Wyoming that the “immense difficulties of transferring a private key are a risk that allows bearing of false witness.” Putting courts, without crypto-expertise, in the middle of the problem could be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Perhaps cryptographers will resolve these issues in time, and perhaps someday courts will be able to share in that expertise if they decide doing so is a good use of their time and resources, but we need to consider keys whose disclosures are being forced now.</p>

<p>6. Courts are requiring premature disclosure.</p>

<p>The current situation with key disclosure is even more problematic because it’s occurring as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions. Discovery rulings are <a href="https://www.resolvingdiscoverydisputes.com/appeals/obtaining-review-of-discovery-rulings/">almost impossible to appeal</a>, which means that in today’s environment key holders have almost no recourse for protecting the token of their own authority in digital space.</p>

<p>7. Courts are more demanding of digital assets than physical assets.</p>

<p>We recognize that courts should be able to require the usage of a key. Compelling usage is nothing new, but the private key is not required for that, simply a court order.</p>

<p>If someone refuses to use their private key in a way compelled by a court, that’s nothing new either. The physical world already has plenty of examples of people refusing such orders, such as by hiding assets or just refusing to pay judgements. They are handled with sanctions such as contempt of court.</p>

<p>Asking for more from the electronic world is an overreach of traditional judgements that also creates much greater repercussions.</p>

 The Repercussions of Disclosure 

<p>Using the wrong tool for the wrong reasons and putting it in hands not ready to deal with it will have calamitous results. Here are some of the most obvious repercussions.</p>

<p>1. Asset Theft</p>

<p>Obviously, there is a danger of the assets being stolen, as a private key gives total control over those assets. These assets could go far beyond the specifics of what a court is interested in, because of the multitude of uses for keys.</p>

<p>2. Asset Loss</p>

<p>Beyond the problem of purposeful theft, keys could be lost, and with them digital assets. Former federal prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan raised this concern in her <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a>, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Evidence is lost all the time.” If that evidence was a private key, which might hold a variety of assets, information, and proofs of identity, the loss could be tremendous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Majority Whip <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///2035">Jared Olsen</a> agreed with this concern at a recent Wyoming hearing, noting that a judicial assistant could delete a key and cause a loss of $8 billion dollars in Bitcoin when there was only a judgment for $100,000. He said he was “concerned about just simply handling it”.</p>

<p>3. Collateral Damage</p>

<p>Thefts or losses resulting from the disclosure of a private key could also go far beyond an individual before the court. Increasingly, assets are being held in multisignatures, which may grant multiple people control over the same assets. By requiring the disclosure of a key, a court could negatively impact people entirely unrelated to the proceedings.</p>

<p>4. Identity Theft.</p>

<p>Because private keys might also protect the identifier for digital identity, their loss, theft, or misuse could put someone’s entire digital life at risk. If a key was copied, someone else could pretend to be the holder and even make digital signatures that are legally binding for them.</p>

 Support This Legislation 

<p>Protecting private keys is one of the most important things that Blockchain Commons has ever worked on. As Blockchain Commons’ founder Christopher Allen said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I find the protections of this Private Key Disclosure bill crucial for the future of digital rights.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader Chris Rothfuss affirmed this, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>” Christopher Allen has been an invaluable member of our blockchain policy community, bringing a lifetime of technical expertise to advise our committee work and inform our legislative drafting. Mr. Allen has emphasized the particular importance of protecting private keys from any form of compulsory disclosure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need your help to make it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re an experienced member of the cryptocurrency or digital asset field or a human-rights activist, please submit your own testimony in support to the <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Committees/2022/S19">Wyoming Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology</a>. The bill will be coming up for further discussion on September 19-20 in Laramie, Wyoming.</p>

<p>But, Wyoming is just the start. They are doing an excellent job of leading the way, but we need other states and countries to follow. If you have connections to another legislature, please suggest they introduce <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">similar language to Wyoming’s bill</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t feel comfortable talking with a legislature, you can help by advocating for the protection of private keys as something different than assets.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our new world of digital assets and digital information will succeed or fail based upon how we lay its foundations today. It could become a safe space for us or a dangerous wild west.</p>

<p>Properly protecting private keys (and using public keys and other tools for legitimate judicial needs) is a keystone that will help us to build a sturdy edifice.</p>

<p>Frankfurt, 16th of August 2022</p>

<p>IDunion, the consortium created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, has reached the next stage in building a productive, cross-border ecosystem by founding a European cooperative with limited liability (Sociedad Cooperativa Europea, or SCE for short). </p>

<p>Founding meeting of the IDunion SCE on 20.07.2022 (from left to right: Mirko Mollik/TrustCerts GmbH, Markus Sabadello/ Danube Tech GmbH, Dr. Carsten Stöcker/ Spherity GmbH)</p>

  With the spin-off into the SCE, the infrastructure for verifiable credentials, which was researched and developed in the research project can now go live into production.   The European cooperative will be deploying and operating the necessary technical network to provide the operations.  This will allow citizens, private-sector organisations and government institutions to augment the digital identifications (eID) provided by governments with use of secure digital credentials for  identity attributes required across a wide range of use cases.   The legal form of the SCE was chosen as it offers a legally secure basis for the operations of an independent infrastructure for digital credentials.  While the IDunion research project was initiated with funding from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Action (BMWK), the European cooperative aims to secure private sector funding to provide a stable, non-profit business operation.   The decision to use the legal form of a Sociedad Cooperativa Europea was driven by IDunion’s core principles of neutrality and openness. It allows all legal entities that adhere to the community values to apply for membership to the SCE. Furthermore a future takeover or control by a single entity is prohibited by this legal form. The guiding principle of the cooperative is the joint establishment of the ecosystem – a task that no individual member can achieve on its own.  
<p>On 20.07.2022, the founding members Spherity, Danube Tech and TrustCerts signed the articles of association of the SCE in Essen. “We are very pleased to have achieved this milestone for the IDunion project,” says Helge Michael, consortium Leader of the IDunion research project. “With the IDunion SCE, we have created the ideal basis for building a future-proof identity ecosystem for Europe in which all members can work together as equals. Special thanks goes to the BMWK for providing the funding support as part of the research project ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’, which was an essential prerequisite to this next stage,” Michael continues. Dr. Carsten Stöcker, Managing Director of Spherity GmbH, adds: “IDunion SCE provides the legal basis for a cooperative governance structure, which strengthens the interests of individual participants in the interplay of decentralisation and cooperation without allowing a central platform operator to exploit its users economically.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>IDunion: The IDunion research project is a European network that brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organisations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields. Its aim is to develop a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information.</p>

<p>IDunion SCE: IDunion SCE is a cooperative (European Cooperative Europea) with limited liability that will operate the production network for credential verification, based on the findings of the research project. The SCE and the network are subject to the community governance of its members. Initial founding members of the SCE are:</p>

<p>TrustCerts GmbH: The cyber security start-up TrustCerts from Gelsenkirchen focuses on verifiable credentials and digital identities. TrustCerts’ solution is based on a specially developed blockchain that is compliant with German data protection and security requirements.</p>

<p>Danube Tech GmbH: One of the first companies supporting the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, the Vienna-based Danube Tech specialises in interoperability between different SSI networks across national borders. Among the products developed by Danube Tech are the Universal Resolver and godiddy.com.</p>

<p>Spherity GmbH: The German software provider Spherity provides secure and decentralised identity management solutions for companies, machines, products, data and algorithms. Spherity provides the enabling technology to digitise and automate compliance processes in highly regulated sectors. Spherity’s products strengthen cybersecurity and create efficiency and data interoperability between digital value chains.</p>

<p>Public key cryptographic token API ready for testing and implementation</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1 from the OASIS PKCS 11 TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>The Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) are a group of public-key cryptography standards devised and published by RSA Security LLC, starting in the early 1990s. The OASIS PKCS 11 Technical Committee addresses the ongoing enhancement and maintenance of the PKCS #11 standard.</p>



<p>PKCS #11 Specification Version 3.1 defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules and smart cards. The API itself is named “Cryptoki” (from “cryptographic token interface” and pronounced as “crypto-key”). This specification defines data types, functions and other basic components of the PKCS #11 Cryptoki interface for devices that may hold cryptographic information and may perform cryptographic functions. It also defines mechanisms that are anticipated for use with the current version of PKCS #11.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>



<p>The prose specifications and related files are available here:</p>

<p>Passwords may be a thing of the past as tech giants are moving to new passkey technology — a passwordless login that is more secure and convenient. Passkeys were created with the Web Authentication API security standard that uses public key cryptography for access. Each key is unique and created with encrypted data for added security. Apple, Google and Microsoft are working with the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure passkeys are implemented in ways that work across multiple platforms.</p>

<p>Fast Identity Online (FIDO) outlines secure authentication protocols that are available to all. Their goal is to normalize passwordless authentication and eliminate passwords from the user authentication equation. It may be a while before passwords disappear entirely, but more companies are beginning to see passwordless authentication as the secure, sustainable alternative.

<p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare says the same attackers that went after Twilio also sent Cloudflare employees malicious SMS messages with links to phishing sites dressed up as an official company website. Despite employees at both companies taking the bait, Cloudflare said attackers were unable to snatch the full logon credentials of its workers because the company’s second layer of authentication isn’t time-limited one-time codes. Instead, every employee at the company is issued a FIDO2-compliant security key from a vendor like YubiKey. Although the attackers siphoned the credentials, the hard key authentication requirement stopped them from snatching a soft token that fooled employees otherwise would have entered into the phishing site.</p>

<p>The Hyperledger Foundation, a multi-project open source collaborative effort hosted by the Linux Foundation, is holding their annual <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/hyperledger-global-forum/bal-forum-2022-dublin-ireland">Hyperledger Global Forum</a> (HGF) September 12th -13th at <a href="https://www.theccd.ie/">Convention Centre Dublin</a> with workshops to follow on the 14th at the Gibson Hotel.&nbsp; The Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP) will be present in the exhibition hall as a community partner at HGF.&nbsp; Please stop by and visit to learn more about the foundation.</p>



<p>ToIP Steering Committee member, Scott Perry, Principal of Crypto and Digital Trust Services at Schellman, will be speaking at HGF on Monday, September 12th on the topic of Governance and Audit of Blockchain Networks.</p>



<p>While blockchain technology creates strong cryptographic controls securing the integrity of data, successful, cooperative blockchain networks must establish trust between a variety of independent entities to create overall trust.&nbsp; In this presentation, Scott Perry will discuss how trust is created when using blockchain technologies in the utility layer of the Trust Over IP stack.  Scott will discuss how blockchain networks can add accountability within stakeholder roles to ensure that blockchain-based trust ecosystems are trustworthy above the embedded cryptographic trust assertions.&nbsp; Come learn which role systems auditors, cybersecurity professionals, and risk management experts play in ensuring how trust is built within the ToIP stack focusing on how blockchain-based trust ecosystems are maintained when adopting such cutting-edge technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-located at the Conventions Center Dublin the same week is the Linux Foundation <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/">Open Source Summit Europe</a> September 13th to 16th.&nbsp; ToIP will be having a co-located <a href="https://trustoverip.org/summit/">Trust Over IP Summit 2022</a>, during the OSS.&nbsp; So when you<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/register/"> register for OSS</a>, don’t forget to add on the free registration for ToIP Summit 2022.<br><br><a href="https://trustoverip.org/summit/#agenda">Agenda for the ToIP Summit 2022</a>:</p>

<p>Microsoft’s blog post explores Accenture’s journey as they adopted passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>With cyber-attacks on the rise, phishing has become the primary method used by attackers to compromise user data.&nbsp;Now, even though multifactor authentication (MFA) defeats over 90% of&nbsp;password breaches, it isn’t immune to phishing. Microsoft’s vision for a passwordless world emphasizes FIDO 2.0-powered inherently phish-resistant credentials like Windows Hello for Business and FIDO 2.0 External Security Keys. Accenture’s implantation includes over 500,000 users primarily using Windows Hello For Business, 200,000 Phone Sign in users, over 10,000 FIDO2 key users, and an 80% drop in day-to-day usage of passwords across the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>

This technology, developed by the FIDO Alliance, uses tokenization rather than passwords during the login process and is meant to help prevent phishing and spoofing.</p>

<p>Passwords are a form of knowledge-based authentication. For a user to prove they are who they claim to be, they need a secret — the password — that has been previously stored by the service. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a technique designed to strengthen the authentication process by adding possession-based authentication to knowledge-based authentication. A service can only authenticate a user when they prove they have knowledge of the shared secret in addition to something they have or are. Eliminating shared secrets removes the intrinsic weakness of password-based authentication and MFA. A secure form of possession-based authentication is the best alternative. Passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards is considered the archetype. FIDO passwordless authentication is based on public-key cryptography.</p>

<p>Stu Sjouwerman, founder, and CEO of KnowBe4 Inc shares his thoughts on how MFAs fell short in data security. A Verizon research report says that 82% of all cyberattacks fall on human error (stolen credentials, phishing, misuse). For a hacker to successfully gain access to credentials they need some level of human involvement to get around MFA defences. Some common phishing techniques include, MiTM attacks, SIM-swapping attacks, “Pass-the-cookie” attacks, and MFA fatigue. The strongest forms of MFAs are based on FIDO2 standards that enables users to access resources through biometrics. The deployment of FIDO2 eliminates the risk of phishing attacks but ensuring users are well trained to identify cyberthreats is just as important if not more.</p>

<p>Cloudflare employees were recently targeted by a “sophisticated” cyberattack, and even though some fell for the scheme, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-ddos-protection">DDoS protection</a>&nbsp;company managed to successfully defend itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2022-07-sms-phishing-attacks/">blog post</a>(opens in new tab), Cloudflare co-founder Matthew Prince, together with team members Daniel Stinson-Diess and Sourov Zaman, explained how the attack happened and what made the difference between success and failure.</p>



<p>The threat actor made a couple of key preparations ahead of the attack: they registered a domain that looked legitimate and would fool many victims: cloudflare-okta.com. Okta is Cloudflare’s identity provider. They also managed to somehow obtain the phone numbers of almost 80 Cloudflare employees, as well as family members for some.</p>

<p>Yesterday, August 8, 2022, Twilio shared that they’d been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/august-2022-social-engineering-attack">compromised by a targeted phishing attack</a>. Around the same time as Twilio was attacked, we saw an attack with very similar characteristics also targeting Cloudflare’s employees. While individual employees did fall for the phishing messages, we were able to thwart the attack through our own use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/">Cloudflare One products</a>, and physical security keys issued to every employee that are required to access all our applications.</p>



<p>We have confirmed that no Cloudflare systems were compromised. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudforce-one-threat-operations-and-threat-research/">Cloudforce One threat intelligence team</a>&nbsp;was able to perform additional analysis to further dissect the mechanism of the attack and gather critical evidence to assist in tracking down the attacker.</p>



<p>This was a sophisticated attack targeting employees and systems in such a way that we believe most organizations would be likely to be breached. Given that the attacker is targeting multiple organizations, we wanted to share here a rundown of exactly what we saw in order to help other companies recognize and mitigate this attack.</p>

 Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2022-04 



 Insufficient data protection or security for sensitive consumer information 



 Question presented 



<p>Can entities violate the prohibition on unfair acts or practices in the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) when they have insufficient data protection or information security?</p>



 Summary answer 



<p>Yes. In addition to other federal laws governing data security for financial institutions, including the Safeguards Rules issued under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), “covered persons” and “service providers” must comply with the prohibition on unfair acts or practices in the CFPA. Inadequate security for the sensitive consumer information collected, processed, maintained, or stored by the company can constitute an unfair practice in violation of 12 U.S.C. 5536(a)(1)(B). While these requirements often overlap, they are not coextensive.</p>



<p>Acts or practices are unfair when they cause or are likely to cause substantial injury that is not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate authentication, password management, or software update policies or practices are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and financial institutions are unlikely to successfully justify weak data security practices based on countervailing benefits to consumers or competition. Inadequate data security can be an unfair practice in the absence of a breach or intrusion.</p>

<p>Passwords are a form of knowledge-based authentication. For a user to prove they are who they claim to be, they need a secret — the password — that has been previously stored by the service. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a technique designed to strengthen the authentication process by adding possession-based authentication to knowledge-based authentication. A service can only authenticate a user when they prove they have knowledge of the shared secret in addition to something they have or are. Eliminating shared secrets removes the intrinsic weakness of password-based authentication and MFA. A secure form of possession-based authentication is the best alternative. Passwordless authentication based on FIDO standards is considered the archetype. FIDO passwordless authentication is based on public-key cryptography.</p>

<p>This update provides a brief overview and technical analysis of the results of the “snapshot” mechanism currently being used to track the consistency of staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Consortia staking pool. Patrons staking EWT can use the tools provided at <a href="https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/">https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/</a> to check the status of their wallets and snapshots if applicable.</p> Snapshots and Variable EWT&nbsp;rewards <p>A series of Snapshots are being taken of wallets that have staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Energy Web Consortia staking pool. The purpose of the snapshots is to measure the consistency of staking. Specifically, snapshots track how much EWT is deposited into a staking contract by a given wallet and how long that stake is maintained throughout the life of the Consortia staking pool. Since staking will be a major contributor to the cybersecurity of Energy Web solutions tied to <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">the upcoming Consortia blockchain</a>, having a consistent, high stake of EWT is crucial. Therefore, EWT staking pools reward consistent stakers with higher rewards compared to stakers who withdraw EWT before the staking pool&nbsp;ends.</p><p>In the case of the current Consortia staking pool, there will be an additional, variable reward distributed to all Patrons (individuals who have staked EWT into the pool) with at least 1 snapshot. This reward comes from redistributing all unallocated rewards from the Consortia staking smart contract. The staking contract was deployed with the maximum possible reward balance in order to provide rewards for Patrons staking a total of 7.5 million EWT for the entire 9 month duration of the staking&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Because the staking pool has yet to reach its capacity, not all fixed rewards will be distributed. This is where snapshots come in: the reward balance that is left unallocated will be distributed to Patrons who have snapshots. Rewards vary depending on the number of snapshots and the amount of EWT staked. For each wallet, the reward will be determined by an exponential formula taking into account the number of snapshots and average EWT stake. The exponential formula will incentivise Patrons to collect all snapshots, since a wallet with all snapshots will earn much higher rewards than wallets with 5 and less snapshots and the same EWT&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Similar to the timing of the snapshots, variable rewards are impossible to predict as they depend on the timing of snapshots and actions of other staking patrons. Therefore, the only rational behavior that maximizes variable APY is to stake as much EWT into a single wallet as possible and leave it staked consistently until the end of the Consortia staking pool. To be clear, the variable rewards will be distributed in addition to the fixed award already awarded by the Consortia staking&nbsp;pool.</p> Snapshot 1 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>In total, 6,408 wallets were included in the first snapshot. These wallets staked 5,540,589 EWT. The individual balances vary from 1 EWT (the lower limit for snapshots) to 3,000 EWT (the upper staking limit for a single wallet). The chart below shows the balances of all snapshot wallets: wallets on the horizontal axis, balances on the vertical&nbsp;axis.</p><p>The next chart shows the stake balance distribution with balance bounds on the horizontal axis and the number of wallets in each section on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>Almost 2/3rd of all wallets have balances under 500 EWT (out of which 334 are staking just 1 EWT), and 17% of wallets have balances higher than 2,500 EWT. This is surprising, as normally such distributions follow a power-law distribution (the higher the balance, the lower the number of wallets). In the case of Consortia staking, the relatively large number of wallets can be explained by Patrons holding many EWT (more than the upper limit of 3,000 EWT) staking with multiple wallets. Out of 1,110 wallets staking over 2,500 EWT, 970 are staking the maximum allowed 3,000&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot 2 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>Snapshot 2 was taken on block #<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/block/18648235/transactions">18648235</a> generated on June 27th, 2022 at 9:16 PM UTC+1. This time, there were 6,641 wallets staking (up 233 from the first snapshot), staking a total of 5,730,962 EWT, so (up 190,373 EWF from snapshot&nbsp;1).</p><p>Here are the balances of snapshot 2 (in orange) compared to snapshot 1 balances (in blue). Wallets on the bottom, balances on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>The orange spikes are wallets adding more EWT between snapshot 1 and 2. The orange dips are wallets withdrawing EWT. On the far right of the chart there is the orange line and no blue line: these are the completely new wallets that didn’t participate in snapshot&nbsp;1.</p><p>In total, 880 wallets increased their EWT stake and 350 of were completely new (not staked during snapshot 1). 180 wallets decreased their stake, 117 of them withdrawing all their EWT and not qualifying for snapshot&nbsp;2.</p><p>Here’s the balance distribution comparison between stake 1 and 2 balances. Bounds on the bottom, number of wallets in each category in the vertical&nbsp;scale:</p><p>We can see a slight increase in each category, even in the highest balances section: 41 new wallets staked between 2,500 and 3,000 ETW, out of which 40 staked the 3,000 EWT maximum. For comparison, there are now 150 additional wallets staking under 500&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot insights and what to expect&nbsp;next <p>So far, staking in the Consortia pool has been consistent in line with the design of the snapshot mechanism. This is evidenced by the balance distribution of snapshot 1 and 2 and <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0x181A8b2a5AEb25941F6A79b4aE43dBb1968c417A/coin-balances#address-tabs">EWT balances in the staking contract</a>:</p><p>Such consistent staking will provide a high degree of economic cybersecurity to all enterprise-grade Energy Web solutions (for more information on the connection between consistent staking, cybersecurity, and Energy Web solutions, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">please review our announcement on the upcoming Consortia chain</a>).</p><p>As mentioned above, the next 4 snapshots will be taken randomly between now and the end of the Consortia staking pool in December 2022. Patrons who receive at least 1 snapshot will qualify for additional rewards. The rewards will be calculated and distributed after the Consortia staking pool ends. Again, since variable rewards are impossible to predict, the best strategy for all patrons is to stake as high a balance as possible and do so consistently.</p><p>Also read: <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-community-staking-pool-snapshots-explained-3a9c3eebf28b">https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-community-staking-pool-snapshots-explained-3a9c3eebf28b</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>On July 13th, the FIDO Korea Working Group held a half-day virtual tech seminar with 250+ attendees.&nbsp; The sessions included updates on the state of the FIDO Alliance and its certification programs, an introduction to FIDO Device Onboard (FDO), a FIDO Authentication 101, an introduction to multi-device FIDO credentials (also known as “passkeys”), and a presentation on understanding Korean&nbsp; laws mandating the use of passwords.</p>

<p>This tech seminar covered topics such as FDO and passkey, and provided a forum for industry experts to learn about phishing-resistant online authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the post-event survey, over 30% of attendees reported they were victims of credential thefts, though they are online security industry experts or studying in the related fields.&nbsp; Mr. Hyeong Won Pyo at Chosun Media thoughtfully summarized what he learned from the seminar while sharing with his colleagues and friends: “Our journalists are under attack by online phishing campaigns, and it was great to learn how to protect them with FIDO Authentication.”</p>

<p>Vietnam Goes Passwordless Roundtable</p>



<p>On the same afternoon, FIDO Alliance participated in another hybrid event, the Vietnam Goes Passwordless Roundtable, organized by VinCSS and Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communication.</p>



<p>It was the first forum on passwordless authentication in Vietnam, and the cyber security industry leaders in the region gathered representatives from the state banks, and local journalists.</p>

<p>During the event local cyber security leaders discussed and shared best practices on digital authentication, disruptive technologies, and mega trends of passwordless authentication.&nbsp; The experts recognized the recent increase of cyber-attacks in Vietnam as a risk factor for further developing digital applications, which is one of the top strategic activities of Vietnamese National Digital Transformation Program.</p>



<p>Mr. Do Ngoc Duy Tranc, CEO of VinCSS said, “VinCSS is ready to sponsor and support the nation by integrating strong FIDO-based passwordless authentication technology by building broader cooperation mechanisms with multi-sectors.”</p>

<p>This blog post outlines the revised version of <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges.pdf">the initial RFC</a> detailing the TRAC bridging approach from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain based on the feedback received on the initial version from the OriginTrail community.</p> Teleporting TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>The <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges.pdf">previous version of this RFC</a> proposed the initial TRAC bridge for near-term utilisation be implemented via the Chainbridge system, while enabling emergent bridging infrastructure (such as the Snowfork bridge) as potential long term bridging solutions.<br>Due to the concerns expressed by the TRAC community regarding the inherent risks associated with such a bridge implementation (details below and in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/16">RFC comments</a>), and demonstrated vulnerabilities of similar bridges seen recently within the crypto space (even while writing this update of the RFC), an alternative approach will be implemented — “one way teleports”.</p><p>A one way teleport is an already proven approach within the OriginTrail community as it was successfully executed during the Starfleet stage of the OriginTrail Parachain development. Via a “one-time” TRAC bridge from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain the OriginTrail community has successfully staked 100MM TRAC tokens to be transferred to the (then stand-alone) OriginTrail tailored blockchain.</p><p>The exact approach and details of the smart contract implementation are specified in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC%2010%20Starfleet%20boarding%20(staking)%20smart%20contract%20specs.pdf">OT-RFC-10</a>, however for practicality an outline is presented here:</p>  A special smart contract is deployed on Ethereum blockchain designed to lock a specific amount of TRAC tokens, to be teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain. The contract is permissionless and anybody can deposit (lock) TRAC into&nbsp;it.  The equivalent amount of TRAC tokens gets minted on the OriginTrail Parachain to the same address as the one that locked tokens on the Ethereum side (so tokens can be utilised by the same&nbsp;wallet).  Special care is taken to ensure security of the smart contract — a thorough smart contract audit has been conducted, together with functionality minimization (to lower complexity and thus risk surface) as well as coding and testing best practices.  <p>The near-term TRAC bridging proposal therefore is&nbsp;to:</p>  Perform one way TRAC teleports from Ethereum to the OriginTrail Parachain by reutilizing <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/starfleet-boarding-contract">the same smart contract</a> already proven in the previous 100MM TRAC Starfleet staking procedure. This contract implementation has <a href="https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/origin-trail-starfleet-staking">been security audited by Quantstamp</a> and proven functional and secure in a production environment. Additionally, the smart contract is built in such a way that the locked funds can be used to integrate with the future&nbsp;bridges.  Execute teleports in a total of 15 batches in two week intervals.  This approach removes third-party code (non-OriginTrail ecosystem) from the bridging infrastructure, additionally minimising the risk surface until a more trust-minimising solution is available.  The approach enables continued exploration of bridging solutions within the Polkadot ecosystem for the mid- and long-term viability of a two-way TRAC bridge. It is expected that multiple options will be available, such as common-good parachain bridges, Snowfork and others, developed by the wider Polkadot community. Once a suitable bridge is available, all teleported tokens will be migrated (subject to the same RFC process as with this implementation).   Teleporting details <p>Teleporting will occur in 15 batches, each of which will be performed with a process similar to the previously executed Starfleet staking. Due to the nature of the smart contracts and them being audited and tested, only parametric changes can be implemented and no changes in smart contract code will be performed.</p><p>Each of the 15 teleportation batches will deploy a separate Teleport contract on Ethereum, managed by a multisig wallet. The illustration below shows the lifecycle of each Teleport contract and its phases as per smart contract design (specified in OT-RFC-10). There are 5 distinct periods defined in the life&nbsp;cycle:</p>  Preparation period: used for contract preparation and deployment on Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  Boarding period: the period during which TRAC can be deposited in the smart contract for teleportation. The boarding period will last 2 weeks for each batch (except for the first batch lasting 3&nbsp;weeks).  Lock period: the period during which tokens are immobile (locked) in the teleportation smart contract on Ethereum. TRAC tokens are teleported to the OriginTrail Parachain and available for use with the same address as used for locking. Each lock period will be set to expire on March 31st&nbsp;2023.  Bridge period: the period during which locked tokens can be transferred from the teleportation smart contract on Ethereum to a fully fledged bridge implementation (which is expected to be available in the bridge period). The bridge period lasts for 12 months (latest until March 31st&nbsp;2024).  Fallback period: period used in the fallback scenario of a fully fledged bridge not becoming available, after all previous periods have expired. In this period it will be possible to teleport TRAC tokens back to Ethereum, using the accounting feature as described in the contract spec (OT-RFC-10).  <p>To incentivize the teleportation process and utility of the OriginTrail Parachain and the (then deployed) OriginTrail DKG v6, a designated amount of OTP bounty tokens will be made available for the users (to be announced).</p><p>The teleport timeline is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  August 18th (tentative): first Teleportation contract deployment and Batch #1 teleporting start, the first boarding period lasting 3&nbsp;weeks  September: first minting of TRAC on OT Parachain, added OTP bounty to enable the use of the OriginTrail Parchain (bonus size&nbsp;TBD)  Mid-September: Once TRAC is available, execute OriginTrail DKG v6&nbsp;launch  Batch #2 and further teleportation batches continue immediately after the first teleportation is completed and validated as successful.  <p>The detailed timeline will be shared in the following documents as soon as this RFC is approved.</p><p>The complete and updated OT-RFC-12 v2 document can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges%20(v2).pdf">here</a>.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-v2-teleporting-trac-to-the-origintrail-parachain-on-polkadot-de535a9d2693">OT-RFC-12 V2: Teleporting TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We’re excited to share that we launched the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network">Ceramic Community Forum</a>! The forum is the place to ask technical questions and receive support from your fellow community members and Ceramic’s core team.</p> Why did we launch the forum? <p>If you have been a part of Ceramic’s developer community for a while, you probably know that we've been exchanging knowledge and receiving updates from the Ceramic core team on a <a href="https://chat.ceramic.network">Ceramic Discord Server</a>. One piece of feedback we received from multiple members of the community is that, over time, the RSS feed-like nature of Discord made it difficult to get answers to technical questions and search for information. It became clear that we need a better platform for facilitating technical support and empowering our developer community to share technical knowledge about Ceramic.</p> What do I use the forum for? <p>The forum is dedicated to asking and answering technical questions about Ceramic. It consists of a few main categories dedicated to specific aspects of Ceramic tech. If you have a question to ask, simply open it under the most relevant category. The questions asked on the forum will be answered between the Ceramic community and Ceramic’s core team.</p><p>The forum includes a few additional features that should improve the technical-information sharing and question answering across the Ceramic developer community:</p>  Better search—you can use the forum’s built-in search tool to discover questions that might be similar to yours  Sign-in with Ethereum—to begin using the forum, you can sign up using your Ethereum wallet.   And what about the Ceramic Discord server? <p>The Ceramic Discord Server is not going anywhere. Going forward, the server will be focused on facilitating more high-level discussions around Ceramic—e.g. talking about community projects, sharing ideas and feedback about specific aspects of the Ceramic Network. Over the next month, expect to see some architectural changes in the Discord server as we transition technical support to the Ceramic Forum.</p><p>Try out the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Ceramic Forum</a> and let us know what you think!</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/venture-builders/"></a>Shops.scot is a new venture under development. 
 Join the <a href="https://community.digitalscot.net/c/venture-builders/shops-scot-like-ebay-stores-but-scottish">Venture Builder group discussion</a> to participate. 
<p>Co-founders, dev partners, reseller agents, early adopter customers – All welcome.</p>
 Multi-vendor Marketplace 
<p>As the title suggests, this will operate a ‘Multi-vendor Marketplace’ – A site where multiple sellers can each create their own e-store, and visitors can browse and buy from any of them.</p>
<p>This will accelerate our Digital Nation Action Plan, specifically the digital enablement and support of micro and small businesses. It’s still the case that many don’t even have a web site.</p>
<p>So this will provide them an ultra simple way of achieving that, with the key distinction from other options like EBay or Amazon obviously being that it’s entirely Scotland focused. This means a much more local, hands on technical support, and a concentrated market focus.</p>
 Features 
<p>Key features will include:</p>
 
 A powerful set of digital marketing tools – As well as loading up your products, you’ll be able to send e-vouchers, email marketing etc. 
 Cryptocurrency – Accept Bitcoin payments et al. This is another key technology field where SMEs know they should be doing more but it is simply beyond them. 
 
<p>In short it will leverage the SaaS (Software as a Service) model to make easily accessible the powerful e-commerce and digital marketing technologies that most small businesses would greatly benefit from but don’t have the resource or expertise to deploy themselves.</p>
<p>There is also great potential to team up with other Scottish innovators, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/">Miconex</a>. They offer a gift card system that could tie in with #1, with a particular focus on local towns, such as <a href="https://www.mi-cnx.com/casestudy/case-study--the-perth-gift-card">Perth</a>.</p>
<p>Shops.scot will be able to provide the core e-commerce tools for selling their products, and organized into similarly local sections, like Shops.scot/Perth. This will provide a powerful combined solution to achieve key Scottish Government goals like <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scottish-government-offers-support-local-online-firms">boosting local commerce for local merchants</a>.</p>

<p>Fast Identity Online (FIDO) outlines secure authentication protocols that are available to all. Now, Microsoft, Google and Apple are doubling down on passkeys to support FIDO Alliance. Their goal is to normalize passwordless authentication and eliminate passwords from the user authentication equation. FIDO Alliance seeks to bring the idea of the “password” into modern times with stronger security — by developing the FIDO protocols and setting a new standard.</p>

<p>Time to leave the passwords behind. Consumers are leaning that way — and would be happy to abandon that age-old, friction-filled relic that traces its genesis to the dawn of the Internet. The door is opening for authentication to increasingly be done by behavioral analytics. Advanced technologies parse how individuals wield their devices, how they type and enter data and leverage geolocation to help prove that people are who they say they are. The Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance also promotes the processes where the devices themselves authenticate identities as the devices are unlocked.</p>

Passkeys are based on public key cryptography, which involves storing a private security key on your device. Because there’s no password to type, phishing and other scams will become far less frequent.</p>

No more searching for the unique password you create for each internet account. Apple works with the FIDO Alliance so passwords also work on non-Apple devices.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/venture-builders/"></a>The <a href="https://digitalscot.net/community/venture-builders/">Venture Builders Group</a> is a&nbsp;community group for entrepreneurs seeking to launch new global-scale tech ventures. 
<p>The group provides a forum to brainstorm your venture idea, discuss business models, recruit co-founders and fast-track to launch, and we’ll showcase new ventures here on this site.</p>
 Learn.scot – A Virtual School for Scotland 
<p><a href="https://Learn.scot">Learn.scot</a> is a new venture under development, intended to deliver ‘Scotland’s Digital Learning Centre’, a community marketplace platform where members can be both learners and tutors, accessing and also creating e-learning courseware.&nbsp;A summary of the business model:</p>

<p>It is intended to play a pivotal role in <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-education/">Transforming Scottish Education for the 21st Century</a>.</p>
<p>While you would assume e-learning would now be a mature component within the education sector, the reality is that it’s adoption is still quite immature – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-53067254">62% of parents</a> said their school had not provided any online learning for their children and <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-pupils-not-engaging-online-learning">teachers were struggling</a> with how to deliver it effectively.</p>
<p>Writing for Reform Scotland Jenifer Johnston offers <a href="https://reformscotland.com/2020/05/scotland-needs-a-virtual-school-jenifer-johnston/">this</a> simple but very compelling ideal for what is needed – A ‘virtual school’ for Scotland:</p>
<p>“My ask of the Scottish Government is that there is a national online curriculum developed and delivered digitally in really simple, open-access websites, no passwords, no gatekeeping, just lessons broadcast daily on a website, join in if you can. Scotland has many superstar teachers who could deliver classes to the nation’s kids in a virtual school – we could get to know them as well as our own fantastic class teachers. Lessons could be live and recorded to watch later if children can’t get to them right away.”</p>
<p>Our national opportunity is to harness this collective pool of innovation and define how various combinations of each can be applied to meet the various education needs of Scotland.</p>
<p>“Scotland has many superstar teachers who could deliver classes to the nation’s kids in a virtual school – we could get to know them as well as our own fantastic class teachers. Lessons could be live and recorded to watch later if children can’t get to them right away.”</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Harnessing modern digital learning platforms can address Scotland’s challenge, and overall presents the country with the opportunity to modernize not only what we learn, but how&nbsp;we learn, and transform our entire approach to education.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of Digital Scotland is to drive the initiatives that will see us emulate the digital nation success of countries like Estonia, and with this program&nbsp;ask and answer the question how might Scotland achieve this same level of digital capability and the same high performance academic achievement it enables.</p>

<p>Accenture, Broadcom, Copado, IBM, Security Compass, US Department of Defense, and Others to Enable VSM Data Sharing Across Platforms</p> 


<p>2 August 2022 — Members of OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, are working together to define interoperability standards for value stream management (VSM). The new VSM Interoperability Technical Committee’s goal is to bring increased interoperability to existing value stream standards, tools, and best practices, enabling a more secure approach to sharing data across platforms in the software supply chain and systems ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For VSM journeys, sharing of data across enterprise platforms to get holistic, valuable data in the form of forensics, observability and auditability, for example, is critical. But it requires data standards and secure interoperability,” said Eveline Oehrlich, Research Director at Research In Action and Chief Research Officer at DevOps Institute. “Having such interoperability allows for teams to look at events that are relevant to an organization with additional context for the forensic processes of post incident and future incident management work, as an example use case.”</p>



<p>The TC’s work will focus on defining key component parts of value stream data, enabling interoperability of value streams among users and platforms, establishing good practice for value stream data architecture, and creating open standards for value stream management metrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The formation of the OASIS VSM Interoperability Technical Committee is an important next step in the advancement of VSM, with the potential to provide an accelerated path to VSM adoption. We look forward to leading this talented group of organizations as we work towards our common goal of aiding VSM capabilities,” said VSMI TC co-chairs Helen Beal of Value Stream Management Consortium and Kelly Cullinane of Copado.</p>



<p>Organizations typically use different tools to measure the performance of their software delivery processes. Using VSM tools, an organization can utilize data and metrics to maximize innovation, drive growth, and add greater value. This TC sets out to create a VSM standard for interoperability and tool integration, allowing for broader adoption in the long term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participation in the OASIS VSMI TC is open to all through membership in OASIS. Digital product leaders; product value stream organizations; cybersecurity, public sector security, and quality management professionals; and others are invited to join the group.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Support for Value Stream Management Interoperability Technical Committee</p>



<p>Broadcom<br>“As a leader in introducing and implementing VSM solutions Broadcom Software is thrilled to support this initiative. VSM has emerged as a critical success factor in digital transformation and uniting to support interoperability standards is the next logical step, especially as we see more businesses adopting VSM. Data lives at the core of ValueOps VSM and we are committed to continually innovating in this space.”<br>-Jean-Louis Vignaud, Head of ValueOps, Broadcom Software</p>



<p>Copado<br>“Standards are critical for the proper interoperability of internet infrastructure and software. That interoperability drives innovation and capabilities that help create a more resilient ecosystem. That’s why it’s so exciting to launch VSMI; this will help companies normalize value stream management data for better measurement, auditability and terminology between large scale ecosystems.”<br>-Daniel Riedel, SVP Strategic Services, Copado&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM<br>“Often times, enterprises are constrained from realizing maximum value from their workflows because of disparate systems that may not seamlessly integrate. This situation is further challenged when there are mergers and acquisitions, and new tooling is invariably brought into the value stream. VSMI can play a key role in bridging this void. We support the VSMI initiative and feel like this will be the logical next step towards creating Next-Gen DevSecOps organizations.”<br>-Sunil Joshi, Vice President &amp; CTO, Hybrid Cloud Services, Americas, IBM</p>



<p>Security Compass<br>“Value streams are a critical part of integrating our disparate security activities and aligning them to produce business value. Including multiple stakeholders, from business leaders to developers, to derive requirements and deliver insights in security activities is the next evolution in securing our applications and infrastructure. Security Compass is honored to participate in this OASIS working group to help create an open standard around value streams so that we can collectively build a world where organizations build secure systems at the pace of business demand.”<br>-Altaz Valani, Director of Insights Research, Security Compass</p>

 Changeworks: Web Site Transformation Project 

		 
			 
				
 
 Organization: <a href="https://www.changeworks.org.uk/">Changeworks</a>. 
 Tender: <a href="https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/search/show/search_view.aspx?ID=JUL454333">Public Contracts</a>. 
 Deadline: 8th Aug. 
 Budget: £70k. 
 

			 
		 
	
 RFP Summary 
 Business Case 
<p>We recognise that our current website is not serving us well and will be developing an organisational digital strategy. We require an agency to partner with on this transformation journey that can help establish a new improved website and a new standard for how we develop digital information and services linking with our established organisational systems.</p>
<p>A digital strategy is in development, alongside a digital framework. Improving our user journeys and website is integral to achieving our strategic aims and to maximise reach, efficiency and engagement. As an organisation, we are in the process of pivoting to be userled and insight-driven to develop intuitive and supportive journeys to support decarbonisation of homes. An organisation-wide customer journey is being planned, which will need to be developed in tandem with our website transformation.</p>
 Tech Platform 
<p>Changeworks’ staff and teams range from those that are highly digitally capable, to people who have few or limited skills. We are in the process of moving to SharePoint and embedding usage of Power Platform capabilities such as our CRM across Changeworks, and we are still in process of adoption and learning. There is an ICT team responsible for Power Platform, CRM and support relating to information technology.</p>
<p>The Digital, Marketing and Communications team is responsible for the website and have a content lead, but only limited SEO capabilities, and no developer or UX resources.</p>
<p>We are currently using Drupal 7 but it is not fit for purpose. While we can make minor updates to our website, bigger changes to webpages need to be done through an agency, which is time-consuming and not cost-effective. Our website is not optimised towards user needs and user journeys are poorly mapped out. Though we have a wealth of quality content, it is difficult to find and surface to users, and our service proposition is unclear.</p>
 Project Scope 
 
 Develop a digital roadmap for our website transformation project incl. project timeline, milestones and quality assurance. 
 Develop user personas and journeys for our B2B and B2C audiences, engaging with Changeworks teams through a Discovery phase to determine which services or aspects of services are equipped with online self-servicing and/or lead generation in a phased approach. Includes providing support with:<br>
a. Content audit and content migration<br>
b. User personas and journeys development and testing<br>
c. Plan for lead generation<br>
d. SEO and content development 
 Re-platform the Changeworks website to a more user-friendly CMS (and develop a Minimum Viable Product version as necessary before full website launch alongside new brand). 
 Ensure the website, CMS, tech stack and other necessary components can integrate with current and future requirements, and are able to support Changeworks’ ambitious aims of scaling up reach through digital including digital service design over the 22-25 strategic period and beyond.
 
 Changeworks is invested in Microsoft (including use of Power Platform for e-marketing and as our CRM). The long-term aim is to use Microsoft Azure Cloud. Sharepoint migration began in May ’22. Dynamics 365 / Power Platform can integrate with the majority of systems as long as they accept HTTP requests, which most modern CMS and websites should be able to handle. 
 
 
 Ongoing (min. 3 years) contract for hosting and maintenance incl. options for annual extensions and break-out clauses. 
 
 Proposal 
<p>Identify and map out costings for the above as well as phased project management cycles as may be required.</p>
<p>a. Proposed costings for website transformation project<br>
b. Proposed costings including fixed budget for maintenance and hosting<br>
c. Estimate costings for future development work (for example for new online services or further integrations)</p>

  🚀 Foundation News  
 W3C DIDCore spec approved as an open web standard 
 
 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) have approved the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) V1.0 specification as an official W3C Recommendation. This is a significant milestone in the digital identity sector. Announcing the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) v1.0 specification as an open web standard signals that it is technically sound, mature, and ready for widespread adoption. Having an established v1.0 specification allows work to continue with renewed energy and focus, not only at the many groups meeting at DIF, but across the digital identity community.<br>
Read about this decision <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec-2/">on the DIF blog here</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/07/pressrelease-did-rec.html.en">the official W3C Press release here</a>. 
 
 <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">DIDComm v2 reached DIF approved spec status</a> 
 
 DIF is delighted to announce the approval of the DIDComm v2 specification from the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DIDComm working group</a>. This, along with the W3C decision on DIDs, represents a major step forward in the acceptance of decentralized identity, one that opens the path to widespread adoption and further development especially with regard to the types of peer-to-peer communication now possible. <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/didcomm-v2/">Check out the DIF blog here</a> for more on the path to this milestone, what's new in v2, and where work goes from here! 
 
 <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/vui-donation/">The Verifier Universal Interface (VUI), an international self-sovereign identity interoperability initiative has been donated to DIF</a> 
 
 Together, 12 SSI organizations have led the definition of the minimum set of standard APIs necessary to implement or interoperate with the Verifier component. After months of hard work and collaboration, the VUI work has been successfully donated to DIF with the goal of furthering its evolution and reach to the international community.

 Members of the Ethereum Foundation joined the SIG to review Ethereum's Decentralized Identity discussion in general, and ideas around a 'portable KYC' system in particular. You can find the discussion on the Ethereum website <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/decentralized-identity/">here</a>, and a problem statement draft on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/sustany/dvg/wiki/Problem-Statement-Framing">here</a> 
 Invited speaker&nbsp;Anessa Allen Santos.&nbsp;Anessa's legal practice is largely dedicated to blockchain and fintech by helping innovative corporate clients navigate the evolving regulatory landscape for securities, commodities, and financial services. 
 John Popeo, a Partner at The Gallatin Group, joins the group. Before entering private practice, John spent a decade in various roles at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Having been on both sides of the regulatory divide, John brings a unique perspective to our discussion towards untangling the externalities of current AML and KYC regimes.

<p>Most breaches involve a stolen password or credential, but ironically enough, passwords are still a popular way to protect your online identity. A study conducted by Google revealed that 52% of people reuse the same password for multiple accounts, making it easy for hackers to guess your passwords. Thankfully, there has been a major shift towards a passwordless future with the development of FIDO2 by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using FIDO2, your smartphone will serve as your identity authenticator and store a passkey with the help of public and private key cryptography.</p>

<p>Google, Apple and Microsoft want to say goodbye to the principle of passwords altogether. Instead, a method jointly developed by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to be used. The FIDO method generates a key pair on devices that is linked to a fingerprint or other biometric factors. Logging on to a cell phone is then sufficient to access accounts on a computer.</p>

but surely, we are bringing our contribution toward more robust 
cybersecurity and seamless interoperability through our Dynamic Data 
Economy vision.

<p>Two years ago, we launched an atypical foundation with a societal mission to create synergies, exposing the formidable challenges of inclusiveness and privacy in digital transformation. Nevertheless, the core design of the Human Colossus Foundation is about experimentation, progressive development, and testing.</p><p>We want to thank our early supporters in the private and public sectors for providing nearly CHF 0.5 Mio of seed funding for prototyping core components to support data harmonisation, digital event authentication and distributed ecosystem governance</p><p>Our focus now shifts from experimentation to progressive development. Funded by the EU Horizon 2020 eSSIF-Lab initiative, the closing of our DKMS-4-SSIproject marks that transition as we hit the road of no return in our journey. Here we present our path to inclusiveness and privacy in digital transformation.</p> 0. Today <p>Every day more private and public services are available online. Users receive the digital benefits of increased availability and mobility. Digital services are available everywhere all the time. But the advantages come at a price: accessibility to the platform delivering the services. Moreover, with the current economic incentive that values data over the purpose of usage, platforms collect more data than they need for the intended purposes of the service. Furthermore, data are kept behind a walled garden, forcing users to share too much data with too many institutions. </p><p>Therefore services are restricted to users with the technological capacity to access the platform. Unfortunately, the same platforms too often force a form of consent, allowing them a secondary usage of user's information outside the initial purpose.</p><p>As a result, we evolve towards a two-tier society, excluding individuals that can not access the platform or are not willing to open their private sphere for an unclear rationale.</p> 1. Inclusiveness Needs Interoperability <p>Early in the 20th century, Georges Orwell introduced the "Big Brother" concept in his novel "1984". Although, at the time caricatural, it recognised early that no single over-centralised system could cope with the diversity and complexity of society. </p><p>When it comes to digital transformation, there is a direct technological corollary: digital platforms can not scale beyond a specific limit. If they grow outside their intended purpose, societal friction appears as they can not cope with the complexity of society as a whole. The diversity of our daily activities as individuals, of our customers as businesses or citizen's needs as a government requires digital services to focus on a clear purpose. Interoperability between services tailored to their user base is the natural solution to include every specific case in our digitalised society. Interoperability should be to services what cooperation is to humans; a natural core capacity enabling growth as a group. </p><p>This interoperability of services requires first machines to talk together (the unfortunately too narrow technological definition of interoperability) while the ultimate exchange of information remains under the user's control. Thus we started with the essential element: the tooling for a decentralised cryptographic key management infrastructure (DKMS). Then, within the creativity nest provided by the eSSIF-Lab, we started building libraries allowing developers to begin their journey into the most advanced decentralised authentication architecture: KERI, the brainchild of the prolific veteran of network security, Samuel Smith. Designed for secure authentication, KERI provides the grounds for an alternative form of interoperability. The user and platform authentication does not rely on an administrative intermediary. Instead, an ambient infrastructure under the separate control of each party lets them choose an adequate level of security according to the context. Security is distributed, and interoperability can follow. </p><p>Michal, a core team member of the DKMS-4-SSI project states: </p><blockquote><p>"Distribute the responsibility and decision making for authentication and authorisation among network participants and let them decide. No more castles with giant walls but a synergistic approach where network participants interact and make decisions based upon other participants' reputations. The foundations for our alternative are very similar to what the US National Institute of Standards (NIST) proposes with the "Zero-trust concept" -- distribute". </p><p>Michal Pietrus -Senior Developer &amp; Co-Founder of ArgonAUTHs</p></blockquote> 2. Privacy Needs Cybersecurity + Information Security = Human Governance <p>Interoperability requires more than secure authentication; it requires trust between participants. The user naturally becomes the central point of overall control of his digital experience. And trust requires meaning, not faith in technology providers. </p><p>The Human Colossus Foundation sees privacy as a fundamental factor enabling human cooperation at all levels. If cybersecurity protects data, privacy protection is at a higher level where data acquires meaning. A text string becomes a name only when the data model unambiguously links it to an attribute. Our equation is simple, Data plus Meaning equals Information. It is information usage that must be governed to protect privacy.</p><p>Like authentication, to be effective at the complexity scale of the Internet, a peer-to-peer mechanism to define the meaning of data has to supplement available standards. This requirement is the motivation behind the decentralised semantics domain. As a result, we elevate privacy protection to the governance of information. In other words, securing privacy requires more than data protection regulation. It requires adherence to the complete existing legal framework of an ecosystem. </p> 3. The ambition: valuing information usage, not data itself. <p>In conclusion, to address the challenges of inclusiveness and privacy, the journey starts by solving thorny technological questions in the domains of authentication and semantics. Then, digital communication channels and the fantastic potential of digital technologies to enrich information can be included case-by-case in the existing trust frameworks (legal, ethical, cultural). This is our roadmap towards accurate information for decision-making.</p><p>Once reached, our ambition loops back to the origins of the foundation as captured by Robert Mitwicki as co-founder:</p><blockquote><p> "Data has value when it flows. It is costly when it stagnates"</p><p>Robert Mitwicki, Head of the Technology Council of the Human Colossus Foundation</p></blockquote><p>To receive updates about the Foundation and DDE v1.0, subscribe to the Foundation’s mailing list <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kRop_rIejjA22GecV--GTbKxwQLF5JVP/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

  <p>The Human Colossus Foundation, a Swiss-based independent non-profit organisation, announces the release of its eagerly-awaited Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) v1.0 architecture, describing the core concepts and technologies to enable a next-generation data-agile economy. Two years following its conception, the Foundation published today DDE v1.0, which includes the Principles and a Trust Infrastructure Stack as well as a rollout plan for a related suite of components: Overlays Capture Architecture, Trusted Digital Assistant, Data Governance Administration. In addition, a DDE Founding Donors’ Programme launch accompanies the release, offering exclusive opportunities for organisations to become the earliest DDE v1.0 contributors and experts by engaging in the next stage of development.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired by the three co-founders' aspiration for secured, authentic data management in an increasingly digitised world, the Foundation coined the term "Dynamic Data Economy", the "DDE". With an overarching vision to empower people and organisations, the DDE enables better-informed decisions based on insights from harmonised, accurate data framed by sound data governance. It has developed an ambient cryptographic infrastructure to underpin ecosystems dealing with harmonised data within distributed governance, a paradigm shift in human-centric digital interaction, free from existing, platform-centric economic models. Further development of the DDE continues to bridge existing data standards and legacy infrastructure whilst preserving nuanced jurisdictional and human distinctions and differences in the digital space. Since its formation in 2020, the Foundation has received multiple rounds of government and private funding to develop this groundbreaking next-generation infrastructure. The release of DDE v1.0 marks the Foundation's readiness for broader collaborative stakeholders and community engagement.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“The DDE v1.0 conceptual models, methodologies, and technological infrastructure provide a realistic solution for digital transformation across distributed data ecosystems. It is about returning to the roots of how humans interact online, arming individuals and businesses with the conceptual knowledge to understand the technical design limitations of the current Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last two years, our team has contributed to open standard and open source development of the new Internet at various community forums and summarised our learning and insights into critical blog posts and webinars. It has become clear to us that we developed wrong habits in the digital space, letting technology take over our agency for authentication and privacy. We would never allow this in our physical world; nor should we have done so for the digital one. It is time for real DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, one that can create a more sustainable, scalable, and human-friendly Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>We released DDE v1.0 today to help you start seeing what we see through the DDE vision and its short-term development roadmap. We also want to invite you to participate in our journey to develop DDE further and use it to solve our collective problems. Are you ready?”</p><p>Dr. Philippe Page, Chair of the Board of Trustees</p></blockquote><p><br>DDE Principles</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>The DDE, a decentralised, network-agnostic trust infrastructure acutely aligned with the European data strategy, is built upon a set of core <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f288b25f9c364d7945e6eb/1660061875006/HCF+DDE+Principles+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Principles</a>. The DDE Principles describe the essential building blocks of any information system, leading to a trust infrastructure that preserves the structural, definitional, and contextual integrity (DDE Principle 1) of any object and their relationships in the Semantic domain, the factual authenticity (DDE Principle 2) of any recorded event in the Inputs domain, and the consensual veracity (DDE Principle 3) of any purpose-driven policy or notice in the Governance domain. As a result, actors in DDE ecosystems will ultimately have the transactional sovereignty (DDE Principle 4) to share accurate information bilaterally in the fourth domain, the Economic domain.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack&nbsp;</p>


















  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
              
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>To better define and describe what contributes most notably to creating a cross-sectoral trust infrastructure for access and use of data according to the DDE principles, the Foundation developed the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack</a> that presents "Infrastructure" versus "Security" incrementally through the core data domains (see figure below). Deployed implementations that align with the Stack will positively affect the relationship between DDE actors and incentivise them to share horizontal data across sectors and jurisdictions. The cryptographic assurance of verifiable digital primitives and the human accountability facilitated by socio-economic data governance administrations and framework empowered by the Stack is pivotal for innovation in analytics, artificial intelligence, or other data-driven applications.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>DDE v1.0 Rollout Plan</p><p>As part of the DDE v1.0 release this year, the Foundation will launch three foundational DDE tools, which include:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a standardised global solution for data capture and exchange which protects sensitive data, providing a positive alternative to current architectures;</p>  <p>Trusted Digital Assistant (TDA), a key DDE software interface component that provides a way to look at and interact with information in distributed data ecosystems; and&nbsp;</p>  <p>Data Governance Administration (DGA), a suite of governance methodologies for distributed data ecosystems.</p>  <p>To build a community of DDE developers and advocates, the Foundation will organise community events to facilitate learning and dialogue, launching the Colossi Network later in 2022 as an open forum for more structured community collaboration and contribution.</p>

<p>First public review - ends August 27th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC are pleased to announce that Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Architecture Specification Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the first public review for this specification.</p>



<p>Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyber defense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. A high level overview of OpenC2 featuring insights from the Technical Director of NSA’s Capabilities Directorate can be viewed at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCooyNJoOrU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCooyNJoOrU</a>.</p>



<p>This specification describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2 to define a common understanding of the messages and interactions for all bindings and serializations.</p>

<p>In late June, as a part of <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/meet-our-new-matchbox-partners/">our work with Ugandan organisation Albinism Umbrella</a>, we hosted a<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/invite-community-call-responsible-data-social-justice/"> Community Call about Responsible Data</a>. The call included speakers <a href="https://twitter.com/amosdoornbos">Amos Doornbos and </a>former Engine Roomer <a href="https://twitter.com/paolasinu">Paola Verhaert</a> and brought together a variety of civil society organisations interested in collecting, managing, and storing data in equitable and responsible ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation was centred on the risks and potential harms of data management, and how to go about integrating responsible data into an organisations’ ongoing work. Below are some of the insights that surfaced in the call.</p>



 Starting from the top: figuring out what data you are using 



<p>Speaker Amos Doornbos pointed out that it is best to start by identifying the ways in which your organisation is using data. It can be easy to underestimate how much data you’re collecting in your day-to-day work, how your team is using it (or not using it!) and what is actually being done with all of it. He introduced the following guiding questions, as well as <a href="https://thisisamos.com/data-inventory-map-fillable-template/">this short Cheat sheet</a>, to support the process of mapping this out:&nbsp;</p>



  What data is being collected and why?&nbsp;  Who is collecting it?&nbsp;  Where is it stored?&nbsp;  Who is this data shared with?&nbsp;  



<p>For further support, The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/">Becoming RAD! [Retaining, Archiving, and Disposal]</a> Tipsheets can guide you through some of the processes in more detail.&nbsp;</p>



 Responsible data as an organisation-wide priority 



<p>Our speakers also talked about how important it can be for the whole organisation (and if possible, also the organisation’s partners and the communities they work with) to be involved in conversations about potential risks and harms related to the data the organisation collects, stores and works with. Data is not just an issue for the “tech person” on your team: the consequences of the ways individuals on the team use data will affect the whole of your work. In addition to that, taking your team’s different experiences and perspectives into account is a good way of designing your data strategy and solutions that work for all.</p>



 Mitigating risk and potential harm 



<p>Much of our conversation focused on the importance of assessing how the data we work with could generate or exacerbate risks for the people reflected in the data. Our speakers shared the following resources to support teams in reflecting on potential risks and harms:</p>



  <a href="https://thisisamos.com/2022/02/09/identifying-potential-data-risks-and-harms/">Identifying Potential Data Risks and Harms</a>  <a href="https://thisisamos.com/cheat-sheets/">Data Sharing Cheat Sheet</a> (scroll down the page)  



<p>We also talked about how practising data minimisation – that is minimising the amount and the categories of data you collect – can be a good strategy to prevent potential harm. If the data you collect does not serve a purpose for your work, consider deleting it and/or not collecting it all.</p>



 Participation is key 



<p>Another insight from our speakers referred to consent practices: The communities you serve should be informed about potential risks associated with your use of their data, and should be able to withdraw their consent regarding the data you store at any point. That is why baking participation into your processes is a good practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relatedly, a key point that emerged in the call was this: Responsible data is not a one-off thing. It’s not a conversation you have once (for example, at the moment that you’re collecting data from the people you work with).&nbsp; Context regularly changes (and so do the potential risks you and your organisation face), so plan accordingly. One way to do this is by creating user-friendly check-ins throughout your project to inform people about what’s happening with their data, making room for them to exercise their agency and select whether to opt-in or out.&nbsp;</p>



 Be specific and realistic with your data management goals&nbsp; 



<p>A different suggestion that came up in the call is to avoid broad and abstract recommendations and processes when implementing responsible data practices in your organisation. Paola Verhaert highlighted how important it is to make them clear and practical, so that they can be implemented easily. Staff might not have extra time on their hands to spend on this, so being specific and realistic with your data management goals is a good way of making sure your team is able to implement them.&nbsp;</p>



 Where to start? 



<p>Changing the way your organisation operates can seem overwhelming. If you need support advocating for changes around your data practices, look for allies both within your own organisation and in the sector (the <a href="https://responsibledata.io/get-involved/">Responsible Data Community</a> might be a good place to start!).

<p>The OriginTrail ecosystem is a two-layer system, driving its two symbiotic networks by their respective crypto tokens — the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (hosting the multichain OriginTrail DKG, as indicated<a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper?section=origintrail-technology-stack"> in the whitepaper</a>) driven by its utility token TRAC, and the underlying blockchains with their respective native tokens used for transactions.</p><p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Network utility enabled by the TRAC token therefore requires each of the respective blockchains to support the TRAC token according to the TRAC tokenomics design, and requires necessary bridge infrastructure between relevant chains. TRAC being an ERC20 token on Ethereum has been so far successfully bridged to two blockchains — Gnosis chain (formerly xDAI) and Polygon with their respective bridge infrastructure.</p><p>With the launch of the dedicated OriginTrail blockchain on Polkadot — the OriginTrail Parachain — the required bridge infrastructure needs to be created to facilitate the OriginTrail DKG operation on this new chain. Moreover, the same infrastructure will enable further network effects for TRAC on all of Polkadot emerging parachain infrastructure and solutions, such as Acala and its DeFi stack (DEX, aUSD stablecoin, etc).</p><p>The purpose of this document is to outline the technical approach to bridging the TRAC token to Polkadot via the OriginTrail Parachain and collect relevant feedback from the OriginTrail community.</p> Bridging TRAC to OriginTrail Parachain and&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Polkadot is a network designed to enable high interoperability between blockchains and inter-blockchain trustless operations, such as bridging Polkadot based tokens on connected blockchains. As a multi blockchain network of parachains connected via the common Layer 0 Polkadot Relay Chain, bridging tokens is enabled by the powerful <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain">cross chain messaging format XCM</a>. Using these inherent functionalities of Polkadot therefore solves the “bridging problem” within the entire Polkadot ecosystem — once the TRAC token is available on the OriginTrail Parachain, making it available to other parachains is a non-issue.</p><p>When it comes to external blockchains such as Ethereum however, there are a multitude of bridging approaches evolving in parallel. Two of the most promising approaches at the moment of writing this RFC&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://snowbridge.snowfork.com/">Snowbridge</a>, a general purpose trustless bridge in development by the Snowfork team, yet to be launched,  <a href="https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io/">Chainbridge</a>, an EVM to Substrate bridge already available and in utilization by parachains such as Moonbeam and Centrifuge.  <p>As development progresses, we can naturally expect new and improved bridging solutions in the years to come. Therefore, bridging of TRAC to the OriginTrail Parachain will, over time, most likely involve a multitude of different bridges and related infrastructure as the Polkadot ecosystem evolves. It is therefore essential to plan for this eventuality from the start and thus enable the bridge infrastructure evolution to be “inherited” by the TRAC bridges on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>It is important to note that TRAC token will stay an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and will be implemented as a bridgeable asset on the OriginTrail Parachain, which operates with its native token&nbsp;OTP.</p> Near term bridging approach — Chainbridge <p>Out of the two approaches outlined above, the core developers of OriginTrail propose the implementation of the Chainbridge bridge system for the first TRAC bridge between Ethereum and OriginTrail Parachain. Chainbridge is a battle tested, two way bridge, used by several teams within the Polkadot ecosystem to move assets to parachains.</p><p>Chainbridge implements a bridge smart contract on the Ethereum side (similar to Gnosis and Polygon bridges), with a respective pallet enabled on the OriginTrail Parachain. Tokens are transferred between the Ethereum bridge contract and the parachain via a set of relayers which listen for bridging events on both blockchains and executing the necessary transfers on the blockchain on the “other side” of the bridge, as illustrated below.</p><p>The bridged TRAC token will be implemented as a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-assets">parachain asset </a>on the OriginTrail Parachain and further bridged to the EVM&nbsp;pallet.</p><p>The Chainbridge implementation has been significantly researched by the OriginTrail core developers and progressed in implementation together with assistance from the Parity development team. To our knowledge and experience it is the most mature and tested system within the ecosystem and is the proposed solution for the near&nbsp;term.</p><p>However, as most existing bridges (such as Gnosis and Polygon bridges) its trust model can be improved, as explained in the <a href="https://chainbridge.chainsafe.io/">Chainbridge docs</a>:</p><p>“In its current state ChainBridge operates under a trusted federation model. Deposit events on one chain are detected by a trusted set of off-chain relayers who await finality, submit events to the other chain and vote on submissions to reach acceptance triggering the appropriate handler. Research is currently underway to reduce the levels of trust required and move toward a fully trust-less bridge.”</p><p>Therefore a key component of this proposal is to avoid “bridge lock-in” and enable further development of the OriginTrail bridging infrastructure to involve more trust-minimized solutions (such as Snowfork when&nbsp;ready).</p><p>The initial set of bridge relayers will be run by OriginTrail core developers, with an ambition to include additional relayers from the ecosystem in the near&nbsp;future.</p> Long term approach — multiple&nbsp;bridges <p>We expect a multitude of improvements as bridging infrastructure evolves to support more than one bridge on the OriginTrail Parachain. These will most likely include improvements in security models (trustless bridges), efficiency and user experience. It’s important to note however that having multiple bridge systems bridging the same asset effectively creates multiple “mirror versions” of the same asset on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>To enable a sustainable, long term evolution of the bridging infrastructure therefore 3 key considerations need to be applied from the&nbsp;start:</p>  Ensuring equivalence of bridged TRAC tokens as they might need to be implemented as “different” assets on the OriginTrail Parachain — for example, a TRAC token bridged via Chainbridge and a TRAC token bridged via Snowfork might be two “mirror version” assets on the parachain, with essentially the same value (1 TRAC). Equivalence would involve enabling OriginTrail DKG and other systems utilizing TRAC to register all TRAC mirror versions on the Parachain as the same (equivalent).  Appropriate mirror asset naming should be applied to avoid confusion, especially as these assets move across the Polkadot ecosystem.  “Phase out” capability for mirror assets in case of potential bridge issues (such as a major flaw being discovered), which would enable a safe decommission of potentially problematic bridges, ensuring TRAC tokenomics preservation.  <p>Having these points in place while implementing the first bridge is important and already taken into consideration by the core development team.</p> Conclusion <p>This document outlines the near and long term approach of enabling the utilization of TRAC token in the Polkadot ecosystem via the OriginTrail Parachain token. We invite the OriginTrail community to provide their improvement proposals, comments and suggestions via the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository">official RFC repository</a>.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-origintrail-parachain-trac-bridges-57bb6852dfa7">OT-RFC-12 OriginTrail Parachain TRAC bridges</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Exploration of Verite verification patterns, with a focus on non-DID wallets. Part 2 in a 2-part series

<p>Part 2 of this 2-part series explains the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">did:pkh</a>/<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md#simple-summary">CACAO</a> variation for Verite data models and flows, which provides an entry path for wallets that may not support sufficient functionality for emerging decentralized identity patterns</p><p>Since some wallets may not themselves be willing to embed protocol-specific logic (interaction with verifiers) or more general verifiable-credential logic, we have to find a kind of "minimum viable" level of support for today’s non-DID-enabled crypto wallets. While handling DIDs and signing Verifiable Presentations brings a kind of secure indirection that enables portability and multi-chain wallets, these properties are not strictly essential to the core functionality of Verite. For this reason, we define a crypto wallet that can receive and pass to dApps a Verifiable Credential issued against its blockchain address adequate, with a few adjustments and supplements.</p> Phase 0: Issuance Directly to Crypto Wallet<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In a crypto-wallet centric end-to-end flow, the trust model is different and the interplay between credential wallet and crypto wallet can be greatly simplified. The credentials themselves must also be slightly different– instead of obtaining the credential subject DID directly from the wallet to which they are being issued, the issuer will use a credential subject identifier based on a specific blockchain address controlled by that wallet. Using DID terminology, rather than attest to the controller of a wallet, it attests only to a specific address controlled by that wallet.</p><p>This greatly simplifies the ownership question, by relying on native mechanisms for proving ownership of the address– at the time of issuance, as well as at time of verification of the credentials.</p> Two Options of Expressing a Blockchain address as a DID (and as a VC subject)<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Instead of defining the subject of the VC as a chain-agnostic DID provided by the wallet, the issuer will deterministically generate a DID from the blockchain address controlled by the connected wallet. Multiple DID methods allow this possibility; we’ll describe two of them, assuming a wallet with an Ethereum address (referred to as <code>ETH_ADDRESS</code>).</p>  did:key method - issue against a crypto wallet’s public key: If the issuer has the wallet address <code>ETH_ADDRESS</code> and any signature over a known message, the corresponding public key can be recovered using the <code>ecrecover</code> mechanism ported over from Bitcoin in the early days of Ethereum. In this way. the issuer can deterministically obtain a<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/"> did:key</a> DID that will be used as the value of <code>credentialSubject.id</code>. This is the method Circle will begin with, for ease of implementation by participants.  In this case, the mapping is:<code> did:key:&lt;ecrecover(ETH_ADDRESS, signature)&gt;</code>  For blockchains that do not use a Bitcoin-style pay2hash address system, like Solana and Polkadot, no recovery from a signature is necessary because the base form of the address is already a public key supported by <code><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase">multibase</a> </code>and thus by <code><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/#introduction">did:key</a></code>.    did:pkh method - issue against a crypto wallet’s public address: Other DID methods, like [did:pkh](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md), allow DIDs to be defined directly based on blockchain addresses in their commonly-used, public-facing forms. Long term, this is the preferred method. Among other advantages, the implementation across chains is more apparent. - In this case, the mapping is: <code>did:pkh:eip155:1:&lt;ETH_ADDRESS&gt;</code>. eip155 here refers to the EVM namespace (defined in EIP155), while 1 refers to the ethereum mainnet according to EIP155. - Just as the did:key URI scheme relies on the <code>[multibase](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-multiformats-multibase)</code> registry, so does the did:pkh URI scheme rely on the ChainAgnostic Standards Alliance’s [namespace registry](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/namespaces) to add non-EVM namespaces. - In cases where human-readability is important, end-users can introspect the VC and see their familiar address, as opposed to a public key that in pay2hash systems like BTC or ETH, they might never have seen or know they control   Sign-In With Ethereum and dApp-native Identity<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Wallets that have not incorporated decentralized identity capabilities rarely support JWT _signing _features, or other token mechanics that are common to the traditional web2 identity world. For this reason, many web3 sites and dApps have started using the wallet connection pattern to create a more feature-rich and auditable session mechanism via offchain message signing (i.e. <code>personal_sign</code> on EVM systems). Equivalents for other blockchain ecosystems, such as Solana, are forthcoming.</p><p>In the case of issuance, this signature is enough to extract the crypto wallet’s public key, as mentioned above. Importantly, though, it also enables delegated keys to sign offchain events without another onerous or fraught wallet-interaction, as we will see below.</p> Phase 1: Off-chain Verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a>  Variant: Crypto-Wallet only with only VC storage capabilities<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>At verification time, when a wallet "connects” to a dApp by providing an off-chain signature over a structured <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/5e9b0fe0728e160f56dd1e4cbf7dc0a0b1772f82/EIPS/eip-4361.md#informal-message-template">authentication message</a>, the dApp will have the wallet’s address (and live proof-of-control, if the authentication message included a secure nonce) so it can simply compare this address with the corresponding DID:PKH <code>credentialSubject.id</code> of the VC. This way, the verifier will not need to do an ownership check on the VC, and the dApp can trust the verifier to have received credentials from the right wallet because it, too, will require a wallet connection and prove ownership of the same wallet.</p><p>Without necessarily even having to parse, validity-check, or introspect the verifiable credentials, any wallet that can store them (whether as JWTs or even as raw text files) can submit them directly to verifiers, as shown below.</p><p></p><p>Note: while it is recommended that crypto wallets parse verifiable credentials and check their validity or safety, crypto wallets could in theory allow blind passthrough if the user can assume the responsibility for their contents. In the Verite case, there are little security concerns or abuses possible.</p><p>By itself, however, this bare VC is inferior to a VP from a full-featured decentralized-identity wallet, since it does not contain a non-repudiable off-chain wallet signature for auditing purposes. Or, to put it another way, it is only as trustworthy as the authentication of the wallet that sent it to you, and there is little standardization of the receipts you keep of crypto-wallet authentication to replay it for a future auditor or security review.</p><p>While the corner cases of impersonation or exfiltrated VCs might be vanishingly rare, the "audit trail” of a bare VC is weaker than a VC wrapped in a timestamped signature. For this reason, we encourage Verite dApps to create a functional equivalent to a verifiable presentation in the form of a signed presentation receipt (signed with a session-specific ephemeral key) for logging purposes. To accomplish this, we return to the Sign-In With Ethereum pattern to elaborate on its key delegation feature.</p> Sign-In With Ethereum Flow<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>As mentioned above, we support the emerging standard approach of the "Sign-In With Ethereum” mechanism which defines a sign-in message that includes a domain-binding anchor, an ephemeral session key, and other caveats. While the ephemeral session key property was not essential to the issuance wallet connection, it can be useful in the verification situation for more trustless (and auditable) logging.</p><p>By generating an ephemeral key and including it in the initial wallet-connection message for the crypto wallet to sign over upon authenticating itself to the dApp, the wallet effectively "delegates” that ephemeral key for the duration of the session. In UX terms, this saves the user from a distinct off-chain wallet signature at each confirmation or consent event. Carefully defining the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#message-field-descriptions">other properties</a> of the SIWE message, dApps can secure and constrain that delegation, link to an applicable terms-of-service agreement, enable DNS-based domain-checks analogous to the "lock symbol” in modern browsers, etc.</p><p>Once the user has "connected” their wallet by signing this SIWE message, a CACAO is generated as a receipt of that session (and of the delegation of signing rights to the key). This allows the dApp to use smoother UX than requiring a full off-chain wallet signature to confirm each consent event or internal transaction (such as the presentation of VCs in a signed VP). But it also provides a compact and tamperproof way of encapsulating each event or internal transaction as a time-stamped and signed object for logging purposes– this makes each event as verifiable as an off-chain (or on-chain) signature, via the indirection of the delegated key.</p> Ownership Verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>You could say that the crypto wallet delegates the encapsulation and signature of a VP to the dApp, which creates a short-lived key with which to sign the VP, which is a kind of standardized logging object for a presentation event. This allows the verifier to confirm that the dApp is interacting on behalf of the wallet. Since the Verifier has confirmed control of the wallet address with a SIWE message, and the VC is issued to the address directly, there is no ownership verification needed as with a decentralized wallet; thanks to the CACAO, future auditors can replay these interactions and re-check signatures and tamper-proof objects to confirm all of these transactions trustlessly.</p> Detailed Flow<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p></p>  Wallet initiates DeFi transaction with dApp.  dApp generates a session-specific ephemeral signing key and encoded it in the SIWE message for the wallet to sign. This generated session key will delegate the wallet for future signings, once after wallet vouches it (by signing the CACAO).  Once the wallet has signed it and returned it to the dApp, the signature and message are encoded into a compact <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md">CACAO</a> session receipt for logging and forensic purposes (if needed).  Next the dApp lets the verifier know about the session, by POSTing the receipt to an endpoint (eg. <a href="https://github.com/centrehq/verite-minter-allowlist/blob/main/backend/src/index.js#L136">signIn</a>). The signed receipt also includes <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md#test-cases">caveats</a>, a domain-binding, an expiration, and other constraints to secure the delegation and the transfer of the session parameters.  The verifier saves the CACAO. The verifier only uses this CACAO in the scope of this verification session (to prove the VP signed by the ephemeral key). Once the CACAO verification step is completed, the session object will be updated.  Instead of sending the wallet to verify directly with the verifier (as in the previous post), the wallet will submit the VC directly to the dapp (or an agent/service it trusts). The dApp presents the prompt to verify.  Wallet submits the bare VC.  Subsequent requests from the dApp will include a reference to the session which the verifier can use if they need to check signatures made by that key. The VC(s) submitted by the dApp in this case will not be signed in a VP with the wallet’s key; instead, it/they will be put into a VP and signed by the dApp using the ephemeral key (the signing key mentioned in the first step above) delegated to it by the SIWE message. Introspection into the CACAO is required to extract the public key that signed the VP, as well as a signature from the wallet key over the public key.  When all the information is submitted to the verifier, the verifier needs to examine the ownership of the credential:  Extract the public key of the session signing key from the resources section of the CACAO  Use the public key of the session signing key to validate the VP’s signature. This is to ensure that the dApp properly (which held the key and got user consent to delegate signing rights to it) signed the VP and that it has not been tampered with in transport.  Compare <code>iss</code> in CACAO with the wallet’s DID in VC (in this case a did:pkh representing the wallet address as a long URI). They should match, if the dApp’s SIWE message. conforms to the SIWE specification. This is to check the wallet which vouched the session key is the subject (and holder) of the VC, which is also connected to the dApp with a signature over a nonce, included in the CACAO to keep future auditors from having to trust the verifier.     Conclusion:<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Circle’s implementation of the Verite protocol allows us to serve our customers and the dApps they interact with equally, putting the rigor of our KYC processes at the service of a process that is auditable and verifiable end-to-end without duplicating KYC process or PII from those processes across the chain of asset custody. We are proud to be driving the Verite process, and welcome more implementations, whether end-to-end issuer+verifier solutions like ours or more focused implementations that bring more wallets and more users into the ecosystem.</p><p>As the Centre team updates its documentation and sample implementation to reflect the new patterns and flows, we will continue to work with them to share the insights we are gaining from our exploratory work with dApps and clients.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec-2/">approval of the Decentralized Identifiers (DID) Core Spec</a> by the W3C as an official open web standard, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation </a>(DIF) announced the approval of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm v2 specification</a>. Combined, this represents a major step forward in the acceptance of decentralized identity, one that opens the path to widespread adoption and further development especially with regard to the types of peer-to-peer communication now possible.</p>
<p>DIDComm, short for Decentralized Identifier Communication, is a communications methodology that works with the decentralized design of DIDs to provide private, secure interaction. "Methodology" is used rather than method because it describes more than just a mechanism for individual or sequential messages. DIDComm defines how messages are composed into application-level protocols and workflows. Just as DIDs are a foundational element of decentralized identity by providing non-revocable identifiers, DIDComm provides secure communication between parties based on the service endpoints and keys present in a DID Document.</p>
<p>DIDComm provides the next step in decentralized identity: direct, secure communication between the owners of DIDs. Currently, APIs are the norm for communicating with online services; however, APIs favor those with the ability to provide highly-available online services; they are ill-suited to peer-to-peer cases where the endpoints are not highly available and the infrastructure costs must be low. In contrast, DIDComm enables peer-to-peer interaction with computers, phones, and even IoT devices.</p>
<p>The protocol derives its security properties independently of the transport being used. The privacy and security guarantees are the same whether using HTTPS, or websockets, or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transport.</p>
<p>By removing architectural barriers, DIDComm-based protocols return individuals and small companies to first-class citizen status on the Internet, a state largely lost via the expansion of large social media platforms and the rise of APIs as a primary integration method.</p>
<p>Version 1 of DIDComm started in the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">HyperlLedger Aries project</a> and resulted in full community adoption. Version 2 of DIDComm (also called DIDComm Messaging) began at the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) as parties outside the HL Aries community became interested in and started working collaboratively on the protocol. The [DIF DIDComm working group]((<a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html</a>) is responsible for the numerous improvements and simplifications that now form DIDComm v2.</p>
<p>DIDComm v2 has now reached DIF Approved Status, joining <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1/">SideTree spec</a> as a complete and approved open-source specification. DIDComm v2 is now ready for development, with planned adoption by the HyperLedger Aries community. The DIDComm spec and "What's New in DIDComm v2" section links are below, along with some explainer videos to help those wishing to understand more.</p>
<p>While the initial spec work may be done, there are plenty of ways to get involved with the ongoing work of the DIDComm community. The <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Sdw8swxpDJ">DIDComm Users Group</a> is open to all, and a great place to get started with using DIDComm and asking questions: Join the conversation on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Sdw8swxpDJ">Discord</a>. This group is working on the creation of the "DIDComm Book," which is available in a live version here: <a href="https://didcomm.org/book/v2/">https://didcomm.org/book/v2/</a></p>

<p>There has been much hype about the Metaverse, a vision for our digital future that's increasingly merging with Web3's. For this article, let's sidestep attempts by Facebook, ahem Meta, or NFT tribes to stake their claim to the Metaverse. We think of the Metaverse as the entirety of all composable and interoperable resources, identities, applications, platforms, services, and protocols that exist in cyberspace.</p><p>Our vision of the Metaverse will run on the Dataverse: a composable, web-scale data ecosystem—owned by everyone and no one. Developers will build interchangeable interfaces and online experiences that directly interact with the Dataverse and the composable data that lives there. The Dataverse will play arguably the most important role within the Metaverse: a shared, high-performance, always-available graph of all data created and used by all applications</p><p>Most features on the web are just data rather than monetary value transactions. For example, the DeFiverse would refer to the universe of interoperable financial protocols, assets, and applications; but, just think about the applications you use on a daily basis. How many times do you click, ‘send’, or ‘like’ compared to ‘buy’ or ‘transfer’? In the Dataverse, your data follows you around from app to app, putting you at the center and in control of your own digital universe.</p><p>Over the next five years we will see a massive explosion in the developer market and a full integration of permissionless protocols into the mainstream development stack, giving rise to a billion networked applications that run and interoperate on shared, composable backend infrastructures. That’s an app for every 10 people on the planet.</p><p>We’d like to take you on a tour of the Dataverse—how we navigate from the data silos of today’s Web2 apps and the data desert of today’s Web3 apps—to a future where everyone in the world is building applications and they’re all doing it on the same networked, composable data layer.</p> The Golden Era for Application Development <p>The route to that interoperable Metaverse depends on enabling developers. The next five years will be the golden age of application development.</p> Everyone’s an App ‘Developer’ <p>Application development is going to become so accessible that five years from now it will be possible for anyone in the world, regardless of location, technical ability or education level, to build and launch an application on the internet. Basically everyone will be able to be a “developer.” For example, even a non-technical journalism student will be able to launch a fully-featured, crowd-sourced intelligence forum in a few hours.</p> Bye, bye, backend. <p>The trend of everything-as-a-service will have abstracted much or all of the backend application development logic away, allowing front-end developers to launch zero-infrastructure applications. These infrastructures could be provided by either decentralized networks or managed service providers.</p> Open, Shared Platforms <p>By this time, decentralized permissionless networks will be widely adopted by the mid- and long-tail of application developers, with some forward-leaning Web2 companies joining in on the fun as well. The primary benefit of building on these platforms is that, in addition to providing zero-infrastructure deployments, it makes cooperation and interoperability within the Metaverse feasible. This solves a lot of traditional application development challenges including centralized platform risk (read: Twitter shutters API, Facebook shuts game developers out of its platform), onboarding new users, bootstrapping content, building network effects, creating delightful user experiences, etc.</p> Copy/Paste Frontend <p>There are two primary trends driving the minimization of front-end development. First, low/no code solutions are doing a good job of making it easy for non-technical folk to create an app. Second, by nature of building on open platforms and users desiring increased transparency, more application code is getting open sourced than ever before at an accelerating rate. Combined with zero-infrastructure backends this means that basically every application is available to be inspected in its entirety, sampled, forked, cloned, remixed, modified, and redeployed. Creating applications becomes so easy that it looks more like copy/pasting others’ front-end code or dropping modular pieces that work together onto a canvas.</p> Global Access, Equal Opportunity <p>Connectivity will have improved around the world through the rollout of satellite-based over-the-top 3G+ internet delivery, causing a new generation of developers to come online for the first time. This connects more people over cyberspace, and gives the inclined more incentive to create something in a global market. The web will be filled with free educational material—all it will take is a little curiosity and initiative.</p> Powerful Incentives and Direct Rewards <p>Given two ways of building the same thing, all else equal, people would want to work on the one with the most upside. Web3 provides powerful native participation and builder incentives that are compelling and directly accessible to developers of all backgrounds. Large tech companies will struggle to compete for talent, as the upside potential of going from 0 to 1 on your own (or joining a Web3 rocketship) will far outweigh the draw for working at a company like Amazon. The Metaverse as a whole will outcompete for talent.</p> Power to the People <p>The organizing principle of the Metaverse will be the individual. When developers build on this shared application architecture, because it is better for their application (user-centric composability), it coincidentally unlocks a new world for end-users where they can reclaim control over their digital identity and begin to experience the web as if every application was built specifically for them and their data was magically everywhere they wanted it to be.</p> Self Agency and Determinism <p>In the Metaverse, individuals have a choice. Based on foundations of public key cryptography, users in the Metaverse begin their life—no permission needed—as a simple, self-sovereign, pseudonymous keypair. From there, they can decide who they want to be. They can allow someone else to control their identity for them. They can be their own bank and take self-custody. They can begin to attach as much or as little data as they want. They can set permissions for who can do what with their data under which conditions. This level of digital ownership and self-agency is how the Metaverse can stay independent and remain secure.</p><p>But self-sovereignty doesn’t stop at an account. Users will also have trusted independent infrastructure for keeping their data around for the long-term so they never have to rely on someone else.</p> The Magic of Interoperability <p>If one of the primary draws to building in the Metaverse is interoperability, then applications are naturally incentivized to adopt the minimum foundational standards needed to enable this interoperability. The easiest and most intuitive way for interoperability to be achieved is through adopting a user-centric architecture. In this model, the user acts as the nexus of data interoperability between different applications; wherever they go, so does their data.</p><p>For end users, the experience of interoperability feels magical—like how the internet should work. No more passwords, forms, verifications, reposting content, refollowing the same person across platforms.</p> An explosion of Knowledge, Science, and Human Progress <p>As a public resource, the Dataverse will enable an explosion of shared knowledge and accelerate science and human progress. The original use case for Internet 1.0 was sharing scientific databases between California and Massachusetts. Web 3.0 is going to take that idea and supercharge it.</p><p>Until now, semantic web and linked data implementations, which are good for information graphs, have really only been deployed in production within the internal systems of the largest companies and institutions in the world such as Google. They’re hard to build and require many of the brightest minds.</p><p>The Dataverse will provide simple, open access to a graph of semantically-defined, structured data that takes the most cutting edge research and allows everyone to build and collaborate on it. While the implications of the progress that can be made when we can connect the entire scientific community on one unified verifiable data platform cannot be overstated, we don’t need to go into unnecessary forward-looking predictions on what that might ultimately look like.</p> The Creativity of a Billion Networked Applications <p>What can be known is the diversity, creativity, ingenuity, and innovation that will be unleashed when everyone in the world is building applications and they’re all doing it on the same networked, composable data layer—let’s refer to this network that supports the Dataverse as a platform.</p><p>As more developers are joining the platform, and more data exists on the platform, it will become even easier for developers to create applications. The startup costs drop to near zero. This allows for a diversity of implementations and experiments that add resilience and allow Darwinism to chart the path forward. It allows developers to hack scalable microapplications together in a few minutes and focus on product-market fit instead of taking weeks to ship a hacky monolith. It provides a new vector to allow everyone-but-Facebook-or-Google to compete with Facebook and Google. The pace and ingenuity of the bazaar, in this case, will outpace the cathedrals.</p> Big Bets <p>A few trends that define the Dataverse and the future of the web.</p> Web3 Applications Explode With Data Functionality <p>The Web3 developer market, containing collaborative groups of value-aligned innovators/early adopters (some of which are already building in other parts of the Metaverse), will be first to adopt the Dataverse. To date, Web3 applications have been data deserts. This makes sense, as there’s only so much data functionality you can build with smart contracts.</p><p>This trend is changing and will continue at an accelerating rate as the market becomes more crowded/mature and applications look for new vistas for innovation. As the market demand picks up for building data features and applications begin cooperating over large data sets, the network effects of the Dataverse will quickly accelerate and the Web3 application market will be flush with data-powered features. Others beyond this market will notice the ecosystem and be compelled to join it.</p> Interoperable Ecosystems Will Outcompete Siloed Platforms <p>The perfect cocktail is brewing for the Metaverse to outcompete even the largest, most entrenched institutions. No one will want to build their own application on an island anymore or for big companies. The simplicity, creativity, pace of innovation, speed of development, open data, and rewards that are available in the Metaverse will be too strong. The incumbents who have already built their business on an entirely different incentive structure will find it tough to pivot or compete.</p> Identity Emerges From Needs of Communities and is the Organizing Principle of the Dataverse <p>Identity is inherently multiplayer. This is true not only in the physical world, where it began as a construct enabling human-to-human interactions, but also in the digital world where it’s more important to have a profile on a social media application than it is to have on your personal note-taking application. Identity is a tool for providing context, trust, and efficiency to transactions. By providing an inherently multi-player data ecosystem, Ceramic is a platform that we can expect to generate a widely-adopted identity system that can serve to provide greater interoperability to the Metaverse.</p> The Effectiveness and Sustainability of Digital Communities <p>Less technical and more sustainability related, we’re betting on the fact that strangers on the internet, unified by a community-owned protocol and its inherent incentives, can effectively organize and create high-impact work with high efficiency. Although this trend has positive indications, it still stands to be seen if these communities can sustain themselves over the long term or if they can stay innovative and keep speed high. The design and implementation of effective digital communities is something we’re keeping a close eye on, but we also believe that a lot of what will make communities successful over the long term has yet to be discovered.</p><p>Some people have gone full degen into “working for the internet” as a contributor to protocols and DAOs, picking up one-off tasks or engaging in longer contracts. We already have participants in DAOs lobbying in front of congress. DAOs are legally recognized meatspace entities in Wyoming. Digital communities have long been used for OSINT (open-source intelligence), where groups of highly-motivated strangers come together on topic-based platforms such as subreddits or Facebook groups to do things that any single person (or government agency) couldn’t—such as crowdsourcing villains or solving investigations. Wikipedia runs beautifully. These are all things that make me optimistic about how this fluid work and incentive system will evolve over time.</p><p>There are positive indications that these communities are beginning to cross the chasm into mainstream, which only deepens their tentacles into society making them more resilient. Bored Ape Yacht Club basically has every celebrity with an ape as their Twitter profile picture; Alexis Ohanian and Serena Williams wore pins of their CryptoPunks to the Met Gala. These digital-first communities will spill into every aspect of society with influencers and celebrities sporting their flair and representing their tribe.</p><p>To get a sense of where Web3 (as opposed to NFTs) will cross into mainstream culture, we should look at where there exist networks of highly-engaged, multiplayer user bases/communities, what it means to be a member of that community, and how people fly their flag.</p> Ceramic: Decentralized Infrastructure for Building on the Dataverse <p>Although the market may be primed for the Dataverse, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will emerge organically. The best developer platform for building applications in the Dataverse requires a few key design considerations.</p> General-Purpose Data Protocol <p>Data is highly varied, and developers need freedom and flexibility to build their applications and data use cases. Rigid standards won't work, or will lead to fragmentation. We need a highly-generalized protocol that is capable of supporting the diversity of use cases that will emerge from the Dataverse. It’s important that all these use cases seamlessly interact and the easiest way is to have them building on the same protocols. It shouldn’t matter which wallet users log in with or what feature you’re building on the front end or what type of data you want to store; it should all just work.</p> Fast, Decentralized, High-Volume Processing <p>This general purpose data protocol needs to support mutability with fast, decentralized, high-volume transaction processing simply for the fact that there are so many data events occurring all day, every day, in every application. Current blockchain protocols cannot scale to support this level of processing and this is a strong area of differentiation. Data consensus properties, like Ceramic’s, can be treated differently than value consensus properties, like Bitcoin’s.</p> Globally-Consistent, Always-Available State <p>Next, it’s important that the system has a way to provide participants with a highly available state that can be trustlessly verified and reconstructed from the underlying event streams. This is critical, because it’s actually what allows developers to build permissionless, composable applications on shared data. The availability of state can be ensured by anyone who plugs into the underlying event streams, as updates are published through this system all participants can immediately update their state database.</p><p>Related to global state availability is state representation. Ceramic currently supports state outputs in the form of simple JSON objects and a native indexing system, which is good for graph-based application use cases. The protocol should be able to adapt and support different state representations based on the optimizations required by the data structures better suited to these use cases. This can be achieved by plugging into the event streaming layer of Ceramic and building custom databases on top.</p> Object-Oriented Permissions <p>Every piece of data in the Dataverse should be verifiable, secure, and useful—not spam or bits of data that clog up the network. By using a protocol for decentralized, cryptographic, object-oriented permissions, we can give decentralized identities provable agency over their data while allowing the access permissions for each state (or even nested/recursive/chained permissions to groups of states) to be completely customizable.</p><p>For example, users can grant their therapist, their school counselor, and their best friend permanent access to their diary. Or someone can give an application the ability to update a state on their behalf for the duration of a session. It can also be natively integrated with the different cryptographic authentication systems used within developers’ applications (e.g. sign in with Ethereum). It’s important that we collaborate with other Dataverse protocols and services to adopt the same permissioning standard so that we can achieve maximal interoperability. In a lot of ways, the more robust, developed, and flexible the permissions protocol is, the less important it is to tie an identity to any single key.</p><p>We should also expect a lot of innovation from the developer ecosystem in the area of permissioning writes and reads within the network. We’re already seeing experimentation along these lines with programmatic permissions protocols. Examples include hosted custodial agents or “personal data managers” or something like “credit bureaus” for managing permissions for users’ data. We should encourage all kinds of diversity, especially early on.</p> Fast, Expressive, Network-Wide Queries <p>Whenever a user logs into an application with their wallet, that application needs to gather data about that user from the Dataverse. When an application wants to fetch a single state that they already somehow know the identifier of—that’s easy. But application developers need much more data retrieval capability than fetching content using its specific machine-readable identifier.</p><p>When this application is multi-player, such as a social network, developers need to gather data sets from across users to display in one interface. This type of data retrieval functionality is core to almost any application, and is especially core to the ones that are most valuable to the data ecosystem as a whole. When the identifiers of the users are known, this can be done by looking at each user’s index of their data that exists in the Dataverse and then pulling in that data. This supposes the existence of a protocol for such a user-centric index, whether physically stored as a single list somewhere in the Dataverse, or maintained using metadata and an indexing service.</p><p>Applications, however, don’t always have the full picture about a user—a wallet address alone doesn't tell the full story. Context can be gained by looking at the broader social graph of communities where the user participated in or rankings in games.</p><p>Developers who build on Ceramic will have the ability to use indexing and querying to pull in opt-in data from users in other apps in the Ceramic ecosystem.</p><p>Ceramic will soon offer a graph database that will enable developers to explore those ties from any of their user's accounts to a stream of data, e.g. all blog posts. But in further iterations, Ceramic will allow relationships between any account, model, and data stream related to model. This will allow infinitely complex queries across the Dataverse.</p> Open Marketplace of Data Models <p>The Dataverse demands interoperability. This is achieved with emergent consensus on data models. Data models on Ceramic are similar to ERC contract standards in Ethereum—e.g. ERC20 for tokens, ERC721 for NFTs—which are basically the equivalent of features for Ceramic. This makes it easy for any developer to just choose from a pre-existing set of feature templates, add a few lines of code to their frontend, and have an app that can access all data sets in the Dataverse that also conform to the same data model.</p><p>The community can build out and curate the biggest universe of data models in the world. The most powerful way to create enough good standards for this to become a vibrant marketplace is by giving the community ownership and upside.</p> Developer Community <p>The Dataverse is owned by no one, and everyone. It’s the output of a community all working toward building creative, networked applications that result in creating a valuable resource for the world. This big project can only be successful if there is a large, engaged community behind it.</p><p>Community members can help with building out the developer tooling and stack ecosystem, growth and influencing, creating educational content, network operations, etc. We have to deliberately consider the incentives of all ecosystem participants so we can maximally deploy this community for good.</p> Path Forward <p>We will start by focusing on delivering data-rich application capabilities to advanced Web3 developers building in highly-networked application ecosystems using data models—the market and use cases most primed for Ceramic. Each phase will look to the previous for a signal on what infrastructure to use and how to build, that’s why full focus on today’s innovators is so important.</p> Unmet Needs of Web3 Developers <p>The Metaverse is emerging from the foundation paved by blockchain; it possesses all the right conditions mentioned earlier to make it a flourishing, vibrant interoperable application ecosystem. Web3 developers are already building applications on blockchain, and a lot of them are looking to differentiate and mature their product by expanding into data.</p> Reputation Features <p>Reputation features are needed across many different Web3 multi-player applications, decentralized protocols, social communities, and span everything from a profile, to assets I can prove to own (NFTs, domain names, social handles), to experience (self-asserted and attested skills trees), to contribution tracking, to KYC VCs (verifiable credentials).</p><p>Some of these use cases include VCs, many do not. Within this set, Ceramic can serve public and ephemerally private data use cases. Fully private use cases should be stored encrypted on an access-controlled server that ideally uses IPLD and CACAO so it can natively interoperate with the data on Ceramic—something like Kepler from Spruce Systems.</p><p>Over the longer term, this collection of data sets will function like one’s identity and passport within the Metaverse. The stakes are high. For example, the future of DeFi is very much in flux until reputation and credentials are figured out.</p> Social Features <p>Social is very hot now in Web3 and a lot of momentum is building around the decentralized social graph and decentralized social media. We see an expansion of the traction and experiments from Orbis, Convo, and CyberConnect, into different iterations and experimentations. These may come in the form of full-blown decentralized social networks, or social features embedded within other applications. Expect social graphs, feeds and posts (blogs, microblogs, etc), reactions, private and public groups, DMs, forums, address books.</p> Account Features <p>Many applications and protocols are asking themselves how to identify a user when they have many different wallets or accounts. This is becoming more important for Web3 applications that are integrating more and more Metaverse protocols into a single application. Maintaining that user object with all the mappings becomes cumbersome and is extremely prone to implementation error. There are a certain set of data features that can be explored for different models of creating an aggregated identity for users in the multi-account, cross-chain (MACC) Metaverse.</p> The Best Has Yet to Come <p>The best has yet to come for the internet. The Metaverse will be the biggest breakthrough in application development over the last 25 years, and it will replace the cloud as the application environment of choice.</p><p>In order to unlock the full potential of the Dataverse, there needs to be interoperability. This type of composable, interoperable data network will be the catalyst for a new wave of innovation that not only reshapes the way we build applications but also how we share knowledge, invent science, and progress as a society. This is the world we are building toward with Ceramic.</p><p>To start building with Ceramic, check out our<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/getting-started-with-ceramic/"> guide</a> or join the<a href="https://chat.ceramic.network/"> Discord</a>!</p>

 Our easy-to-repeat workshop for The Badge Summit&nbsp;2022! <p>In early August 2022, at <a href="https://thebadgesummit.com">The Badge Summit</a>, we’re <a href="https://badgesummit22.sched.com/event/13q6M/dream-makers-lounge-keep-badges-weird-helping-people-understand-the-badges-landscape?iframe=yes&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no">running a workshop</a> related to <a href="https://badges.community">Keep Badges Weird</a>. This is an emerging Community of Practice exploring the badges landscape and helping people understand that badges are more than just credentials.</p><p>In this session, we’re using an organising metaphor of co-creating pizza toppings to delve into how to design an equitable, emergent badge system that works for Communities of Practice. We want the session to be accessible to those who can’t make it to Boulder, Colorado for The Badge Summit, and so created this resource for them to be able to participate remotely!</p><p>You may find this resource useful as a starting point for workshops you run. The aim is to create an inclusive, welcoming space to help people move beyond individual badges as credentials, and towards a system of <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>.</p><p>This resource is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) licence</a>, as is the accompanying <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gxuBP7oZbphwgkYWX0VMEWoS3xg_DpHIrJiAUbhmLHI/edit">slide deck</a> (apart from Bryan Mathers’ images, which are <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC BY-ND</a>). We encourage you to remix these resources for your own purposes!</p> Aims of the&nbsp;workshop <p>By the end of the session, participants should be able&nbsp;to:</p>  Explain the difference between credentialing and recognition  Demonstrate the hallmarks of an inclusive badge system for Communities of&nbsp;Practice  Reflect on their own assumptions and experience using the pizza&nbsp;metaphor   Check in &amp; Intro (15&nbsp;min) <p>To break the ice, and to encourage participants to ‘lean forward’ rather than ‘lean back’ as the session begins, start with a question. Turning to the person sitting next to them*, participants should discuss and answer the following question&nbsp;prompts:</p>  If you really knew me you know&nbsp;that….  If you could learn any skill, what would it&nbsp;be?  What is one of the nicest things a person has done for&nbsp;you?  <p>The aim of this part of the session is to allow those who arrive slightly late not to feel like an inconvenience, to get people talking, and to create a welcoming atmosphere.</p><p>As the facilitator, indicate when time is up, and get people to share out either their own answers to the question, or other people’s that they found interesting.</p><p>Then introduce yourself and other facilitators, and go on to explain that this session is about Communities of Practice, systems of Open Badges, and Open Recognition. Go through a couple of slides explaining what Open Recognition is using images and the definition:</p><blockquote>“Open Recognition is the awareness and appreciation of talents, skills and aspirations in ways that go beyond credentialing. This includes recognising the rights of individuals, communities, and territories to apply their own labels and definitions. Their frameworks may be emergent and/or implicit.” (<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">What is Open Recognition, anyway?</a>)</blockquote><p>Explain that we’re going to use metaphors, and in particular a pizza metaphor to help people gently leave their comfort zone and examine their practice from a different perspective.</p><p>*if you are running this session remotely, the facilitator should put people into breakout rooms of three rather than two, to help participants feel&nbsp;safe.</p> Make a Pizza (20&nbsp;min) <p>Encourage participants to get into groups of four.* You and your 3 friends are having a pizza together. Don’t overthink just make one. How is it going to look? Either provide your own paper-based materials, or use <a href="https://app.mural.co/template/e8f6ec36-13f4-4599-89bb-d6a3e83354a6/c3848ce8-f372-4cbc-b79d-1e043e363bd2">this Mural board as a template</a> to co-create your&nbsp;pizza!</p><p>Once participants have created their pizzas, bring the room back together and have a look at them together. Ask why they created them this way. Answers will range from taste preferences, to dividing out the pizza&nbsp;equally.</p><p>Reflect that in order to build the pizza together, the groups needed to talk about individual needs, work together and design a solution. Explain that they were a Community of Practice in Pizza building!</p><p>Show participants the slides demonstrating linear, cluster, and freeform ways of laying out pizza ingredients. Make the point that none of them designed linear pizza toppings, so why design linear badge systems? Make the point that in a Community of Practice the co-creation of a badge system helps decentralise power by giving community members a seat at the&nbsp;table.</p><p>Reiterate that working together allowed them as individuals to integrate their personal needs and expectations into the pizza. Make the point that some people needed a particular topping, while others may have been willing to sacrifice their preference for the good of the&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Explain that if we understand the ingredients as a metaphor for different types of badges, then an useful, inclusive, successful badge system includes all kinds of elements: membership, participation, capability, and&nbsp;mastery.</p><p>Take questions, but remind them that this is just a metaphor and therefore being used to illustrate a point about keeping badge (systems) weird! Show other metaphors, such as stepping stones, Trivial Pursuit segments, and constellations of&nbsp;stars.</p><p>*if you are running this session remotely, you can either put people back into their groups of three, or re-create the rooms to be groups of&nbsp;four.</p> Discussion: Open Recognition Pathways Pizza (15&nbsp;mins) <p>Ask participants to return to discuss in their groups* what kind of metaphors they might use to help one another, and their colleagues, understand the importance of recognition as well as credentialing.</p>  How could they change some of their current practices to include Open Recognition?  How could they make co-designing badge systems more inclusive?  How could they ensure badge systems are emergent within their Communities of Practice?  <p>After 10 minutes of discussion, allow participants to come back and share one thing they’ve learned back to the wider group. Allow people to respond to other people’s points if it’s useful for the majority of people in the&nbsp;room.</p><p>*if you are running this session remotely, put people back in their breakout room for this activity.</p> Wrap-up and next steps (10&nbsp;mins) <p>Finally, invite people to continue the conversation by showing ways they can get involved in the <a href="https://badges.community">Keep Badges Weird community</a>. Show badges that can be earned through membership and participation in the community, as well as for levelling up skills and knowledge around Communities of Practice and Open&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>If you’ve already prepared it, allow participants to claim their “I Kept Badges Weird at X” badge, either using a claim code, or by issuing the badge using their email address. You can download image files to edit to create your own version of the badge from this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iDrX5_APJ-glMDahziKVB_9YLJOfGU79?usp=sharing">Google Drive&nbsp;folder</a>.</p><p>Stick around to chat to people who might be super-enthused by the ideas stimulated during the workshop, and provide easy ways to keep in touch. Congratulations, you’re done!

To help with context, I offered my perspective on some emerging trends in the form of a&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2022/07/15/leading-the-digital-trust-conversation/">Q&amp;A here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been blessed with quite simply an extraordinary array of speakers bringing their expertise and experience from their respective backgrounds and perspectives. We have been privileged to have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rikiconsultancy.co.nz/">Janelle Riki-Waaka</a>&nbsp;Chair the conference whose deep understanding of te ao Māori and its application to digital trust is unassailable. She is supported by a diverse cross section of experts from the public and private sectors. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/minister/biography/david-clark">Hon Dr David Clark</a>&nbsp;follows the Chair’s opening remarks, and we will be listening for any insights regarding the range of legislation proposed under his watch, the most important of those to us at&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">Digital Identity NZ</a>&nbsp;being the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/whole.html#LMS459679">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Bill</a>&nbsp;which has entered its Second Reading.&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrustsummit.co.nz/speaker/tamara-al-salim/">Tamara Al Salim</a>&nbsp;from NZDF (also Women in Identity’s New Zealand&nbsp;country ambassador) is next with the Opening Keynote – Trust in the Aotearoa context – followed by two panels playing forward the Trust theme inwards to developing more domestic capability and outwards to ask the question ‘Is Trust an exportable asset?’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discussion over lunch however is bound to revolve around globally acclaimed UK speaker David Birch and his take on that amorphous concept, the Metaverse and whether Identity has anything to do with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dave is joined at the event by an Australian trio of speakers each with very different perspectives. Internationally acknowledged identerati aficionado&nbsp;<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/">Steve Wilson</a>, will beam in with his view into the future as to how all the ‘infostructural’ pieces might fit together, while Gold Sponsor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.okta.com/au/">Okta’s</a>&nbsp;April George will offer practical tips for implementing Zero Trust in organisations large and small. From the public sector across the Tasman, we are looking forward to an update from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/our-projects/digital-identity">DTA</a>&nbsp;on the operationally more advanced but legislatively further behind Australian equivalent to New Zealand’s DISTF – the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/tdif#:~:text=Trusted%20Digital%20Identity%20Framework%20The%20Trusted%20Digital%20Identity,templates%20to%20support%20providers%20to%20meet%20TDIF%20requirements.">TDIF</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Australian showings will be more than matched by the locals. Silver Sponsor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/">NEC NZ</a>&nbsp;co-presenters Steven Graham and Graham Prentice will focus on current best practice, specifically in the field of Biometrics, followed by Lightning Rounds from Kiwi startups<a href="https://frankly.ai/">&nbsp;FranklyAI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://jnctn.nz/">JNCTN</a>, while&nbsp;<a href="https://ahau.io/">Ahau’s</a>&nbsp;Kaye-Maree Dunn will provide perspectives on the user as the key stakeholder. The finale will feature representatives from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dia.govt.nz/For-people-and-businesses">DIA</a>&nbsp;leaving us with plenty to think about over drinks regarding the role of standards as the ultimate connector in this Hui’s range of topics alongside&nbsp;DIA’s overall reflections.</p>



<p>There’s audience participation planned too. To help the digestion of lunch, an hour’s Roundtable Discussion will begin the afternoon sessions, where delegates choose two topics from a range of options and meet with like-minded individuals, moderated by a Hui speaker or panellist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All up, the Hui Tumata is set to be insightful and thought-provoking, guaranteeing that delegates come away more informed and knowledgeable.&nbsp; See you there!</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi nui,</p>

<p>Since Verite’s original release, we’ve gotten feedback from development partners and the broader community about which patterns are useful and where guidance could be improved. Some themes include:</p>  Persistence of verification results to on-chain registries is over-emphasized.  Verite’s current <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/verification-flow">verification flow documentation</a> assumes that Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are stored in wallets that support decentralized identity protocols, which are currently somewhat scarce in the market.  <p>Upcoming Verite releases (including code and documentation) will address these concerns as follows:</p>  A forthcoming editorial revision of Verite documentation will explicitly describe a variant of the subject-submission patterns without any on-chain persistence.  A coming release will include code and documentation demonstrating how more of today’s wallets can participate in VC flows in a standardized way, until DIDs become more common.  <p>In this two-part blog series, we’ll preview these updates. This post (Part 1) includes an overview of options for the use of off-chain VCs to support on-chain decision-making, including subject-submission without on-chain persistence. This begins with a summary of core concepts and principles of Verite. Readers already familiar can skip ahead to the "Two Phases of Verification" section for an overview of the new flow being added to the Verite docs and pioneered by Circle’s implementation. After this new end-to-end pattern for Verite is outlined, a more analytical "Discussion" section follows.</p><p>The second post in the series will zoom in on how wallets that do not currently support sufficient functionality for emerging decentralized identity patterns can be "retrofitted” and supplemented to support Verite’s off-chain verifications like those described in this post.</p> Verification Concepts <p>If you’re new to Verite, or want a reminder, this section describes how Verite credential verification works off-chain to support smart contracts with maximum privacy around sensitive identifying information.</p> Roles<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The following entities are involved in the Verite credential verification process:</p>  Crypto wallet: aka "payment wallet”, controls a blockchain address; may be browser or mobile, hosted or self-hosted.  Credential wallet: aka "identity wallet”, stores and shares VCs, controls a "DID” (meta-wallet identifier). Some or all of these functional roles may be subsumed into a crypto wallet or a trusted dapp, or this entity may be completely distinct software, depending on flow and trust model.  Verifier: aka the "verifier service” or "verifier endpoint” that consumes a privacy-preserving, off-chain token (a verifiable credential) on behalf of a dApp. It can be operated by the dApp or a trusted partner but in either case it needs to be previously known to and trusted by the dApp at a static address.  dApp: decides which verifiers to trust; the dApp frontend is responsible for triggering the verification process; the dApp backend is responsible for on-chain validation  On-chain verification registry (optional): depending on the implementation choices, dApps may rely on on-chain storage of verification results. This may be part of the dApp or a separate registry accessible by other parties. For simplicity, we’ll assume the former case in this blog.   Verification Result<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>A Verification Result enables a "verified” crypto wallet – that is, a wallet whose controller has proven possession of a valid VC that has passed a dApp-trusted-verifier’s verification process – to interact on-chain.</p><p>You can think of a Verification Result as the result of slicing and dicing a VC, potentially obfuscated, with an attached proof from the Verifier. The Verification Result structure in Verite’s reference implementation includes the following fields, returned along with the Verifier’s cryptographic signature:</p>  subject: identifies the wallet address  schema: indicates the kind of credential (flexible according to the implementation)  expiration: a number that is less than or equal to the expiration value in the VC.  <p>The Verification Result may be extended to include additional fields, which could be carried over identically or fuzzed/obfuscated in some way (which is especially relevant if using on-chain storage).</p>   <code>export type VerificationResult = {<br>  schema: string<br>  subject: string  // address<br>  expiration: number<br>}<br></code>      Verifier vs Subject Submission<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Verite’s implementation demonstrates two possible methods of submitting Verification Results to smart contracts; or in other words:</p>  Verifier-submitted: the verifier submits the Verification Result and signature directly to the smart contract immediately after verification.  Subject-submitted: the verifier returns the Verification Result and signature to the subject (or an entity or code acting on the subject’s behalf) who then submits the signed Verification Result to the smart contract.   Verification Principles <p>While verifications can be carried out using a variety of methods, all are expected conform to the following principles:</p>  Trusted issuer principle: the credential was issued by one of a list of trusted issuers.  Credential ownership principle: The crypto wallet that owns (i.e. can prove themselves to be the subject of) the credential is the one making the DeFi transaction request, regardless of whether the credential itself is held and presented by a separate piece of hardware (i.e. whether the credential wallet and the crypto wallet are distinct)  Trusted verifier principle: The verifier that provides verification is on the allowlist of verifiers already trusted by the dApp.  <p>The fact that all Verified Credentials are signed by their self-identifying issuers makes the first criteria simple: issuers’ public keys can be obtained from the identifiers listed in a registry of trusted issuers, and their signatures can be checked against them at verification time. In this way, the verifier enforces the trusted issuer principle.</p><p>DApps, in turn, uphold the trusted verifier principle, deciding which verifiers they trust to verify VCs – including standard VCs checks (non-revocation, tamper-free) and any other fitness-for-purpose checks (such as subsetting valid Verite credentials according to additional constraints on issuers or <a href="https://verite.id/blog/crossfunctionationality">KYC processes</a>).</p><p>Enforcement of the credential ownership principle will vary depending on how the crypto wallet relates to the credential wallet. In this post, we’ll describe how this works with a distinct decentralized identity wallet controlled by the same actor as a crypto wallet; in the next, we’ll describe how crypto-wallets-only actors may be accommodated.</p> Two Phases of Verification <p>Verite’s <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/smart-contract-verite">Smart Contract Patterns</a> documentation describes the two-phase process of how smart contracts can require successful verification of VCs. To summarize:</p>  Phase 1: "Off-chain” verification by a verifier, based on traditional web or API stacks, resulting in a lightweight "Verification Result” object.  Phase 2: On-chain validation of the Verification Result, which is optionally persisted on-chain in private, obfuscated, or opaque form referred to as a "Verification Record”.  <p></p><p>The two-phase process enables the use of VCs with chain-based applications for which verification operations are not technically possible and/or economically practical. More importantly, this reduces (by construction) the amount of potentially sensitive data sent on-chain. All examples that follow will refer to main-net Ethereum, but all these patterns should be replicable on all major chains, availing themselves of further privacy or obfuscation techniques where supported.</p><p>The subsequent sections discuss these phases and variations. This first post in the two-part series assumes a decentralized identity wallet, and the next will cover other options.</p> Phase 1: Off-chain Verification <p>Assuming a Decentralized Identity+Crypto Wallet</p><p></p>  <p>The wallet initiates a DeFi transaction with a dApp.</p>  <p>The dApp (frontend) chooses a trusted verifier to start the verification process.</p>  <p>The verifier responds to the wallet, telling it how to start the process<a>1</a> through the dApp.</p>  <p>The wallet chooses one of the credentials stored locally and submits it to the verifier.</p>  <p>The verifier confirmed the credential’s signature and the validity of its contents. The dApp retrieves (via callback or polling) confirmation.</p>  <p>DApp unlocks the subsequent DeFi transaction flow.</p>   Ownership verification<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In step 4, when the wallet submits the credential, the wallet wraps the VC with a Verifiable Presentation (VP) and signs it. When the verifier receives the credential, it uses the Decentralized Identifier (DID) – for example, <code>did:key:&lt;public_key&gt;</code><a>2</a> – listed as <code>holder</code> in the VP to verify the JWT’s signature (made from the corresponding private key). It also compares this DID in the VP with the DID listed as <code>credentialSubject.id</code> in the VC, i.e. the public key that the credential was issued against. Those two checks guarantee the wallet, submitting the credentials, was the same wallet that the issuer intended, and thus rightly owns it.</p> Phase 2: Validation and use in smart contracts <p>The second phase of verification covers how a Verification Result gets used as a prerequisite to on-chain interaction.</p> Validating a Verification Result<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>Along with a verification result, a smart contract will receive a signature on the result, allowing them to confirm that the result was provided by an authorized party, as described <a href="https://verite.id/verite/patterns/smart-contract-verite#verification-results">here</a>.</p> On-chain storage of Verification Results (or not)<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>We’ll look at 3 cases below. With the verifier-submitted pattern, the verifier always stores the Verification Result on-chain. With subject-submission, the Verification Result may or may not be stored on-chain, depending on the implementation.</p> Case 1: Verifier-submitted verification result, stored on-chain<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>With the verifier-submitted approach, the verifier stores the Verification Result on-chain after verification.</p><p>We’ll cover step 1.5 later; this is relevant for subsequent interactions with a dApp when on-chain storage is used.</p><p></p> Case 2: Subject-submitted verification result, stored on-chain<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The subject-submitted approach also supports persistence, as determined by the implementor. Like the verifier-submitted case, in subsequent interactions, the dApp will be able to determine that the wallet is already registered.</p><p>We’ll cover step 1.5 later; this is relevant for subsequent interactions with a dApp when on-chain storage is used.</p><p></p> Case 3: Subject-submitted verification result, off-chain<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>If the Verification Result is not persisted on-chain, then every interaction of the wallet with the contract will be associated with a fresh, unique Verification Result.</p><p></p> Subsequent interactions <p>Assuming the implementation is using on-chain storage, after the phases 1 &amp; 2 (plus on-chain storage) are completed, then on subsequent interactions, a dApp could check the registry to confirm the wallet/address is already approved, avoiding the need to re-verify the VC. The dApp backend (or registry, if separate) can simply check that <code>msg.sender</code> is in the set of registered addresses.</p><p></p><p>Without on-chain storage, in general the VC would be re-verified<a>3</a> each time (as shown in the diagram in Case 3), and the verification result submitted along with the transaction. Since verification is off-chain (and generally fast/inexpensive, depending on the provider), and since this avoids on-chain storage of potentially correlatable data, this is often the preferred solution.</p> Discussion  On-chain Storage Considerations<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>The on-chain storage patterns have implications that require careful consideration:</p>  On-chain persistence of any potentially identifiable (or re-identifiable) data should be avoided. If on-chain persistence is used, it is up to the design of a particular implementation to manage that smart contract’s access rights and obfuscation mechanisms to minimize privacy risks.  The verifier-submitted pattern, in its current form, assumes the verifier’s willingness to pay transaction fees (e.g. "gas fees”, in EVM systems).  The verifier-submitted pattern includes an obligation that the verifier update the on-chain state corresponding to revoked credentials.  In general, this may not be the most cost-effective option.  <p>There are optimizations – in the Verite open source, the Verification Registry may be used among multiple contracts, and <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0xFd283fBb301f332A94969f629E1832824DEA3684/IFYyHg6OUQVj4QurIOOpVvHHBWaC1cJzdI6B4OU15WM">proposed improvements enable further reuse through proxies</a>. These are all possible for implementations; Verite’s open source repositories are intended as example implementations, and not as normative guidance.</p><p>However, we think it’s important to draw attention to off-chain options, as it has a profile of privacy characteristics we find favorable in many use-cases. This is one of the reasons we’re increasingly demonstrating this option, as seen in the <a href="https://verite.id/blog/NFT-allowlists-with-verifiable-credentials-and-verite">off-chain NFT allowlist</a>.</p> Circle’s Implementation Choices<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>It was not necessary to write the verification results to on-chain storage in Circle’s implementation. The advantages of flushing to chains include the avoidance of repeated verification for the same wallets. However, the advantages do not always outweigh the drawbacks:</p>  Short TTL is required for verification because a user's KYC status could change.  Chain writers must pay a gas fee.  <p>As a result, Circle chose and suggests other implementers also choose this approach: do not write verification results into chains unless there is a substantial efficiency gain, i.e., if many transactions will be authorized by the average on-chain write operations.</p><p>Since Circle’s architecture is optimized for delivering verification reliably and simply to dApps, we choose to explain the design choices we’ve made from the perspective of the verification process, where valid Verifiable Credentials get communicated to smart-contracts powering dApps.</p> Up Next<a title="Direct link to heading">​</a> <p>In the following post, we’ll describe options for wallets that don’t understand Decentralized Identity protocols to participate in VC exchanges, while conforming to the verification principles above.</p><p>The Verite core team is grateful to Circle’s Verite engineers Tao Tao, Daniel Lim, and Fei Niu for taking the lead on this exciting work!</p>    Crucially, this includes not just the usual redirections and tokens but also an artifact called a "Presentation Submission" object which describes the credentials that a given verifier will accept. This enables wallets to “pre-select” appropriate credentials to the end-user, in the case of a full wallet.<a>↩</a>  An "onchain DID" (decentralized identifier) scheme such as did:ion can be used here if the wallet controls such an identifier– this is basically a user-controlled indirection, which allows user-initiated rotations and even migration to a new wallet. In an end-to-end system, however, this indirection is optional, because the verifier has access to the issuance records, and can simply use a public key in both places since they are opaque to any other audience.<a>↩</a>  The verite reference implementation avoids resubmission of the same verification results / signature to avoid replays<a>↩</a>

<p>The specification defines a RESTful web services interface for the management of architectural resources and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks, requirements or test cases.</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 11 July 2022:</p>



<p>OSLC Architecture Management Version 3.0<br>OASIS Standard<br>11 July 2022</p>



<p>OSLC Architecture Management defines a RESTful web services interface for the management of architectural resources and relationships between those and related resources such as product change requests, activities, tasks, requirements or test cases. To support these scenarios, the specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, as well as HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.</p>



<p>The specification is part of a broader set of OSLC specifications that are part of the OSLC-OP project.

<p>Back to our Developer Showcase Series to learn what developers in the real world are doing with Hyperledger technologies. Next up is Daniel Bluhm, Software Engineer at <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>. </p>



<p>Give a bit of background on what you’re working on and how you got into blockchain</p>



<p>I am currently working on Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent – Python and other agent implementations. I spend most of my days working on agents and protocols. I first got into blockchain at the Sovrin Foundation where I got my start as an associate software engineer. I was actually around at the founding of the agent ecosystem, back when we all collaborated in the Hyperledger Indy Agent Working Group. I was one of the first implementers and continued working with it as the community grew. Eventually it snowballed into the Hyperledger Aries project.</p>



<p>What Hyperledger frameworks or tools are you using in your projects? Any new developments to share? Can you sum up your experience with Hyperledger?</p>



<p>I really like where things are going with the Aries Cloud Agent – Python repo, driving towards more pluggability and making it so we can extend functionality without changing the core project itself. I am also excited to get did:indy method support into Hyperledger Indy, as well as multi-ledger support in ACA-Py.We already have reads down, so now we’re just working on the writes.</p>



<p>What do you think is most important for Hyperledger to focus on in the next year?</p>



<p>We have a really diverse and thriving community in the Hyperledger Aries space; what we really need going into 2022 is a push for greater adoption of the technology and getting it into the hands of people who aren’t engineers. I would also really like to see a focus on encouraging more interaction with the Hyperledger Indy project, especially after seeing how positively this affects our work with Hyperledger Aries.</p>



<p>What advice would you offer other technologists or developers interested in getting started working on blockchain?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest piece of advice I could give is to not be afraid to step in, contribute, and break stuff. It doesn’t matter if your pull request isn’t perfect.The maintainers of the project will work with you to get it right.</p>



<p>As Hyperledger’s projects continue to mature, what do you see as the most interesting technologies, apps, or use cases coming out as a result?</p>



<p>The technologies that are most interesting to me are the ones that allow us to use multiple different technologies at the same time – which is exactly what we’re striving for in Hyperledger Aries. This enables us to take advantage of the strengths of one technology – be it blockchain, communication, protocol, crypto suite, or something else – and use those strengths to shore up the places where another technology might fall short. Beyond that, anything that makes it easier and more efficient for the end user will be a huge step in the right direction.</p>



<p>What’s the one issue or problem you hope blockchain can solve?</p>



<p>The biggest problem that I would like to see blockchain solve is power imbalances. This applies across the board, to finance, representation in government, data used and collected by big orgs, and other scenarios we just haven’t thought up yet. I’d like to see blockchain enable individuals to have a say in how they are treated and be more self-deterministic – they should have at least some level of control over what’s running their lives.</p>



<p>Where do you hope to see Hyperledger and/or blockchain in five years?</p>



<p>I would like to see Hyperledger and blockchain technology in general in the hands of real people. They don’t necessarily need to be aware that they are using a blockchain. In fact, I think there are some really good arguments to the contrary. But it should be a positive influence in their lives as it is used day to day. I would like to see the blockchain space settle down, drop some of the hype, and just be used for what it’s good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the best piece of developer advice you’ve ever received?</p>



<p>No one gets it right on the first try. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes, break tests, crash CI/CD pipelines, or push broken code. Don’t do it intentionally, of course, but the faster you can get at shortening the “experience a failure, find the problem, implement the fix” cycle, the faster you’ll learn and master your code. In short, don’t be afraid to break stuff. Just give it a shot and learn from the result.</p>



<p>When a problem or change needs to be made in the future, the developer then can see what your thought processes were for writing the code you did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What technology could you not live without?</p>



<p>I could not live without Git. Without it it would be nearly impossible to get any code written and submitted. It’s part of my everyday workflow and even crucial in my hobby projects.</p>

<p>Co-Chairs – Wenjing Chu of Futurewei and Vikas Malhotra of WOPLLI Technologies</p>







<p>Trust over IP foundation (<a href="http://www.trustoverip.org">www.trustoverip.org</a>) is forming a new task force on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Metaverse (AIM for short), under its Technology Stack working group. The mission of this new task force is to complete a ToIP Recommendation for the ToIP community to address opportunities and challenges brought on by advances in AI, Metaverse and related technologies in relation to ToIP’s mission of creating interoperable trust over the Internet.</p>







<p>In one aspect, AI technologies may break the traditional assumptions of digital systems design, even most of the SSI systems or other decentralized systems. In another aspect, AR/VR/XR/Metaverse, combined with AI, may fundamentally alter/blur/erase the boundaries between digital and the real world. After all, our face is our identity, whether we choose it or not, and anyone can create that implied identity without our permission or even knowledge. Once it is in a system, it has a life of its own. How do we find what is real from fake and establish Trust? It is something missing today but critically important if we want our solutions to be useful in the next 5-10 years.</p>


 
 


<p>Metaverse and Web 3.0 are two intertwined drivers in pushing many Trust related issues and technologies to the forefront of defining what is the next internet or the next web. &nbsp;AI technology raises critical ethical issues with regard to how we think about trust over the internet, e.g. fairness, privacy and accountability. All these aspects, and more generally, AI ethics and harm prevention, point to the importance and relevance of the intersection between Trust and AI.</p>



<p>Many additional topics have to be explored, including Trustworthiness of data, how the AIs work with each other, how does a person determine trustworthiness of AI “on the fly’, potential of harms caused to a person with increased surveillance in Metaverse environments etc.</p>



<p>The task force plans to carry out its work in two phases below –</p>



  Phase 1: Survey and White Paper  Phase 2: Recommendation and/or White Paper  







<p>More details are available at<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19657312"> AI &amp; Metaverse Technology Task Force – Home – Confluence (trustoverip.org)</a>.

 What is the Verifier Universal Interface (VUI)? 
<p>Originally funded by <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/essif-lab/">eSSIF-Lab</a>, a project funded by the European Commission within the <a href="https://www.ngi.eu">Next Generation Internet (NGI) Program</a>, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/vui/">Verifier Universal Interface (VUI) initiative</a> aims to build a set of standard APIs to enable interoperability between ID Wallets and Verifier components. After months of hard work and collaboration, the VUI work has been successfully donated to DIF with the goal of furthering its evolution and reach to the international community.</p>
<p>As different technology providers build SSI solutions, it becomes critical to ensure interoperability between these solutions. Available standards for SSI still have important gaps, leading us to an ecosystem of full-stack providers whose approach to interoperability is building proprietary plug-ins for each one of the other available solutions. This approach to interoperability is not scalable, the underlying problem being that building standards takes time. For this reason a practical and focused approach was proposed to enable scalable interoperability in the SSI community: a role-centric approach to standardization at the API level.</p>
<p>The VUI working group, led by <a href="https://gataca.io/">GATACA</a> and composed of 12 SSI organizations, identified a minimum set of 6 APIs to offer an end-to-end credential verification flow.</p>
 
 DID resolution 
 Status resolution 
 Data agreements 
 Presentation exchange 
 Issuer resolution 
 Schema resolution 
 
<p>Since both DID Registry &amp; Status resolution APIs have advanced pre-defined work, VUI set out to build a team to work on the remaining interfaces.</p>
<p>In just one year, the working group has been able to define APIs for Data Agreements, Presentation Exchange, and Issuer Resolution.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the delivery for the Presentation Exchange API was an extension of the existing work based on WACI. As for the remaining API, Schema resolution, future work of VUI will involve its definition as it is only one without a definition proposal or an existing normative reference.</p>
 Results 
<p>The results of these efforts include <a href="https://identity.foundation/vui/">API specifications</a> built on ReSpec, API swaggers, and an open-source library that organizations can use to easily implement these APIs. Below are some details of each Working Package.</p>
 Data Agreements 
<p>In current SSI architectures, there is little to no support for data agreements, also known as consent management, on the usage of Verifiable Credentials. On one hand, there was some groundwork done by<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">  Kantara</a> on a generic<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-consent-receipts">  Consent Receipts</a> specification that could apply to any digital service, yet in the context of SSI frameworks, the only progress made were proprietary implementations of consent mechanisms, such as GATACA's Verifiable Consent; but no proposal had received major adherence. Due to the standardization gap, the<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-data-agreement">  Automated Data Agreement</a> (ADA) project was created under the EssifLab organization and led by<a href="http://igrant.io/">  iGrant.io</a> and builds upon Kantara<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-consent-receipts">  Consent Receipts</a> to allow data privacy mechanisms to be enforced in the framework of Hyperledger Aries. Given the strong alignment with the Consent Management API defined at VUI, both teams decided to join forces into one single initiative.</p>
<p>Now, the VUI Data Agreement sub-ReSpec proposes a specific Data Model to manage data agreements, built upon both<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-data-agreement">  Automated Data Agreements</a> and Kantara<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-consent-receipts">  Consent Receipts</a>. It also defines a basic protocol and the mechanisms to embed it inside a<a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/vui/dataAgreements#dfn-dif-presentation-exchange">  Presentation Exchange</a>, which could be supported by multiple exchange standards.</p>
 Presentation Exchange 
<p>There are multiple known and adopted technology solutions or standards focused on the presentation exchange between a wallet and a verifier, the DIF Presentation Exchange (PE) data model being the most widely accepted. This is because DIF PE is compatible with multiple exchange protocols such as WACI, CHAPI, DID Comm, and DID Siop, making it scalable. To avoid further siloing the standards market by developing another PE data model from scratch, the VUI group believed supporting a successful, pre-existing data model was the best approach and decided to develop an extension of the groundwork done at DIF PE. Our core work consisted of proposing new extension features including:</p>
 
 
<p>Linkage to the data agreement (as mentioned before)</p>
 
 
<p>Mutual authentication (right now, it's performed at the exchange layer protocol), and</p>
 
 
<p>Mechanisms to improve the link between the credential subject and the person managing the wallet.</p>
 
 
 Issuer resolution 
<p>Who should be trusted as an issuer? This is a common, yet challenging question often asked in the online authentication space. In the past, many technology providers have attempted to provide generic solutions such as hardcoded lists in configuration files, API services, Domain name consultations, or Blockchain/DLT registries. In the SSI world, however, it's the Verifier who has the final decision on who he/she will trust to supply valid, verifiable data.</p>
<p>One of the most mature trust frameworks for Issuers has been defined at the<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI">  EBSI/ESSIF</a>  project by the European Commission, which includes a trusted issuer registry designed with a complex governance protocol to determine who can issue which credentials and who can vouch for those issuers.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the VUI team is taking it one step further by designing a generic, platform-agnostic issuer registry approach that is portable across any governance platform. The goal is to offer a generic adaptation compatible not only with EBSI/ESSIF trusted registries, but also with any other trust framework, where the Verifier will just have to build a generic query interface, similar to the Universal DID Resolver, to retrieve the issuers from any platform, and manage them at his preference.</p>

 Next steps 
<p>The VUI initiative has been steadily gaining international traction. In addition to having been donated to the DIF, it was recently mentioned in a<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/canada-eu-joint-workshop-series-enabling-interoperability-and-mutual-support-digital-credentials">  report published by the European Commission (DG Connect) and the Canadian Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, (ISED)</a>, as a key global interoperability approach to explore.</p>
<p>Moving forward VUI can help the SSI community successfully achieve interoperability between Verifiers and Wallets, a necessary step towards mass adoption. DIF's vast community and SSI expertise is precisely what VUI needs to make a tangible global impact.</p>
 Participating in VUI 
<p>The group is always looking for new organizations that can contribute and further these efforts.

<p>Orbis introduces a new social data model where everything is decentralized, composable, easy-to-use, and readily accessible to developers. Developers can use it to build features such as social timelines, comment systems or private messaging on top of their applications, with the underlying Ceramic data infrastructure facilitating performant social experiences for millions of users.</p><p>Orbis’ journey started on Ceramic’s Clay Testnet in December last year. In a few months, Orbis generated more than 70k Ceramic streams and over 20k unique posts. Today, Orbis is launching on Ceramic Mainnet with an improved user experience and opening its SDK to external developers to let anyone build fully decentralized social apps or social features on top of the Orbis architecture.</p><p>The SDK documentation is available <a href="https://orbis.club/developers">here</a> for developers interested in building decentralized social applications: <a href="https://orbis.club/developers">https://orbis.club/developers</a></p> Web3 Social With Web2 Performance <p>Social media’s current model is entering decline as users increasingly question data ownership and how they share value with those platforms. Users face the same trade-off: a great experience that meets their needs, but one that requires giving away their data and time in return. Web3 social promises all of the benefits of digital interaction while preserving a user's ownership of the data and value they create. Orbis offers a solution to this challenge—enabling a Web2 experience with Web3 benefits thanks to Ceramic.</p><blockquote>To reach hundreds of millions of people, Web3 social must be as easy to use as Web2 and shouldn’t introduce a new set of frictions—such a wait times, transaction fees or chain restrictions. This is why we decided to build Orbis on Ceramic, which is by far the best technology for data-intensive decentralized applications.</blockquote><p>Whether it’s DeFi, Gaming, or NFTs, Orbis makes adding social functionality a simple plug-in and lets developers focus on the unique features of their projects. As developers ourselves, we know that we must optimize your time and enable a better social experience for your users. Better still, the composability of Orbis and Ceramic means that the user's social experience can be enriched and extended across platforms. For example, an insightful commenter’s responses to articles can be aggregated into another news platform or a discussion group, rather than being siloed in the original platform or fragmented across many sites.</p><p>With the help of Ceramic’s infrastructure, Orbis:</p>  Creates social experiences with no fees or friction—connecting your wallet on Orbis creates your unique identity on Ceramic; after that, all social interactions automatically attach to this identity without the need for additional signatures  Builds network effects across its social graph to create a persistent user experience across apps—users bring their profile with them  Provides users with a similar performance to their favorite Web2 social experience  Equips developers with easy-to-add social modules to plug into their applications  (Coming soon) Users can join Orbis using different chains such as Cosmos or Solana    Hundreds of Possibilities With Orbis Protocol <p>Orbis protocol will be represented by several collections of modules that developers can use to supercharge their applications. Developers building on Orbis can pick and choose modules as social lego bricks to power many different use cases:</p>  Blockchain games could use the <code>Profile</code> and <code>Direct Message</code> modules to build a fully encrypted and decentralized chat application embedded on their own website  An NFT project developer using the <code>Profile</code> , <code>Context</code>, <code>Posts</code> and <code>Reactions</code> modules can build a simple social feed that aggregates content specific to their project and community  A content platform developer using the <code>Profile</code> , <code>Context</code>, <code>Posts</code> modules can add a fully decentralized commenting system for readers and viewers to discuss and engage with the creator  <p>All of these modules have already been built and are now being used on <a href="http://orbis.club">orbis.club</a>.</p> Unlocking the Power of Ceramic <p>Web3 social must offer the same frictionless user experience as Web2 applications to gain adoption. All while bringing Web3 benefits such as composability, portability and decentralization. This is what Ceramic offers.</p> Orbis Data Specified Using the Ceramic Schemas Feature <p>Imagine if your social interactions could follow composable standards similar to the successful ERC20 or ERC721 specifications. It would allow users to bring and view their data in many different types of applications, as they are doing with NFTs.</p><p>You could send a message to someone using a specific app and have the recipient read it in a completely different application—that's what Orbis does—and since it’s built on Ceramic, developers aren’t constrained to transactions fees or long write times.</p>On Orbis, each action taken by a user is a unique Ceramic stream, following a standardized schema, to allow composable experiences across applications building on top of Orbis. What’s next for Orbis? <p>Orbis will onboard additional providers, in the coming months, allowing users to create their Ceramic identity and Orbis profile using other ecosystems such as Solana or Cosmos.</p><p>The team will also be working very closely with external development teams to help them navigate the Orbis SDK.</p><p>If you're interested in adding a decentralized social layer to your application, or you want to build a fully decentralized and composable social network, we recommend exploring the developer documentation <a href="https://orbis.club/developers">here</a> and to <a href="https://orbis.club/group/kjzl6cwe1jw14ai2gg8e0qmx2j944ppe3s3dgfk003jlb8guuybyg4m77nsrg73/kjzl6cwe1jw145gun3sei0a4puw586yxa614le1tfh434y7quv2wsm0ivhbge7x">join our developer channel</a>.</p><p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Documentation</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

<p>Solution enables EV owners to charge from specific power plants and match their charging session with close to real-time production from renewables</p><p>Zug, Switzerland, and Wolfsburg, Germany, 19 July 2022 — Energy Web, a non-profit building operating systems for energy grids, in collaboration with Volkswagen Group Innovation and Elli, have developed a new smart charging solution enabling EV owners to charge their vehicles with renewable electricity that is matched directly with the vehicle’s real-time electricity consumption.</p><p>The solution relies on “24/7” matching algorithm which optimizes charging to maximize the use of clean, locally sourced electricity and provides users with an unprecedented level of control and granularity over EV charging. Through the solution, users can dictate the date and time of charging, the desired level of charge by the end of their session, what and the renewable energy facility the electricity is drawn&nbsp;from.</p><p>Several VW ID4s were successfully charged with local clean energy consumption, over the span of 3 months. A full array of charging sessions were tested, running from just a couple of hours through to sessions spanning several days. Each time, the platform optimized the charging schedule for maximum clean electricity usage while ensuring the target state of charge at the end of each session. The majority of tests took place near Wolfsburg, Germany, and took advantage of abundant clean energy from wind and solar farms in the surrounding area.</p><p>“This is the first time ever that an electric vehicle has been charged using a verified 24/7-matched clean energy strategy — coming at a time when EV adoption is gathering speed and charging is placing larger demands on electricity grids than ever before”, said Jesse Morris, CEO at Energy Web. “The purpose of this project has been to showcase that advanced EV charging solutions can empower EV owners to set their own preferences for when and where they get their energy. For instance, they can select to charge using wind and solar resources, from energy assets within a 10 km radius, and target 80% charge by 5 pm — all from within a user-friendly application, with an accurate breakdown of their session’s carbon footprint.”</p><p>Volkswagen Group Innovation is currently exploring how the solution can be further developed and rolled out at production scale, ensuring as many EV owners as possible can benefit from the Smart Charging application. With a traceable and secure audit trail for transactions provided on the Energy Web Chain, consumers will be able to show proof of renewable energy purchases, which will in future make it simple for corporate EV fleets to track granular energy usage for carbon accounting.</p><p>The Smart Charging App was developed by integrating Energy Web’s open-source 24/7 toolkit into Elli’s green charging app, which provides users with access to over 300,000 public charging points across Europe. Energy Web released its open-source 24/7 clean energy toolkit <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-shares-open-source-tech-toolkit-for-simplifying-24-7-clean-energy-procurement-41ac2e8225eb">earlier this&nbsp;year</a>.</p><p>You can read the full case study on the Smart Charging App&nbsp;<a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/greenevcharging/">here.</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven non-profit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

<p>Congratulations to W3C on the ratification of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID v1.0</a> as a W3C standard!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Though Blockchain Commons has only lightly touched upon DIDs to date, they nonetheless are a crucial part of our history. In addition, their ratification today as an international standard demonstrates the ability of a cooperative commons to incubate ideas that will eventually be adopted as standards to be used widely by governments, corporations, and individuals.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen began experiments with decentralized identifiers in late 2014 when he built on his previous work as the co-author of the TLS spec by suggesting a <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherA/revocable-self-signed-tls-certificates-hack">hack to TLS</a> that associated X.509 certificates with Bitcoin addresses and then allowed revocation of those certs by spending the Bitcoin. It was a decentralized solution to the centralized problem of certificate authorities. Around the same time, Dave Longley and Manu Sporny were exploring similar ideas around identifiers and decentralization in the <a href="https://web-payments.org/minutes/2014-05-07/">W3C Web Payments Community Group</a>. Then, in 2015, Christopher began work with Drummond Reed and others from Respect Network as part of the XDI Registry Working Group, whose goal was to explore possibilities for a decentralized and rootless registry of identifiers; a strawman was presented at <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/A_Registry_Directory_~_based_on_BLOCKCHAIN_that_is_ROOTless_%26_NOT_Centralized">IIW 21</a>.</p>

<p>That presentation led to interest from Anil John of the Science and Technical Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, who was looking for alternative identifiers to the US Social Security Number that also provided clear differentiation between identifier and authenticator functions. Christopher helped to coordinate a community effort that led to both Drummond Reed at Respect Network and Manu Sporny at Digital Bazaar submitting proposals to the Identity Management and Data Privacy R&amp;D Program. The goal was to show wide community interest in decentralized identity. Not only did both companies receive a grant, but they also both received additional funds through round two of the program.</p>

<p>Much of the community’s support for DIDs then occurred through the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop</a> that Christopher founded in November 2015 to mark the upcoming 25th anniversary of PGP. One of the five papers that were published following that first workshop was the massive <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure paper</a>, which included as one of its design principles that “each principal must be in complete control of their current identifier/public-key binding”, but had not yet settled on questions such as whether decentralized identifiers should be usernames or UUIDs.</p>

<p>DIDs themselves saw their first major workshopping at RWOT 2, which was run in conjunction with the <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/id2020-holds-inaugural-summit-at-the-united-nations-7112014add5e">ID2020 conference</a> at the United Nations in May 2016. Drummond Reed and Les Chasen of Respect Network produced the initial paper on the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/final-documents/requirements-for-dids.pdf">Requirements for DIDs</a>, supported by that US Department of Homeland Security grant. That was also the workshop that brought in Manu Sporny’s work on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, which required an identifier to work with, and so was quickly dovetailed into the project.</p>

<p>Christopher has been constantly involved with the iterations of the DID specification that followed, beginning with the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf">DID Data Model and Generic Syntax Implementer’s Draft 01</a> that was written at RWOT 3 in San Francisco, where he worked with Drummond and Les as well as Ryan Grant. More designs followed across the subsequent Rebooting the Web of Trust events, including a massive DID breakout room at RWOT 5 in Boston, which spent the length of the conference refining the growing spec. Many, many more people contributed to the evolution of the design, among them: Daniel Buchner, who spearheaded Microsoft’s support of DIDs and with Microsoft’s backing created the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF); and Joe Andrieu, who led the work on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID Method Rubric</a>, a way to evaluate DID methods, as well as foundational use cases and engagement models for decentralized identity such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot3-sf/blob/master/final-documents/joram-engagement-model.pdf">Joram</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers document</a>.</p>

<p>As part of his work on the preliminary DID spec, Christopher became one of the co-chairs of the W3C Credentials Community Group alongside Joe Andrieu and Kim Hamilton Duffy. There, he co-authored and co-architected the DID spec to be presented to the W3C. He has also been an invited expert at the DID Working Group since its advent in September 2019. Today, July 19, 2022, that Working Group’s work became a “W3C Recommendation” and thus an official international standard. Our congratulations to DID Working Group chairs Daniel Burnett and Brent Zundel, to DID editors Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, Markus Sabadello, and Drummond Reed, and to everyone who has spent the last seven years working on turning the ideas incubated in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and elsewhere into a real specification that can change the world by giving people control over their digital identifiers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Besides his work on the DID spec itself, Christopher is also one of the architects alongside Kim Hamilton Duffy, Ryan Grant, and Dan Pape, behind <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">the BTCR DID method</a>, which has been dubbed the <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/podcasts/23899/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids-didbtcr">“granddaddy of DIDs”</a>. This DID method anchors decentralized identifiers on the Bitcoin blockchain, very similar to the X.509 cert revocation that Christopher was advocating back in 2014.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons was founded in 2018 to support the ideas and community that came out of Rebooting the Web of Trust. Though Blockchain Commons proper has not published much on DIDs, except as an educational topic for our interns, it continues to be a future focus for us, with the idea of decentralized identifiers being a crucial assumption for our Gordian architecture. Christopher also continues to be an invited expert on Verifiable Credentials 2.0 and has advocated for the DID spec throughout its ratification process. Our expertise with DIDs and with BTCR leaves this all as an open opportunity for Blockchain Commons. If you’ve considered becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor</a> of Blockchain Commons and are interested in DID work, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">drop us a line</a> to discuss the topic!</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that the OriginTrail DKG version 6 is officially feature-locked and about to move to “Stage 2” aimed to launch next week! The DKG ot-node v6 RC1 (Release Candidate 1) is now fully specified, verified and has reached the final stages of software implementation, bringing new features such as UALs, incentivization, advanced keyword search, Polkadot integration and more. Stage 2 further extends the scope of the v6 bounty program from technical validation to collective population of the Web3 Asset Graph incentivizing asset publishers to the DKG. Stage 2 kicks off with the RC1 release on the OriginTrail DKG v6 testnet. After months of iteration and telemetry analysis, the core development team behind OriginTrail has feature-locked and finalized the specification of the biggest update since its inception.</p> What’s new in OriginTrail version&nbsp;6? <p>The upcoming update to v6 introduces a major paradigm shift in the capabilities of the DKG, evolving the knowledge graph to extend from data to Web3 assets. Users of the DKG v6 will now be able to create their unique DKG graphs as Web3-native assets, representing, describing and linking to any physical or digital asset, collectively forming a massive, verifiable, global, decentralized knowledge graph.</p><p>In v6, each of the published assets receives a new type of identifier — the Uniform Asset Locator (UAL), a Web3 extension of the URI/URL scheme used in Web2. However, in contrast to URLs which point to Web2 resources (e.g. websites) and are effectively rented from centralized authorities, UALs are Web3 native identifiers in full control by their owners, linking to any asset in existence via their verifiable asset&nbsp;graphs.</p><p>A key application enabled by the introduction of UALs is Web3 search — a fully decentralized, verifiable protocol for the discovery of assets indexed in the Decentralized Knowledge Graph. The DKG v6 gives asset owners full control over the way their assets are shown in search results, as well as those searching to find any asset with fully verifiable search&nbsp;results.</p><p>Apart from many new features, version 6 of OriginTrail introduces an incredible performance boost, seeing multiple throughput KPIs at 500x improvement from&nbsp;v5.</p><p>These new capabilities and performance improvements are enabled by introduction of several key technologies into OriginTrail v6:</p>  OriginTrail dedicated Polkadot Parachain: a highly scalable, tailored blockchain for the OriginTrail DKG (<a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/google-for-web3-specific-blockchain-origintrail-parachain-launches-today-heres-what-s-next-9a0d92bb72ef">recently launched on Polkadot</a>) with native interoperability with all of Polkadot, opening way for integrations with Web3 ecosystems such <a href="https://medium.com/acalanetwork/origintrail-to-launch-on-acala-bringing-its-decentralized-knowledge-graph-to-acalas-developer-d92c4372deb9">the Acala DeFi </a>hub, Efinity by Enjin, KILT protocol, Moonbeam and others (OriginTrail DKG remains a multichain DKG integrated with Ethereum, Gnosis and Polygon blockchains).  Native NFT ownership representation: each DKG asset now consists of its own asset graph (as part of the DKG) and a corresponding non-fungible token representing ownership of the graph on a particular blockchain. All asset graphs are therefore natively compatible with all existing NFT tools and services(such as NFT marketplaces), as well as enabling existing NFTs to be extended with asset graphs and indexed in the&nbsp;DKG.  Native W3C RDF graph representation: asset graphs are natively represented according to the W3C standardized <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a>, enabling compatibility with existing KGs (e.g. Google) and standards based semantic technologies (JSON-LD, SPARQL, OWL, SHACL&nbsp;etc).  UALs as unique asset locators: binding together NFTs and asset graphs, UALs give Web3 assets a unique, verifiable, cross-chain asset ID and locator for asset graph&nbsp;data.  Decentralized Search index: enabling discovery of assets in Web3 with a fully decentralized search engine, built on open source standardized technologies, starting with keyword search and staking. These Web3 search results are fully controlled by users, built on top of UALs and provide verifiable ranking scores using well known algorithms e.g. Google PageRank.  Continued support for industry standards such as the new GS1 EPCIS 2.0 and Digital Link, W3C DIDs and Verifiable Credentials and many others, some of which have already been integrated into <a href="https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/healthcare/donated-medicines-and-vaccines/">latest pharmaceutical asset tracking solution AidTrust built on OriginTrail in collaboration with British Standards Institution</a>.  <p>All of the above mentioned features will be available through a plethora of new clients (including a light node client in the near future) in popular programming languages (Javascript, Rust, Python, etc) for Web3 developers across the Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems.</p> The road ahead of feature-lock &amp; stage 2&nbsp;testnet <p>The OriginTrail version 6 RC1 kickstarts stage two of v6 launch with the feature-locked DKG implementation next week, following the release of EVM support on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet (as indicated in <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/">the Parachain roadmap</a>).</p><p>Therefore Stage 2 introduces a new v6 testnet launched on the OriginTrail Parachain testnet, which will be the final environment for verification and testing before proceeding with OriginTrail v6 mainnet launch on the OriginTrail Parachain this&nbsp;August.</p><p>Following the initial release of v6 on mainnet, further updates will introduce:</p>  Keyword Staking and Node Delegation — enabling asset owners and token holders to contribute their dormant TRAC tokens to the network utility for a share of the network&nbsp;fees,  Launch DKG incentives on OriginTrail Parachain via the OTP token, incentivizing system participants for activities contributing to the growth of the OriginTrail DKG,  DKG Asset marketplace tools, which are under ongoing development,  Cross-Web3 integrations via Polkadot,  New interfaces and improvements in associated tooling.   Magnifying interaction with OriginTrail <p>In order for the new capabilities of OriginTrail to be easily available for users, we are introducing a new core interface aimed at growing the OriginTrail DKG.</p><p>As we are approaching the <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-v6-and-parachain-from-turing-to-metcalfe-phase-2276ab284de4">upcoming Metcalfe phase</a>, we will see continuous development of The Magnify project — an application interface that will leverage the v6 capabilities to enable an enhanced, Web3-native, asset ownership experience. It will allow asset publishers to quickly add assets and populate the DKG and at the same time allow asset consumers to easily discover&nbsp;assets.</p> OriginTrail on Twitter: "With the launch of @OT_Parachain on @Polkadot &amp; V6 @origin_trail Decentralized Knowledge Graph, it's time to magnify your capability to discover, verify, and supercharge assets!

The asset publishers will, for the first time ever, have the opportunity to create verifiable and ownable search results for the universe of assets. It will allow them to be among the first to create an ownable search results that will evolve over time, build a defensible position in the search rank and magnify its&nbsp;value!</p><p>As we see the OriginTrail DKG get populated with a universe of (Web3 native) assets and search results, the capabilities for asset consumers, including DKG-powered anonymised asset discoverability and a chance to become owners of the found&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The interface will also support the upcoming staking functionalities, allowing asset owners to put their tokens to work by staking TRAC to Keywords for discoverability and allow any TRAC holder to delegate TRAC to nodes for a share of&nbsp;rewards.</p> V6 as an adoption&nbsp;catalyst <p>Previous versions of OriginTrail (up to including v5) have made it possible for all groups of users (enterprises, government sector, Web3 builders etc.) to connect and verify information thanks to the semantic and linked data technology intertwined with the multi-chain blockchain layer.

<p>Apple, Google and Meta Platforms are among the tech companies that provide digital-legacy tools to let users bequeath account access to others, but millions of people are poised to change how they log into accounts as FIDO passwordless technology is rolled out. But those passkeys aren’t set up yet for sharing with heirs or next of kin. In the future, they could allow users to designate emergency contacts who can access your accounts through their own unique passkeys after verifying their identity. Alternatively, apps and websites may let you keep a traditional password as a backup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why is digital trust so important? We asked Digital Identity NZ’s executive director Colin Wallis for his perspective on an equitable digital future.&nbsp; Plus, we preview the top trends in digital identity.</p>



<p>Q: What is digital trust and why is it so important?</p>



<p>A: Trust lies at the heart of human relationships.&nbsp; While the notion of trust has been with us since the beginning of humanity, it is rooted in the physical world, where people can be close to each other, understand their heritage from their village, iwi and hapū.&nbsp; In this context, sources of authority can vouch for their integrity.&nbsp; Back in those days just as today, this extends to commerce and entitlements and the privacy-respecting nature of those.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a digital world where this physical closeness doesn’t exist, other methods are required to gain confidence and assurance in someone’s identity and data.&nbsp; This includes overall security of the system and the personal data it processes to ensure the parties are acting in good faith.&nbsp; Without digital trust, the digital economy falters and ultimately cannot function.</p>



<p>Q: What underpins digital trust in New Zealand?</p>



<p>A: In essence there are two brand categories of underpinning – the public sector and the private sector.&nbsp; The Government for example, is generally trusted and seen as the authoritative source for much of our identity related information.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the private sector for example, banks, financial services and many other sectors operate digital services as well as physical services and in some cases solely through the digital channel.&nbsp; These are often extensions of our trust in brands in the physical world.&nbsp; Some brands, including big platforms like Apple, straddle both the physical and digital worlds while other brands like TradeMe, are online only, where people’s trust in the service has been built over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the medium term, the introduction of the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Act has the potential to provide a game-changing regulatory foundation for the identification and authentication components of services delivered through the digital channel.&nbsp; Those services that choose to be independently audited for compliance against the Framework’s security and privacy oriented rules and standards to become accredited, would then be able to differentiate those digital service brands through displaying an accreditation mark.&nbsp; This would provide the public with greater confidence, assurance and level of trust in those services relative to other services that do not carry the mark.&nbsp; It was a key motivation in the establishment of Digital Identity New Zealand.</p>



<p>Q: What makes digital trust so complex?</p>



<p>A: The sheer range of actors and roles, technology options and technical approaches, plus the requisite legal compliance and information security, data protection and privacy standards means that there are a wide range of concerns to actively manage.&nbsp; All these factors need to be able to operate safely, respectfully and easily (ideally seamlessly) for people, and at scale nationally and internationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite significant advances during the past 10 years, the ecosystem is relatively immature and in keeping with modern day life generally, is continuously evolving in response to policy changes, technical advances and emerging new cybersecurity threats. New techniques and technology give rise to new ways of weaponising digital trust and in turn new techniques and technology are developed in defence of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q: What are barriers to digital identity adoption?</p>



<p>A: Digital literacy, confidence to use, knowledge of and equitable access to technology are all barriers to digital identity adoption.&nbsp; Trust and beliefs can also be an inhibitor to including everyone on this journey. Governments and large technical platforms are typically key actors in digital identity systems.&nbsp; People who distrust Government, big tech or anything digital for whatever reason present a challenge to ubiquitous inclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also barriers for digital services and service providers regarding legal compliance, lack of definitional alignment, interoperability and cross recognition among&nbsp; jurisdictions.&nbsp; Regardless, the business model for digital identity is typically opaque, given future uncertainty in policy, costs, technology options, market dynamics and adoption. As in all of modern life’s uncertainties, the risks and costs of investing can quickly outweigh the benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q: What does an equitable digital future look like?</p>



<p>A: Equitable and inclusive!&nbsp; In an ideal world, everyone would have equitable access to the digital economy and participate in it securely, safely and with confidence.</p>



<p>This is easy to say, but much harder to deliver at scale with constrained resources.&nbsp; An equitable digital future requires significant, sustained investment of resources across society in order to leave no-one behind in offering the opportunity to participate.&nbsp; This begins with literacy, education and technology.&nbsp; Improving digital literacy and equity requires a national programme of sustained investment with collaboration across Government, the private sector, the charity sector and non-profit industry associations such as Digital Identity New Zealand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q: What are the top trends in digital identity and identity management?</p>



<p>1.Decentralised identity architectural approach.&nbsp; This established but new-to-digital-identity approach promises a more streamlined, user-centric and privacy-centric digital experience where, after an initial set up process, personal identity-related data never leaves an individual’s device, thus reducing the amount of personal data transferred, stored and processed by other actors in the system and reducing the associated risks potentially exposed by those activities. While this would potentially remove some barriers to adoption for those distrustful of actors in systems based on centralised or federated architectures, and give people agency over which parties see their data, this approach is still early in its implementation lifecycle. Nonetheless with standardisation efforts underway, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a> was recently approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Tokenisation.&nbsp; Again, the concept of Tokenisation is not new, having been used in a rudimentary form in New Zealand’s digital identity systems for 15 years, but the term and its application to digital identity systems more broadly is new to the global community. This is when assets of almost any type can be trusted as being representative of the asset (physical or digital) itself but carrying ‘no exploitable value’. Given the nature of identity-related information, it’s no surprise that the concept has found its way into the realm of digital identity. Tokens are typically categorised into Fungible or Non-Fungible asset types. Tokens used in identity management are of the Non-Fungible variety and most commonly associated with decentralised identity implementations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3.Passwordless.&nbsp; This is a technical approach to confirming or recognising a returning person that has previously registered at a digital service – the process known as authentication. It removes the need for people to type in a password after their username, instead using a high security option such as a cryptographic key pair and leveraging the person’s smartphone or similar device. More digital identity services are offering this option because by removing the password, a fraudster’s password guessing and brute force attacks against the person are minimised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4.Trust Frameworks.&nbsp; As with many other established concepts newly applied to digital identity, Trust Frameworks have been in use in the private and public sectors for decades in sectors such as financial services operating payment card systems underpinned by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). As one of Aotearoa’s foremost digital identity service providers explains, “Trust frameworks are a foundational component of the web of trust. A trust framework is a common set of best practice standards-based rules that ensure minimum requirements are met for security, privacy, identification management and interoperability through accreditation and governance. These operating rules provide a common framework for ecosystem participants, increasing trust between them”.&nbsp; The trust framework has the potential to significantly aid more frictionless e-commerce and velocity in the digital economy by giving people more confidence in the safety, security and privacy in their digital lives and control over their identity-related data.</p>



<p>Q: What can we learn from other countries?&nbsp;</p>



<p>A: Aotearoa can learn more from countries who have high levels of public and private sector collaboration in the development of digital identity ecosystems.&nbsp; Collaboration with industry associations like Digital Identity Identity New Zealand have advanced developments in the EU, the US, the UK and Canada and there is capacity to do more similar collaboration in New Zealand. &nbsp; It must be remembered that while of foundational and paramount importance, identification and identity&nbsp; – be it physical or digital – is a sub-system of a much larger set of business and governmental processes.&nbsp; Countries that have achieved high levels of cross party commitment to continued long term investment in process modernisation are in theory better placed to achieve better outcomes with better optics, delivered with more agility as a result. Oftentimes the most valuable interventions to demonstrably move the needle are things that don’t make headlines and in and of themselves don’t attract votes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, other countries have also learned from us!&nbsp; In 2007 Aotearoa was the first non-national ID card country to operate a national web-based login service and used early tokenisation techniques for privacy and security preservation referred to in the industry as ‘blinding’ well ahead of other jurisdictions.&nbsp; In 2023/24 it is expected New Zealand will be the first common law country of those typically compared, to pass Trust Framework legislation and operate a regulatory framework for digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Q: What are the global opportunities for New Zealand as a trusted economy?</p>



<p>A: New Zealand’s growing capability and maturity in all things digital, needs to be consistently reflected in the development of digital services, be they online gaming or digital support in supply chain integrity for physical products that our association colleagues in AgriTechNZ promulgate. Digital identity underpins them all. Local companies can more easily expand to enter and operate in overseas markets with potentially less friction if internationally recognised digital identity standards and practice are consistently applied.&nbsp; Armed with these tools, we have the potential to develop a strong competitive advantage in the digital economy globally. &nbsp;</p>

 Growing the Community 

<p>The Blockchain Commons community continues to grow to the benefit of all of our members.</p>

<p>Welcome to Chia. A big welcome to our newest sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://www.chia.net/">Chia Network</a>, Bram Cohen’s blockchain company. Chia joined mainly because of what we’re already doing, including our work on advocacy and our history with DIDs. We’re thrilled to have them not just because of the interest in our current efforts, but also because of their cutting-edge blockchain work, including the innovative Chialisp smart-contract language, work with pairing-based cryptography, and their <a href="https://www.chia.net/greenpaper/">Proofs of Space and Time algorithm</a>. Blockchain Commons supports the heterogeneity of the blockchain space. We want to make wallets work with multiple blockchains that are built in multiple ways, and having someone like Chia onboard makes that possible.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon. Community growth allows us to hold events to bring that community to share their knowledge. Thus, our first quarter welcoming of <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> and <a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a> allowed us to hold our first Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, hardware-wallet makers, and other interested parties joined together to discuss the future of semiconductor design and how it can better support cryptographic functionality. The <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon website</a> contains complete information on the June 1st event, including <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/presentations/">videos, slides, and transcripts of all the presentations</a> as well as an <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/#discussions">overview of the discussions</a> with quotes.</p>

<p></p>

 Evolving our References 

<p>Our reference apps demonstrate how the Gordian principles can be used in functional applications; while our reference libraries make it easy to use our specifications. We continue to upgrade and expand both with the support of our community — and occasionally deprecate some when they’ve served their purpose.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool 1.5. We upgraded our premiere Gordian app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool</a>, to 1.5. This upgrade implemented new experimental functionality related to NFC Tags. You can now write to and read from NFCs by just tapping them with your phone. There are still a number of questions about NFC security, but we’re always interested in testing out the newest technology and considering how it could integrate into our secure architecture — and that type of experimentation is one of the major purposes of our references.</p>

<p>Gordian Server 1.0.2. One of the challenges of producing an application like <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a>, which makes it easy to install and use Bitcoin Core on your Mac, is that we’re vulnerable to any changes in Bitcoin Core itself. Some minor changes in the file names for Bitcoin Core 23.0 required us to do some updates to both Gordian Server and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup Scripts</a>, but everything is now up-to-date, allowing easy installation of a Bitcoin Server that will allow you to work with new Bitcoin technologies such as Taproot and Schnorr signatures.</p>

<p>Gordian QR Tool Deprecation. The maintenance load for apps results in us occasionally deprecating something, and that was the case this quarter for our QR Tool app. We originally released Gordian QR Tool to demonstrate the Gordian principles of resilience and independence in a simple, easy-to-use way. This included a way to store seeds and other vulnerable data as QR codes in a secure vault. However, Gordian Seed Tool has evolved so far since the debut of the two apps that we’ve decided QR Tool doesn’t hold many advantages any more. Thus, we’ve deprecated QR Tool so that we can instead focus our attention on Seed Tool.</p>

<p>Lifehash for Python. Thanks to the support of our sustaining sponsor <a href="https://cramiumsolutions.com/">Cramium Solutions</a> and the work of long-time Blockchain Common contributor &amp; supporter <a href="https://github.com/kanzure">Bryan Bishop</a>, Blockchain Commons is now able to offer a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash-python">Python implementation of our Lifehash library</a>. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash.info#readme">Lifehash</a> is a Blockchain Commons specification that creates beautiful visual hashes that make it easy to identify data at a glance. Thanks to Cramium for making this methodology available to Python programmers!</p>

 Evolving Smart Custody 

<p>Smart Custody is one of Blockchain Commons’ oldest projects, and it continued to see new life in the last quarter.</p>

<p>Full Draft of Multisig. We have completed the first draft of our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">multisig scenario for self-sovereign #SmartCustody</a>. Since our rough draft last quarter, we’ve added dozens of illustrations and responded to reviews, creating a new draft that’s hopefully more usable and definitely more accurate. Though we’re thrilled to now be able to advocate for a multisig solution for self-custody, in the process we’ve learned both that its complexity can be intimidating and that the specificity of required devices can make it unapproachable. So expect both more expansions in the future (to support more variants), as well as some bigger Blockchain Commons projects that will start to demonstrate how we can make multisigs simple.</p>

<p>Outline for #SmartCustody 2.0. We’ve been thinking about a second edition of our 
<a href="https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101">Smart Custody book</a> for a few years and have recently created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md">a new outline for SmartCustody 2.0</a>. We’re not quite sure when we’ll be able to dedicate time for it, but these are our current thoughts on documenting SmartCustody for the future. In the meantime, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody#smartcustody-scenarios">Smart Custody Repo</a> for the scenarios, tools, and case studies that we’ve written in the last year and which will eventually appear as modules in the #SmartCustody 2.0 book.</p>

<p></p>

 Welcome to New Interns 

<p>For the third year in a row we’re running a Blockchain Commons virtual-intern program this summer.</p>

<p>The Third Cohort of Blockchain Commons Interns. Welcome to our latest cohort of Blockchain Commons interns, which this year includes 16 interns out of twice that many applications. We’ve always wanted to broaden our internships to go beyond just software engineers, and we’ve been pleased with the success of that this year, with a pre-law intern now leading a whole group in the support of our advocacy work in Wyoming. Projects our interns are working on include: the support for that legislative work in Wyoming and elsewhere; expanding Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line for new Taproot and Schnorr technology; exploring the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0322.mediawiki">BIP-322 proposal</a> to leverage Bitcoin Script to sign arbitrary messages; updating <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">Spotbit</a>; and writing use cases for human-rights workers such as emergency and medical personnel, monitors, press, and advocates. We look forward to reporting back on these projects at the end of summer.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Pre-Updates. To get the Learning Bitcoin course ready for our newest interns (and for their own work on it), we updated Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line for all recent PRs and to address all recent issues (most of which had to do with updates to Bitcoin Core over the last year). Thank you to everyone who has helped us to keep the Learning Bitcoin module up-to-date and correct over the years! We haven’t flagged an official release yet, as we’re hoping to at the end of summer, but the Learning Bitcoin course should now be more accurate and up-to-date with Bitcoin Core 23.0 commands.</p>

 Working with Wyoming 

<p>We’ve been thrilled to continue working with the Wyoming legislature, with support from our new interns. Christopher Allen and one of our interns gave new testimony on a variety of topics this June, with support from the legislative intern team.</p>

<p>E-Residency. We’ve spoken several times in Wyoming to advocate for e-residency, which will allow corporations to take advantage of the excellent digital business &amp; privacy laws that Wyoming has been advancing in the last several years. A local paper gave <a href="https://www.thesheridanpress.com/news/local/wyoming-considering-following-in-estonias-footsteps-with-new-program/article_fa2161e0-ed7f-11ec-b22a-db4cbe8144e0.html">good coverage</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>WRDAs. We also advanced new ideas on Wyoming Registered Digital Assets (WRDAs), which will improve Wyoming’s treatment of digital assets by allowing for perfection under the UCC. Here’s our <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061408-03WyomingWRDASlides.pdf">slides on the topic</a>.</p>

<p>Private Key Protections. Finally, our most important testimony for Wyoming may have been about protecting private keys from disclosure by courts. The problem is that courts are current endangering digital assets, information, and identity by demanding the turnover of private keys, often as part of pretrial motions. They’re not the proper tool, and they’re not being used in the proper way. Because this is such an important topic, we’re currently working on a position paper that will better explain why private keys are not appropriate for this usage.</p>

<p></p>

 Looking toward the Future 

<p>A lot of our work in Q2 was forward-looking, developing specs and architectures that we hope will be the next generation of responsible key management on the internet.</p>

<p>We expect to advance three major projects in the third quarter based on this work.</p>

<p>CSR. Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR) is the first step in the development of our next-generation Smart Custody architecture. The <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/149">CSR Project</a> is intended to automate the sharding and recovery of seeds and other essential metadata, with options to support shard-recovery services: interopable services will hold envelopes of data containing shards of the data required for wallet recovery and only return them to users following sufficient authentication. This work is currently being done in conjunction with Bitmark and Proxy.</p>

<p>Hardware API. The varied APIs of hardware devices can cause numerous integration problems for developers (the so-called “NASCAR Problem”. Thus our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/158">Hardware API Project</a> seeks to develop a  unified wallet architecture &amp; APIs that will work with a variety kinds of devices. We also plan to leverage URs and crypto-requests and to support device capability discovery. The first steps will be analyzing and assessing current hardware APIs, abstracting out functionality, and simultaneously leveraging new work such as that being done by CrossBar for silicon support. This work is currently being done in conjunction with CrossBar and Proxy while Blockchain Commons contributes specs and coordination.</p>

<p>Reference Upgrades. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/issues/159">Automated multisig round-trips</a> are meant to expand the work Blockchain Commons has already done on Uniform Resources (URs) by using <code>crypto-requests</code> to automate the creation and usage of a classic (pre-Taproot) Bitcoin multisig. This will be done through the development of a new reference app, Gordian Coordinator, which will be a transaction coordinator that holds no private keys, and through the expansion of Gordian Seed Tool. Our ultimate goal is to demonstrate the ease of use possible with a fully integrated system of <code>crypto-requests</code>.</p>

<p>We’re looking forward to the development of these exciting new architectures and designs for the future!</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-bachenheimer-2632202/">Dan Bachenheimer</a>, Unique Identity Services Global Lead, Accenture</p>



<p>The Identity Week Europe conference and exhibit was conducted in London on June 28 and 29, 2022.&nbsp; The conference had three tracks, Security Documents, Biometrics, and Digital ID with the mission to “… to accelerate the move towards a world where trusted identity solutions enable governments and commercial organizations to provide citizens, employees, customers and consumers with a multitude of opportunities to transact in a seamless, yet secure manner. All the while preventing the efforts of those intent on doing harm.”</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation was invited to join a panel discussion on the topic of Smart Digital ID Wallets and the Future of Identity moderated by Steve Pannifer, Managing Director, Consult Hyperion.&nbsp; The panelists were:<a href="https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/identity-week/agenda.stm"> Nick Mothershaw, Chief Identity Strategist, Open Identity Exchange</a>,<a href="https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/identity-week/agenda.stm"> Daniel Bachenheimer, Contributing member to the Technical Architecture Task Force, Trust Over IP</a>; Arjan Geluk, Lead Principal Advisor, Identity Management &amp; Security, UL; and Kristel Teyras, Chair of the Digital Identity Workgroup, Secure Identity Alliance.</p>







<p>The 20 minute Smart Wallet panel discussion was preceded by a presentation on Smart Digital ID Wallets – Smart Digital Wallets: More than just a collection of Digitised Credentials by Nick Mothershaw and Lee Hughes who laid down the underlying functional elements of Smart Wallets along with use cases and operational considerations.</p>



<p>Our panel discussion began with what is digital identity? and my response was that we need to think about it in two domains: foundational identity, typically imparted by the public sector as a form of legal identity after establishing uniqueness within the target population, and functional identities where identity attributes are typically established by sector-specific relying parties such as: employers, financial institutions, educational institutions – as well as public sector entities for voting, taxes, driving licenses, etc.</p>



<p>The next discussion round was seeking clarity on what exactly are digital identity wallets and what specifically ToIP offers in this domainn. I shared that, beginning with the OIX Smart Wallet discussed in the last session, there are varying capabilities already in (or expected to be in) digital identity wallets – from the OIX rules engine, to the EU Digital Identity Wallet initiative that is to include strong, multi-factor authentication, auditing, and (like the ISO mDL wallet), both online and offline capabilities – among many others.</p>



<p>I explained that the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">ToIP model</a> was originally inspired by the Hyperledger Aries work on digital identity wallets and agents. The focus has been on secure key pair generation and storage along with secure verifiable credential exchange and storage. However that scope is steadily expanding to be inclusive of other decentralized identity stack architectures and protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also shared that the ToIP model outlined in the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Introduction-to-ToIP-V2.0-2021-11-17.pdf">Trust Over IP Introductory document</a>, available at <a href="http://trustoverip.org">TrustOverIP.org</a>, addresses the technology and governance related to each layer separately. I shared an example from the EU Digital Identity Wallet requirements which says that a “minimum set of person identification data…&nbsp; [must be shared] to identify the user upon … request in those cases where identification of the user is required by law.” How does one ensure that the entity requesting the person identification data, as required by law, is a legitimate relying party and how do we securely share the minimum amount of information that is legally allowed? ToIP governance and technology guidance exists today, in the form of <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/ToIP-Governance-Architecture-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">ToIP Governance Specification V1</a>, and is maturing to address these fundamental digital identity capabilities.</p>



<p>Ultimately the panel was very much aligned that decentralized digital identity will be an integral part of establishing one’s identity online, and off. Industry must work together to establish globally interoperable solutions where formats, protocols, and digital signatures defined by governance and trust frameworks are agreed within and between ecosystems.</p>

 Tactics to help get things moving,&nbsp;pronto! <p>Often, when <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> is brought in to help with a community-focused project, we’re there for both strategic thinking and to provide quick wins. <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/keep-badges-weird-is-about-breaking-boundaries-42afb0415826?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">Laura’s previous post</a> is a good example of some of the former, whereas this post aims to share examples of the&nbsp;latter.</p><p>It may also be interesting/useful to read <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/howto-create-an-architecture-of-participation-for-your-open-source-project-a38386c69fa5">this post</a> from a couple of years ago about our work with Greenpeace’s community.</p><p>In addition to the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/knowledge-pool/tools/">tools and approaches</a> we share, one of the most important touchstones we have for this kind of work is what we call an <a href="https://weareopen.coop/aop">Architecture of Participation</a>. We’ve developed this over the last decade from our work with Mozilla, Greenpeace, as well as other clients large and&nbsp;small.</p>Image CC BY-ND Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Our framework has to be applied in context, but once again, it is proving helpful in our work with <a href="https://localgovdrupal.org">LocalGov Drupal</a>. Here are some examples of how we’re applying it, based on work we’ve been doing with the community recently.</p> Clear mission <p>A clear mission is important to channel the energy of the community and align people around your&nbsp;goals.</p><p>Does everyone know why the community exists? Is the mission statement short and pithy enough to remember? Put it everywhere to remind people what you’re there to do! The mission / big idea can be pinned to channels on workplace chat apps like Slack, added to the top of meeting document templates, as well as being front-and-centre on websites, docs sites, and code repositories.</p><p>For example, LocalGov Drupal have a fantastic mission statement and strapline: The publishing platform created by councils, for councils. This is expanded to explain that “LocalGov Drupal is a publicly owned asset that delivers a better digital experience for citizens, improves service outcomes, and saves&nbsp;money.”</p> Invitation to participate <p>There’s a difference between a passive and an active invitation to contribute to something. For example, think of the difference between a neighbour sending out a mass email saying that “everyone’s welcome for drinks to celebrate Bob’s 50th birthday” versus that neighbour knocking on your door and inviting you personally.</p><p>Although it can feel like a lot of work, personal invitations are immensely important for community participation and growth. Direct messaging people who haven’t introducing themselves to the community can give them the confidence to do so. This is especially important for diversity and inclusivity — providing people with a personal connection into a community can help create safety and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>The same goes for working groups and community gatherings. “We’d love to see you at the next product meeting to tell us more about the idea you shared in the channel last week” is an invitation. People need inviting.</p> Easy onboarding <p>People are busy. Life is short. We’re all interested in lots of things and, while some people are more interested in some things than others, we should make it as easy as possible for people to get involved.</p><p>Most of this is about removing barriers, which can be broken down&nbsp;into:</p>  Signposting — is there an easy-to-understand overview of where everything is, and how to get involved?  Checklist — is there a way that new community members can know when they’ve completed all of the recommended onboarding activities?  Proof of membership — is there a way that new community members can share their new-found status with others? (e.g. a profile, or a&nbsp;badge?)  <p>Community belonging is about identity, which is aligned with the mission. Making it easy to show how to belong is important and it’s important to provide several ways to understand the community’s landscape. After all, everyone thinks a little differently!</p><p>A good place to start with conversations about belonging can be working a Code of Conduct. It’s worth checking out the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a> if you haven’t done this kind of work&nbsp;before.</p><p>In terms of badges, here are some examples we’ve been talking about issuing for the LocalGov Drupal community. A good example of a mature badge system for contributors is the <a href="https://badges.fedoraproject.org/explore/badges">Fedora Project</a>, which has been issuing badges since&nbsp;2013!</p>Mock-ups of badges for the LocalGov Drupal community Modular approach <p>Diversity is the lifeblood of communities, both in terms of people of all backgrounds, orientations, and beliefs feeling welcome, but also in terms of interests and job role. For example, there will be some people are particularly interested in codebases and repositories, whereas others may be more interested in&nbsp;design.</p><p>As a project grows, it’s important that new contributors don’t feel like they have to be part of every conversation and initiative. So it’s worth separating out work, and discussions about that work, where possible. Practically speaking, this can be as simple as separate chat channels, but may also include potentially new working groups, and decision-making workflows.</p><p>You may want to ask a particularly-engaged community member to take the lead in a particular area. This can avoid burnout for the overall project lead, who often feels like they need to be across everything going on in a community.</p> Strong leadership <p>Communities, and especially open source communities that have a technical project attached to them, are often started by a single person with a big idea. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">Benevolent Dictator For Life</a> (BDFL) approach, however, tends to foreground and elevate white western males, and does not necessarily lead to community cohesion. In addition, it can be onerous for those put into that position.</p><p>The approach being experimented with by LocalGov Drupal, and which we have seen work extremely well within the co-operative movement, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy">Sociocracy</a>.</p><blockquote>Sociocracy is a system of governance that seeks to create psychologically safe environments and productive organizations. It draws on the use of consent, rather than majority voting, in discussion and decision-making by people who have a shared goal or work&nbsp;process.</blockquote>LocalGov Drupal governance, based on Sociocracy<p>The idea is that governance is always a work in progress, and that people can join circles based on interest. Decision-making is devolved to the relevant circle, with ‘double links’ back to other circles. More details on this at the <a href="https://www.sociocracyforall.org/">SoFA website</a>. Outlandish, a sister co-op to WAO, also run <a href="https://outlandish.com/workshops/">introductory Sociocracy workshops</a>.</p> Ways of working&nbsp;open <p>As we explained in a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/why-working-openly-on-ambitious-projects-breeds-excitement-537b17ec7ec0">previous post</a> about our work with LocalGov Drupal, working openly on ambitious targets is how people get excited about projects and want to join your community.</p><p>It can be tempting to just focus on getting the work done, but if you don’t have increasing numbers of contributors, you’re creating a bottleneck. That’s why working openly, and documenting your work is so important!</p><blockquote>After all, if a project isn’t ambitious but is open, then people who do find out about might not care enough to be interested. Conversely, if a project is ambitious but not open, then people tend to get suspicious. The sweet spot is being both open and ambitious, with bonus points for finding ways to help people get involved&nbsp;easily!</blockquote> Backchannels &amp; watercoolers <p>A particular project may be a ‘work’ thing. For example, LocalGov Drupal is squarely focused on helping councils deliver a better digital experience for citizens, improve service outcomes, and save&nbsp;money.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean that people can’t have fun while doing it, make new friends, and learn new, adjacent things! Creating a place for people to share photos of their dogs, request sponsorship for a trek they’re doing, or talk about things that may be a little off-topic, is all part of community cohesion.</p><p>You can create channels such as #watercooler or #backchannel in chat apps. You can ensure that people can bring their full selves to the project by <a href="https://www.sociocracyforall.org/project/check-in/">‘checking-in’</a> to meetings or gatherings. You can model this behaviour by being human, and not a&nbsp;machine.</p><p>Some people are naturally more open and extroverted than others, whereas others are more reserved and introverted. Laura has <a href="https://opensource.com/open-organization/18/11/design-communities-personality-types">written about this elsewhere</a>. The idea is to create a space where everyone feels welcome and can contribute in ways with which they feel comfortable.</p> Celebration of milestones <p>There are at least three different types of milestones you can celebrate in your community:</p>  Project milestones — e.g. new releases of&nbsp;software  Community milestones — e.g. the existence of the project for X number of&nbsp;years  Personal milestones — e.g. someone celebrated a big&nbsp;birthday  <p>There are many different ways of celebrating these milestones, but all are to do with <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">recognition</a>. This may be recognition of the hard work that people have put in, of their value to the community, or to the impact the project has had on the wider&nbsp;world.</p><p>However you do it — through badges, a message full of emoji, or a press release, the aim is to bring a smile to the faces of community members and make them feel proud to be associated with your&nbsp;project.</p><p><a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a> is a collective of independent thinkers and makers helping charities, ethical companies, government departments and educational institutions with sensemaking and digital transformation.</p><p>Can we help you with your project or new initiative? <a href="https://weareopen.coop/contact/">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">Quick wins to improve your Open Source community’s Architecture of Participation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago was the first full-scale Identiverse since the pandemic began, and host Ping Identity pulled out all the stops. It started off with a wonderful video splash with spotlighted drummers banging away, setting the stage for three days of wonderful entertainment, great keynotes, engaging sessions, and nonstop networking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ping CEO Andre Durand ‘s opening keynote set the tone by putting decentralized identity front and center. Stating that our current systems do not scale, Andre took us on a journey through the history of Identity solutions from passwords, to single sign-on, to OAuth, to centralized and federated identity.&nbsp;</p>







<p>He then ended with what we all know at the Trust Over IP Foundation: that the future is decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p>







<p>It was not just a wonderful start to the conference, but a great summary of exactly why ToIP was founded: we are collaborating to develop the recommendations, standards, guides, and templates needed to connect the gap shown on Andre’s slide above.</p>



<p>If there was a real surprise at this year’s Identiverse, it was the evidence presented throughout the conference that decentralized identity isn’t just the future, it is the NOW. For example, only an hour after Andre’s keynote, Kristina Yasuda, Senior Identity Standards Architecture at Microsoft, gave an entire talk extolling the virtues of verifiable credentials (VCs) without even mentioning Microsoft’s own VC products. (She also didn’t mention that she is the new co-chair of the new W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0 Working Group along with Brent Zundel of Avast).</p>



<p>Shortly after Kristina’s session, Brent and Drummond Reed gave a presentation on how the SSI model of digital wallets and VCs can and should be integrated with existing identity and access management (IAM) systems. Their goal was to dispel any notion that “rip and replace” was necessary to start using VCs and the ToIP stack.</p>



<p>But the most resounding endorsement of VCs came when Alex Simons, Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President of Identity and Network Access gave the opening keynote on the second day. He not only spent the entire first half of his talk explaining why VCs were the headline new feature of the Microsoft Entra product suite, but then invited Kristina to give a live demo of VC interop between Microsoft, Ping, Workday, IBM, and MATTR. For more on the specific interop profile they were using, see <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/new-capabilities-in-microsoft-entra-verified-id-now-available/ba-p/3295507">this blog post</a> from Microsoft decentralized identity product manager Ankur Patel.</p>



<p>On Thursday, ToIP Steering Committee member Mike Vesey, CEO of <a href="https://idramp.com/">IdRamp</a> presented several use cases in his session “Establishing Trust with Decentralized Identity Networks, Verifiable Credentials, and Zero Trust”. Mike shared several decentralized identity solutions operating in production today, including:</p>



  “Zoom Bouncer”, a new meeting security application now available in the Zoom public app store that allow meeting hosts to use verifiable credentials and biometrics to protect virtual meetings from zoom bombing.&nbsp;  The North Dakota Department of Education decentralized identity initiative shows how verifiable credentials are being used for decentralized verification of student learner records for graduating students.&nbsp;  



<p>Mike also gave a demo of the IdRamp zero code orchestration platform that allows issuance of verifiable credentials from any traditional IAM system and verification with any traditional relying party service—an entire journey that can be implemented in just a few minutes without any code. “IdRamp has been providing decentralization for a few years now.” states Mike Vesey, “The IdRamp platform provides a seamless bridge from centralized identity systems into decentralized credential based authentication and access control. It was inspiring to hear that same vision being shared by the largest IAM organizations in the world. The future of identity is decentralized and ToIP is playing a major role in guiding organizations on their journey into decentralized zero trust protection.”</p>



<p>Judith Fleenor, Director of Strategic Engagement at the Trust Over IP Foundation, agrees: “It’s exciting to see live use cases of verifiable credentials across various sectors of government and industry. It is equally exciting to see organizations such as our Steering Committee members <a href="https://idramp.com/">IdRamp</a> and <a href="https://monokee.com/">Monokee</a> making integration with traditional IAM a breeze through their innovative system integration platforms and consulting services.”</p>



<p>Another key theme throughout the conference was <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 passkeys</a>. At least a half-dozen sessions were focused on this topic—not surprising given <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/cnet-apple-google-microsoft-back-fido-tech-to-dump-passwords-on-websites-and-apps/">the announcements from Apple, Google, Mozilla, and the FIDO Alliance</a> earlier this spring—and that Identiverse focuses on an enterprise IAM-centric audience where solutions to multi-factor and passwordless authentication have been sought after for two decades.</p>



<p>Overall, the attendees from ToIP agreed that this Identiverse took a strong step in the direction of ToIP—and it made it even more important that we push forward with our work of completing the full definition of the ToIP stack.</p>

<p>From October 2021 to April 2022, The Engine Room conducted a research project exploring areas of intersection between digital rights and climate &amp; environmental justice. </p>



<p>Supported by <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/" title="Ford Foundation">Ford Foundation</a>, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/">Mozilla Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://www.ariadne-network.eu/">Ariadne</a>, we set out to map the important work happening at the intersections of these vast fields, with the goal of identifying current barriers to and opportunities for greater collaboration, and highlighting areas in which funders can provide needed support.</p>



<p>We are excited to publish the findings from this research.

 About our research 



<p>We spoke to a variety of practitioners from both digital rights (DR) and environmental and climate justice (EJ-CJ), and many flagged how relevant it can be for DR and EJ-CJ practitioners to learn more about each other’s work and priorities, and to explore areas of overlap.</p>



<p>In our research, we surfaced numerous areas of cross-cutting concern as well as existing points of interconnection between DR and EJ-CJ. In our report, we highlight five key intersections in particular: </p>



  sustainable internet and technology  access to information and information disorder  safety and defence  data-driven environmental monitoring   migration justice.  



<p></p>



<p>Our report is primarily designed for grantmakers and practitioners in and adjacent to the digital rights sector, as well as grantmakers and practitioners with an environmental or climate focus who are interested in exploring the intersections between their work and that of the digital rights sector.</p>



<p>The report:</p>



  provides an overview of some of the key areas where digital rights and allied technology work currently intersects with environmental and climate justice  provides insights on the needs and challenges of practitioners engaged in work spanning DR, tech and EJ-CJ issues  identifies barriers to, and opportunities for, an ecosystem that sits between the two, and  lays out a variety of opportunities for digital rights funders to provide impactful support that is grounded in the real-world experiences of different communities and movements engaged in the fight for climate and environmental justice.  



<p>This report wouldn’t be possible without the organisations and individuals who participated in the research – thank you so much to everyone we spoke to for your time and insights.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that <a href="https://monokee.com/">Monokee</a> s.r.l., a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaleup_company">scaleup</a> from north Italy, has joined the ToIP Foundation as a Steering Member. A company rising from the centralized and federated IAM world to embrace the SSI paradigm, Monokee intends to be an&nbsp;active contributor to the community’s efforts in defining the interoperability standards that will lead to Web 3.0.</p>



<p>Launched in 2018, Monokee leverages the 20 years of experience of its two founders in IAM/IGA consulting. The company’s flagship product is an easy-to-integrate, point-and-click visual identity orchestration tool used by security architects from SMEs to larger enterprises.</p>



<p>Representing Monokee on the Steering Committee will be Ing. Roberto Griggio, Monokee’s CEO. Roberto graduated in Computer Science from the University of Venice, Italy and sports more than 20 years in identity and access management and related fields. On the technical working groups and task forces, Monokee will be represented by Dr. Mattia Zago, Monokee’s SSI Solutions Architect. Mattia holds a Ph.D. from the University of Murcia, Spain, specifically dedicated to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence subjects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Joining the ToIP Steering Committee represents a significant milestone for me as a researcher and us as an identity company,” said Dr. Zago. “Seeing that the community is aligned with our view of a hybrid integration between federated enterprises’ services and decentralized identities further increases our motivation to pursue it. Indeed, we will keep pushing forward our identity orchestrator to provide seamless (and codeless) integration experiences for security engineers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monokee believes a formal definition for the authentication and authorization processes is critical for integrating IAM/IGA solutions. Despite the importance of this aspect, most contemporary solutions require a non-negligible amount of engineering effort to connect identities, attributes, applications, flows, protocols, and many other elements.</p>



<p>Monokee simplifies this process with its Visual Identity Orchestrator (VIO), a drag-and-drop interface to build your authentication processes from scratch, starting from predefined blocks and connecting them in a flow-chart fashion as illustrated below.</p>







<p>Each block and connector in the resulting map represent parts of the process in a virtually codeless environment: Monokee’s visual builder turns that map into computer-generated code, with no room for human errors. The VIO is also a major improvement for process management. For example, adding an authentication factor in an existing process is just a matter of dragging a new block into the chart and inserting it into the flow.</p>



<p>The abstraction provided by Monokee’s VIO aligns perfectly with the vision of the ToIP foundation of an interoperable web of trust. Specifically, Monokee aims to bridge the gap that exists at layers 3 and 4 of the ToIP stack between classic centralized and federated ecosystems and new decentralized services and resources. While this obviously involves technical challenges, the real interoperability questions reside in the governance framework that coordinates the topmost ecosystem layer: how to embrace the new trust paradigm without tossing away the achievements of the last decade?</p>



<p>Monokee envisions a hybrid world capable of taking advantage of the structured, well-tested, and effective IAM solutions while incorporating decentralized and distributed elements to improve end-user privacy and usability. Monokee plans to provide resources and workforce to help ToIP working groups achieve their 2022 objectives, starting with the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification, anticipated for release in September 2022.</p>
