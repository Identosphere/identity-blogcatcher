 Simplicity: Break down BeL2 in layman’s terms. It should be easy to understand for someone without a technical background 
 Technical Depth: Your video must also cater to those who appreciate the technical nuances of BeL2. 
 Voice Over: While we prefer human narration, AI-generated voices are acceptable, the more realistic the better.

 AI-Generated Videos: We value and encourage human creativity in this competition. Therefore, videos that are entirely generated by AI will not be accepted. However, you may use AI tools to assist in certain aspects like editing or effects. Video length should be no more than 3 minutes in total. 
 Respect Intellectual Property: Ensure that your video respects intellectual property rights. This means avoiding the use of copyrighted video, audio, or any other content without permission. Use original or royalty-free materials to ensure compliance. 
 Content Authenticity and Accuracy: Your video should accurately represent the BeL2 technology and its features. Misrepresentation or factual inaccuracies could lead to disqualification. Make sure to fact-check and present genuine information about BeL2. 
 
 Resources to Help You

 Approach to Consider 
 
 Simplicity is Key: We encourage you to distill complex ideas into simple concepts. Remember, the best explanation is one that everyone can understand.

<p>Dear Elastos Community,</p>
<p>In a recent legal development, as of December 26th, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued a Final Order and Judgment in the case involving the Elastos Foundation, Feng Han, and Rong Chen. This judgment represents a pivotal moment in the proceedings, marking the resolution of the claims against Elastos and the individual defendants.</p>
<p>The case revolved around allegations from plaintiffs Mark Owen and James Wandling, who asserted that the defendants had violated sections of the Securities Act of 1933 by selling and soliciting unregistered ELA cryptocurrency tokens. The court’s recent action brings closure to these claims against Elastos and the individual defendants. This conclusion represents a significant turn in the case, outlining the boundary of resolved issues.</p>
<p>As we near the end of this significant legal chapter, it’s important for members of the Elastos community to be aware of ongoing opportunities and developments. A proposed settlement of $2 million to resolve these claims means that if you purchased or acquired ELA tokens between January 1, 2018, and July 27, 2023, you might be entitled to a share of this settlement. If you believe you are eligible and affected by this case, the court is still open to accepting class claims. Your participation is important, and we recommend you to take action.</p>
<p>What do I do?<br>
To submit your claim or to gain more insight into the process, please visit the <a href="https://www.elastossecuritieslitigation.com/">Elastos Securities Litigation page</a>. Additionally, a&nbsp;<a href="https://elastos.info/blog/ef-settlement-update/">guide</a> is available to assist you in navigating through the submission process. Remember, time is of the essence to ensure your involvement in this settlement. For those interested in the detailed history of the case, extensive information and updates are available <a href="https://casetext.com/case/owen-v-elastos-found-1">here</a>.</p>
<p>Whats next?<br>
We want to thank all those who have stayed firm and believed in Elastos over the years while this court case has been active. Your resilience and belief have allowed the project to keep growing and remain an innovator in supporting a user-owned internet. The recent legal developments have brought us to an exciting juncture, allowing us to shift our focus towards the future with renewed optimism.</p>
<p>One of our key commitments for 2024 is the innovative Bitcoin Layer 2 solution, <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-bel2-bitcoin-layer-2-solution/">BeL2</a>. This solution adds smart contract programmability and decentralised staking to Bitcoin, unlocking over $800 billion in dormant layer 1 value to enable smart finance, entertainment, and asset markets. Moreover, <a href="https://ela.city/">Elacity</a> is set to release its <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/YEeOIqG/elacity-access-economy-whitepaper-pdf">Access Economy Protocol</a> on Elastos on January 7th. This DRM protocol introduces scarce, content markets on the Elastos SmartWeb, starting with video, marking a significant milestone in showcasing the Elastos vision where creators can directly sell content to the world. How this technology converges into BeL2 only adds to the excitement of Elastos’ maturing journey.</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance’s Andrew Shikiar emphasises the need for enterprises to adapt cybersecurity strategies due to rising AI-driven social engineering threats and a push for greater cyber-transparency. Traditional methods like company-wide phishing training may become inadequate. Shikiar suggests reducing reliance on passwords and adopting passkeys, either synced or device-bound, as a more secure and user-friendly authentication approach.</p>

<p>Target is a retailer with locations across the U.S as well as online ecommerce operations. Target also provides loyalty and credit card services to its customers.</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case</p>



<p>The initial use case for FIDO at Target was to help enable a secure login experience across applications at the company, as part of a broader platform modernization effort.</p>



<p>Target’s challenge was to provide a consistent and secure login experience across applications at Target, to provide a seamless experience to its users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We had to reduce friction, wherever possible, be it in the authentication flow by reducing the dependencies on passwords, or in the onboarding process by making it easier for applications and business owners to easily consume the enterprise authentication services,” explained Nataraj Rao, Principal Engineer for Security Solutions at Target.</p>



<p>How Target Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>Target initially integrated a FIDO server with its Single Sign On (SSO) platform to provide multi-factor strong authentication capabilities.</p>



<p>“Support for a wide variety of authenticators makes it possible for team members to choose from a wide variety of authenticators and avoids a scenario where they are not able to move forward, just because they did not have a specific authenticator at that time,” Rao said.</p>



<p>With a solid understanding of how FIDO works and how it can be integrated with Target’s systems there are multiple use cases where it can be deployed. Among those use cases is for providing additional verification, in a multi factor authentication flow. FIDO can be used as the primary authenticator and can completely eliminate passwords from the login equation. It can be used for native authentication to mobile applications, providing a very intuitive login experience for Target’s mobile users.</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>FIDO2 in particular has been useful for Target as it’s integrated into most modern web browsers without the need for users to install any third-party software or plugin on their devices or browsers.</p>



<p>With FIDO, Target is able to provide a better authentication experience for its users and is taking steps toward enabling a passwordless future.</p>



<p>“We all know that it’s not easy to get rid of passwords immediately,” Rao said. “But let’s all take a step towards it.”</p>

<p>SURF is the shared IT organization for research institutes and universities in the Netherlands. The organization helps to connect over 100 different institutions across the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case:</p>



<p>With lots of students and educators that need access, SURF faces multiple challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2007, SURF has been developing and using a service it calls SURFconext, which provides a national identity federation for research and higher education. SURFconext is an identity federation that consists of over 180 different identity providers and it provides a single sign-on (SSO) capability for SURF’s member institutions. SURFconext is based on the SAML 2.0 standard and makes use of OpenID Connect and is used by 1.7 million people across the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last decade, there have been increasingly sensitive workloads and growing security concerns with accessibility. Some member institutions were only enforcing access with basic password authentication and there was a need to introduce multi-factor strong authentication.</p>



<p>How SURF Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>With multiple member organizations each using various technologies, SURF implemented an add-on service called SURFsecureID.</p>



<p>SURFsecureID is a hosted service that provides multi-factor authentication, with a step-up approach.</p>



<p>“The idea is that users authenticate at their home University using the password and before they are redirected to the service provider they are redirected to us where we require a second factor before sending them off to the service they initially requested,” explained<a href="https://authenticatecon.com/speaker/joost-van-dijk/"> Joost van Dijk</a>, Technical Product Manager at SURF.</p>



<p>The step up authentication approach makes use of FIDO2 standards to help protect SURF’s users.</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>With FIDO, SURF is now able to provide strong authentication to users across the Netherlands in an approach that helps to improve resiliency and security.</p>



<p>One particular risk that FIDO helps SURF to minimize is that of phishing attacks which has been a growing concern since at least the onset of the pandemic.<br>“Especially since the COVID crisis began, we’ve seen a lot of phishing campaigns launched against our users and we see FIDO2 as an excellent way to mitigate this threat,” commented Joost van Dijk, Technical Product Manager at SURF.</p>

<p>The Company:&nbsp;</p>



<p>CZ.nic is a domain registry organization in the Czech Republic that has been in operation since 1998. The organization manages over 1.3 million domains and is operated as a not-for-profit entity.</p>



<p>In addition to the administration of domain names, CZ.nic is active in the development and deployment of internet technologies as well as identity services.</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case:</p>



<p>One of the primary activities that the CZ.nic domain registry does is it needs to verify the identity of domain owners. CZ.nic has contact information on well over 800,00 domain owners and administrative contacts.</p>



<p>Verifying and authenticating the integrity of user identities is a key challenge that faces CZ.nic. The European Union has a regulation known as Network Information Security (NIS) version 2 (<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2021)689333">NIS2</a>) that recommends that top level domain registries like CZ.nic have technology and policies in place to properly verify domain owners.</p>



<p>“There’s a common agreement that illegal content is usually linked to fake identities,” explained Jaromir Talir, technical fellow at CZ.NIC and member of eIDAS Technical subgroup. “In the case of domains, there is definitely the possibility to register fake identities as domain owners.”</p>



<p>To that end, CZ.nic developed the<a href="https://www.mojeid.cz/en/"> mojeID</a> (my ID) service as a way to authenticate user identities. MojeID serves as a central identity service where an individual identity can be associated with a domain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MojeID also acts as an identity provider that ties into the European Union’s<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation"> eIDAS</a> (electronic identification and trust services) approach for an identity system that works across the EU.</p>



<p>How CZ.nic Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>CZ.nic started out with just a username and password for authentication and realized over time that there was a clear need to have stronger authentication options for users.</p>



<p>In 2018, CZ.nic began evaluating the FIDO U2F specification as a solution for two factor authentication. In 2019, CZ.nic shifted its focus to using FIDO2/WebAuthn as it began to roll out the technology for production deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>The use of FIDO2 provides CZ.nic with an extensible framework that works across desktop and mobile operating systems and devices.</p>



<p>With FIDO, CZ.nic is able to provide its users with strong authentication for identity verification. FIDO2/WebAuthn is also a core element of the eIDAS enablement for MojeID, which requires the use of a FIDO authenticator, alongside username/password for access.</p>



<p>As of July 2021, CZ.nic had over 30,000 users with FIDO security keys.</p>

<p>CVS Health is a U.S. healthcare organization that includes multiple operating divisions including retail with CVS Pharmacy, which has nearly 10,000 locations across America. CVS Health also includes a large healthcare insurance business that integrates assets from Aetna.</p>



<p>As of Q2 2023, CVS Health is using passkeys for consumer logins to their mobile web service.</p>



<p>The Challenge/ Use Case</p>



<p>The key focus for CVS Health is to ensure integrity and confidentiality of customer data. The overall user experience also needs to be positive, to drive traffic to CVS’s digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CVS Health is on a path to help make its consumer authentication experience not only secure, but easier to use. CVS Health is also on a path toward enabling password-less experiences for consumers wherever possible.</p>



<p>“For the external user, they would just simply walk away, if the user log in experience is cumbersome, in any way,” Cisa Kurian, senior security advisor at CVS Health commented. “Good security is always a balance between security and usability.”</p>



<p>How CVS Health Uses FIDO To Secure Its Users</p>



<p>CVS Health is building out an authentication platform to provide password-less authentication capabilities in its web, mobile, IoT and voice applications. Passwordless authentication is enabled with biometric authentication using FIDO standards</p>



<p>“Our goal is to increase friction for a potential threat actor, while enabling ease of use for the legitimate user,” Kurian said.</p>



<p>Benefits</p>



<p>By adopting a FIDO based approach, CVS Health is able to provide an easier authentication experience for its users. Making the login experience more seamless also helps to improve the overall user experience as well.</p>



<p>“We chose FIDO because the standards are open, and allow for simpler and stronger authentication that is based on public key cryptography,” Kurian said. “In other words, it’s easy to use and more secure, at the same time.”</p>

The impact of GenAI will be immense and it can significantly enhance counterfeit problems such as stealing intellectual property (IP) and lowering transparency across markets. Adding that to the already booming real-world counterfeit problem (estimated 10% counterfeit drugs globally, up to 50% of artworks suspected to be forgeries, $10–15 billion annual damages in the food and beverages industry&nbsp;…), there is a clear need to bring more powerful tools to counteract these trends and protect the innovators, artist, creators, and other IP owners.

Much like the unique DNA makeup of every person, consumer products can be outfitted with synthetically produced DNA tags unique to every unit, batch, or brand. These miniature DNA particles, or DNA tags, can be embedded in products or packaging, providing unique, tamper-proof identifiers, making counterfeiting extremely challenging. These tags can accompany and protect the authenticity of any physical RWA throughout its entire lifecycle. This can be achieved as the DNA is very hard to destroy, can be very well hidden, and has incredible storage capabilities so we need microscopically little of it (e.g. entire world’s data fits in a water bottle of&nbsp;DNA).</p><p>However, data in the DNA is not that easy to read and it cannot be frequently updated, which might be required and desired for many products. This is where the DKG steps in. By putting a smart anchor in the DNA and applying the global standard GS1 Digital Link on the product, we create a physical-to-digital connection that leads to extending the capabilities of the DNA tag. The DKG allows the product owner to add any additional information to it (about the production process, ingredients, quality parameters, ownership experiences).</p>Source: DATANA<p>All the information kept in the DKG has an owner and cannot be tampered with, giving the required digital protection. This protection extends towards the GenAI tools as well, as the DKG offers known sources that the GenAI can use and reference (see the Trusted AI framework implementation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHLkNCL9gCI">here</a>).</p><p>Looking towards the future, this technology could revolutionize sectors like luxury goods, where authenticity is paramount. In pharmaceuticals, it could be the backbone for verifying the legitimacy of drugs, combating counterfeit medicines that pose substantial risk to public health. In the food and beverage industry, it could ensure the origin and quality of organic or premium products, while in the art world, the powerful combination of technologies could authenticate artworks and historical artifacts.</p> DNA as a next-gen tool for authenticity verification <p>DNA-based tracking and authenticity verification offer a sophisticated and secure method for protecting real-world assets, leveraging the unique nature of DNA sequences. Products can be tagged using synthetic DNA markers modified to encode digital data, which are applied through various methods such as microscopic particles, direct surface application, integration into materials, or embedding in packaging. With its multiple and growing use cases, the DNA production industry is now advancing at an exponential rate.</p>Source: DATANA Benefits of DNA tagging&nbsp;systems <p>Using DNA for authenticity verification is a cutting-edge approach that leverages the unique and tamper-proof nature of DNA sequences. Here is how it can be implemented:</p>  DNA Tagging: Products can be tagged with synthetic DNA markers that are uniquely designed and nearly impossible to replicate. These markers can be applied to various products like luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, or agricultural products. The DNA sequences used are typically non-biological, meaning they do not come from living organisms but are artificially created.  Traceability: As products move through the supply chain, the DNA tag remains with them. This allows for the tracking of goods from the point of origin to the end consumer. At any stage of the supply chain, a sample of the DNA tag can be collected and analyzed.  Verification and Authentication: To verify the authenticity of a product, a small sample of the DNA tag is extracted and analyzed.  Simple and Covert Application: DNA tags can easily be applied to products in various covert forms (*see next section), preventing counterfeiters from detecting, replacing, or removing&nbsp;them.  Enhanced Encoding: Advanced DNA tagging systems also allow encoding significantly more data (metadata, media, etc.) into the tag itself, compared to alternative tracking forms (e.g. QR codes, barcodes). For example, a typical QR code can store roughly 1 kb of data, whereas a DNA tag can store up to 1MB of data (1000x&nbsp;more).  Regulatory Compliance and Quality Control: In industries like pharmaceuticals and food, DNA tagging can help ensure compliance with regulatory standards and improve quality control processes. This method is particularly valuable for high-value or sensitive products where authenticity and origin are crucial. The technology is advancing rapidly, making it more accessible and cost-effective for various industries.  <p>The application of DNA tags to products can vary depending on the type of product, the intended use of the tagging, and the durability required. Here are some common methods of applying DNA&nbsp;tags:</p>  Integration into Product Materials: For some products, DNA tags can be integrated into the material itself during the manufacturing process. This could involve adding DNA to plastics, textiles, or paper. For example, high-value clothing or documents can have DNA integrated into their fabric or&nbsp;paper.  Incorporation in Ink or Printing: DNA can be mixed with inks used for printing on products or their packaging. This method is useful for products that are already undergoing a printing process, such as packaged goods, books, or official documents.  Microscopic Particles or Encapsulation: DNA can be encapsulated in microscopic particles that are then applied to the product. These particles can be mixed into paints, varnishes, or adhesives that are then applied to the product’s surface. This method is often used for high-value items like artworks, electronics, or luxury&nbsp;goods.  Direct Application to Product Surfaces: In some cases, the DNA solution can be directly applied to the surface of the product. This could be through spraying, brushing, or immersing the product in the DNA solution. It is commonly used for products where the appearance is not a primary concern, or where the solution can be applied in an inconspicuous area.  Embedding in Packaging or Labels: DNA tags can be incorporated into the product’s packaging or labels. This is a less invasive method and is particularly useful for products where direct application of DNA might be impractical or could affect the product’s quality or integrity, such as food products or pharmaceuticals.  Coating with DNA-Infused Films: Products can be coated with a thin film that contains the DNA tag. This method is useful for a wide range of products, including electronics, automotive parts, and various consumer&nbsp;goods.  Injection into Products: In some cases, especially for large or solid items, the DNA tag can be injected into the product. This method ensures that the DNA is present inside the product, making it difficult to remove or tamper&nbsp;with.  Edible DNA Tags: For food products, edible DNA tags have been developed. These are safe for consumption and can be applied directly to the food or mixed into the food product during processing.  Source: DATANA Encoding DKG into DNA sequences: bridging digital and&nbsp;physical <p>Combining DNA tagging and OriginTrail technology can create a robust tool for enhanced supply chain tracking and authenticity verification for RWAs. Here is a brief overview of how these two technologies can be integrated:</p>  Assembling the Relevant Identifiers: The OriginTrail DKG enables connecting various identifiers across the entire product lifecycle to create a digital twin. These can include decentralized identities (DIDs), uniform asset locators or UALs (similar to URLs), and cryptographic proofs of the data (i.e. hashes) for immutability.  Encoding DKG into DNA Sequences: Depending on the product, tamper-proof data from the DKG (such as UALs) are then encoded into short, synthetic DNA sequences, which are “stitched” together in DATANA’s DNA writer. The initial encoding process translates the digital information into the biological sequence of DNA (A, T, C, G). Then, the physical DNA molecule is synthesized in a process that involves carefully mixing thousands of microscopic droplets containing the DNA building blocks at extreme speeds. Each mixture of droplets represents a unique biochemical reaction, resulting in the elongation of the data-coding DNA&nbsp;chain.  DNA Tagging: Synthetic DNA sequences, serving as trusted links to the DKG, are administered to the product as DNA tags, anchoring the connection between the product and the DKG digital twin. The selection of the DNA application method (microscopic particles, direct surface application, integration into materials or packaging, etc.) is contingent upon the product’s characteristics and the chosen implementation approach. Products undergo tagging with synthetic DNA markers employing diverse techniques like microscopic particles, direct surface application, integration into materials, or embedding in packaging. These distinctive DNA sequences are intentionally crafted to be tamper-proof and are exceptionally challenging to replicate.  Traceability and Verification: Throughout the supply chain journey, the DNA tag stays linked with the product. At any stage in the supply chain, it is possible to collect a sample of the DNA tag, followed by an analysis to extract the encoded data. As products progress through the supply chain, the DNA tag remains connected to them within the OriginTrail DKG. The interlinked knowledge assets construct a thorough and accessible record of the product’s voyage, incorporating details about manufacturing, transportation, storage, and&nbsp;sale.  DKG Verification: Retrieving digital data from DNA involves sequencing the DNA, translating its nucleotide sequence back to the original binary code. DNA sequencing is a rapidly advancing technology routinely used in molecular biology and genome sequencing. The DKG data extracted from the DNA sample undergoes comparison with what is stored on the OriginTrail DKG. If the two align, the product is confirmed as authentic, affirming that the information in the DKG aligns with the physical product. Authenticity verification involves collecting a small DNA tag sample from the product, followed by analysis using techniques like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to confirm its match with the original DNA sequence stored in the OriginTrail DKG.  Privacy and Ownership: OriginTrail DKG provides options for configuring privacy settings, and guaranteeing secure management of sensitive data, including the details about the placement of DNA tags and other product information. Verifiable transfer of ownership, encompassing the DNA-tagged identifiers ensures transparency and accountability.  Ensuring Data Integrity: The integrity of the product information is maintained through cryptographic hashing on the blockchain within the OriginTrail DKG, ensuring that the last state can be verified.  AI-powered product interaction: DKG makes all the product information AI-ready, easily connecting to the constantly advancing AI tools. It allows users to interact with information through questions and prompts that are most relevant to them — learning more about the brand history, production process, ingredients quality or DNA protection on their products. All the responses such an AI-powered system provides are based on inputs from the DKG. AI based semantic search solutions can be developed to simplify and enhance the interaction with trusted product information on the&nbsp;DKG.  Source: DATANA Vision of the&nbsp;future <p>From high costs and complexity in implementation, to the technological requirements, and the potential stability issues of DNA tags under different environmental conditions, the real-world use case of DNA-based tracking and authenticity verification in protecting real-world assets is, however, not without its limitations.</p><p>Overcoming these aforementioned limitations demands collaborations between leading ecosystem players, with each leveraging their expertise for mutual and collective benefits.

<p>The OpenID Foundation, in partnership with <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a>, would like to invite you to participate in an interoperability event where different implementers can demonstrate the compatibility of their implementations to the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) of the Shared Signals Framework (SSF), along with the Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC) profile. CAEP, SSF and RISC are open standards considered to be important to zero-trust security. Multiple implementers have announced their upcoming support for CAEP and related specs, as referenced in “<a href="https://openid.net/importance-of-shared-signals-framework/">The Importance of OpenID Foundation Shared Signals Framework</a>” on December 14, 2023.</p>
 Overview 
<p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/identity-access-management-uk">Gartner Identity &amp; Access Management Summit</a> will be held in London on March 4-5th, 2024. As a part of this summit, Gartner has invited the OpenID Foundation to host an interoperability event that demonstrates standards-based interoperability between implementer products that implement the OpenID specifications CAEP, SSF and optionally, RISC.</p>
<p>In order to make this event a success, the OpenID Foundation, in partnership with Gartner, would like to invite you to participate as an implementer in this event. Anyone with an eligible implementation may sign up to be an implementer at this interop event without a requirement to be a contributor to the Shared Signals WG or a member of the OpenID Foundation. An eligible implementation is not required to be a production-quality / shipping product, but needs to be one the implementer reasonably believes will be a part of their operational / production services or will be a part of their shipping products in the near future. Space is limited so implementers will be included on a “first come first served” basis.</p>
 Event Outline 
<p>The CAEP Interoperability Event will have the following structure:</p>
 
 On or before Jan 6th, 2024: Implementers indicate their interest in participation 
 On or before Jan 17th, 2024: OpenID Foundation specifies, after discussing with implementers, the use cases that may be demonstrated by implementers 
 On or before Feb 3rd, 2024: Implementers commit to their participation 
 Feb 3rd – March 2nd 2024: Implementers perform online testing of their implementations against the <a href="https://sgnl-ai.github.io/caep-interop/openid-caep-interoperability-profile-1_0.html">interoperability specification</a> provided by the OpenID Foundation. This profile is preliminary and is under active discussion by the Shared Signals WG. Anyone may participate in this WG to discuss the interop profile without cost by signing an <a href="https://openid.net/intellectual-property/openid-foundation-contribution-agreements/">OpenID Foundation Contribution Agreement</a>. Online testing may be performed using <a href="http://caep.dev/">caep.dev</a>&nbsp;or using peer implementations that are available for such testing. 
 March 3rd, 2024: Venue (the Interop Event room) open for the entire day for Interop Event implementers to set up and perform final interoperability tests 
 March 4th, 2024 11:45am – 12:15pm: Gartner analyst Erik Wahlstrom hosts a breakout session that includes a description of the Interop Event and announces its results. Shared Signals WG co-chair Atul Tulshibagwale will join Erik on stage for provide details and for demonstrating interoperable products 
 March 4 2024 12:15 until 5:00pm: Appointment slots will be available through the Gartner event application to visit the Interop room. Implementors will be able to show implementations to conference guests with appointments, and answer questions. 
 [Subject to Sponsorship and venue availability] VIP drinks ~4:30-7:00pm March 4th reception for interop implementers to celebrate their first interop event, and select government and IAM guests to provide informal feedback and advice to further accelerate market adoption. 
 
 Implementer Commitments Desired 
 
 By Jan 6, 2024, confirm interest in participation by sending email to Shared Signals WG co-chair, Atul Tulshibagwale* at atul@sgnl.ai

<p>* Capacity for this interop event is limited to 8 implementations due to limited venue capacity.&nbsp; As a result, we will record expressions of interest and participation commitments on a “first come first served” basis. If implementers miss any of the deadlines above they may lose their spot to an organization on the waitlist. We encourage all implementers to ensure they are fully prepared on a timely basis. We will also maintain a waitlist of implementers if more than 8 show interest or are willing to commit.</p>
 Participant FAQ 
<p>What Commitments does a participant need to make in order to participate:</p>
<p>Participants need to make the following commitments:</p>
 
 Presence at the Interop Event room from March 3-4th during normal business hours. 
 Demonstrate support for at least one use-case specified in the <a href="https://sgnl-ai.github.io/caep-interop/openid-caep-interoperability-profile-1_0.html">CAEP Interoperability Specification</a>. The demonstration can be on prototype / developer code, but the participant should reasonably believe that the feature will be available in a short time frame in one or more of that participant’s products 
 Work to demonstrate interoperability with other products that are a part of Interop Event for all use-cases the participant has committed to support 
 Make a video recording of all interoperability use-cases that have been successfully tested with other participants 
 
<p>Is there an online service where implementations may be tested beforehand?</p>
<p>Participants can test their implementations against an online service that will be posted soon, specific to the new interop test profile. In the meantime, implementers may choose to test their implementations (transmitters and receivers) against caep.dev, a service developed by SGNL in partnership with the OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>What signage may be presented in the Interop Event room by participants?</p>
<p>Signage will be made available on each of the tables where the interop demonstrations will be conducted in the breakout room 12:15-5:00pm March 4, 2024.</p>
<p>How will my product be displayed to the audience?</p>
<p>An OpenID Foundation representative will demonstrate all use-cases where there are more than 1 participant on stage. In order to demonstrate the use-cases, the OpenID Foundation will use some of the implementer products. All implementer products may be seen by the audience when they visit the Interop Event room. Gartner will invite people to visit the Interop Event room at the end of the presentation, and make appointments via the conference event application.</p>
<p>Is there a cost to implementers?</p>
<p>There is no cost to implementers to take part in this interoperability event.&nbsp; We are seeking an implementer willing to sponsor a small drinks reception on March 4th, 2024. More generally, we warmly welcome all implementers joining the OpenID Foundation as <a href="https://openid.net/intellectual-property/openid-foundation-contribution-agreements/">contributors</a> (at no cost) and as <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/benefits-members/">members</a> to support and sustain the OpenID Foundation.</p>

When observed through the lens of the provenance and lineage of data, many challenges and design choices are inherently unique to a peer-to-peer, multi-directional replication layer that enables multi-master, eventually consistent databases to be built on top. As the article referenced above points out, the paradigm of true “user-controlled data” does not exist in traditional database terms, since user-generated content is authored by dedicated servers on the users’ behalf.</p><p>More recently, our team has been discussing and working on additional features to ComposeDB that feel different compared to those aimed to provide functional parity with what developers should expect from a database layer. Whereas the ability to filter and order based on schema subfields feels like a basic utility expectation, our more recent discussions around introducing features that allow developers to define single-write schemas, for example, call on use cases unique to decentralized data.</p><p>These feature ideas, and more importantly the problem statements behind them, impact certain patterns of data control more than others. These different architectural patterns are what we’ll attempt to unpack below by tying together their design, specific needs, how teams are currently building with them, and what role they play in the broader <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/into-the-dataverse/">dataverse</a>.</p> Users vs. Apps: Data Creation and Ownership <p>We’ve broken down these predominant patterns in the table below:</p><p>Before we dive in, it’s important to point out that the way Ceramic “accounts” (represented by <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/accounts/decentralized-identifiers?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDs</a>) interact with the network is itself a novel paradigm in data storage, and more akin to blockchain accounts transacting with a smart contract network. This is an important key to the underlying architecture that allows for the diversity of “data control” outlined in the table above. This article assumes readers are already familiar with this setup, at least on a basic level.</p><p>Finally, our position on these patterns is of the perspective that all are necessary and important to a diverse data ecosystem. As we’ll outline below, these emergent behaviors arise from the real needs of the applications that use them and their users. We hope that this article will help developers understand why these different models exist, what trade-offs and considerations they incur, and use that information to approach their data design in a more informed way.</p><p>With that out of the way, let’s dive deeper into each of these patterns.</p> Application-Generated, Application-Controlled <p>When I think of an archetypal use case for this quadrant, the idea of a “data oracle” comes to mind. That oracle is responsible for:</p>  Bridging the “gap” between two disparate networks by reporting data  Reliably providing said data in an opinionated, predictable, and steadily frequent way  <p>Looking at it through this lens, the “application-generated” thought transforms into more of an “application-provided” idea. Though the data itself originates elsewhere, the role of the oracle is to retrieve it, transform it into whichever format is needed by the storage layer, and write it to its final destination.</p><p>There are commonalities in behavior across teams creating and using this data quadrant:</p><p>Use of DID:Key</p>  Unsurprisingly, an application dedicated to writing reporting data to Ceramic frequently will be using a static seed (or set of static seeds) to authenticate DID:Key(s) on the Ceramic node  <p>Server-Side Generation, Server-Side Writes</p>  Given that the method used to write data to Ceramic doesn’t require authentication with a browser wallet, this action can be easily created as a server-side service  Similarly, another server service would be responsible for retrieving data from the data source and transforming it before supplying it to the service that writes it to Ceramic  <p>Application as the Trusted Vector</p>  Other teams relying on data provided by an oracle need to trust that the service won’t have intermittent failures  <p>Data Availability Motives</p>  As far as composability goes, the application writing the data, along with other applications building on that data, are incentivized to sync the data to ensure persistence  <p>Unique Needs</p>  Beyond basic sorting and filtering needed by any applications building on this data type, not much is needed  Consumers of this data (which is likely the application that controls it) trust the logic that was used to write the data to the network  <p>Ceramic Example</p>  Orbis authors <a href="https://scan.s3.xyz/streams/profile/did:key:z6MkkauvinSwdvqT6k44GZG6MArjD3qXiiEwfi5sKiHJ3JaE?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Pricefeed Data</a> to Ceramic to serve as an oracle   Application-Generated, User-Controlled <p>As outlined in the table, a great example that falls into this category would be credential data. In the analog world, universities issue diplomas to their students. The diploma is typically signed by the university’s chancellor or president, but the physical document is transferred and kept by the student (I understand that this is not a perfect analogy in the sense that it’s typically the university that verifies a student has received a diploma by employers or other interested parties).</p><p>In a broadly similar sense, this category manifests in Ceramic as tamper-evident data that are cryptographically signed by the application but point to the end user that controls its storage. Perhaps the data is encrypted by the user before it’s stored in Ceramic, with access control conditions to grant only whitelisted parties viewing abilities. Due to its tamper-evident qualities, all parties can rest assured of the fidelity of the data’s contents.</p><p>Here are some commonalities:</p><p>Use of DID:PKH</p>  The resulting Ceramic documents are almost always written by the user with an authenticated session created by their blockchain wallet  <p>Server-Side Generation, Client-Side Writes</p>  In the case of credentials, the application is likely using a static key to generate payloads server-side (once certain application conditions are met) and passes the payload to the user to write with the authenticated session stored in the browser  <p>Application as the Trusted Vector</p>  What matters most for consumers of this data is the application that attested to it and signed it  While the user has technical control over the data and who they share it with (if they encrypt it), they cannot change the data’s values  <p>Data Availability Motives</p>  We can assume that some of this data will be highly valuable—perhaps the application that issues the credential is highly respected and unlocks a lot of gates for the end user  The user that controls these documents will likely be the most compelled party to keep this data available. It will be important for other applications that consume this data, but arguably not as much  <p>Tamper-Evident, Cryptographically Signed</p>  Behavior is already aggregating along the lines of standards and formats like <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/examples/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS Off-Chain Attestations</a>  <p>Unique Needs</p>  Under the use case example referenced above, applications that issue data for their users to store typically don’t reference other data (for example, a relation to another Ceramic document) that can easily be changed—each data object is inherently <code>whole</code>  Therefore, I’d argue no unique needs are obvious or necessary for this quadrant either  <p>Ceramic Example</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-builds-passport-on-ceramic/">Gitcoin Passport</a> issues Verifiable Credentials to its users while giving the users Ceramic ownership of their instances   User-Generated, Application-Controlled <p>This unique category feels most similar to what we’re used to in Web2, though the use cases in Ceramic might be somewhat novel. For example, if you think back to the tamper-evident qualities of an application-generated credential that’s stored by the user we referenced in the last section, the inverse could be necessary for some applications. Perhaps an application wants to create a petition that’s cryptographically signed by multiple users, but ownership of the final document that aggregates the individual signatures should be in the hands of the facilitator.</p><p>Perhaps the broader use case is positioned around collaboration, allowing individuals to input into the document with the resulting document representing that unified effort.</p><p>In terms of commonalities:</p><p>Use of DID:Key</p>  The application will most likely be authoring Ceramic documents using a static seed or set of seeds  <p>Client-Side Input, Server-Side Transformation, Server-Side Writes</p>  Under this design, it’s likely that the application is receiving input from user browser sessions but is set up such that once a condition has been met, it will transform the data into the format necessary to write it to Ceramic  <p>Application Server May or May Not Require Trust</p>  If the inputs from the users are in a format that’s tamper-evident, end users interacting with this setup simply need to trust that the server writes the data to Ceramic, but do not need to worry about data fidelity  <p>Data Availability Motives</p>  If the application’s primary value proposal is its ability to facilitate coordination across users or transform data in creative ways, the controlling application is most motivated to keep the data available (alongside other applications consuming it)  <p>Unique Needs</p>  Feature needs for this quadrant should be highly similar to the “application-generated, application-controlled” category, in the sense that the application can trust the static logic of its servers not to intentionally change and ruin its data   User-Generated, User-Controlled <p>We anticipate this final category to eventually be the most common across applications built on Ceramic, and much of the momentum we’ve witnessed thus far aligns with that narrative. More importantly, while each of these categories is valuable to the ecosystem, this one speaks most to the narrative around data interoperability, making the concept of users interacting with the same data primitives they own across disparate environments and applications possible.</p><p>A great showcase example would be a social application framework that allows users to create posts, comment on posts, and react to content, all tied together by a parent “context” representing an application environment. Other social applications can read from and build off of the same content artifacts, or define a unique context that uses the same data primitives but swaps out the connective tissue.</p><p>Under this model, users have sovereign control of their documents. Even if a user creates a session key that allows a malicious application to write incorrect data on their behalf, the session key will ultimately expire (or is manually revoked by the user), the application loses its write privileges, the Ceramic document never transfers ownership, and the user overwrites the data. End users are equally free to spin up custom UIs and nodes and edit their data that will render in the interfaces of the applications that defined those models.</p><p>However, high flexibility brings important considerations:</p><p>Use of DID:PKH</p>  This shouldn’t be surprising since most users will be creating authenticated sessions from their browser wallet  <p>Client-Side Generation, Client-Side Writes</p>  This also shouldn’t be controversial given that the inputs are coming from end users, and their sessions are authenticated to write the data to Ceramic  <p>Network Data Sync</p>  This is where more complexity comes into play. For the data users generate to propagate and become usable between applications, their underlying Ceramic nodes must sync and share information  While a multi-node architecture may be required for a single application (in which case the data sync is still important as far as performance goes), in this context I’m referring to data sharing across nodes operated by separate applications  To reduce or eliminate the necessity of trust between application environments, the underlying protocol must have built-in features to ensure data fidelity. Team A should not have to rely on the competency of Team B, and shouldn’t suffer if Team B somehow messes up  <p>Data Availability Motives</p>  Interest in keeping the data available should be fairly shared between the end users and the applications that use it  <p>Ceramic Example</p>  <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/orbis-launches-web3-social-protocol-on-ceramic-mainnet-and-opens-sdk-to-developers/">Orbis</a> is a social data model that provides intuitive tooling for developers who want to build social timelines, comment systems, private messaging, and more  <p>Unique Needs</p>  I think this is where we wade into territory that’s best illustrated by hypothetical situations:  <p>Let’s say a trust system for open-source software plugins is built on Ceramic. Individual plugins are represented by ComposeDB models. For example:</p> <code>type Plugin
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple plugin")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "name" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "checkSum" }]) 
{
    owner: DID! @documentAccount 
    name: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
    description: String @string(maxLength: 100)
    created: DateTime!
    checkSum: String! @string (minLength: 64, maxLength: 64)
}</code> <p>Let’s assume that the <code>checkSum</code> field in this example represents the SHA-256 hash of the plugin’s code.</p><p>For people to trust and use the plugins, they rely on representations of user-generated trust:</p> <code>type Plugin @loadModel(id: "...") {
    id: ID!
}

type Trust
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A trust model")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "trusted" }])
{
    attester: DID! @documentAccount 
    trusted: Boolean! 
    reason: String @string(maxLength: 1000)
    pluginId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "Plugin")
    plugin: Plugin! @relationDocument(property: "pluginId")
}</code> <p>Under this current setup, you can easily imagine the following problematic situations:</p>  <code>Plugin A</code> receives a ton of authentic, well-intentioned trust signals over a few weeks. The controller of the <code>Plugin A</code> stream then decides to switch out the value of the <code>checkSum</code> field to refer to a malicious plugin that steals your money. Because the relationship is defined by the plugin’s stream ID, those positive trust signals will by default point to the latest commit in the event log (the malicious plugin)  <code>Plugin A</code> receives a ton of deceptive positive trust signals, all from <code>Account A</code>. Because (at the time of writing this article) there’s nothing that prevents <code>Account A</code> from doing so, <code>User Interface A</code> and <code>User Interface B</code> are left to do some custom client-side work to sort through the noise and present the truth to the end user. Since there are multiple ways of doing so, mistakes are made by <code>User Interface B</code>, and the end user is tricked yet again  <p>You can start to see the real ways these issues simply don’t exist elsewhere under the safeguard of an application’s server preventing adverse or unexpected behavior.</p> Solutions Actively Underway <p>Bringing this back to Ceramic’s current roadmap, we have two active feature integrations we’re working on to address these unique problems, each of which is actively in request-for-comment stages:</p><p>Native Support for Single-Write Documents (field locking)</p><p>This <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/rfc-native-support-for-single-write-documents-with-field-locking/1398?ref=blog.ceramic.network">active RFC</a> (request for comment) details a feature that would allow developers to define schemas that prevent certain fields within a model from being updated after the document is created. Using the <code>Plugin</code> example above, you can imagine how this might be useful in preventing a <code>Plugin</code> controller from maliciously updating key fields like <code>checkSum</code> to prevent users from being tricked.</p><p>A refactor of the <code>Plugin</code> schema definition using this feature might instead look like:</p> <code>type Plugin
    @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A simple plugin")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "name" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "created" }])
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "checkSum" }]) 
{
    owner: DID! @documentAccount 
    name: String! @locking @string(maxLength: 100)
    description: String @string(maxLength: 100)
    created: DateTime! @locking
    checkSum: String! @locking @string (minLength: 64, maxLength: 64)
}</code> <p>While actual syntax may vary, the <code>@locking</code> directive here is meant to identify the subfields that would be prevented from being updated after the document is created (most importantly, the <code>checkSum</code>).</p><p>Native Support for Unique-List Documents (”SET” accountRelation)</p><p>This <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/rfc-native-support-for-unique-list-relationships-between-stream-types-and-accounts/1406?ref=blog.ceramic.network">RFC</a> would help prevent situation #2 above from happening. While ComposeDB would currently allow <code>Account A</code> from creating as many <code>Trust</code> instances for <code>Plugin A</code> as they wanted (thus leaving it up to the competency and inference of the applications or interfaces using that data to resolve), this instead would make the following possible:</p> <code>type Plugin @loadModel(id: "...") {
    id: ID!
}

type Trust
    @createModel(accountRelation: SET, accountRelationField: "pluginId")
    @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "trusted" }])
{
    attester: DID! @documentAccount 
    trusted: Boolean! 
    reason: String @string(maxLength: 1000)
    pluginId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "Plugin")
    plugin: Plugin! @relationDocument(property: "pluginId")
}</code> <p>Under this design, users can create as many instances of <code>Trust</code> as they want, but prevents them from creating more than 1 for any 1 plugin, given that the constraining field is on the <code>pluginId</code> field.</p> Get Involved <p>For you readers who find this problem space compelling, or want to get involved in ways that help shape the future of ComposeDB, we encourage you to react in the forum to the RFCs we mentioned above.

  <p>By Coleen Jose, Head of Community, CAI</p><p>When a group of 59 organizations gathered in January 2020 for the first Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) Summit, generative AI tools were not available for mass consumption. The main themes then were media literacy, context and intent, and the need to find a solution that drives trust and transparency online while mitigating the potential for bad actors. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Those discussions laid the foundation for the C2PA standard, verifiable Content Credentials, and the CAI’s open-source tools. Attendees envisioned these pillars as a way of ensuring clarity about the origins and history of the visual stories and media we consume online.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2020, the proliferation of mis- and disinformation across social media was also top of mind. Newsrooms and readers were struggling with challenging questions: How can we verify the origins of photographs and videos? How do we confirm facts emerging from a breaking news event? How do detection tools and digital forensics keep up with technological advances and the torrent of content before it goes viral?&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the speed of innovation in generative AI has again brought trust and transparency to the forefront. The potential of AI to both do good and cause harm is a dominant question&nbsp;in industry, policy, and media circles.&nbsp;</p><p>At this year’s CAI Symposium, held on Dec. 7, similar themes emerged. This time, over 200 people attended—from direct business competitors to experts in cryptography, identity, media, and policy. What they had in common was a commitment to the pursuit of an open solution to build trust and transparency into the digital ecosystem. Participants reflected the growing momentum of C2PA adoption across devices, software, services, and platforms. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Co-hosted with Stanford Data Science, the event was a full day of presentations, breakout sessions, and hands-on demonstrations from the CAI community.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are three takeaways from the CAI Symposium:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Scaling the chain of trust. Speakers from Adobe, the Partnership on AI, and WITNESS alluded to the importance of scaling trust and transparency solutions from the ground up, starting with frontier models, research, and development stages to the end-user experience. We saw hardware innovations in the form of Leica’s M11-P camera, the world’s first Content Credentials-enabled camera, which the company plans to extend to other products. With the introduction of generative AI tools on mobile devices, Qualcomm shared how building the C2PA standard into its chip processers can add transparency and mitigate potential harms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;2. Elections and media integrity. Forty countries representing 3.2 billion people will go to the polls in 2024, and we’re already seeing AI-generated images and videos influencing the democratic process. Additionally, a steady stream of misleading imagery and deepfakes are emerging from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The stakes have never been higher for media authenticity, and our work in this space is critically important. &nbsp;We were thrilled to highlight that BioBioChile became the world’s first media organization to implement Content Credentials on a live news website. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;3. User experience and consumer education. Significant work lies ahead to establish the <a href="https://contentcredentials.org">Content Credentials icon</a> as the starting point for a new language of authenticity and context. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, one area with immense potential for innovation is ensuring an accessible, simple, and clear experience across mobile and web platforms. As technology continues to advance, it will be crucial to create a seamless and user-friendly interface for verifying content authenticity. This commitment to accessibility and clarity will play a pivotal role in enhancing user experience and promoting trust in the digital landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>The expertise and industry leadership that the CAI community brings spans engineering, product, trust infrastructure, policy, media, creativity, and education. We’re inspired by the ever-increasing adoption of Content Credentials and excited to take on the challenges ahead, together.&nbsp;</p><p>What began as a sea of promising ideas at the 2020 CAI Summit has evolved into a deep focus on deploying Content Credentials. The way forward depends on enabling honest discourse, surfacing challenges, and building solutions. If one thing was evident at this year’s Symposium, it's this community's commitment to that path.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to our speakers, moderators, and demo presenters! </p>  <p>Opening Remarks by Dana Rao, Adobe</p>  <p>Leica Content Credentials by Nico Kohler and Jesko von Oeynhausen, Leica</p>  <p>C2PA Primer by Leonard Rosenthol, Adobe</p>  <p>Trust and attestation in a modern mobile SoC by Asaf Shen, Qualcomm</p>  <p>Navigating Trust: Provenance Technology in Journalism by Santiago Lyon, Adobe and David Clinch, Media Growth Partners</p>  <p>Perspectives from the MediFor and SemaFor Programs by Matt Turek, DARPA</p>  <p>Content Authenticity with Zero Knowledge by Dan Boneh, Stanford University</p>  <p>Safe and Sound?

  Union Farms: A leading pork producer achieves carbon neutrality in the name of sustainability
 
 
     

 
             Union Farms in Nebraska has addressed the challenge of measuring environmental impact in agriculture by adopting GS1 standards. 
     

 
             <p>In farming, despite its close connection to the earth, capturing, measuring, and analysing data for sustainability proves complex. This complexity is amplified in animal farming, where considerations like food safety and public health come into play.</p>

<p>Union Farms has addressed this challenge by integrating GS1 standards into its grain and pork operations. This integration allows for meticulous measurement of products and processes, with a focus on carbon sequestration, water, energy, and fertiliser stewardship.</p>

<p>The result is impressive – carbon neutrality, increased profitability through carbon credits, and future-proofing the family farm for subsequent generations.</p>

<p>Drawing over 300 attendees from 12 distinct nations, including Vietnam, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, India, the UK, the USA, and Australia, the FIDO APAC Summit 2023 fostered rich discussions and collaborations. With a lineup of 29 speakers from diverse sectors such as government agencies, corporate enterprises, e-commerce platforms, solution vendors, service providers, and manufacturing firms, the event facilitated the sharing of expertise and insights over the fruitful days of the conference.</p>







<p>[Pictures from the Main Sessions: August 29th]</p>



 



<p>During the event, attendees had the opportunity to delve deep into more than 30 developer workshops and deployment/implementation case studies, each one offering a window into the rapidly expanding adoption of phishing-resistant FIDO Authentication across the APAC region and beyond. These sessions revealed several critical insights, highlighting current trends and forecasting the promising future of this essential technological progression. Here are some notable observations:</p>



<p>Google: From 2019 to 2022, the APWG (Anti-Phishing Working Group) Phishing Activity Trends Report indicated that the number of phishing attacks increased by more than 150% per year. Attacks targeting the financial sector accounted for 27.7% of all phishing attacks.

<p>The ToIP Foundation is pleased to announce a 30 day public review of the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/index.html">did:webs Method Specification</a>. This blog post will explain the motivations for creating this new method for creating and resolving <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs), and also how to participate in the public review process.</p>



 Background 



<p>When DIDs were first invented, the inventors thought that someday there might be perhaps a dozen or so different types of DIDs, called <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">DID methods</a>. Their reasoning was that DIDs solved a very narrow problem—how to create a cryptographically-verifiable identifier—an identifier over which the controller (person, organization, device, bot, etc.) could prove control by virtue of having the associated private key. This new type of identifier would not need to be registered with any centralized authority and could not be spoofed or taken away by some other party (unless they could steal the private key).</p>



<p>Each DID method was simply a different way of specifying how the DID could be securely bound to a public/private key pair. While there are of course multiple ways to do that, what the DID inventors didn’t anticipate is: a) how badly cryptographically verifiable identifiers were needed, and, as a consequence, b) how many DID methods would be created. By the time the DID specification reached <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/w3c-vision-of-decentralization/">a final vote at the W3C</a> in 2022, 112 DID methods had been registered in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">W3C DID Spec Registries</a>. As of this writing, there are now 184.</p>



 The did:web method 



<p>That’s 184 different ways to create a DID and resolve it to its corresponding DID document (which is where you find the current public key together with other metadata such as the network service endpoint where you can communicate with the controller). Given this massive number of options, it is no surprise that many developers threw up their hands and chose the one that seemed the easiest and most familiar: the did:web method.</p>



<p>What makes the did:web method so intuitive is that all it requires is posting a DID document on a web server. The resulting DID is simply: a) the string did:web: followed by the domain name of the web server and—optionally—the path name to the DID document (with each forward slash turned into a colon). Here’s a simple example: if the DID document will be stored at the URL:</p>



<p>     <code>https://example.com/user/alice</code></p>



<p>…then the corresponding did:web DID is:</p>



<p>     <code>did:web:example.com:user:alice</code></p>



<p>It is that easy. The irony is that the did:web method was very nearly rejected by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID Working Group</a> for two reasons:</p>



 
 It is a stretch to call it decentralized since it depends on DNS domain names which require centralized registries. 



 As a result, it inherits all of the security flaws of DNS, and then adds the additional vulnerabilities of storing a “naked” DID document on a web server. Since the DID document contains the public key associated with the DID, anyone who can manage to replace the real DID document with their own version can completely hijack the DID. 
 



<p>For these reasons, once DID adoption started to kick in, it came as somewhat of a shock that did:web was proving to be so popular. In fact, some DID proponents became quite worried that the security issues with did:web might lead to a breach whose ensuing publicity might give all DIDs a bad name.</p>



 The light bulb 



<p>Thankfully, as those concerns mounted, by the summer of 2023, no less than four independent groups all had the same basic insight: the flaws in did:web could be fixed by tunneling a self-certifying identifier inside a did:web string.</p>



<p>What is a self-certifying identifier? See the following diagram that categorizes the three overall types of DIDs by the approach they take to how the DID is bound to the key pair:</p>







<p>In short, a conventional did:web DID is a category 1 administrative DID whose security depends on: a) a TLS certificate administered by a certificate authority, and b) the administrator of the web server. That’s two humans-in-the-loop, either of whose defenses can be penetrated to compromise the DID.</p>



<p>By contrast, a category 3 self-certifying DID, also called an autonomous DID is generated directly inside a digital wallet or hardware security module (HSM) and cryptographically bound to the associated DID. That means there are zero humans-in-the-loop. Anyone with a copy of the DID document can instantly verify—using only a cryptographic proof—that it is bound to that DID and only that DID.</p>



 The did:webs method 



<p>What the different groups realized is that all it takes to “tunnel” a self-certifying identifier inside a conventional did:web DID is to include it as the final path segment. So if the self-certifying identifier is:</p>



<p><code>Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M</code></p>



<p>…and the URL of the folder that will contain the DID document is…</p>



<p><code>https://example.com/user/</code></p>



<p>…then the resulting did:webs DID is:</p>



<p><code>https://example.com/user/Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M</code></p>



<p>In short, a did:webs DID is a valid did:web DID that has special cryptographic properties Thankfully, those properties solve both of the key challenges with the did:web method:</p>



 
 did:webs is more decentralized because, even though resolution of the did:web domain name depends on DNS, the security of the embedded self-certifying identifier does not. It can be generated and maintained in any digital wallet or key management system anywhere. In fact the same self-certifying identifier can be included in multiple did:webs DIDs stored on different web servers around the web, and they all serve as synonyms for each other (which can be explicitly declared in the did:webs DID document—see the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/index.html">did:webs specification</a> for details). 



 did:webs is more secure because security does NOT depend on the web server. If the web server is hacked and an attacker replaces the did:webs DID document with their own, the fake DID document will not verify because (unless the attacker has stolen the private key), it will not be cryptographically bound to the did:webs DID. 
 



 The did:webs Method Task Force 



<p>Armed with this insight that the simplicity and ease of implementation of did:web could be combined with the decentralization and security properties of self-certifying identifiers, the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/DID+WebS+Method+Task+Force">did:webs Method Task Force</a> was formed in July 2023. The mission was to develop a specification for the did:webs DID method that met the requirements defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification</a>, including creation, resolution, updating, and deactivation of did:webs DID documents.</p>



<p>Given that self-certifying identifiers have always been a foundational feature of the KERI family of specifications being developed by the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ToIP ACDC Task Force</a>, the new did:webs Method Task Force was able to rapidly draft a specification based on the autonomic identifiers (AIDs) used by KERI.</p>



<p>The task force previewed their draft did:webs specification at the 37th Internet Identity workshop in Mountain View, California. First Markus Sabadello and Lance Byrd presented <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BC9y4YvLPwOJwnwpwl8puJYwJHUONLovLITxOCOK8FY/edit?usp=sharing">did:webs for Muggles</a>, then Markus gave his <a href="https://github.com/peacekeeper/did-webs-iiw37-tutorial">did:webs IIW37 Tutorial</a> which covered:</p>



 
 how to create a did:webs identifier,&nbsp; 



 how the associated KERI self-certifying identifier secures the DID document,&nbsp; 



 how to host the information on Github or any other web server, and&nbsp; 



 how the <a href="https://dev.uniresolver.io/">DIF Universal Resolver</a> resolves both the did:web and did:webs versions of the DID document. 
 



<p>Following the feedback received at IIW, the task force further refined the specification and verified it with several implementations. By early December, the task force was ready to request a full public review.</p>

<p>We’ve discussed in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/attestations-vs-credentials-making-claims-interoperable/">Attestations vs. Credentials</a> blog and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/examples/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable Credentials</a> guide how to make two claim standards “work together” on ComposeDB by improving querying efficiency and composability as a result of integrating interfaces. Taking a step back, one of the core benefits these formats unlock for developers is the tamper-evident verification assurance that the resulting signature payloads provide. More broadly, developers (and by extension the users of their applications) who want to use verifiable claims in their applications value claim portability.</p> Why does claim portability matter? <p>Unlike a public blockchain that reveals the behavior of a user address simply by observing its transaction history, claims produced in 'off-chain' environments require different qualities to be inherently 'provable'. At the same time, many developers agree that for certain types of data, or certain application environments, a fully on-chain architecture is both cost-inefficient and non-performant. As a result, some of the systems we’re seeing built on Ceramic today use standards like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> or <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/easscan/offchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS Offchain Attestations</a> to provide portability assurances.</p><p>Each document written to Ceramic in the form of a Verifiable Credential or off-chain EAS Attestation payload contains everything needed to later recall the document from Ceramic and validate the signatures. The document can therefore be considered “whole” and simply requires minor reconstruction (to create a Verifiable Presentation in the case of a VC, for example).</p> So, what’s the issue? <p>In the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/attestations-vs-credentials-making-claims-interoperable/">Attestations vs. Credentials</a> post, we used a simple <a href="https://beta.api.schemas.serto.id/v1/public/trusted-reviewer/1.0/ld-context.json?ref=blog.ceramic.network">VC definition</a> that is simply meant to illustrate a trust credential issued from one account that points to another. The credential subject therefore only contained two fields:</p>  <code>isTrusted</code> : a boolean field that represents whether the party is trusted or not  <code>id</code> : the DID of the recipient account  <p>Despite the brevity of this credential type, the payload of one example EIP712 instance was quite verbose:</p> <code>{

}</code> <p>As a result, the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/user-controlled-claims/blob/main/composites/00-verifiableClaims.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">schemas</a> used to capture and store the VCs required several layers of interfaces with many subfields. Additionally, as mentioned before, the data itself would still require a process of normalization to create a presentation to be verified (for example the <code>context</code> key used in the ComposeDB schema would need to be replaced with <code>@context</code>).</p><p>This example also requires the end user to sign a transaction in their browser wallet each time a Verifiable Credential is issued, regardless of whether they wish to use a JWS or EIP-712 proof type. You can imagine how this would become cumbersome to a user who wants to issue several in one sitting.</p><p>The entirety of this setup seems like overkill for an assertion that uses such a simple data model. While it may be a necessity for architectures that require the W3C Verifiable Credential standard, those that don’t can ensure claim portability more simply. What if we instead leverage Ceramic’s core capabilities to more seamlessly design an architecture that accomplishes verifiable claims?</p> Example Application: Walk-Through <p>To illustrate how to do this, we’ve put together the following repository that this section of the article will reference:</p> <code>https://github.com/ceramicstudio/did-session-claims</code> <p>Before we begin to boot up a local deployment of our application, let’s talk through how our user authentication is configured, and how this relates to the portability of the claims we’ll produce.</p> Authentication <p>This example uses WalletConnect’s <a href="https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal</a> module to pass authentication logic down through the child components of this application (thus making it possible for us to use for Ceramic authentication). If you navigate into <code>/src/pages/_app.tsx</code>, you can see how our Wagmi configuration encompasses our ComposeDB wrapper, both of which encompass any React components we’ll render to our client.</p><p>Let’s take a deeper look at the ComposeDB wrapper imported and used at the top level of our application. If you open up <code>/src/fragments/index.tsx</code>, you’ll notice how we’re using a React <code>createContext</code> hook to make our ComposeDB client (with our casted runtime definition), an <code>isAuthenticated</code> value, and a <code>keySession</code> object available to any child components that import and call the exported <code>useComposeDB</code> method.</p><p>Take a look at what’s happening in the <code>useEffect</code> hook within the <code>ComposeDB</code> parent object:</p> <code>export const ComposeDB = ({ children }: ComposeDBProps) =&gt; {
  function StartAuth(isAuthenticated: boolean = false) {
    const { data: walletClient, isError, isLoading } = useWalletClient();
    const [isAuth, setAuth] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
      async function authenticate(
        walletClient: GetWalletClientResult | undefined
      ) {
        if (walletClient ) {
          const accountId = await getAccountId(walletClient, walletClient.account.address)
          console.log(walletClient.account.address, accountId)
          const authMethod = await EthereumWebAuth.getAuthMethod(walletClient, accountId)
          // create session
          const session = await DIDSession.get(accountId, authMethod, { resources: compose.resources })
          //set DID on Ceramic client
          await ceramic.setDID(session.did)
          await session.did.authenticate();
          console.log("Auth'd:", session.did.id);
          localStorage.setItem("did", session.did.id);
          keySession = session;
          setAuth(true);
        }
      }
      authenticate(walletClient);
    }, [walletClient]);

    return isAuth;
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    isAuthenticated = StartAuth();
  }

  return (
    &lt;Context.Provider value={{ compose, isAuthenticated, keySession }}&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/Context.Provider&gt;
  );
};</code> <p>Since we know our application will be using a wallet client (given our use of Web3Modal), we’ll rely on Wagmi’s <code>useWalletClient</code> method to obtain an account ID and authentication method that we’ll later use as arguments to create a <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/api/modules/did_session/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DID session</a>. In effect, the result creates and authorizes a DID session key for the user, and authorizes that session key with capabilities to write only across the specific data models references in the <code>{resources: compose.resources}</code> object argument. This is the predominant way blockchain accounts can use Sign-In with Ethereum and CACAO for authorization (yielding a parent did:pkh that authorizes child session keys with limited and temporary capabilities).</p><p>Finally, you’ll see how our <code>keySession</code> variable is redefined as the current authenticated session, thus exposing it to any React components that import <code>useComposeDB</code>.</p> DID Class Capabilities <p>If you take a deeper look at the <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/api/classes/dids.DID?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DID Class</a>, you’ll notice a <code>createJWS</code> method available to use that creates a JWS-encoded signature over a specified payload which is signed by the currently authenticated DID. This is what we’ll use to create an explicit JWS-encoded signature over our “Trust Credential” payloads, allowing us to easily determine who signed the payload, and determine if the credential has been altered.</p> Data Models <p>If you navigate into the /composites directory, you’ll find the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/did-session-claims/blob/main/composites/00-verifiableClaims.graphql?ref=blog.ceramic.network">schema definition</a> we’ll use to store this simple assertion type:</p> <code>## our broadest claim type
interface VerifiableClaim
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable claim interface") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
}

type Trust implements VerifiableClaim
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A trust credential") {
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  trusted: Boolean!
  jwt: String! @string(maxLength: 100000)
}</code> <p>You’ll immediately notice that this definition is much more concise compared to the definitions we used for our Verifiable Credential or Attestation versions of the account trust credential. The <code>recipient</code> and <code>trusted</code> fields will be used to store the end values our users write to Ceramic, while a <code>jwt</code> field will hold our portable claim (which will be redundant against the plain values we’re writing in the two fields above it, but will provide the tamper-evident and portable qualities we’ll want).</p> Writing Our Credentials <p>If you imagine our <code>Trust</code> model without the <code>jwt</code> subfield, a write query to our ComposeDB client might look something like this:</p> <code>const data = await compose.executeQuery(`
      mutation{
        createTrust(input: {
          content: {
            recipient: "${completeCredential.recipient}"
            trusted: ${completeCredential.trusted}
          }
        })
        {
          document{
            id
            recipient{
              id
            }
            trusted
          }
        }
      }
    `);</code> <p>In our case, if you take a look into the <code>/src/components/Claim.tsx</code> component, you’ll notice how the <code>saveBaseCredential</code> method uses a few additional steps to create a JWT string prior to saving to Ceramic:</p> <code>const saveBaseCredential = async () =&gt; {
    const credential = {
      recipient: `did:pkh:eip155:1:${destination.toLowerCase()}`,
      trusted: true,
    };

    if (keySession) {
      const jws = await keySession.did.createJWS(credential);
      const jwsJsonStr = JSON.stringify(jws);
      const jwsJsonB64 = Buffer.from(jwsJsonStr).toString("base64");
      const completeCredential = {
        ...credential,
        jwt: jwsJsonB64,
      };
      const data = await compose.executeQuery(`
      mutation{
        createTrust(input: {
          content: {
            recipient: "${completeCredential.recipient}"
            trusted: ${completeCredential.trusted}
            jwt: "${completeCredential.jwt}"
          }
        })
        {
          document{
            id
            recipient{
              id
            }
            trusted
            jwt
          }
        }
      }
    `);
    }
  };</code> <p>First, notice how we define a <code>credential</code> object that includes only the essential values each assertion needs (the recipient, represented by their did:pkh, and the trusted value). Next, we’re using the <code>createJWS</code> method (mentioned previously) from our authenticated DID session (represented by the <code>keySession</code> yielded by the <code>useComposeDB</code> deconstruction at the top of the component). Finally, we Base64-encode the result and save it to Ceramic.</p><p>Notice how our <code>credential</code> doesn’t hard-code a <code>controller</code> (i.e. the account creating the assertion). As we’ll display later, the DID that was used to create the JWS can be easily extracted from the payload (along with the assertion values) and is therefore inherently included.</p> Getting Started <p>To begin, start by cloning the example app repository and installing your dependencies:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/did-session-claims &amp;&amp; cd did-session-claims
npm install</code> <p>We’ve set up a script for you in <code>/scripts/commands.mjs</code> to automate the creation of your ComposeDB server configuration and admin credentials. You’ll use it in the next step by running the following command in your terminal:</p> <code>npm run generate</code> <p>If you take a look at your <code>admin_seed.txt</code> and <code>composedb.config.json</code> files, you’ll now see that an admin seed and server configuration have been generated for you. Taking a closer look at your server configuration, you’ll notice the following key-value pair within the JSON object:</p> <code>"ipfs": { "mode": "remote", "host": "http://localhost:5001" }</code> <p>Unlike several of our other tutorials where we run IPFS in “bundled” mode, we’ll need our IPFS instance running separately for this walk-through so we can show how to obtain the session key from the DAG node from IPFS (to prove that the session key used to create the Ceramic commit is the same as the session key that invoked the <code>createJWS</code> method referenced above).</p><p>We’ll want to start our IPFS daemon next (with pubsub enabled):</p> <code>ipfs daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment </code> <p>In a separate terminal, allow CORS (to enable our frontend to access data from the Kubo RPC API):</p> <code>ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["'"$origin"'", "http://localhost:8080","http://localhost:3000"]'</code> <p>Finally, start your application:</p> <code>nvm use 20
npm run dev</code> <p>This command will invoke the script created for you in <code>/scripts/run.mjs</code> responsible for deploying our ComposeDB schema on your local node, booting up a GraphiQL instance on port 5005, and starting your NextJS interface on port 3000.</p> Creating Assertions <p>If you navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your browser, you’ll be able to authenticate yourself by clicking the “Connect Wallet” button in the navigation (using Web3Modal). You’ll also be prompted with a second signature request - this one is from the <code>/src/fragments/index.tsx</code> context we discussed earlier, which creates the DID session, with limited scope to write data only against the <code>VerifiableClaim</code> interface and <code>Trust</code> types (shown in “resources” below):</p><p>You should now see the following in your browser:</p><p>As mentioned above, the corresponding React component can be found at <code>/src/components/Claim.tsx</code>. We’ve added some logs into the code for you, so we recommend inspecting your console in your browser as you follow along.</p><p>Go ahead and enter a dummy wallet address into the <code>Address</code> input field, and click “Generate Claim.” You’ll notice several new logs in your browser console - we’ll walk through these as we explain what’s happening.</p><p>Above we spoke about how we’re using the <code>saveBaseCredential</code> method to use our authenticated session key to sign our credential and save it to Ceramic using a mutation query off of our ComposeDB client. In your text editor, you’ll also see that we’re invoking <code>validateBaseCredential</code> at the end of this call.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what’s happening here:</p> <code>const validateBaseCredential = async () =&gt; {
    const credential: any = await compose.executeQuery(
      `query {
        trustIndex(last: 1){
          edges{
            node{
              recipient{
                id
              }
              controller {
                id
              }
              trusted
              jwt
              id
            }
          }
        }
      }`
    );
    console.log(credential.data)
    if (credential.data.trustIndex.edges.length &gt; 0) {
      //obtain did:key used to sign the credential
      const credentialToValidate = credential.data.trustIndex.edges[0].node.jwt;
      const json = Buffer.from(credentialToValidate, "base64").toString();
      const parsed = JSON.parse(json);
      console.log(parsed);
      const newDid = new DID({ resolver: KeyResolver.getResolver() });
      const result = await newDid.verifyJWS(parsed);
      const didFromJwt = result.didResolutionResult?.didDocument?.id;
      console.log('This is the payload: ', result.payload);
      //obtain did:key used to authorize the did-session
      const stream = credential.data.trustIndex.edges[0].node.id;
      const ceramic = new CeramicClient("http://localhost:7007");
      const streamData = await ceramic.loadStreamCommits(stream);
      const cid: CID | undefined = streamData[0] as CID;
      const cidString = cid?.cid;
			//obtain DAG node from IPFS
      const url = `http://localhost:5001/api/v0/dag/get?arg=${cidString}&amp;output-codec=dag-json`;
      const data = await fetch(url, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
      });
      const toJson: DagJWS = await data.json();
      const res = await newDid.verifyJWS(toJson);
      const didFromDag = res.didResolutionResult?.didDocument?.id;
      console.log(didFromJwt, didFromDag);
      if (didFromJwt === didFromDag) {
        console.log(
          "Valid: " +
            didFromJwt +
            " signed the JWT, and has a DID parent of: " +
            credential.data.trustIndex.edges[0].node.controller.id
        );
      } else {
        console.log("Invalid");
      }
    }
  };</code> <p>First, we’re grabbing the most recent <code>Trust</code> model instance from our index (the one we just created). After we’ve extracted the value of the <code>jwt</code> field from this node and converted it back to a JSON object, notice how we eventually are able to extract the result of the <code>id</code> subfield after verifying the signature (which we subsequently assign to <code>didFromJwt</code>. This is the did:key that was used to sign the JWT.</p><p>Next, for the sake of proving ownership back to the parent did:pkh account, we’ll show how to obtain the did:key from the DAG node that was used to sign the Ceramic commit. After loading the stream commits based on the node’s StreamID and isolating the IPFS CID, we’re making a fetch request to our remote IPFS node running on port 5001, asking for the DAG node that’s tied to the Ceramic commit (for more information on the various API options, visit <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/rpc/?ref=blog.ceramic.network#api-v0-dag-get">Kubo RPC API</a>).</p><p>Similar to how we extracted the did:key from our <code>jwt</code> subfield, we can use the JSON result to verify the signature, and isolate the <code>id</code> field from the DID document. Finally, we log “Valid” after proving that the two DIDs are the same, proving that the did:key used to generate the portable JWS over the data is indeed the same as the controller of the Ceramic stream.</p><p>Finally, just for fun, we’ve set up an embedded GraphiQL instance on the same page for you - go ahead and submit the default query to view an instance result:</p> What have we learned? <p>Different teams will have different requirements related to verifiable claims. For some, the use of a standard like a W3C Verifiable Credential will be a requirement. Other teams might care more about ensuring claim portability which offers an easy way to tie signed data to a signer in a reliable way.</p><p>It’s also likely obvious to some readers that the logic we’ve set up to create a credential object and use the did:key to sign is not happening at the Ceramic protocol level but at the application level, which could be maliciously leveraged by applications to cause their users to generate falsy assertions (though the same could be said about the temporary write privileges a user grants to a certain set of ComposeDB model definitions when they sign and create their DID session).</p><p>At the very least, we hope you walk away from this article with a better understanding of how DID sessions work, how they’re created, and where the DAG nodes can be queried from a Ceramic node’s IPFS instance. There are trade-offs to be considered across all verifiable claim options, so we hope these ideas spark future creativity around new solutions.</p><p>Finally, if you’re interested in diving deeper into what can be done with DID sessions, check out this repository branch that shows how to allow users to generate VCs and EAS attestations using their session signature:</p> <code>https://github.com/ceramicstudio/user-controlled-claims/tree/did-session</code> <p>Navigate to our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">forum</a> if you have questions or want to contribute to our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/rfc-verifiable-credentials-on-composedb/1325?ref=blog.ceramic.network">RFC on verifiable claims</a>! </p>

<p>The Elastos Foundation has recently introduced support for the ‘<a href="https://elastos.info/blog/elastos-bel2-bitcoin-layer-2-solution/">Bitcoin Elastos Layer2</a>‘ (BeL2), a new Layer 2 solution built using SmartWeb technology to significantly enhance Bitcoin’s capabilities. BeL2 integrates the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) with Bitcoin, offering a sophisticated approach to Bitcoin transactions and smart contract implementation. These smart contracts, immutable and transparent, operate without the need for third-party intermediaries. Distinguishing itself from existing solutions like the Lightning Network, BeL2 enables true staking and transaction recognition across Bitcoin and secondary networks, utilizing zero-knowledge proof technology for enhanced transaction authenticity and security.</p>
<p>For node managers, BeL2 introduces a new opportunity to earn Bitcoin through staking as a “relayer”, previously unfeasible in the Bitcoin framework. The additional advent of Bitcoin-denominated smart contracts is expected to increase blockchain activity, providing more transactions for verification and the potential for higher gas fee revenues.</p>
<p>Aligning with Elastos founder Rong Chen’s vision of a ‘SmartWeb’, BeL2 fosters a decentralized internet ecosystem where users control their data, empowered by blockchain technology and direct interactions. This positions BeL2 as a key player in transforming Bitcoin into a more versatile and powerful digital currency, as detailed in the <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/Xqk17l9/be-l2-whitepaper-english-pdf">BeL2 whitepaper</a>, a comprehensive guide to this innovative approach.

<p>Creating guidelines for common digital wallet user patterns – we need your feedback.</p>







<p>Image Credit: Alta Nel</p>



 Introduction 



<p>The Human Experience Working Group’s Interaction Patterns Task Force is on a mission “to enable digital wallet experiences that are reliable, accessible, and trustworthy.” Think of it like a manual for new gadgets; the digital wallet landscape needs an evolving guide to the common principles and patterns of how we interact with them. We’re running a survey to understand what users and stakeholders really need and want from their ‘digital wallets,’ making it a collective effort. This goal isn’t to provide a singular, one-size-fits all approach; it’s about co-creating a living guide that recognises the diverse contextual needs of different digital wallet users and that keeps up with the twists and turns ahead. Join in by sharing your thoughts in the survey – it’s open to everyone and takes less than 10 minutes. Let’s shape the friendly future of digital wallets together!</p>



 New tech, old problems 



<p>Any time you or I are offered a new piece of technology, confusion is likely to ensue, at least to begin with. Imagine trying to use your air fryer for the first time without having read any of the instructions and imagine how folks felt when cars first hit the scene back in the late 1800s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In ancient times, pedestrians kept to the right side, carrying luggage on their right shoulder for protection. Charioteers preferred the right side for reins control, while armed individuals passed on the left for sword accessibility. The shift to right-hand traffic occurred when people stopped suspecting enemies in every encounter. This historical shift informed the psychology influencing the placement of a car’s driver’s side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to these valuable insights, these conventions and rules improved safety and efficiency, making it easier to teach and provided choices for drivers.</p>



<p>Then, in the early days of automobiles, a simple manual sufficed to guide users through the basic operations. However, as cars evolved with new features, complexities, and technological integrations, so did the need for a more sophisticated manual. The same principle applies to our digital experiences. What worked yesterday may not be sufficient for the challenges of today or the innovations of tomorrow.<br><br>“People ignore design that ignores people.”</p>



<p>— Frank Chimero, Designer</p>



 Understanding and shaping the future of digital wallet experiences 



<p>In an era defined by rapid technological advancements, the need for reliable and secure data exchange has never been more critical. The Human Experience Working Group’s Interaction Patterns Task Force has undertaken a mission to enable consistent, accessible, and trustworthy digital experiences for all.<br><br>Our goal is to create a living resource that contains learnings about the diverse needs and challenges faced by users and stakeholders in the realm of digital wallets, emphasizing a focus on the adoption, operation, and use of digital wallet services. This resource will facilitate those designing and developing in our community to seamlessly implement them.</p>



<p>Much like the evolution of manuals for complex tools such as cars (and air fryers), the emerging landscape of digital wallets demands a guide to navigate its intricacies. By following common principles and patterns of use, digital wallets can reduce cognitive load for users, allowing them to focus on the purpose and context of their interaction rather than the mechanics of operating a digital wallet.</p>



<p>In order to begin this work, we are gathering inputs to better understand the key needs and issues for digital wallet users and stakeholders, from designers to developers, users, issuers, verifiers and regulators. This survey will help to ensure the deliverables of the group meet the needs of the community and bring business value. Open to all, it serves as a channel for users and stakeholders to voice their perspectives, contributing valuable insights to help shape the future of all types of digital wallet experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey covers various topics, including:</p>



 
 Understanding how organizations and people engage with digital wallets for life, work and play.&nbsp; 



 Identifying digital wallets that perform well and those that are less effective 



 Determining what Trust over IP deliverables would be most valuable for those people and organizations that rely on digital wallets for their day to day business 



 Examining an individual’s trust preferences and optimal digital wallet experience 
 



 Digital wallet experiences are part of trust-building: Ongoing dialogue and collective responsibility 



<p>We recognise that creating a trustworthy digital environment is an ongoing process, and one that requires the creation of reliable repeatable experiences across the ecosystem. This is why we are encouraging an open dialogue that fosters a sense of collective responsibility and ownership, emphasizing that this landscape is a shared space that evolves through the active participation of its users.</p>



<p>By embracing the concept of an evolving manual, the community acknowledges that this journey is a dynamic process, and our understanding of it must continuously evolve. Not only will technologies develop but so will human behaviors as adoption and use of digital wallets increase. Through initiatives like the survey, we are co-creating a manual that will guide us through the complexities of tomorrow.</p>



<p>This survey is for everyone, and it’ll only take a quick 10 minutes of your time. Feel free to complete it as an individual, a representative of an organization, or even both! The survey will be available from December 13th to 3rd January. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesUrBCsDrmRZwauumBirk2RVy7Bj8fx7ZGJB9BbJkJP9KCuw/viewform">Access the survey right here!</a></p>



<p>We’re excited to share the survey results with the community in early 2024. Importantly this will include the deliverables from the task force that are most important to the community of technologists, designers, implementers and users of digital wallets.</p>

<p>Blog authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/appsdesh/">Apoorva Deshpande</a></p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation Shared Signals Framework (SSF) is an emerging and promising standard for sharing security signals between trusted parties. It has the potential to play a significant role in securing the world by enabling organizations to share indicators of compromise (Security Events) and other security information more easily and efficiently.</p>
 How SSF Can Help Secure Identity and Access by Sharing Security Events 
<p>SSF Events are either artifacts of malicious activity or indicators of session property updates that can be used to monitor, detect, and prevent attacks, without a standard way to share Security Events between organizations, information silos form and weaken defenders’ ability to identify and mitigate threats.</p>
<p>SSF provides a secure and privacy-preserving way for organizations to share information via events. It uses a standard format for representing these events and a secure transport mechanism for sharing them. This makes it easy for organizations to integrate SSF into their existing security infrastructure and to share Security Events with a wide range of partners.</p>
<p>By sharing events among trusted parties, organizations can exchange threat indicators across domains and collaborate to identify and mitigate threats more quickly and effectively.</p>
 Benefits of Using SSF to Share Security Events 
<p>There are several benefits to using SSF to share Security Events, including:</p>
 
 Zero trust security posture: Zero trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and continuously verifies the identity and authorization of users, devices, and applications. SSF aligns with zero-trust principles by enabling organizations to continuously share and update security signals, ensuring that access decisions are based on the most up-to-date information. 
 Reduced operational overhead: SSF can help organizations reduce the operational overhead of sharing Security Events by providing a standard and automated way. This allows organizations to leverage the collective knowledge of the federated ecosystem to make more informed access control decisions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. 
 Increased visibility: SSF empowers organizations to share information about their cloud security posture, including security policies, configurations, and incident response procedures. This transparency fosters collaboration and enables organizations to learn from each other’s experiences, improving overall cloud security posture. 
 Seamless Federated Identity Management: In federated identity management, multiple organizations manage user identities and access control. This shared responsibility can create challenges in ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive resources. SSF is crucial in addressing these challenges by enabling organizations to share security signals about users, devices, and applications. 
 Enabling Continuous Risk Assessment: SSF enables continuous risk assessment by providing a mechanism for sharing real-time information about user behavior, device health, and network activity. This continuous risk assessment allows organizations to dynamically adjust access control measures based on the evolving threat landscape. 
 
 NSA and CISA Report on SSF 
<p>The National Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently published <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/04/2003313510/-1/-1/0/ESF%20CTR%20IAM%20MFA%20SSO%20CHALLENGES.PDF">a report on the future of identity and access management (IAM)</a>. In the report, the NSA and CISA identified SSF as an emerging and promising standard for sharing security signals between trusted parties.</p>
<p>The report states that SSF has the potential to “revolutionize the way that organizations share security information.” It also notes that SSF is “gaining traction in the industry” and that it is “being used by several leading organizations.” Although this is not an endorsement of the specifications, it is encouraging to see the US government’s recognition of the SSF’s potential to support infrastructure security by closing critical gaps.</p>
 How SSF Will Be Useful in the Future 
<p>According to Okta’s blog post on <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/08/exploration-of-open-identity-standards/">the future of open identity standards</a>, SSF will be useful in the following ways:</p>
 
 Improving risk-based authentication: SSF profile signals can be used to assess the risk of a particular login attempt (Tokens Claim changed, assurance level change, etc.) and implement risk-based authentication measures, such as requiring additional authentication factors for high-risk logins. 
 Preventing fraud: SSF can be used to identify patterns of fraudulent activities (credentials change, Credential Compromise, etc.) and block fraudulent transactions by requesting re-authentication or step-up challenges. 
 Improving threat detection and response: SSF can be used to share Security Events and other security information between trusted parties, enabling them to detect and respond to threats more quickly and effectively. 
 
<p>Apple’s decision to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10254">mandate the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) for custom identity providers in Apple Business Manager</a> marks a step forward in adopting this open standard, signaling its growing recognition within the industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2023/06/okta-to-improve-user-experience-through-apple-business-manager/">Okta is proud to be one of the first identity providers to implement this new capability </a><a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2023/06/okta-to-improve-user-experience-through-apple-business-manager/">to integrate seamlessly with Apple’s new feature</a>, further solidifying SSF’s position as a promising industry standard with the potential to transform identity management practices.</p>
<p>Cisco’s <a href="https://sharedsignals.guide/">sharedsignals.guide</a><a href="https://sharedsignals.guide/"> has also supported the industry with a robust guide for developers on the benefits and how to take advantage of current shared signals capabilities</a>, and SGNL’s <a href="http://caep.dev">caep.dev</a> is a tool to help implementers build to the shared signals spec and get responses from a Transmitter.</p>
<p>The involvement of tech giants and start-ups underscores the framework’s maturity and potential to become the de facto standard for identity management in the coming years.</p>
 How to get involved in the Shared Signals Framework 
 
 Joining the SSWG as contributors: <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">The Shared Signals Working Group</a> (SSWG) is the group responsible for developing and maintaining the SSF specification. Interested parties can join the SSWG as contributors to help shape the future of the framework. 
 Taking part in the interop demonstration: The SSWG is planning an interoperability demonstration in early March with a major SIAM conference. Interested parties can participate in the demonstration to see how SSF can be used to share security signals between different products and vendors. Please email the co-chair of SSWG, <a href="mailto:atul@sgnl.ai">Atul Tulshibagwale</a>, if you are interested. 
 Early adoption: Early adopters of SSF will benefit from being at the start of deployment and vendor selection as these capabilities become baseline expectations for implementors ranging from the US Government to leading digital platforms and relying parties. They can also take a central role in the ecosystem governance efforts. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The OpenID Foundation Shared Signals Framework is a promising new standard for sharing security signals between trusted parties. It has the potential to play a significant role in securing the world by enabling organizations to share Security Events and other security information more easily and efficiently.</p>
<p>Organizations should consider adopting SSF to improve security posture and reduce the operational overhead of sharing Security Events.</p>

<p>Cisco, Dell, Huawei, Microsoft, Qualys, Red Hat, Sophos, and Others Collaborate on a Unified Framework for Automated Product Lifecycle Management</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 14 December 2023 – OASIS Open, the international standards and open source consortium, announced the launch of <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openeox">OpenEoX</a>, a global initiative to standardize the exchange of End-of-Life (EOL) and End-of-Support (EOS) information within the software and hardware industries. OpenEoX will provide a unified and efficient method to programmatically verify the EOL or EOS status of the products that businesses and individuals rely on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A standardized approach to EOL and EOS information will empower open source maintainers and vendors alike to deliver more accurate and reliable support to their users. OpenEoX can help reduce cybersecurity risk and susceptibility to vulnerabilities, enabling companies to quickly identify unsupported products. While frameworks like software bill of materials (SBOMs), the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF), and Vulnerability Exchange (VEX) have made significant strides in improving information sharing and product lifecycle management, OpenEoX represents a critical step forward in unifying these efforts.</p>



<p>“It’s crucial for people to stay informed on the lifecycle status of the products and open-source software they rely on. OpenEoX addresses this challenge by providing a common framework that simplifies the process of managing and sharing End-of-Life and End-of-Support information across the industry,” said Omar Santos, co-chair of OpenEoX and Distinguished Engineer, Security &amp; Trust, AI Security Research and Operations at Cisco Systems. “When I started the original work in OpenEoX, I recognized that for it to truly transform the industry, it needed to be advanced in OASIS Open.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“OpenEoX will help redefine the landscape of vulnerability management by streamlining the oversight of product lifecycles. This empowers organizations to proactively address security issues through efficient patching and product upgrades,” said Justin Murphy, OpenEoX co-chair and Vulnerability Disclosure Analyst at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). “The machine-readable OpenEoX standard will pave the way for automation and integration with tools such as vulnerability scanners and SIEM systems. It will be able to offer a comprehensive overview of an organization’s security posture, contributing to more informed decision-making and enhanced risk mitigation. We look forward to continuing to work with OASIS Open and the broader vulnerability management community to build a path toward more efficient, automated and prioritized vulnerability management.”</p>



<p>Participation in OpenEoX is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/join-a-tc/">OASIS membership</a>. OpenEoX invites software and hardware vendors; open source maintainers; technology consultants; business stakeholders reliant on technology products; international, federal, and local government organizations; and others to become part of this collective effort. For more information on OpenEoX, please visit <a href="https://openeox.org/">https://openeox.org/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support for OpenEoX</p>



<p>Huawei<br>“Huawei is proud to join the OpenEoX project and support the establishment of standardized software and hardware end-of-life and end-of-support programs. We understand the impact of rapid tech development on the industry and are committed to working with stakeholders to explore a standardized approach to EOL and EOS programs. This will streamline processes, reduce confusion, and ensure a smooth transition for consumers. We look forward to contributing to the health and sustainability of the entire hardware and software ecosystem!”<br>– Martin Xie, Director of Huawei Cybersecurity Transparency Center</p>



<p>Microsoft<br>“Standardizing how the industry performs End of Life/End of Support for developed software/services and their related direct and transitive dependencies is critical to the evolution of end-to-end software supply chain security. Microsoft is proud to contribute to this work, which achieves even more transparency in better-made software while further building trust with more informed consumers.”<br>– Brendan Burns, CVP, Azure OSS Cloud Native</p>



<p>Qualys<br>“Qualys has been helping enterprises assess their first-party &amp; open-source software risks through our Enterprise TruRisk Platform and are pleased to partner with OpenEoX to build an open standard to do this at scale. Identifying End-of-Life (EOL) and End-of-Service (EOS) applications in hybrid environments is now a concern at the CIO level, not just for CISOs. The capability to measure, communicate, and, more importantly, eliminate risks stemming from such tech debt demands a collaborative effort involving cybersecurity vendors, software vendors, and IT departments within organizations. We’re pleased to collaborate with OpenEOX to facilitate this process.”<br>– Pinkesh Shah, CPO, Qualys</p>



<p>Red Hat<br>“As an open source solutions provider with a broad product portfolio, consistently communicating lifecycle information to our customers and partners can pose a challenge. With OpenEoX, Red Hat will be able to streamline that process, providing users with a more accurate and reliable view over the lifecycle of their technologies. This information, integrated with other components of the vulnerability assessment process, will complement data like VEX and SBOMs and help our users address and remediate potential security issues more quickly and efficiently.”<br>– Pete Allor, Sr. Director, Red Hat Product Security</p>



<p>Sophos<br>“In today’s dynamic world of cybersecurity threats, identifying the end stages of software and hardware—End-of-Life (EOL) and End-of-Support (EOS)—is critical. While tools like SBOMs, CSAF and OHDF have advanced the field, there is a vital need to address the lack of knowledge when products are no longer supported and the vulnerabilities they introduce. OpenEoX will help us solve this gap with a streamlined process for lifecycle management, minimizing risks from outdated technology. Sophos is excited work with the OpenEoX community to create a flexible framework that seamlessly melds with current standards and tools, streamlining the addition of EOL / EOS into the product lifecycle.”<br>– Mike Fraser, VP of Product Management of DevSecOps and Automation, Sophos</p>

 WAO’s 2023 in&nbsp;Review <p>2023 is drawing to a close, so we thought a reflection and roundup on life inside of WAO would be a nice thing to do before we take some time off to reset for 2024. It’s been quite a full year, with a lot of amazing experiences that have pushed us along towards what we call <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16">a practical utopia</a>. Our utopia is a working environment where our members and collaborators work within the intersections of things they care&nbsp;about.</p>Our practical utopia flower cc-by&nbsp;WAO Community is everything <p>Not only are members of WAO expert community builders, we are lucky to move within various communities that help us learn and grow. We consider ourselves a community, and as leadership in communities change, so does the culture. This year, Bryan stepped back from being a founding member of the co-op and became a collaborator. He came to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/wao-were-almost-seven-8921f530284b">a final IRL meet-up in Amsterdam</a> to celebrate his membership.</p><p>As we said goodbye, we were all worried about how our relationship would change. While it was certainly an adjustment, and while we do miss Bryan in our internal channels and meetings, WAO still gets to work with him all the time! This year, we pulled him into several projects to help us find the right metaphors and visuals. We look forward to working with him in 2024&nbsp;too.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>As Bryan stepped back, Anne stepped up. Anne moved from being WAO’s intern to being a collaborator last year already. But this year, she spent more time “in the office”. She also finished her Bachelor of Arts degree in Media Education and Culture Studies, an accomplishment that fits in perfectly with our Learning and Development Department*.</p><p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/integrating-open-recognition-into-program-and-course-designs-5430a173a1f8">Anne’s educational story</a> has become a way for us all to talk about the need for Open Recognition, and her interest in gender equity and feminist workplaces has made WAO even more equitable and inclusive. We’re pleased to collaborate with Anne on her interests and looking forward to sharing her ePIC talk “Open Recognition is for Everybody — A feminist practice for more equal workplaces”.</p><p>*We don’t have departments ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p><p>This year, we were also lucky to collaborate with others in our network. There are too many to name, but we are ecstatic about our deepening relationships with many from <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a> and the <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition is for Everybody Community</a>, members of <a href="https://workers.coop">Workers.coop</a> and the world of cooperatives, as well as individuals in activist communities like <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/nurturing-the-wellbeing-economy-4396a8ad5bb4">WEAll</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/navigating-greenpeaces-critical-incident-network-5d9fe79ea824">Greenpeace</a>.</p> We have an awesome&nbsp;network cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>We kicked off the year helping some folks at Change.org <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/radiating-confidence-at-change-org-9fbbe9f4fc2f">rock their workshops and presentations</a>. Early in 2023, we also worked a bit with passbolt to help their budding community team plan for the rest of the year. We talked about <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-art-of-community-cultivating-online-connections-738cc90b0a39">anti-transactional relationship building</a> and, of course, Open Recognition. We also helped WEAll think about their digital strategy through the lens of “<a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/people-process-product-5a3dfbe565b">People, Product and Process</a>”, and facilitated a hackathon for <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/">Historic England</a> to allow their developers to get their hands dirty with AI. Each of these projects helped us learn more about our network and the organisations in&nbsp;it.</p><p>We returned to Amsterdam in the early summer, when <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/we-are-open-coop-x-mozilla-festival-house-23407548b900">we went to the Mozilla Festival</a> and talked about co-ops, <a href="https://ailiteracy.fyi">AI Literacy</a>, transparency and the power of open. We ran sessions, talked about the politics of technology in Europe and reconnected with the Mozilla ecosystem (where WAO members originally met).</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Our amazing partner, Participate, helped sponsor WAO attendance at the Badge Summit in Boulder where we learned the importance of a front porch. It was on that porch in Boulder that WAO was asked to help the <a href="https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/">Digital Credentials Consortium</a>, hosted at MIT, to communicate more clearly the fairly technical concept of Verifiable Credentials. It was on that porch that we started thinking about how the <a href="https://badges.community">Open Recognition is for Everybody</a> (ORE) community should show up at <a href="https://epic.openrecognition.org">ePIC</a>.

<p>Cisco, Cyware, IBM, U.S. NIST, and Others Advance Committee Specification for Orchestrating and Automating Cyber Response Playbooks</p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 13 December 2023 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, and the Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) for Cyber Security Technical Committee (TC) have approved <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/cs01/security-playbooks-v2.0-cs01.html">CACAO Security Playbooks v2.0</a> as an OASIS Committee Specification (CS). CACAO v2.0 will empower organizations to orchestrate, collaborate, and share cybersecurity playbooks. In the ongoing battle against threat actors, organizations must identify, create, document, and test various steps to detect, investigate, mitigate, and remedy potential threats. The culmination of these steps results in a cybersecurity playbook designed to secure organizational systems, networks, data, and users.</p>



<p>CACAO v2.0 defines the schema and taxonomy for cybersecurity playbooks and describes how they can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions. These playbooks give security teams the ability to respond to incidents, mitigate threats, and protect their networked systems by offering a modular and extensible approach to playbook development, ensuring that it can adapt to the diverse needs of different organizations.</p>



<p>“CACAO is the culmination of many years of hard work from the cybersecurity community outside and within OASIS, resulting in a significant step forward for all organizations looking to automate their defense against today’s latest cyber threats,” said Allan Thomson, co-chair of the CACAO TC. “We’ve taken the approach with CACAO, to embrace existing toolsets and processes security organizations are already familiar with, and defined a standardized playbook mechanism that allows orchestration and collaboration not easily achieved both within their own organization, as well as with external sharing partners.”</p>



<p>“The creation, development, and now approval of CACAO v2.0 as a Committee Specification is a testament to the hard work and collaboration of so many different individuals and organizations from around the world to help solve one of the biggest problems in cyber defense: the orchestration of response in cyber relevant time,” said Bret Jordan, co-chair of the CACAO TC. “This standardized approach to orchestrated cyber defense gives organizations the ability to navigate the evolving threat landscape with confidence, armed with the tools needed to orchestrate and automate responses effectively. I am so proud of the work that everyone has done to make this a reality. This TC has done for cyber security playbooks what STIX and TAXII did for cyber threat intelligence (CTI).”</p>



<p>For further insights, read the blog <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2023/12/06/cacao-security-playbooks-v2-blog/">Standardized Security Orchestration with CACAO</a>, written by Bret Jordan, Vasileios Mavroeidis, Luca Morgese, and Allan Thomson.</p>



<p>The CACAO TC is made up of a diverse group of global experts from various industries, including cybersecurity, government, and academia. OASIS Open encourages organizations and individuals to get involved in the development and adoption of CACAO v2.0 and other open standards for cybersecurity.</p>

   <p>In our rapidly evolving digital world, the way we manage and verify our identities is undergoing a fundamental transformation. At the forefront of this change is the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is set to redefine digital identity management. This 1000-word exploration delves into the essence of SSI, particularly its open-source variant, and examines why it is poised to be a cornerstone of our digital future.</p>



 Understanding Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity represents a paradigm shift in digital identity management. Unlike traditional models where third-party organizations hold and control individual identity data, SSI places the power back into the hands of the individual. It enables people to own, control, and share their personal information without the need for intermediaries. This approach not only enhances privacy but also reduces the risk of data breaches and misuse.</p>



 The Role of Open Source in SSI 



<p>Open source plays a pivotal role in the development and adoption of SSI technologies. By its nature, open source promotes transparency, community collaboration, and continuous improvement. These attributes are crucial for building a robust and trustworthy digital identity system.</p>



 Transparency and Security 



<p>In an open-source SSI system, the underlying code is available for anyone to review, audit, and improve. This transparency is vital for security. It allows experts worldwide to scrutinize the code for vulnerabilities, ensuring that the system is as secure as possible. In a domain as sensitive as identity management, such widespread scrutiny is invaluable.</p>



 Community-Driven Development 



<p>Open-source SSI benefits from community-driven development. A diverse community of developers, users, and stakeholders contribute to the project, bringing in a wide range of perspectives and expertise. This collaboration leads to more innovative and user-centric solutions.</p>



 Adaptability and Interoperability 



<p>Open-source projects are known for their adaptability. As new challenges and requirements emerge, the open-source SSI systems can evolve swiftly to meet these changes. Moreover, open-source projects often prioritize interoperability, ensuring that different systems and applications can work seamlessly together, an essential feature for widespread adoption of SSI.</p>



 The Advantages of SSI 



 Empowering Individuals 



<p>SSI empowers individuals with direct control over their personal information. They can decide what information to share, with whom, and for how long. This autonomy not only enhances privacy but also fosters a sense of control and dignity.</p>



 Reducing Reliance on Central Authorities 



<p>By decentralizing identity management, SSI reduces reliance on central authorities. This decentralization not only mitigates risks associated with data breaches at central points but also prevents misuse of power by these centralized entities.</p>



 Enhancing Privacy 



<p>Privacy is at the heart of SSI. By allowing individuals to share only the necessary information, SSI minimizes data exposure. For instance, instead of sharing a birth certificate to prove age, a person can simply provide a verification that they are over a certain age, without revealing their exact birth date.</p>



 Streamlining Verification Processes 



<p>SSI can streamline verification processes, saving time and resources for both individuals and organizations. For instance, once an individual’s credentials are verified and stored in their SSI, they don’t need to be re-verified each time they are used.</p>



 The Challenges Ahead 



 Technological Barriers 



<p>Despite its potential, SSI faces technological challenges. Developing a user-friendly, secure, and scalable SSI system is complex. There’s also the need for widespread interoperability among various SSI systems, which is a significant undertaking.</p>



 Regulatory and Legal Hurdles 



<p>SSI operates in a space that intersects with various legal and regulatory frameworks. Navigating these, particularly in areas like data protection and identity verification laws, is challenging.</p>



 Adoption and Awareness 



<p>For SSI to truly succeed, it needs widespread adoption. This requires not only technological solutions but also efforts to raise awareness and educate both users and organizations about the benefits of SSI.</p>



 The Road Ahead: Implementing Open Source SSI 



 Collaborative Development 



<p>The future success of open-source SSI hinges on collaborative development. Encouraging participation from diverse stakeholders, including governments, businesses, and civil society, is crucial.</p>



 Building an Ecosystem 



<p>Developing an ecosystem around SSI, complete with supportive tools, applications, and services, is essential. This ecosystem should be user-friendly and accessible to encourage adoption.</p>



 Policy and Regulation 



<p>Engaging with policymakers to develop supportive and clear regulatory frameworks is vital. These frameworks should protect users while encouraging innovation and growth in the SSI space.</p>



 Pilot Projects and Use Cases 



<p>Implementing pilot projects and highlighting successful use cases can demonstrate the practical benefits of SSI. These examples can range from streamlined online services to enhanced privacy in digital transactions.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Open-source SSI is more than just a new technology; it’s a movement towards a more secure, private, and user-centric digital world. Its promise lies in empowering individuals with control over their identity, fostering innovation through collaboration, and building a more inclusive digital society. While</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/examples/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable Credentials tutorial</a> and <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-provenance-composedb-as-an-authenticated-database/">Data Provenance</a> blog article, we discussed how some teams building on Ceramic use verifiable claims to make assertions about their users or allow their users to make claims about other users or non-user entities. At the time of writing this article, we’re seeing momentum build and excitement aggregate along particular claim standards (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> and attestations using the <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/welcome?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ethereum Attestation Service</a>). At the core of these standards are the features they unlock, not only for the users themselves but (importantly) the developers integrating them into their applications.</p><p>So what are these features? What are the differences in capabilities between standards currently being used? What trade-offs should developers consider before choosing one framework over another? Is there a world where they can be used together?</p><p>As you might’ve guessed, these are the topics we’ll cover below. More specifically, we will observe how these standards compare in the world of off-chain self-sovereign identity (SSI).</p> Common Features of Verifiable Claims  Schemas <p>If verifiable claims themselves are building blocks of online trust and reputation, the schemas those claims use provide their necessary structure. This ensures that two separate instances of a claim that fall into the same claim “family” can be predictably and reliably interpreted.</p><p>For example, if you were using a <code>courseCompleted</code> schema in an academic setting that used a required boolean field (representing whether or not a student passed a course) and a required string field (to identify the course by name), it would be hard to consume and interpret data instances that had additional unwanted fields or were altogether missing one of those two required fields.</p><p>Take a look at how the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network#data-schemas">data schemas</a> W3C section articulates the need for schemas in comparison to a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/core--concepts/how-eas-works?ref=blog.ceramic.network#schemas-give-structure-to-the-attestation">similar section</a> on the EAS docs site. While the implementation differs, both point out that schemas are essential for enforcing data conformity within a given collection.</p> Public Schema Registries <p>A schema registry is another commonality between these emergent standards, with the connecting tissue being a place to publicly reference and house schemas. In the world of decentralization and SSI, the registry plays a particularly compelling role because it enables disparate applications to build on shared data models due to the predictability of the shape of each data instance.</p><p>For instance, if <code>Application A</code> is a Ph.D. program, it can validate credentials created by <code>Application B</code>, a four-year university, and issue credentials to the same <code>courseCompleted</code> schema. <code>Employer A</code> cares about credentials issued by both <code>Application A</code> and <code>Application B</code>.</p><p>For entities issuing claims, these registries both serve the purpose of helping those teams ensure their data conforms to the schemas they utilize, while (just as importantly) functioning as a discovery mechanism for types of SSI. Entities consuming and validating those claims use those schema definitions to validate whether a user has cryptographically signed a given statement, making it essentially impossible for bad actors to tamper with those claims.</p><p>Registries like <a href="https://schemas.serto.id/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Serto</a> service this need for applications using Verifiable Credentials, whereas <a href="https://github.com/Consensys/linea-attestation-registry?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verax</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-contracts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS</a> use immutable on-chain registries where anyone can deploy or reference schemas for attestations.</p> Credential Metadata + Body <p>The most obvious commonality across standards is the assertion itself (presumably in the form of the schema it is using), alongside other important metadata such as expiration dates or revocation status. The form and corresponding values of the credential itself, for example, are checked against the expected form of the schema by issuers, thus making it easy to omit nonconforming data altogether.</p> Proof (Signatures) <p>Whereas a public ledger of record like a blockchain verifiably reveals the behavior of a user address simply by observing its transaction history (thus simplifying the observability of on-chain attestations so long as a user’s account hasn’t been hacked), verifiable claims produced elsewhere must include cryptographic proofs that verify the provenance of those assertions. Similar to the role of public schema registries, attached proofs ensure that consuming entities can reliably verify that a given user has made some claim, agnostic of where the claim was stored or when it was produced.</p><p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk/blob/master/src/offchain/offchain.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS off-chain module</a> incurs an <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EIP-712</a> <code>signTypedData</code> request that packages the contents of the attestation as method arguments, encodes, hashes, and requests a user signature over the hash of that data. <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/veramo/blob/next/packages/credential-eip712/src/agent/CredentialEIP712.ts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Veramo’s EIP-712 module</a> (just one method of producing a signature with Veramo) similarly requests and yields an EIP-712-conforming payload over the Verifiable Credential being signed.</p><p>Finally, public data ledgers like Ceramic are architected on mutable data streams, allowing users to create and mutate their streams as much as they desire under a single authenticated session. Users might choose to make claims about themselves or others without an additional attestation or framework layer.</p><p><a href="https://www.oamo.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Oamo</a>, for example, is a platform build on Ceramic that helps individuals own and monetize their data by granting access to it to other organization and companies in exchange for rewards. Oamo generates claims authored by the application itself (as opposed to user-authored claims). For example, Oamo would issue a certain claim type after a user has connected their Twitter account. Unlike teams like <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-passport-on-ceramic-enabling-trustworthy-beta-round-donations/">Gitcoin</a> that are storing Verifiable Credentials on Ceramic, Oamo uses predefined ComposeDB schemas to provide claim structure, with no additional Verifiable Credential or attestation frameworks or layering on top. You can view one of these model definitions <a href="https://scan.s3.xyz/models/modelview/kjzl6hvfrbw6cb8b9j326870su0gmlziwepl5nu8jk9tybwxe7mobm67cqd58a3?network=MAINNET&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p><p>Similar to a blockchain, if a data consumer is aware that claims are being authored by users they care about in this type of environment, they can choose to index on those streams and can rest assured of the provenance and lineage of that user data. Ease of portability to a different environment later on, however, might be an issue under this paradigm.</p> Decentralized Identifiers <p>If you’re reading this, chances are you already know the whole spiel on DIDs, so we won’t spend too much time here. The important key to note here is how these identifiers are viewed as an essential pillar of SSI. Similar to how issuers and consumers of verifiable claims containing proofs can collaborate on shared data due to the inherent characteristics of those claims, DIDs ensure that individual users can take their identity from one context to another without the permission or awareness of some central actor.</p> Choosing between Claim Types <p>Despite their similarities, developers who choose to incorporate claims into their applications must consider the trade-offs and differences in experience each method offers. For the purpose of this comparison, I’m intentionally isolating “off-chain” claims (produced either by signed meta transactions, or claims generated on a public data ledger like Ceramic, both of which incur no cost to the issuer).</p><p>Given this brief comparison, it’s easy to understand why many teams choose to build high-portability claim types like Verifiable Credentials on top of a public data network like Ceramic. This combination works in complimentary fashion to enable easy portability and verifiability (when using a framework), alongside the availability and discoverability benefits of a network.</p> Making Claim Standards Interoperable <p>Given the similarities between the two tamper-evident claim methods, developers might want to give their users optionality by allowing them to choose which one to use. For teams building on Ceramic and utilizing ComposeDB, they can offer their users this flexibility without degrading the efficiency of their query logic. By using interfaces, developers can define a “family” of data under a <code>verifiableClaim</code> (or other preferred name) interface, and define the low-hanging similarities between the two standards as interface subfields. The standard-specific subfields can be used as differentiators defined within higher-level types.</p><p>For example, let’s say an application wants to allow their users to create <code>accountTrust</code> claims that point to a DID and contain a boolean value representing trust or distrust (here’s a <a href="https://beta.api.schemas.serto.id/v1/public/trusted-reviewer/1.0/ld-context.json?ref=blog.ceramic.network">VC definition</a> and <a href="https://easscan.org/schema/view/0x776c6c1d76055522753787b3abfdbeeff262cda35eebecaf83059b738698ef62?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EAS schema</a> that do exactly this). Here’s a resulting payload from each:</p> <code>// Credential

</code> <p>You’ll notice a few things right away that underline differences we’ll have to account for when saving to ComposeDB. For example, the <code>issuer</code> and <code>[credentialSubject.id](&lt;http://credentialSubject.id&gt;)</code> fields within our Verifiable Credential use DIDs, whereas the <code>account</code> (akin to issuer) and <code>message.recipient</code> within our attestation use Eth addresses. The signatures are also different in observing the <code>signature</code> object within our Attestation instance vs. our <code>proof.proofValue</code> credential field.</p><p>Let’s assume we want to make these work as-is without deploying new Verifiable Credential or Attestation schemas.</p> Layer 0 (Broadest) <p>Since we’re allowing our users to both author their own claims and corresponding Ceramic documents, our broadest-level interface can therefore tie together the claim creator with the claim recipient:</p> <code>## our broading claim type

interface VerifiableClaim 
@createModel(description: "A verifiable claim interface")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
}
</code> <p>We will need to account for the differences between the payloads and how they must be saved. For example:</p> <code>//attestations

recipient: "${"did:pkh:eip155:1:" + attestation.message.recipient}"

//VCs

recipient: "${credential.credentialSubject.id}"
</code>  Layer 1 <p>Our next level down entrypoint can therefore dictate the claim type that was used:</p> <code>## our overarching VC interface that acts agnostic of our proof type

interface VerifiableCredential implements VerifiableClaim
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable credential interface")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  issuer: Issuer! 
  context: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  type: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
}

## our overarching Attestation interface that acts agnostic of our proof type

interface Attestation implements VerifiableClaim
@createModel(description: "An attestation interface")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  attester: DID! @accountReference

  data: String! @string(maxLength: 1000000)
}
</code> <p>You can start to see how these parent definitions open up the possibilities of running queries like this:</p> <code>query VerifiableClaims {
  verifiableClaimIndex(last: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        recipient {
          id

        controller {
          id
        }
        ... on VerifiableCredential {
          issuer {
            id

        }
        ... on Attestation {
          attester {
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  Layer 2 <p>We can add a third interface layer that accounts for the differences between proof types:</p> <code>## generalized JWT proof interface for VCs

interface VCJWTProof implements VerifiableClaim &amp; VerifiableCredential 
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable credential interface of type JWT")
{

}

}

type Domain {

  version: String! @string(maxLength: 1000)
}
</code> <p>We can therefore start to query these fields:</p> <code>query VerifiableClaims {
  verifiableClaimIndex(last: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        recipient {

  }
}
</code>  Layer 3 <p>Our next layer can include the specific values relevant to the claim. We’ve maxed out the layers we want to use for our Attestations (so we’ll define this as a type), while our Verifiable Credentials will detach the proof type from the claim:</p> <code>interface AccountTrustCredential implements VerifiableClaim &amp; VerifiableCredential  
  @createModel(description: "A verifiable credential interface for account trust credentials")
{
  controller: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference

  time: Int! 
  data: String! @string(maxLength: 1000000)
  trusted: Boolean!
}
</code> <p>Incorporating into our querying:</p> <code>query VerifiableClaims {
  verifiableClaimIndex(last: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        recipient {
          id

        controller {

            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>  Layer 4 (most specific) <p>Finally, since we’ve defined our <code>AccountTrustCredential</code> interface as agnostic of our proof type, our final layer will define types that differentiate based on proof:</p> <code>type AccountTrustCredential712 implements VerifiableClaim &amp; VerifiableCredential &amp; AccountTrustCredential &amp; VCEIP712Proof 
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A verifiable credential of type EIP712 for account trust credentials")

  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "trusted" }]) {

  credentialSchema: CredentialSchema!
  credentialStatus: CredentialStatus
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  expirationDate: DateTime
  credentialSubject: AccountTrustSubject! 
  trusted: Boolean!
  proof: ProofEIP712!
}

type AccountTrustCredentialJWT implements VerifiableClaim &amp; VerifiableCredential &amp; AccountTrustCredential &amp; VCJWTProof 
  @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "A verifiable credential of type JWT for account trust credentials")
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "issuanceDate" }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "trusted" }]) {

</code> <p>You can begin to see how developers who might want to account for multiple claim types, each with sub-options offering different proof types, while still exposing these as queryable under an overarching claim family can start to do interesting things with precision using interfaces.</p><p>Developers will still need to keep the reconstruction and validation mechanics in mind, given the deconstruction and alterations made to the data in order to save to ComposeDB and make it interoperable under a <code>VerifiableClaim</code> interface, and the client-side work required to reconstruct the claim into an acceptable format to be verified.</p><p>To view and experiment with the example code yourself, visit and clone <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/user-controlled-claims?ref=blog.ceramic.network">this repository</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>On November 23, we held the second community call for our project directed at <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-working-towards-a-healthier-and-more-robust-information-ecosystem-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/" title="">building a healthier and more robust information ecosystem</a> in Latin America and the Caribbean. We were joined by 20 participants from 10 countries in the region and had a collective conversation about the different ways each participant and their organisations were working to strengthen this&nbsp; ecosystem, and about the challenges they’re facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We appreciate everyone who came to share their perspectives and expertise with the group. In this blog post, we’re sharing some of the major themes that emerged from this conversation.</p>



 “If the actors who are damaging the information ecosystem are really good at collaborating, we have to be even better” 



<p>When talking about how the information ecosystem in the region could become stronger, the need for more collaboration between different actors who are working to create healthier information ecosystems was quickly pointed out by participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are quite a lot of similarities in terms of the challenges civil society faces in the information ecosystem across the region – whether it’s the existence of coordinated groups perpetuating mis- and disinformation or local governments rolling out similar strategies to curtail civil society organising. To respond to this context, practitioners mentioned wanting to have multidisciplinary spaces where those working towards social justice can have dialogue about common challenges they’re facing in the information ecosystem, share strategies and projects they’re working on, and eventually combine efforts and work on projects together.</p>



<p>Though collaboration was seen by participants as something needed in the space, they also shared how difficult it can be to secure long-term resources to make regional and/or cross-sector collaboration possible. Participants from countries like Brazil, Argentina and Colombia talked about how collaboration requires a lot of time and coordination – “to build trust, consolidate relationships, find alignment” – and it can be hard to secure funding to undertake the activities and the work of forming alliances, which is sometimes seen as “invisible” and/or “not urgent”.&nbsp;</p>



 Threats to civil society and machismo as concerning features of information ecosystems in the region&nbsp; 



<p>During our conversation, participants also indicated the impact that governments with authoritarian tendencies have had on the information ecosystem in the region. Participants shared that they have been dealing with governmental surveillance, censorship in digital platforms and, occasionally, the spread of misinformation and disinformation coming from state actors. One participant working on sexual and reproductive health and rights, for instance, shared that though they work on a regional level, their content on social media was removed at the request of a municipal government in one of the countries in which they work, showing the impact that local governments can have on the information ecosystem more broadly.</p>



<p>Relatedly, a number of participants described how expressions of machismo, including gender based violence and gendered dis- and misinformation, are defining features of the information ecosystem in Latin America. For instance, one practitioner described how they witness a large amount of disinformation on sexual and reproductive health and rights, and in their work, they face significant issues, such as censoring and digital attacks. Another person working to share audiovisual content on sexual and gender dissidences in Latin America also faces censorship in the process of sharing their work. To those who joined our conversation last week, building a healthier and more robust information ecosystem in the region requires <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/10-inspiring-initiatives-fighting-online-political-violence-in-latin-america/" title="">fighting these types of gendered violence</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Building bridges and sharing knowledge for a stronger information ecosystem 



<p>During this call, participants talked about leveraging digital technologies (as well as using other relevant strategies!) to communicate with each other and create bridges across different sectors and areas of work, which includes building collective knowledge around skills such as communications, digital security and data, digital rights, and more. To this end, like in the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/a-slow-burning-process-to-improve-the-information-ecosystem-we-need-to-rebuild-trust-and-focus-on-local-community-driven-initiatives/">previous community call</a>, participants highlighted the importance of working to improve information ecosystems on a local level, fostering a sense of community and responding to the information needs of their communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the inspiring initiatives we got to know a little more during the call and who are working towards strengthening their local information ecosystems include:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.taturana.org/" title="">Taturana</a>, a Brazilian film distribution organisation working with local mediators to make social impact movies more accessible;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://datalabe.org/" title="">DataLabe</a> a narrative and data lab from Maré in Rio de Janeiro;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://mujeresalborde.org/programa/al-borde-producciones/" title="">Escuela Audiovisual al Borde</a>, organised by Mujeres Al Borde to help people can create their own narratives and content;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://nosmulheresdaperiferia.com.br/" title="">Nós Mulheres da Periferia</a>, a Black-women led journalistic vehicle in Brazil;&nbsp; 



 Linterna Verde’s project <a href="https://www.circuito.digital/" title="">circuito.digital</a> through which they help organisations to understand content moderation problems and document cases;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://latfem.org/" title="">LatFem</a>, a digital native feminist media working to provide quality information in the region;&nbsp; 



 … and many more (we’ll keep sharing more about this in our blog over the next few months!). 
 



<p>Participants also talked about support and investment in work done by indigenous, quilombola and black-led organisations as something that is crucial to having stronger local information ecosystems in the region.</p>



 What’s next and how you can get involved 



<p>During the next few weeks, we’re interviewing researchers, communicators, journalists, civic media professionals, digital rights defenders and social justice activists working to build better information ecosystems in Latin America and the Caribbean. We’ll also host another community call for this project in the beginning of 2024 – keep an eye on our blog and <a href="https://us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1747fd8a7bf587bd4a215d984&amp;id=53139510a0" title="">newsletter</a> for more info on how you can join us!</p>

<p>No dia 23 de novembro, realizamos a segunda chamada comunitária do nosso projeto voltado para a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-working-towards-a-healthier-and-more-robust-information-ecosystem-in-latin-america-and-the-caribbean/" title="">construção de um ecossistema de informação mais saudável e robusto</a> na América Latina e no Caribe. Contamos com a presença de 20 participantes de 10 países da região e tivemos uma conversa coletiva sobre as diferentes maneiras pelas quais cada participante e suas organizações estavam trabalhando para fortalecer esse ecossistema e sobre os desafios que estavam enfrentando.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Agradecemos a todas as pessoas que vieram compartilhar suas perspectivas e conhecimentos com o grupo. Nesta publicação, compartilhamos alguns dos principais temas que surgiram dessa conversa.</p>



 “Se os atores que estão prejudicando o ecossistema de informação são muito bons em colaborar uns com os outros, nós temos que ser ainda melhores” 



<p>Ao falar sobre como o ecossistema de informações na região poderia se fortalecer, participantes rapidamente apontaram a necessidade de mais colaboração entre os diferentes atores que estão trabalhando para criar ecossistemas de informação mais saudáveis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Há muitas semelhanças em termos dos desafios que a sociedade civil enfrenta no ecossistema de informações em toda a região – seja a existência de grupos coordenados que perpetuam a desinformação ou os governos locais que implementam estratégias semelhantes para restringir a organização da sociedade civil. Para responder a esse contexto, participantes da chamada mencionaram o desejo de ter espaços multidisciplinares onde aqueles que trabalham em prol da justiça social possam dialogar sobre os desafios comuns que estão enfrentando no ecossistema de informação, compartilhar estratégias e projetos em que estão trabalhando e, por fim, combinar esforços e trabalhar em projetos juntos.</p>



<p>Embora a colaboração tenha sido apontada por participantes como algo necessário no espaço, as pessoas presentes também compartilharam como pode ser difícil garantir recursos de longo prazo para viabilizar a colaboração regional e/ou intersetorial. Participantes de países como Brasil, Argentina e Colômbia falaram sobre como colaboração significativa exige muito tempo e coordenação – “para criar confiança, consolidar relacionamentos, encontrar alinhamento” – e pode ser difícil garantir financiamento para realizar as atividades e o trabalho de formação de alianças, que às vezes é visto como “invisível” e/ou “não urgente”.</p>



 Ameaças à sociedade civil e machismo como características preocupantes dos ecossistemas de informação na região&nbsp; 



<p>Durante nossa conversa, participantes também indicaram o impacto que governos com tendências autoritárias têm tido sobre o ecossistema de informação na região. Compartilharam que têm lidado com vigilância governamental, censura em plataformas digitais e, ocasionalmente, com a disseminação de desinformação proveniente de agentes estatais. Uma das pessoas presentes, que trabalha com saúde e direitos sexuais e reprodutivos, por exemplo, relatou que, embora trabalhe em nível regional, seu conteúdo nas mídias sociais foi removido a pedido de um governo municipal em um dos países em que trabalha, mostrando o impacto que os governos locais podem ter sobre o ecossistema de informações de forma mais ampla.</p>



<p>Várias participantes descreveram como as expressões de machismo, inclusive a violência baseada em gênero e a desinformação de gênero, são características definidoras do ecossistema de informação na América Latina. Por exemplo, uma pessoa descreveu como ela testemunha uma grande quantidade de desinformação sobre saúde e direitos sexuais e reprodutivos e, em seu trabalho, enfrenta problemas significativos, como censura e ataques digitais. Outra pessoa que trabalha para compartilhar conteúdo audiovisual sobre dissidências sexuais e de gênero na América Latina também relatou enfrentar censura no processo de compartilhamento de seu trabalho. Para quem participou da nossa conversa na semana passada, a construção de um ecossistema de informações mais saudável e robusto na região exige o <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/10-inspiring-initiatives-fighting-online-political-violence-in-latin-america/" title="">combate a esses tipos de violência de gênero</a>.</p>



 Construindo pontes e compartilhando conhecimento para um ecossistema de informação mais forte 



<p>Durante a chamada, participantes falaram sobre o aproveitamento das tecnologias digitais (bem como o uso de outras estratégias relevantes!) para se comunicarem entre si e criarem pontes entre diferentes setores e áreas de trabalho, o que inclui a construção de conhecimento coletivo sobre habilidades como comunicação, segurança e dados digitais, direitos digitais e muito mais. Para isso, assim como na <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/a-slow-burning-process-to-improve-the-information-ecosystem-we-need-to-rebuild-trust-and-focus-on-local-community-driven-initiatives/" title="">chamada comunitária anterior</a>, participantes destacaram a importância de trabalhar para melhorar os ecossistemas de informação em nível local, promovendo um senso de comunidade e respondendo às necessidades de informação de suas comunidades.</p>



<p>Algumas das iniciativas inspiradoras que conhecemos durante a chamada e que estão trabalhando para fortalecer seus ecossistemas de informações locais incluem:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.taturana.org/" title="">Taturana</a>, uma organização brasileira de distribuição de filmes que trabalha com mediadores locais para tornar os filmes de impacto social mais acessíveis;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://datalabe.org/" title="">DataLabe</a>, um laboratório de narrativa e dados da Maré, no Rio de Janeiro;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://mujeresalborde.org/programa/al-borde-producciones/" title="">Escuela Audiovisual al Borde</a>, organizada pela Mujeres Al Borde para ajudar as pessoas a criarem suas próprias narrativas e conteúdo;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://nosmulheresdaperiferia.com.br/" title="">Nós Mulheres da Periferia</a>,&nbsp; um veículo jornalístico liderado por mulheres negras no Brasil;&nbsp; 



 O projeto <a href="https://www.circuito.digital/" title="">circuito.digital da Linterna Verde</a>, por meio do qual eles ajudam as organizações a entender os problemas de moderação de conteúdo e a documentar casos;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://latfem.org/" title="">LatFem</a>, uma mídia feminista nativa digital que trabalha para fornecer informações de qualidade na região;&nbsp; 



 …e muitas outras iniciativas (que continuaremos a compartilhar em nosso blog nos próximos meses!) 
 



<p>Participantes também falaram sobre o apoio e o investimento no trabalho realizado por organizações indígenas, quilombolas e lideradas por pessoas negras como algo crucial para ter ecossistemas de informação locais mais fortes na região.</p>



 Próximos passos e como você pode se envolver 



<p>Durante as próximas semanas, entrevistaremos pesquisadores, comunicadores, jornalistas, profissionais de mídia cívica, defensores de direitos digitais e ativistas de justiça social que trabalham para criar ecossistemas de informação melhores na América Latina e no Caribe.

		<p>NEWARK, New Jersey, December 11, 2023 – To expand knowledge access, community, and practice in the digital learning space, Edge in collaboration with Neumann University launches the Mid-Atlantic Digital Learning Colleges &amp; Universities Affinity Group.</p>
<p>The genesis of the idea for the group derived through a partnership with Alexandra Salas, Vice President for Digital Learning &amp; Innovation at Neumann University. The inaugural meeting, held November 28, 2023, drew digital learning leaders from representatives of institutions from three states, including Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Vital topics of discussion included:</p>
 
 Organizational structure of instructional design offices 
 Quality assurance frameworks 
 The role of AI in instructional design and education 
 
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		 “Having an affinity group where four year institutions in the Mid-Atlantic area can have a platform where we can engage, share, find common ground, and discuss our collective differences, and our challenges will in terms of growth opportunities and troubleshooting and to figure out new ways of staying relevant in higher ed.” 
 — Alexandra Salas<br>

		<p>Elaborated, Joshua Gaul, Associate Vice President &amp; Chief Digital Learning Officer, Edge, “This affinity group is a great opportunity to connect with colleagues to share ideas and build relationships. I love connecting with people I know and don’t know to talk about trends, struggles, and any other current topics in our field. Having intelligent discussions with intelligent people is something I will always welcome! We are off to a great start – I can’t wait to grow it more!”</p>
<p>Mid-Atlantic Digital Learning Colleges &amp; Universities Affinity Group member Dr. Earl W. Brieger, Chief Online Learning Officer, Gannon University added, “Our new affinity group is important to help the members consider new approaches to instructional design that promote student engagement and meaningful interactions.” Continued Dr. Brieger, “In higher education, a dedicated group focused on instructional design, pedagogy, and compliance plays a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of our institutions’ online learning experiences. By leveraging our pedagogical expertise and knowledge of innovative technology, this new group helps ensure the development of engaging and effective online instruction, fostering student success and promoting a culture of continuous improvement in teaching methodologies.”</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		 “Participating in the Mid-Atlantic Digital Learning Colleges &amp; Universities Affinity Group broadens perspectives by incorporating diverse experiences and approaches from across the region. It complements similar in-state groups focusing on localized challenges. The initial meeting quickly showed that we are all experiencing similar challenges and can share solutions.”

<p>Built on the WebAuthentication standard, they eliminate traditional password challenges. Despite corporate adoption hurdles, the FIDO Alliance claims readiness, with 92% expressing confidence in passkey security benefits. Challenges include compatibility issues with platforms like Microsoft Entra ID and limited support from browsers. Adoption may be slower in heavily regulated industries requiring higher security standards.</p>

<p>Momentum continues in Japan with notable passkey deployments, while SBI Sumishin Net Bank announces membership and Mercari is appointed to Board of Directors&nbsp;</p>



<p>TOKYO, December 8th, 2023 – 2023 has been ‘the year of passkeys,’ as major consumer brands began offering them to make more than 7 billion user accounts ready for passwordless sign-ins. This momentum behind FIDO is the focus of today’s 10th FIDO Tokyo Seminar, where hundreds gathered to learn about the latest developments in the global push to eliminate dependence on passwords. Presenters include those from the Digital Agency of Japan, the National Institute of Informatics, the Taiwan government, Amazon, FIDO Alliance, Google, KDDI Corporation, LY Corporation, Mercari, NTT DOCOMO, Tik Tok and more.</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication uptake soars in 2023 as passkeys become available for consumer and workforce applications</p>



<p>Passkeys, which can be available across a user’s devices or bound to a single device, provide phishing-resistant security with a user experience far superior to passwords and other phishable forms of authentication. Many major consumer brands including Adobe, Amazon, Apple, CVSHealth, Dashlane, DocuSign, Google, Hyatt, Instacart, Kayak, LY Corporation, Mercari, NTT DOCOMO, Nintendo, 1Password, PayPal, Shopify, TikTok and others began offering them for cross-device sign-in to their services in 2023. Usage jumped in the workforce, too, as companies such as Fox, Hyatt, Intuit, Target and more bolstered their authentication options with passkeys.</p>



<p>Consumers also gained more flexibility for passkey management this year, as credential managers such as 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane and LastPass joined Apple, Google and Microsoft as available options for managing passkeys across devices.</p>



<p>Service providers are realizing the benefits of passkeys</p>



<p>Google made passkeys the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/passkeys-default-google-accounts/">default sign-in method</a> for personal Google accounts and over <a href="https://safety.google/authentication/passkey/">9 million organizations</a> can allow users to sign in-to Google Workspace or Google Cloud using passkeys. Google, which has shared many early results from its implementation, reported passkeys are <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/passkeys-default-google-accounts/">40% faster than signing in with passwords</a>. Some other reported benefits have been reported from Intuit, which has seen a 97% sign-in success rate, and a 70% reduction in sign-in time with passkeys, and Mercari, which has seen a 82.5% authentication success rate&nbsp; with 20.5 seconds time reduction for authentication when compared to&nbsp; SMS OTP sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notable Momentum in Japan</p>



<p>Specifically in Japan, notable FIDO momentum discussed in the seminar included:&nbsp;</p>



 
 KDDI now has more than 10 million au ID customers now using FIDO authentication (as of August 2023); and KDDI has seen a dramatic decrease (nearly 30%)&nbsp; in calls to its customer support center as a result.&nbsp; 



 LY Corporation now has 21 million of FIDO active users among 44 millions of enabling the password-less option; over 40% of all user authentication on smartphones are FIDO authentication now.&nbsp; 



 Mercari has seen the benefits of passkeys, with 2.1 million users enrolled, and now seeing sign-in speeds at 4.4 seconds (which is 20.5 second time reduction), and a 82.5% sign-in success rate (15% improvement).&nbsp; 



 NTT DOCOMO has released its own Digital Identity Guidelines, and since deploying passkeys has seen dramatic enrollment (almost double in a year, now 37%) and reduction in successful phishing attacks. 
 



<p>Along with the many deployments in Japan, there are 64 of the FIDO Alliance’s 250+ member companies actively taking part in the FIDO Japan Working Group (FJWG). The FJWG is now beginning its 8th year working together to spread awareness and adoption of FIDO in the region. Notably, SBI Sumishin Net Bank today announced that they have joined FIDO Alliance as a Sponsor member, effective immediately, and Mercari has been appointed to the FIDO Alliance Board of Directors.</p>



<p>Consumers and workforce users are aware of, and want to use, passkeys</p>



<p>Passkeys are not only available across a wide array of services, but recent studies have shown that consumers and workforce users are aware of, and want to use, passkeys. A recent report from <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> and <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;esheet=53518663&amp;newsitemid=20230809614908&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=LastPass&amp;index=1&amp;md5=77c9b141f704e56ec2c9543ec95bc3d7">LastPass</a> showed that businesses believe passkeys will help make them more secure: 92% believe passkeys will benefit their overall security posture, and 93% agree that passkeys will eventually help reduce the volume of unofficial (i.e., “Shadow IT”) applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another FIDO Alliance report revealed that passkeys have grown in consumer awareness despite still being live just over a year, rising from 39% in 2022 to 52% awareness today, while more than half of respondents said they had set up a passkey to sign into an account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, www.fidoalliance.org, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with standards for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.</p>

<p>“The way you train that (AI) system will have to be crowdsourced&nbsp;… if you want it to be a repository of all human knowledge, all humans need to contribute to it.” — Yann&nbsp;LeCun</p><p>OriginTrail is an open decentralized knowledge system of collectively ownable, discoverable and verifiable units of knowledge, connected in a Decentralized Knowledge Graph, safeguarded by several blockchains. World class companies are already using OriginTrail to create value for their ecosystems. For example, OriginTrail is enabling frictionless international trade for over 40% of US imports by fostering secure exchange of security audits. With the Metcalfe phase initiated in November, the OriginTrail ecosystem entered a journey to achieve a 100.000x growth of the verifiable web of knowledge, pursued in two stages — the genesis, and convergence. The genesis phase creates opportunities for organizations and individuals who will mine the most valuable Knowledge Assets using the latest advancements on the AI-specific layer 1 blockchain — the OriginTrail Parachain (on Polkadot), which will evolve into NeuroWeb.</p><p>This RFC introduces knowledge growth incentives through a key innovation — Knowledge Mining, a decentralized way of growing the trusted knowledge base for humanity, and defines the scope of the beta Knowledge Mining program. The beta program is supported by the <a href="https://www.ngisearch.eu/view/Events/OC1Searchers">EU’s Next Generation Internet initiative — NGI Search</a> through the ChatDKG project. In addition to that Trace Labs (OriginTrail Core Developers) have provided support through the <a href="https://chatdkg.ai/">ChatDKG Grant program</a> aimed for builders of Decentralized AI tools and integrations with the DKG, which are to be piloted in the Knowledge Mining beta&nbsp;program.</p>This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme via the NGI Search <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101069364__;!!D9dNQwwGXtA!W2TymOXKZfJknzduXKZepycFGpQKHCYE2taARqr71Z_4hUad5Z9nJ1iA0WXSsznErIrWwkS6l5ttaifbtFcALg$">grant agreement 101069364</a> and linked with the <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ngi.eu__;!!D9dNQwwGXtA!W2TymOXKZfJknzduXKZepycFGpQKHCYE2taARqr71Z_4hUad5Z9nJ1iA0WXSsznErIrWwkS6l5ttaifkmkhTvg$">Next Generation Internet Initiative</a>.<p>This RFC is used as information support for the upcoming referendum on OriginTrail Parachain on Polkadot seeking&nbsp;to:</p>  Confirm the Knowledge Mining mechanics  Introduce the new naming for OriginTrail Parachain (token ticker OTP) to reflect its unique value proposition as an enabler for the verifiable web through decentralized Artificial Intelligence, becoming NeuroWeb (token ticker&nbsp;NEURO)*  <p>* — No new token is being created, OTP tokens become Neuro&nbsp;tokens</p> Decentralized global intelligence: Synergy of blockchains and Decentralized Knowledge Graph <p>“The word synergy comes from the Greek sin-ergo, meaning, to work together. It describes a mutually supportive atmosphere of trust, where each individual element works towards its own goals, and where the goals may be quite varied; nevertheless, because all elements of a synergetic system support one another, they also support the whole.” — Buckminster Fuller</p><p>The breakthrough of creating a decentralized global intelligence is underpinned by driving both vertical and horizontal synergies that enable network&nbsp;effects.</p><p>Vertical synergies</p><p>OriginTrail forms a strong synergy between knowledge graphs and blockchains. The result of that synergy is a Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) integrated with multiple blockchain networks. Each vertical integration of the DKG to a blockchain network not only brings additional resilience and scale to the OriginTrail DKG, but also enriches that blockchain with native DKG capabilities.</p><p>Horizontal synergies</p><p>Building a cross-chain knowledge base enables horizontal synergies between various blockchain ecosystems. With the proposed knowledge mining design, knowledge miners can mine new knowledge on any of the DKG integrated blockchains and be eligible for claiming their rewards on NeuroWeb. Due to DKG design, all knowledge published on one blockchain can be accessed on any other integrated blockchain, allowing synergy of knowledge assets across&nbsp;chains.</p> Knowledge Mining <p>Data can be an extremely valuable resource, when turned into highly structured, contextualized knowledge. We’ve seen this materialize in many systems from AI models to knowledge graphs driving insights for big corporations (Google, Amazon, Netflix, IKEA, Uber — to name a few), effectively proving the inherent value of knowledge.</p><p>OriginTrail aims to create the largest public knowledge base in the world, by doing so in a collaborative, crowdsourcing approach, via a unique approach called Knowledge Mining.</p><p>Knowledge Mining is the process of producing high quality, blockchain tracked knowledge for artificial intelligence, pioneered by the OriginTrail ecosystem. This cyclical process leverages the key component of the OriginTrail technology — Knowledge Assets — which are ownable containers for knowledge with inherent discoverability, connectivity and data provenance.</p><p>Similarly to the concept of Bitcoin mining, where miners collectively provide computing resources to the network and receive incentives in coins, knowledge miners contributing useful knowledge to the OriginTrail DKG will receive NEURO tokens (currently OTP). With Knowledge Mining incentives enabled across multiple blockchains, the ambition is to drive exponential growth of trusted knowledge in the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph.</p><p>There are 4 general steps in the Knowledge Mining&nbsp;cycle:</p>  Discovery — during which contributors discover profitable “gaps” in knowledge in the DKG, signaled by knowledge consuming applications  Publishing — once a gap is identified, knowledge miners create and publish a set of Knowledge Assets in the DKG. The aim is to incentivise high quality Knowledge Assets (based on content, structure, usage signal and other quality criteria)  Enrichment — participants can collectively improve existing knowledge by various enrichment activities, such as connecting Knowledge Assets to existing high quality Knowledge Assets (e.g. providing linking signal via <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/decentralized-knowledge-graph-layer-2/dkg-basic-concepts#what-is-a-ual">UALs</a>), providing economic signal (e.g. via knowledge market purchase activity, direct economic stake on specific Knowledge Assets, etc) and usage signal (e.g. by utilizing specific knowledge, indicating its usefulness)  Learning — the system finally “learns” from the previous steps in several ways, including DKG entity relevance updates (e.g. equivalent to PageRank), such as reasoning based on newly available knowledge, repopulating vector stores and training AI models based on the newly acquired knowledge.  <p>Knowledge miners publish to the DKG by spending TRAC tokens, utilizing the underlying blockchain native token for gas fees (e.g. NEURO/OTP on NeuroWeb/OriginTrail Parachain, xDAI on Gnosis, ETH on Ethereum etc), while receiving NEURO tokens based on the level of their contribution, regardless of their blockchain of choice to perform Knowledge Mining.</p><p>NEURO token incentives will be distributed to knowledge miners based on both the quality and quantity of their contributions, regardless of the blockchain they choose for Knowledge Mining. It’s important to note that this mechanism is designed to evolve alongside the development of Knowledge Mining. As the ecosystem grows adjustments will be made to further improve fairness and efficiency of the reward system until the system matures. This dynamic approach ensures that participants are continually incentivized and rewarded for their valuable contributions. The process of Knowledge Mining implementation is subject to updates guided by the decentralized governance system on NeuroWeb (governance details available in <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/tree/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-15-OriginTrail-Parachain-Governance">OT-RFC-15</a>).</p><p>To kickstart the first Knowledge Mining system and validate the approaches, we are introducing the Genesis Knowledge Mining beta&nbsp;program.</p> Genesis Knowledge Mining beta&nbsp;program <p>The initial beta program is aimed at kickstarting Knowledge Mining through a Supervised Knowledge Mining approach as part of the Metcalfe Genesis phase of the OriginTrail roadmap. To establish dynamic cycles and quick iterations, the initial beta Knowledge Mining program will be executed as described below.</p> Mechanics of the beta Mining&nbsp;program <p>The initial beta Knowledge Mining will be facilitated by OriginTrail Core developers and all interested knowledge miners can participate by using the <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/knowledge-mining-kit">Knowledge Mining Kit</a>, containing a set of tools and tutorials on knowledge mining. The aim of the beta program is to validate the intended approach in a simplified manner (MVP approach) so that improvements and potential flaws can be discovered in a timely manner. The beta Knowledge Mining will be performed only on OriginTrail Parachain (NeuroWeb).</p><p>Discovery: To establish dynamic cycles and quick iterations, the genesis Knowledge Mining beta program will have a narrow focus on two specific knowledge domains:</p>  Knowledge about the wider OriginTrail ecosystem (AI, knowledge graph and blockchain technologies, and their relation to OriginTrail)  Knowledge relevant for the construction industry  <p>Details of how discovery can be done, and the specifics on the two knowledge domain topics will be presented in the Knowledge Mining&nbsp;kit.</p><p>Publishing: Several tools and instructions will be provided for creation and publishing of Knowledge Assets in the Knowledge Mining Kit, and will gradually expand over the course of the beta&nbsp;program.</p><p>Enrichment: Will focus on connecting relevant Knowledge Assets (linking signal) and token locking (economic signal)</p><p>Learning: Initially the learning step will be performed by OriginTrail Core developers, introducing mined Knowledge Assets into OriginTrail World.</p><p>All details of the process, including how you can participate will be explained in the Knowledge Mining Kit. A total of 1.000.000 OTP tokens (to become Neuro tokens) will be designated for the Knowledge Mining Beta program&nbsp;rewards.</p> OriginTrail Parachain becomes NeuroWeb — the Knowledge Mining blockchain <p>The OriginTrail Parachain is poised for a transformative evolution into NeuroWeb, a blockchain platform specifically tailored for Knowledge Mining and Knowledge-centric functions. This shift represents an advanced stage in the evolution of the original concept behind OriginTrail Parachain and its OTP token (to be renamed to NEURO), a progression that will be thoroughly detailed in the upcoming NeuroWeb whitepaper, detailing the NEURO token economic model designed to incentivize the growth and dissemination of knowledge.</p><p>To ensure community involvement and support, a Referendum vote is to be executed on the OriginTrail Parachain. This critical step will not only confirm the community’s support for the proposed change but also mark the beginning of the Knowledge Mining beta program. The community is invited to review this Request for Comments (RFC) and provide comments as soon as possible, after which the referendum voting will take place. The referendum voting will kickstart on Monday, December 18th&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Looking ahead, the Genesis Knowledge Mining beta program is set to commence in January&nbsp;2024.</p><p>To conclude, the referendum vote will&nbsp;entail:</p>  Confirmation of the name change from OriginTrail Parachain to&nbsp;NeuroWeb  Confirmation on the Knowledge Mining&nbsp;concept   Conclusion <p>This RFC introduces the concept of Knowledge Mining and the dedicated artificial intelligence blockchain NeuroWeb which will implement Knowledge Mining capabilities in Web3. The wider community is invited to provide feedback on the presented proposals and participate in confirming the indicated direction in the coming referendum to be voted upon <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/41">discussion on this&nbsp;RFC</a>.</p><p>#TraceON</p><p>About OriginTrail</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by enabling a universe of AI-ready Knowledge Assets, allowing anyone to take part in trusted knowledge sharing.

<p>The analysis was co-funded by the Australian Government and the OpenID Foundation, and executed by the team at the University of Stuttgart that previously analyzed both FAPI 1.0 and the FAPI 2.0 Security Profile, in close collaboration with the FAPI working group.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-attacker-model.html">FAPI 2.0 Attacker Model</a> specifies security goals for authorization and authentication flows:</p>
 
 For OAuth 2.0 authorization flows, an attacker must not be able to access resources belonging to a user. Additionally, the attacker must not be able to force a user to use the resource of the attacker (instead of their own resources). 
 For authentication flows that use OpenID Connect, an attacker must not be able to log in under the identity of a user. And neither must an attacker be able to force a user to be logged in under an identity of the attacker (instead of their own identity). 
 
<p><br>In addition to these security goals, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/575-httpsig/fapi-2_0-message-signing.md">FAPI 2.0 Message Signing</a> also specifies non-repudiation requirements, where the general idea of non-repudiation is that “If an honest party A accepts a message (it expected to be signed) signed with a key of an honest party B, the message was signed by B”. The non-repudiation requirements apply to:</p>
 
 Pushed Authorization Requests 
 Authorization Responses 
 Introspection Responses 
 Resource Requests/Responses 
 
<p><br>The analysis of the aforementioned security properties is based on the Web Infrastructure Model (WIM), which is a detailed formal model of the Web infrastructure. The report provides an overview of the protocols and extensions analyzed and the security goals considered. In order to facilitate the analysis and prove the security properties based on the given formal model, a set of modeling decisions and assumptions were made, and the report goes into detail on all of these and explains the reasoning behind them.</p>
<p>As a result of this work, the researchers at the University of Stuttgart, Institute of Information Security led by Prof. Ralf Küsters, Pedram Hosseyni and Tim Würtele, have been able to prove the security properties listed above. This result should give implementers of FAPI 2.0 further confidence in the security benefits of implementing the specifications.</p>

<p>Organizational cyber security has never been more under attack than in today’s world. With the introduction of the OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Actions Operations (CACAO) Version 2.0 standard, security organizations have a new and formidable toolkit in their ability to orchestrate and collaborate using fully automatable security playbooks to respond to today’s cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on to learn more about how CACAO can help defend your organization better.<br></p>



 The New Standard for Security Playbooks 



<p>CACAO is a standardized framework for orchestrating and automating course-of-action playbooks in cybersecurity. It streamlines the creation, execution, and sharing of playbooks, making it easier for security teams to respond to incidents, mitigate threats, and protect their networks. CACAO offers a modular and extensible approach to playbook development, ensuring that it can adapt to the diverse needs of different organizations.</p>



<p>CACAO focuses on empowering IT/Security organizations to design and orchestrate security activities. These range from traditional activities like intrusion detection; through security event triage, to determining relevant steps to counter a threat; and enforce mitigation and incident response procedures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, it enables more advanced techniques that use playbooks across various use cases that organizations may employ or want to address, such as performing attack emulations as part of red team activities, utilizing threat deception techniques to engage with active threats against the organization, or even ensuring policy and regulatory compliance.<br><br>The following section highlights some of the key aspects of how CACAO Playbooks are designed.</p>



 Key Technology of CACAO 



<p></p>



<p>Organizing and Searching Playbooks: Metadata<br><br>Metadata is a crucial and powerful component of CACAO, allowing for the efficient categorization and searchability of playbooks. It includes information such as the operational roles a playbook performs, descriptions of its activities, and the complexity of workflow steps encapsulated. For example, a playbook may contain workflow steps that are simple sequencing or they may contain control flows that require the orchestration system to handle the typical logic that programs require. This metadata helps organizations find relevant playbooks quickly and accordingly tailor them to their specific requirements.</p>



<p>Defining the process, logic and knowledge within a playbook: Workflow Steps</p>



<p>CACAO playbooks are structured as workflows, composed of a dictionary of action steps to be performed sequentially or in parallel while also staying flexible, allowing branching with other CACAO playbooks (modular approach), and incorporating different types of conditional logic (e.g., if, while, switch) to support even the most advanced and complex scenarios and requirements.</p>



<p>Connecting the playbook steps to systems, people and their targets: Agents and Targets<br><br>In CACAO, the agent is the entity responsible for executing actions, while the target is the recipient of those actions. Agents execute action steps containing commands against targets. The design emphasizes modularity and reusability, allowing organizations to define agents and targets once, reference them in multiple playbooks, or reuse them within a playbook. This approach provides flexibility on how action steps and their underlying commands will be executed by, or against, for example, an individual, group, organization, devices and equipment, or in a hybrid manner.&nbsp;</p>



 Additional Key Features of CACAO 



  
<p><br>Modularity &amp; Extensibility</p>
  



<p>Recognizing that cybersecurity organizations and their technologies can span a large ecosystem that is constantly evolving, CACAO was designed to be both modular and extensible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations can be responsible for specific areas of technology and their respective playbooks. Those playbooks can be combined with other organization’s playbooks for specific threats or general process implementation that larger organizations typically follow when responding to incidents (also known as standard operating procedures – SOPs). In many respects how the IT/Security organization is defined and operating is set; however, CACAO playbooks can be easily mapped to that organizational fit, without requiring changes to the organization or how they perform their automation. With CACAO, organizations now have standardized and fully interoperable playbooks that can provide significant improvements to their operational processes within the organization and externally if the team is collaborating with other organizations.</p>



<p>CACAO already includes a comprehensive set of integrations for a large variety of commands and toolsets*. However, organizations can also adapt CACAO to incorporate new tools, proprietary systems, or evolving industry standards. We defined an extension mechanism that is now the basis for <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/stix-v2.1.pdf">STIX</a> and CACAO Extensions that can be applied at the playbook, step, or command level, providing flexibility for organizations to customize their orchestration.</p>



<p>* See <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/cs01/security-playbooks-v2.0-cs01.html#_Toc152256488">CACAO Specification Section 5</a> for details.</p>



  
<p><br><br>Ensuring Playbook Integrity</p>
  



<p>Integrity and trust are essential in the world of cybersecurity. CACAO addresses this need by incorporating digital signatures into playbooks to support the ability for them to be signed and countersigned. CACAO’s signature mechanism (<a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.590-202310-P">JSON signature scheme</a>), has been submitted to the UN’s ITU-T, which was standardized as <a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.590-202310-P">X.590</a>. It is now being used in CACAO, assuring authenticity and ensuring integrity across playbooks and helping organizations validate their sources and track changes to playbooks over time.</p>



  
<p><br><br>Integrating Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with Orchestration</p>
  



<p>CACAO connects with the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) Version 2.1 standard, ensuring interoperability and information sharing between cyber threat intelligence and incident response. CACAO uses the same identifiers, versioning mechanism, and core metadata as STIX, enabling organization investments to support both standards easily. This integration allows organizations to leverage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and apply it directly to their playbooks. Similarly, the synergistic utilization of these two standards can allow CTI to trigger or recommend the execution of specific CACAO playbooks.&nbsp;</p>



 <br>Designing CACAO Playbooks – Key Elements to Consider 



<p>As highlighted above, there are three key aspects to designing a CACAO Playbook that an organization must consider.<br><br>Metadata</p>



<p></p>



<p>Metadata enables organizations to assess and evaluate the contents of a playbook and what its operational impact might be. The key parts and some of the properties to consider are:</p>



 
 Playbook Type
 
 This property defines the key purpose of the playbook, for example, does it address, threat detection, incident response, threat mitigation, investigation, a combination of the aforementioned, etc. 
 
 
 



 
 Playbook Activities &amp; Playbook Processing
 
 These properties enable organizations to better understand what a playbook does in detail and what features it has implemented such as conditional logic, digital signatures, etc. 
 
 
 



 
 Versioning
 
 Versioning enables organizations to track changes in their playbooks over time and potentially changes in playbooks created by different authors. 
 
 



 Labels
 
 Labels can be used to index and categorize playbooks by type, organization, and function while enabling many other organizational and trust group specific vocabularies or taxonomies. Labeling can be extremely powerful and effective when organizing playbooks. 
 
 
 



<p>Workflow Steps<br></p>



<p></p>



<p>Workflow Steps are the primary content that defines the playbook and the outcomes expected by executing the steps within it. CACAO provides a rich set of (programming) constructs, offering organizations a great amount of flexibility and comprehensive support for their operational and automation needs.</p>



<p>Steps may include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sequential
 
 Each step is executed in a simple defined order:<br>step 1, step 2, step 3, step n 
 
 



 Parallel
 
 Each step is executed in parallel:<br>step 1.1, step 1.2, step 1.3, step 1.n 
 
 



 Conditional
 
 Each step can consider a boolean expression prior to executing the next step, for example, if Condition X is true, then perform step 1. 
 
 



 Loops
 
 Supports repeating steps until a condition is not satisfied, for example, while Condition X is true, then perform step 1. 
 
 



 Action
 
 Supports the specific action to be executed for a given step. 
 
 
 



<p>Agents &amp; Targets</p>



<p></p>



<p>Agents execute action steps containing commands against targets.</p>



<p>Two simple examples:</p>



 
 An agent could be an orchestration system executing an automated command (e.g., HTTP API call) to configure a firewall (in this case – the target).&nbsp; 



 A human agent executing a manual step (manual command), such as switching off the power to a building’s internet connection, which requires network isolation and is impossible to automate without a human override. 
 



 <br>Conclusion 



<p>CACAO provides organizations with a rich set of mechanisms to define security playbooks across their entire organization to handle many different aspects of the security operations lifecycle. For collaborating teams within the organizations or across different organizations, CACAO enables the teams to define and share their defensive tradecraft on many aspects including incidents, threat responses, investigative actions, and security assessments.&nbsp;</p>

 Not-for-Profit Registry Launches to Spur Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Through Transparent Digital&nbsp;Tool  The SAFc Registry will transparently and rigorously connect corporate aviation customers to clean fuel deployment, reducing emissions from air travel and air&nbsp;freight. <p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates — December 6, 2023 — A new independent, not-for-profit sustainable aviation fuel certificate (SAFc) registry launched today at COP28, supporting major consumers of air travel and transport in their efforts to help directly decarbonize flight with an enterprise-grade digital tool. The registry was created by clean energy nonprofit RMI and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), in collaboration with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) and digital solutions developer Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>The <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a> connects corporate consumers, airlines, freight forwarders, and clean fuel producers in one universally accessible platform that will spur the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) via the purchase of SAF certificates. Led by impartial nonprofits, the careful, transparent design of the registry builds on industry best practices and went through public consultation to ensure that the SAF certificates exchanged realize their intended environmental impact and can be claimed towards emissions reduction goals.</p><blockquote>“The SAFc Registry is the culmination of RMI’s ongoing work to catalyze the sustainable aviation fuel market. By creating a throughline from corporate consumers to fuel producers, we can expand investment in SAF infrastructure and increase supply of low-carbon fuels. Voluntary uptake is critical to scaling a burgeoning market, and we hope this registry can serve as an example for other sectors in the future.” said Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at the clean energy nonprofit RMI.</blockquote><p>SAF is made from renewable or waste materials and can decrease the lifecycle emissions of flight by more than 80%. However, the fuel is not yet widely available and carries a significant green price premium. The Registry helps address this market gap by connecting corporate demand for emissions reductions to SAF producers through an auditable ledger for certificates which decouples the emissions benefits of SAF use from the physical fuel supply. It is the final piece of market infrastructure — in addition to robust <a href="https://rsb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RSB-PRO-20-001-001-RSB-Book-and-Claim-Manual-3.0.pdf">standards</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificate-safc-emissions-accounting-and-reporting-guidelines/">accounting guidelines</a>, and structured <a href="https://flysaba.org/2023/04/04/first-collective-purchase-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates/">RFPs</a> — to create a robust and de-risked market for SAFc investment.</p><blockquote>“For corporations and airlines, no other registry offers full transparency and tracks sustainable aviation fuel integrity to ensure high impact in fighting climate emissions,” said Elizabeth Sturcken, Managing Director, Net Zero Value Chains, at&nbsp;EDF.</blockquote><p>Major corporations that fly employees and goods around the world are urgently seeking ways to reduce the climate impacts from air transport. Emissions from travel, part of the “Scope 3” emissions in corporate emissions accounting, often represent the lion’s share of a business’ carbon footprint. SAF certificates enable companies to directly buy the auditable, credible emissions claims that represent a volume of sustainable aviation fuel displacing the same volume of conventional jet fuel for climate disclosures. These SAF certificates can be issued and retired in their name on the registry. Purchase of the certificates spurs fuel producers to invest in SAF production by sending a strong demand signal and creating a secondary value&nbsp;stream.</p><p>Major customers like Bank of America, Boom Supersonic, Boston Consulting Group, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Meta have already banded together to <a href="https://flysaba.org/2023/04/04/first-collective-purchase-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates/">collectively procure SAF certificates through SABA</a>, an alliance of the world’s most ambitious corporations addressing the emissions of flight through collective action. Future joint procurement efforts can use the SAFc Registry to seamlessly ensure the delivery of SAF certificates and sustainability assurances to&nbsp;buyers.</p><blockquote>“The SAFc Registry stands alone among other registries for being state-of-the-art, purely independent, and non-profit led. It should be the choice for any aviation customer looking to decarbonize their use of aviation,” said Kim Carnahan, Head of the SABA Secretariat and CEO of Neoteric Energy and&nbsp;Climate.</blockquote><p>The open-source software behind the SAFc Registry was designed to deliver an intuitive experience and great transparency to end-users. Each action on the SAFc Registry is validated, scrubbed of sensitive data, and digitally recorded. For registry users, the public, and auditors, this represents a continuous audit of registry operations.</p><blockquote>“We’re proud to support this best-in-class registry from inception and are already looking forward to new features focused on even easier ease-of-use and increased transparency,” said Jesse Morris, CEO at Energy&nbsp;Web.</blockquote><p>RMI, EDF, SABA and Energy Web will provide a tour of the new registry in a <a href="https://rmi.org/event/webinar-safc-registry-what-it-is-how-to-engage-and-why-it-matters/">webinar</a> on December 12th, 2023, and show how SAFc can help organizations meet sustainability goals by supporting auditable claims in climate disclosures.</p><p>Notes to&nbsp;Editors</p><p>About RMI</p><p>RMI, founded as Rocky Mountain Institute, is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms global energy systems through market-driven solutions to align with a 1.5°C future and secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all.

<p>15-day third public review - ends December 20th</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that XACML v3.0 Related and Nested Entities Profile Version 1.0 CSD03 from the OASIS eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) TC is now available for public review and comment. This is the third public review for this work.</p>



<p>Overview:</p>



<p>The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) defines categories of attributes that describe entities of relevance to access control decisions. XACML rules, policies and policy sets contain assertions over the attributes of these entities that must be evaluated to arrive at an access decision. Principal among the various predefined entities are the entity that is requesting access, i.e., the access subject, and the entity being accessed, i.e., the resource. However, it is not unusual for access decisions to be dependent on attributes of entities that are associated with the access subject or resource. For example, attributes of an organization that employs the access subject, or attributes of a licensing agreement that covers the terms of use of a resource.</p>



<p>This profile defines two ways of representing these associated entities in the request context – related entities and nested entities – and defines additional mechanisms to access and traverse these entities.</p>



<p>TC Description:</p>



<p>The XACML TC specifies access control standards, based on the Attribute-based Access Control model (ABAC). The core of this work is the specification of the syntax and semantics of a policy language called XACML. Current work in the TC consists mostly of defining additional profiles of various types which build on version 3.0 of the XACML core specification.</p>

The Lissi wallet supports selected eIDAS standards required for European digital identity&nbsp;wallets.<p>In response to the revision of the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">eIDAS regulation</a>, the European Union is introducing a common set of standards and technical specifications, which are designed to facilitate the seamless issuance, presentation and verification of verifiable identity data across borders. We are excited to announce that the Lissi ID-Wallet supports selected standards, as we will further elaborate in this&nbsp;article.</p><p>The technical standards of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation are defined in the <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework">Architecture Reference Framework</a> (ARF). These standards are crucial as every <a href="https://neosfer.de/en/unveiling-eidas-2-0-the-dawn-of-the-eudi-wallet-era/">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> (EUDI Wallet) and applications interacting with it will need to support the required standards and technical specifications, which include communication protocols and credential formats among others. At <a href="https://www.lissi.id/">Lissi</a>, we have extended our wallet to ensure alignment with core standards:</p><p>Communication protocols: Currently, the only proposed communication protocol is OpenID4VC (OpenID for verifiable credentials), which we integrated as the worlds first wallet as part of a <a href="https://idunion.org/2023/04/26/contributing-to-the-development-of-openid4vc-with-idunion/">prototypical implementation in 2021</a>. It is mandated for the presentation of the foundational identity (eID or PID — Person Identification Data), which will be issued by a member state. With the current status of the regulation, member states will have the flexibility to choose their own issuance protocols for the PID, however QEAA and EAA need to be issued via this protocol.</p><p>Credential formats: The ARF standards currently propose multiple credential formats, including two different types of verifiable credentials as well as an ISO mobile driver’s license (mDL) credential format. In order to use the benefits of multiple credential formats, the PID will be issued as verifiable credential and ISO mDL simultaneously. For all other (qualified) electronic attribute attestations (such as an educational degree, employee pass, customer card, insurance claim etc.) the issuer is free to choose one of the supported types of credential formats according to the&nbsp;ARF.</p><p>We are thrilled to announce that the Lissi ID-Wallet, is now supporting these new crucial standards:</p>  OpenID4VC, which includes OpenID4VCI (OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance) and OpenID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations).  SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credentials with JSON payloads (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-terbu-sd-jwt-vc-02">SD-JWT&nbsp;VC</a>).  <p>The wallet is publicly available as a beta version for both iOS (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">TestFlight</a>) and A<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">ndroid</a> platforms. We encourage developers of issuance and verification software to test their implementations against our wallet to ensure interoperability and seamless functionality. We currently test our own issuance and verification software with selected clients. If you are interested in exploring our <a href="https://www.lissi.id/for-organisations">ID-Wallet connector software</a> with a free trial <a href="https://r82hs8os9o6.typeform.com/to/HDfiwoNP">reserve your spot on our waitlist&nbsp;now</a>.</p><p>The new standards are implemented based on the High Assurance Interoperability Profile (HAIP). It’s worth noting that there are other important standards as part of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation, such trust lists, public key infrastructure, digital signatures and more, which we will explore in future articles and won’t go into detail&nbsp;here.</p><p>In addition the Lissi ID-Wallet still supports the following standards which are not defined in the ARF, however, are used in many other identity projects:</p>  The DIDcomm communication protocol  Anonymous credentials also called “Anoncreds”  <p>As we witness the European community unite around a shared vision for a trusted digital future, we are proud to offer solutions that facilitate the required testing and integration of these pivotal standards. We look forward to continuing our journey alongside you, contributing to a harmonious and interconnected digital&nbsp;Europe.</p>

 Mapping learning processes and&nbsp;outcomes <p>Often, when reflecting on ‘learning’, people recall their days of compulsory schooling, filled with specific content to learn and tests to complete. Yet, when we stop to think about it, most learning experiences differ from this. From learning to tie shoelaces, to the intricacies of how to interact on a social network, we learn by imitation and from&nbsp;others.</p><p>In other words, learning occurs both unintentionally and intentionally, both solo and collectively. It’s something that happens daily in all different kinds of ways. So when we’re thinking of designing learning experiences with and for others, we need to be aware of different forms of learning; each can be used effectively for various purposes.</p> Learning in four quadrants <p>A good place to start in understanding different forms of learning is with the work of <a href="https://www.sterksamenwerken.nl/userfiles/files/1B-Collectie-%20leren-Simons-De-Laat-2002.pdf">De Laat &amp; Simons</a> (2002). They map learning processes and learning outcomes against each other to create four ‘quadrants’ of learning. A slightly adapted version, with the quadrants renamed for clarity, can be found&nbsp;below:</p><p>To explain those four quadrants with some examples:</p> 1. Individual Learning <p>Self-directed learning processes and personal knowledge acquisition.</p><p>Examples:</p>  Learning to cook a new dish by following a recipe found in a cookbook or online, adjusting it through trial and error to suit one’s own&nbsp;taste.  An independent bookstore owner researching and implementing a new inventory system to better track sales and customer preferences.  An activist educating themselves on legal rights and protest strategies through various self-study materials to organise a non-violent civil disobedience campaign for social&nbsp;justice.   2. Networked Learning <p>Individual learning that occurs as a result of being part of a broader&nbsp;network.</p><p>Examples:</p>  Using a neighbourhood social networking app to exchange gardening tips and local plant knowledge with nearby residents.  A cafe owner joining a national coffee shop network to share insights on sustainable sourcing and eco-friendly practices.  Environmental scientists across the globe collaborating through a virtual network to share research on plastic degradation, aiming to develop new solutions to the plastic waste&nbsp;crisis.   3. Participatory Learning <p>Individuals actively engaging in learning communities.</p><p>Examples:</p>  Local people sharing knowledge and learning from each other’s experiences in a community garden about planting seasons, pest control, and crop rotation.  A coworking space that hosts weekly skill-sharing sessions where entrepreneurs share expertise on various topics such as marketing, legal issues, or funding strategies.  The forum of a social movement where members discuss and learn from each other about effective strategies for advocating policy changes to address income inequality.   4. Cooperative Learning <p>Structured group learning with common goals and shared knowledge creation.</p><p>Examples:</p>  A group of friends forming a book club where they read and discuss books together, each person bringing their own perspective to the discussion.  Renewable energy companies working together through a consortium to develop a shared framework for assessing the environmental impact of their products.  An international coalition of NGOs designing a cooperative learning program for young leaders from marginalised communities, focusing on climate action and sustainable development.   Types of social&nbsp;learning <p>As we can see, the difference here is not simply between ‘learning alone’ or ‘learning with others’. Putting to one side Individual Learning, let’s dig into the three types of learning involving a collective or ‘social’&nbsp;element:</p><p>Where do Communities of Practice (COPs) sit in relation to these three types of learning? The answer is that CoPs can involve all three, depending on the members of the community, how they interact, and what their goals are. This is why the value cycles we discussed in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">our post</a> about the Community Conversations workshops are so important. CoPs change and mature over time, with different forms of learning happening for different people at different times.</p> Conclusion <p>There is no one form of learning that is best for every situation. For example, you might find a manual useful for fixing a boiler, but a manual would be of little use when learning to&nbsp;abseil.</p><p>Using the right type of learning depends both on the process you want to follow and the outcome you want to&nbsp;reach:</p>  If you want to help people or organisations enhance their own knowledge or skills by interacting with others, then look at a Networked Learning approach.  If you want to help them work separately on the same (or similar) goals then consider a Participatory Learning approach.  If you want shared involvement to reach a common goal, then perhaps a Cooperative Learning approach would be best&nbsp;suited.  <p>Taking the time to understand both what you and your learners want from a situation can save a lot of time, money, and frustration. Designing a course to deliver the latest information might be important in the world of compliance training, but for the vast majority of learning experiences, it’s the social component that provides a lot of the&nbsp;value.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/social-learning-the-heartbeat-of-communities-and-networks-55a9b3d33e8d">Social Learning: The Heartbeat of Communities and Networks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Security and Fraud Prevention: The paper details a new innovative mechanism being built for secure transaction verification, utilizing relayers for fraud prevention. This approach not only fortifies security but also gamifies transaction management, providing a robust and reliable Layer 2 network. 
 Decentralized Governance: Governed by the <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic’s</a> Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), BeL2 supports decentralized decision-making, staying true to Bitcoin’s ethos of community-driven innovation. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impact on Bitcoin’s Ecosystem:</p>
 
 Unleashing Dormant Value: This exciting new solution unlocks new potential in Bitcoin holdings, paving the way for innovative uses in decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital rights markets. 
 Extended Functionality: By leveraging Bitcoin’s robust security, BeL2 significantly expands Bitcoin’s use cases, making it more versatile and adaptable for modern financial needs. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BeL2 whitepaper presents a straightforward plan for enhancing Bitcoin by integrating advanced technologies where engineering will now commence. This approach, appealing to both Bitcoin users and Elastos developers, aims to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities. The BeL2 whitepaper signifies a key step in evolving Bitcoin, combining its fundamental attributes with new SmartWeb technology for improved scalability, functionality, and privacy. To explore BeL2’s visionary approach and understand how it is set to transform the Bitcoin landscape, read the English <a href="https://docdro.id/Xqk17l9">BeL2 whitepaper here</a> or alternately <a href="https://docdro.id/j8LKdMl">阅读BeL2中文版白皮书.</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;We recently interviewed Ivan Basart, who is the co-founder and CTO of a Spanish based digital services company called <a href="https://www.validatedid.com/en?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Validated ID</a>. Validated ID have been long standing Associate members of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) and we sat down to learn more about their company, their story and the service that they're offering. View the interview in it's entirety on <a href="https://youtu.be/kHylglExigM?ref=blog.identity.foundation">YouTube</a></p><p>&nbsp;Limari Navarrete: I always like to start out my first question with getting a sense of the story of not just your company, but also you yourself, how you came to decentralized identity. I feel like everyone has a really great story that's very intriguing, so I'd like to hear yours. Maybe you can tell us a little bit about that.</p><p>&nbsp;Ivan: Actually, my story is quite connected with the wider history. I've been around digital identity and the digital signatures and cryptography space for almost 25 years. I feel old when I say that statement, but that's the reality. It's being a long time. I've been involved in different companies and different projects and that also was interesting, because I've seen the evolution of this space. I've been involved in many projects which were complete failures in terms of adoption, mainly working on digital certificates, many in Europe and in other countries so they can have digital certificates or national ids.</p><p>&nbsp;In that sense, most of the projects that were happening at the beginning of the century through 2010, most of them were very bad in terms of adoption, and that was also one of the reasons why we created Validated ID. I'd say that in my case, what I'm trying to do in this company is cleaning my karma. After working on a lot of projects that not many people were using, we were able to run a company with services that were secure and quite usable while thinking about the user experience.</p><p>&nbsp;When we created Validated ID, you think about the name, we had in mind mainly identity validation, things like the definitions and the problems that you are trying to solve with SSI. But at that time that was in 2012, so more than 11 years ago, the identity landscape was completely different, really the technology was not there. So that's why, when we started the company, the first thing we started was on digital signatures, which was very hot at that time. It's actually our main business.</p><p>&nbsp;So we started our journey with Validated ID working on digital signatures, digital certificates as a trust services provider. Then with the blockchain space, all these things about decentralized identity appear. It really completely took our attention because it was the initial goal of the company. We started working on that at the very beginning and we are founding members of the DIF. Even before the DIF we were part of the Rebooting Web of Trust, we were also part of the Sovrin foundation. We were part of many initiatives that were part of the beginning of the SSI space. When the DIF was created we were very interested in being part of it because it was one of the main think tanks that helped to settle down all these things.</p><p>&nbsp;So that’s briefly my story and Validated ID’s story.&nbsp; We really had this digital id idea the whole time, even before SSI existed. Sometimes things happen that way. You have an idea, but you need to wait till really the market and the masses are there in order to make it happen. So that’s how it was in our case.</p><p>&nbsp;Limari Navarrete: Maybe you can share an overview of Validated ID’s services. I went to the website and you are intersecting a lot of industries with your various products. Can you give us a sense of how you brought SSI to those various products and to some of those industries?</p><p>&nbsp;Ivan: Sure, so Validated ID as it’s called in Europe, is a trust service provider. We are offering services about trust. This is regulated here in Europe. We have a regulation which is called eIDAS (electronic identification and trust services) which regulates digital signature and digital identities which now is under revision. &nbsp;The new revision of eIDAS, as most people who are listening will know, is talking about wallets and things like that. But as I said, we were here before all that from 2012.</p><p>So in that sense, we are offering these kind of services to the market. Our main service is digital signatures but in different flavors, or with different technologies, from using biometrics, to user certificates, to remote signatures or face to face. These are our main services, which are also combined with issuance of certificates and things like that. However from 2017, we start working on SSI. (Self-Sovereign Identity) Those are services that are at a very different maturity level in Validated ID but also in general. But SSI is part of our portfolio of services as a trust service provider. It’s not something isolated, it’s connected with existing services about trust that we're already offering.</p><p>&nbsp;For instance, if you need to create a digital signature you may be able to use a wallet to prove your identity in the process of making a signature and proving who you are. If you go into a facility for a face to face validation, when you create a signature this process of face to face validation could be useful in order to create an attribute &nbsp;that goes into a wallet. So we are trying to connect the ecosystems or services so that SSI can be integrated into the portfolio of services about trust. We think that SSI and the wallet could be very disruptive to existing trust services.  Take digital signature because this is our main service, with digital signatures what you need to do are two things:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prove that you are okay with providing the content of a specific document</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prove your identity</p><p>&nbsp;The way that we are proving our identity nowadays is sometimes very complex using certificates or a very weak DocuSign style proof of identity which mainly only proves that you have access to an email account.</p><p>&nbsp;So when you’re able to have a wallet, in order to prove your identity and not just your identity, but an extended version of your identity, certain attributes that you work for a company, that you are over 18, these kind of things, this we think can be very disrupting in this space. So that's why we think that the SSI service will be part of the ecosystem of services that we have, and the evolution of the system and services that we are offering currently to the market.</p><p>&nbsp;Limari Navarrete:  I think it's a good segue into my next question, which is about one of the projects that Validated ID has been a part of recently which was in collaboration with SEIDOR to bring Verifiable Credentials to five universities in Catalonia. I'd like to hear more about that and I'm sure our audience would be very interested to hear more about that project and where things are with that.</p><p>&nbsp;Ivan: It’s a very interesting project. It's called Camins, which is a Catalan word which means paths. So this project is about delivering an SSI platform ecosystem in order to let those universities issue credentials to students and teachers, to allow access to the university, the virtual campus or get a diploma. One important thing here is that this project is very connected with the EBSI project. EBSI is the European Commission Project about SSI. It’s a ledger but it’s more than that. It’s really specifications, definitions of credentials and so on. This project is very connected to that. Those universities have been working within the EBSI project for years and now they are taking their knowledge and experience and deploying a platform which is compliant with the EBSI and is able to deliver those use cases to citizens. SEIDOR is also our partner and they are doing more of the work of managing the project itself. As Validated ID, what we are providing is the technology and SSI expertise to be able to create this platform, to customize the platform and get it integrated with EBSI, and to put it in place for deployment.</p><p>&nbsp;Here the time frame is that soon, I think at the at the end of this year, beginning next year, there will be a first version deployed. With that they will first create internal use cases in order to test it, and so on, but the goal is really to use that for the deployment of all the citizens of those five universities in Catalonia. Also, the ability to exchange credentials from university to university. If I have a credential for a diploma from your university, I can exchange that information with another university. The good thing about using EBSI is that some of the credentials of the data structure are already defined. So there is an interoperability already defined at different levels, at the protocols, but also the semantics and so on. I think it's a very nice use case on a very nice project, because it's a way of proving that SSI is not just something theoretical We are really at the point that we we can deploy those kinds of projects as a real world use case.</p><p>Watch the video in it's entirety at <a href="https://youtu.be/kHylglExigM?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://youtu.be/kHylglExigM</a></p>

<p>In <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/rong-chen-and-the-evolution-of-the-internet-from-arpanet-to-web3-part-1/">Part 1</a>, we explored the pivotal contributions of Rong Chen to the internet’s development, starting with his innovative work in 1987 at <a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/">NCSA</a> on data rendering algorithms. This era was essential for the evolution of the internet, marked by the introduction of the first TCP/IP protocols for IBM PCs and the genesis of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WWW/">World Wide Web</a> in 1989. Rong’s involvement was key in transitioning the internet into a user-friendly platform. During his time at Microsoft (1992-2000), he further advanced OS development, focusing on multimedia systems and secure computing, a testament to his forward-thinking technological approach.</p>
<p>As the internet evolved from Web 1.0, a basic platform for reading content, to Web 2.0, an interactive space fraught with challenges like data centralisation and privacy issues, Rong’s insights and experiences became increasingly meaningful. This evolution paved the way for Web 3.0, centering on user security, data ownership, and decentralisation—simplifying and enhancing the groundwork laid by Web 2.0. This slow yet significant approach in computer science signified a change towards a more secure, user-centric internet. These foundational principles inspired Rong Chen to establish Elastos, a pioneering Web3 platform, which will be further explored in Part 2.</p>
<p>“The network is the computer.” Rong Chen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Core Technological Principles</p>
<p>Post his time at Microsoft in 2000, Rong relocated to China to spearhead the development of a new operating system, Hexin, amidst tough challenges. His innovation with a C++ virtual machine established a secure, sandboxed environment, laying the foundational architecture of Elastos. The incorporation of blockchain technology in 2018 was a pivotal moment, endowing the platform with decentralised security, immutable records, and smart contracts—cornerstones of a trust-based, secure internet. This integration, along with Rong’s expertise in operating systems and computer science, simplified internet architecture, moving from a centralized to a decentralized network OS. This shift redistributes power from central entities to individual users and communities. Here are the core components:</p>
 
 Sandboxing: Elastos revolutionises security through sandboxing, isolating applications to prevent malware spread and safeguard user data. This contrasts starkly with the current internet model, where apps often have extensive system access. 
 Peer-to-Peer Communication: Elastos transforms internet communication with a peer-to-peer model, facilitating direct data exchange between devices sans central servers, thus enhancing privacy, security, and efficiency. 
 Decentralised and Trust-Based Interactions: Blockchain technology in Elastos underpins a secure, decentralised system with an immutable ledger, pivotal for safeguarding transactions and preventing data breaches and misuse. Elastos combines a main chain for essential transactions which is <a href="https://elastos.info/blog/now-is-a-good-time-to-be-a-validator-with-elastos-elastic-consensus/">merged mined with Bitcoin</a> for security with adaptable side chains for fast tasks like smart contracts and identity services. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elastos as a World Computer</p>
<p>Elastos can be conceptualised as a “World Computer”, a decentralised network mirroring a singular, global computer. This network enables secure data storage, processing, and communication among its users. Its comprehensive framework integrates various components, each akin to parts of a traditional computer. Here’s a breakdown of Elastos’ components and their parallels in a traditional computer system:</p>
 
 Elastos Runtime (The Virtual Machine): Mirroring a computer’s operating system, the Elastos Runtime serves as the primary interface for running applications. It hosts decentralised applications (DApps), akin to an OS within an OS. 
 Elastos Hive (Storage Solution): Hive operates as a decentralised storage system, similar to a computer’s hard drive. It facilitates secure and decentralised data storage and retrieval. 
 Elastos Carrier (Network Layer): Comparable to an internet connection, the Carrier enables peer-to-peer communication between nodes in the Elastos network, circumventing the need for centralised servers. 
 Elastos Blockchain (Trust and Security Layer): This backbone of the Elastos ecosystem is akin to a computer’s security and trust protocols. It’s merged-mined with Bitcoin and provides decentralised trust, records transactions, and manages digital identities. 
 Elastos Sidechains (Scalability Solution): These function like auxiliary processing units, providing additional capabilities and scalability without burdening the main blockchain. 
 ELA Tokens (Transaction and Governance Mechanism): Serving as the currency within Elastos, these tokens are akin to resources or credits in a computer system, managing processes and prioritising tasks. 
 Elastos SDK (Software Development Kit): Similar to a computer’s development tools, this kit equips developers to create DApps for the Elastos ecosystem. 
 
<p></p>
<p>By integrating these components, Elastos forms a comprehensive “world computer”, redefining application operation, data storage, and transaction processes in a digital environment. It emphasises decentralisation, security, and user control. By decentralising the network, Elastos aims to tackle key issues plaguing the current internet, such as data monopolisation, security vulnerabilities, and lack of user autonomy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E Last OS – The Last OS</p>
<p>“Every Web3 app has its dedicated compute space, provided by the hosting device’s OS or the browser’s WebAssembly. Additionally, each Web3 app is equipped with its embedded OS, with dedicated binary executable code loader and interrupt handlers, that can thwart reverse-engineering attempts on decryption keys. This design ensures that the loader can scrutinise the hash value (SHA256) of each executable file against the dependency list in the caller file’s resource section. In essence, every Web3 app has its own built-in trustworthy computing mechanism, eliminating the need to trust external entities, a crucial aspect for Web3 security. Given the diversity of mechanisms employed by different apps, it becomes very challenging for an open-source Web3 Network OS to compromise the security of a Web3 app.” Rong Chen</p>
<p>This vision simplifies Web3 app security: each decentralised app (DApp) functions in its own secure runtime environment with an embedded OS. This design eliminates the need for complex external security measures, focusing on internal protocols like specialised code loaders and SHA256 hash checks. This approach directly enhances trust in the Web3 space, embodying Elastos SmartWeb’s commitment to a secure, independent, and simplified Web3 application security framework.</p>
<p>In this new paradigm, the internet is no longer a series of centralised servers owned by a few corporations. Instead, it functions as a global, cooperative network where each node contributes to the overall system’s stability and security, and binary code moves peer to peer, validating blockchain rights before running the DApp. This approach fundamentally alters how data is stored, shared, and managed, empowering users with greater control over their digital identities and interactions, addressing Web 2.0’s centralisation issues such as single points of failure, corporate control over data, and lack of transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elastos SmartWeb (Interconnectivity Layer)</p>
<p>In Elastos’ vision for Web3, Rong Chen birthed the term ‘SmartWeb’, a category which transforms the internet into a user-driven, interactive ecosystem. The SmartWeb is analogous to a computer’s web browser or internet suite. It enables interconnected services and applications on the Elastos network, allowing for a seamless and integrated user experience. It merges decentralised technology and security, transitioning from centralised control to a more democratic space where users own and control their data.</p>
<p>“On the current internet everything you share is a copy and doesn’t have much value. The internet of value is scarce. Today we trade offline goods, but can you trade online virtual digital assets and build a virtual economy which protects users data? To send a digital asset you have to send code not, for instance, a file that can be played by a media player. You have to send binary code, which runs like a program and validates itself and checks the blockchain, do you still own it? When you’re sharing code we call it a Smartweb.” Rong Chen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Components and Functionality of SmartWeb</p>
 
 Decentralised Structure: SmartWeb utilises Elastos’ decentralised structure, operating across a network of distributed nodes rather than central servers, enhancing security and preventing singular entity control. 
 Security Through Sandboxing and Blockchain: Security in SmartWeb is multifaceted. It employs sandboxing technology to isolate applications, preventing malicious software from affecting the system or accessing user data without permission. The integration of blockchain technology provides an immutable ledger for transactions, fostering trust and transparency. 
 User Empowerment and Control: SmartWeb is designed to return control to users. Through decentralised applications (DApps) and digital identities, users gain autonomy over their digital interactions, managing their data, and controlling how it’s shared. 
 Peer-to-Peer Interactions: A vital component of SmartWeb is its peer-to-peer communication model. Unlike the traditional internet, where data often goes through centralised servers, SmartWeb enables direct communication and data exchange between users’ devices and personal nodes, boosting privacy and efficiency. 
 Integrated Digital Economy: SmartWeb isn’t just about secure communication; it also fosters a decentralised digital economy. Blockchain and smart contracts facilitate secure, transparent financial transactions without traditional intermediaries. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last five years, Elastos has been initiating a paradigm shift in the internet’s evolution, building on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET’s</a> foundational principles. Rong Chen’s vision compels corporations and individuals to adapt, as companies must forgo some control for a decentralised model, disrupting conventional business structures. For individuals, it heralds a new era of digital interaction and ownership. The benefits are transformative: Elastos enhances security, privacy, and user-centricity, supporting true digital ownership. It catalyses individual monetisation and redefines digital private property, enabling users to participate actively and equitably in the digital economy. Users can monetise their content and services directly, establishing ownership rights over their digital assets, a previously challenging feat. Elastos isn’t merely a technological leap; it’s a call to revolutionise our digital world, paving the way for a secure, equitable, and user-controlled digital landscape.</p>

<p>Over a period of six months, The Engine Room worked with<a href="https://www.evanigeria.org/" title=""> Education as a Vaccine (EVA) </a>, a non-profit organisation founded in 2000 that works in partnership with children and young people to advance their rights to health and protection from all forms of violence by strengthening capacities, providing direct services and influencing policies, for improved quality of life.</p>



<p>This post looks back at our work together in the course of our partnership (run&nbsp; through our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/">Matchbox support programme</a>), which focused on EVA Nigeria’s data collection, analysis, storing and sharing practices and processes; how the organisation uses the data they collect; and areas of potential improvement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This included:</p>



 
 Assessing the current data ecosystem and data lifecycle in order to identify opportunities for strengthening their data processes in ways that are both responsible and effective . 



 Working together to determine how Eva Nigeria can approach data management more strategically for advocacy 



 Strengthening knowledge around responsible data management 



 Engaging in practical responsible data management exercises 



 Co-creating a data management policy. 
 



 Local Context 



<p>In Nigeria, internet use is widespread, but the speeds are often slower than recommended for work. While there are laws in place to protect people’s digital rights and data, Nigeria was ranked as the 32 most-breached country in early 2023, with a <a href="https://techcabal.com/2023/05/23/nigeria-is-witnessing-a-disturbing-surge-in-data-breaches/">64% increase in documented data breaches</a> from the previous quarter. In 2021, the government also <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/12/nigeria-ends-its-twitter-ban-after-seven-months">temporarily banned Twitter,</a> which had significant economic and social impact. Despite these issues, however, there’s a strong sense of digital activism in Nigeria, with various campaigns mobilising the public.&nbsp;</p>



 What We Learned 



<p>EVA uses a variety of communication platforms and tools for internal collaboration, project management, and data analysis. As concerns were raised about high property crime rates in Nigeria, the team was interested in strengthening their security. To support in this, our team conducted a thorough assessment of EVA’s practices. This included:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Context research: Our team conducted desk research covering the ways that Eva Nigeria’s varied contexts (geographical, network make-up, applicable legislation, etc.) impact potential risks and strategies.<br><br> 



 Documentation review: We reviewed information and communications documentation, including strategies and policies, and any documentation on relevant security incidents.<br><br> 



 Interviews and surveys: We conducted interviews and surveys with the team to better understand their experiences with tech and data.<br><br> 



 Mapping critical processes: Our team facilitated a data mapping session with the team where we traced the lifecycle of two critical operational processes involving data.<br>&nbsp;<br> 



 Capacity Building: Based on our findings, we facilitated a group session that supported the learning goals of the organisation.&nbsp; 
 



 Looking Towards the Future 



<p>Our partnership surfaced several opportunities for EVA Nigeria to explore in terms of data and security practices – both internally and with their mobile apps:&nbsp;</p>



 Responsible Data 



<p>EVA is an organisation that already uses data in a variety of ways to achieve its mission. We recommended that they primarily focus on incorporating responsible data practices into their workflow. Understanding what data is being collected and for what purpose, and assessing its sensitivity, can help the team identify risks. Additionally, knowing where the data is stored and who has access to it is important for any organisation who wants to better secure their data. Relatedly, minimising data collection, especially when it comes to sensitive information like location and sexual health, was also recommended to keep their users safe.&nbsp;</p>



 Strengthening Organisational Security 



<p>Given the context in which the team works and the ways in which they collaborate, we recommended implementing secure communication guidelines and practices that include using encrypted tools like Signal for internal chats. For video conferencing, we advised switching to services that prioritise privacy, such as Jitsi Meet or BigBlueButton. We also suggested establishing a comprehensive password management process that covers strong password creation, two-factor authentication, and periodic password changes. Training and guidelines for device security were also recommended, focusing on password protection, disk encryption, and limiting personal use on work devices.&nbsp;</p>



 Developing Privacy Policies 



<p>We recommended that EVA’s mobile applications have a comprehensive privacy policy detailing the specific data points collected and their intended use. Data management information should also be standardised across all of EVA’s apps. Lastly, we suggested that future app improvements should focus on innovative yet thoughtful approaches that prioritize both user needs and privacy protection.</p>



 What’s Next 



<p>We are excited to see how EVA’s efforts will continue to shape their organisation’s data management and security practices. From our side, we found this partnership incredibly rewarding, with opportunities to expand our knowledge about health initiatives in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>

This latest one offered a sobering reminder that while New Zealand is sadly behind in a domain where nothing is more important than protecting children from harm online, this community can help with effective and pragmatic industry – government collaboration. I want to draw your attention to these among our list of great achievements this year, because they have each broken new ground for Aotearoa</p>



<p>Alongside the above, and our monthly Coffee Chat series now boasting well over 100 registrations, we ran our Perspectives on Decentralised Identity series in the late summer featuring DINZ members&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar/">RealMe</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar-2/">Mattr</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar-3/">TANZ</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/03-april-perspectives-on-decentralised-identity-summer-series-2023-webinar/">CentraPass</a>&nbsp;(now Futureverse). In autumn DINZ hosted US based digital identity conformity assessment company Zygma who presented the first ever&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/an-analytic-discussion-with-aotearoa-new-zealand-industry-members-around-the-digital-identity-services-trust-framework/">technical analysis of the DISTF Trust Framework</a>. As winter gave way to spring DINZ member ForgeRock put its customers Kiwibank and Westpac on the stage to talk to a big crowd about their experiences with&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/continuous-delivery-what-is-it-and-why-it-matters-to-your-business/">Continuous Delivery</a>. Earlier this month DINZ members&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/air-new-zealand-flying-forward-with-passkeys-delivered-by-authsignal/">Air New Zealand hosted another sold out event with partner Authsignal sharing their successful implementation of passkeys</a>&nbsp;– the first implementation for an airline and the first known implementation in the Australia/NZ region.</p>



<p>December sees us at the Reserve Bank ‘myth busting’ some often misunderstood aspects of our domain, and then our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/digital-identity-annual-meeting-2023/">members Annual Meeting on 7 December</a>&nbsp;to announce our 2024 Executive Council, which will round out our events for the year. With it we will farewell the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-people/">Council of ‘23</a>&nbsp;under whose custodianship of the events above, the list of mahi below and a refreshed 2024 strategy and action plan, have propelled DINZ to new heights. Our sincere thanks to them, particularly those that finish their term this year.</p>



<p>Aside from the standout successes above, members have curated two submissions –&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Response_-Biometrics-discussion-document-2023.pdf">one</a>&nbsp;on the Privacy Commission’s consultation on a code of practice for biometrics, and&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/09/DINZ-Submission-Targeted-Engagement-DISTF-Regulations.pdf">the other</a>&nbsp;on DIA’s targeted consultation on the DISTF regulations. Being an election year, we published DINZ’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/26/trusted-digital-identity-critical-for-new-zealands-digital-future/">Manifesto&nbsp;</a>and have just completed our Briefing for Incoming Ministers to be published shortly. Our perspectives have captured the attention of&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/13/biometric-industry-warns-that-regulation-may-bring-unintended-consequences/">national</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/09/12/digital-id-group-calls-for-biometrics-code-in-nz-to-avoid-stifling-innovation/">international</a>&nbsp;media following biometrics but also&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2023/04/04/your-personal-data-whats-at-risk-and-whats-being-done-to-protect-it/">the fallout from the Latitude and Optus data breaches</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/mntBLOCKSTORAGEhomemasternews_importersrcColin-Wallis-_-Digital-Identity-New-Zealand_1_Pub.mp3">findings outlined in our report.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>This newsletter that you are reading is published 11 times per year bringing you digital identity-related news from members and from around the world. By any measure, our events and written work is a stellar output from a part time team, only made possible by&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/our-members/">members’</a>&nbsp;subscriptions and sponsorship. So thank you!&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/join/">Not a member</a>&nbsp;and not sponsoring? There are many sponsorship opportunities available. Please get in contact:<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">&nbsp;info@digitalidentity.nz.</a></p>



<p>Looking ahead, 2024 is already shaping up well event-wise as more members recognise the value of DINZ hosting their events. We have several online and in person events planned for Q1 and Q2 and DINZ will be supporting its members at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fintechhui.nz/">Fintech Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;in February, the&nbsp;<a href="https://event.brightstar.co.nz/2024NZCyberSecuritySummit">National Cyber Security Summit</a>&nbsp;in March, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://nzgovdata.co/">Government Data Summit</a>&nbsp;in May. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/working-groups/">member working and special interest groups</a>&nbsp;are already gearing up for what will be a busy year ahead with member expertise shaping submissions and the development of education &amp; guidance materials. The refreshed strategy calls for deeper, wider and more international context given the extent of change coming such as the EU Digital Wallet, Australian digital identity related legislation and our own DISTF Act effective 1 July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My New Year’s resolution: Put an end to silos. Teach ourselves to view different activities ‘in the round’ and interrelate them, not silo them to save effort under the guise of ‘focus’. I have seen too many silos in our domain in 2023 and as a nation we are the poorer for it.</p>



<p>This is DINZ’s last newsletter for 2023, so on behalf of the 2023 Executive Council, Ngā mihi o te Kirihimete me te Tau Hou.</p>

Key themes for the year covered various aspects such as digital identity, biometrics, digital onboarding, verification/authentication, secure credentials, and verifiable credentials. The two-day event revolved around the overarching theme that digital identity is transitioning into a comprehensive, large-scale implementation. A significant focus was on Decentralized Identity, ranging from blockchain solutions to discussions about verifiable credentials. The presentations were policy-oriented, featuring esteemed speakers from organizations like DHS, UN, the Canadian Government, and the EU. These speakers emphasized the importance of collaboration and interoperability as essential goals to facilitate seamless citizen travel, international work, and the establishment of trust in online interactions.</p><p>The Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, California, centered around technological advancements in decentralized digital identity solutions. Spanning three days, the event delved into key topics, including OpenID4VC, AnnonCreds 2, W3C, TrustOverIP, DIDComm, JSON-LD, KERI, GLEIF's VLEI, decentralized ecosystem governance, backup and restore, and credential recovery. For credential recovery, the discussions offered a comprehensive solution that encompasses defining the data format, experimenting with compression and encryption, and ensuring the compressed format remains developer-friendly. Additionally, conversations surrounding backup and recovery focused on standardizing methods for backing up application data, especially wallet data, to provide users with a seamless experience. This included challenges like backing up specific information, and the need to reissue credentials in certain scenarios (see below for more from DIF @ IIW).</p><p>The Interoperability Group meets bi-weekly at 8am PT/11am ET/5pm CET Wednesdays</p> 📡 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-usergroup/tree/main?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm User Group </a> <p>The DIDComm Demo is live!

  <p>This is the meant to be the beginning of a discussion on the topic of Open Development as a growth beyond Open Source. It outlines how we think about it at Blockchain Commons, and why we think it’s important. Please <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/121">join us in those discussions</a> and how you might think about the topic differently and on how we can make Open Development a reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The term “open source” gets a lot of attention. It usually refers to the open-source model, where developers collaboratively create software and then release their source code for free distribution, modification, and usage. The idea has entered the modern culture: definitions can be found in the Meriam-Webster Dictionary<a>1</a> and the OED<a>2</a>.</p>

<p>Open-source software is very important to a variety of modern computer platforms. It’s the heart of blog publishing in WordPress, the core of cryptocurrency in Bitcoin, and the foundation of web browsers in projects such as Firefox and Chromium. Unfortunately, open source is all too often seen as all that’s needed. Though there are innovators who are thinking about open source as part of a larger ecosystem<a>3</a>, they’re the exceptions. We need to more broadly realize that the open-source model needs to become a larger open development movement<a>4</a> that can fill in the gaps and resolve the problems of traditional open-source software.</p>

 The Limits of Open Source 

<p></p>

<p>The biggest limitation of the traditional open-source model is that it’s just a licensing regime: no less, no more. A license describes how software can be distributed and used but it doesn’t require a project to be designed, developed, or supported in an open way. And those additional levels of consideration are crucially important: whereas the open-source model describes how you can use a product, a larger open-development movement is needed to reveal whether that product is actually useful or not.</p>

<p>Without open development, open source is full of limitations and disadvantages. These issues are not requirements of the open-source model, but they are obvious and expected consequences of open-source software as it currently exists, which focuses on specific licenses that are used for software created largely by volunteer teams of development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the open-source model doesn’t even necessarily do its licensing well. The Free Software movement and then the open-source model that followed innovated free and open licenses, from copyleft to the GPL and the MIT License. However, open-source software organizations have been reluctant to update these classic licenses to the modern day. We need something not just newer, but better.</p>

<p>Beyond that, many disadvantages of open source stem from the fact than open-source projects tend to be volunteer-led. As a result, improvements found in open-source projects are typically driven by a developer “scratching … a personal itch” <a>5</a>. Though this certainly can create innovation, it’s not necessarily directed toward production releases. Even though open-source advocate Eric S. Raymond encouraged involving users and customers, that often doesn’t happen. As a result, open-source software has a reputation for being hard to use, with poor user interfaces and poor documentation<a>6</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the issue of long-term support: what happens to open-source software after it’s been released? As the initial developers move on and the years stack up? As new threats and the ever-changing internet require new changes? Too often, this continuing support isn’t considered in the open-source model.</p>

<p>Limitations with licenses, development models, and support models all point toward the need for a larger open-development movement, as a level-up of the traditional open-source model.</p>

 Principles of Open Development 

<p>Open development is a larger infrastructure that encompasses open-source licenses but does so while laying out a complete methodology for these projects, from their initial conception through their long-term support. It is built on what we see as the intrinsic goal of the open-source model: for a community to create common resources that can be freely used for the good of all. However, open development looks at this goal as part of an ecosystem that goes well beyond the idea of just developing code and releasing it under an open license.</p>

<p>To be truly open, and to support development from inception through long-term support, we believe an open-development community must increasingly abide by a set of principles as it rises up through the spectrum of openess.</p>

<p>These principles include:</p>

 
   
    <p>Accessibility. An open-development community must be open to all comers. There must be clearly stated rules for how to join the community, how to participate in the community, and how to remain a member of the community. Though there certainly may be (and should be) ways to remove problematic members from the community, the reasons and procedures for doing so should be clearly stated as well.</p>
   
   
    <p>Collaboration. An open-development community must be collaborative. It must have ways that people can make themselves heard and can help to determine the community’s direction through <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/systems-for-collective-choice/">collective choice</a>. This representation and collaboration should encompass developers, users, and distributors alike. The democratic and collaborative choice of an open-development community might be a true democracy, where everyone gets a vote, but more likely it’s some other form of decision making that reflects the needs and limitations of an online community, such as rough consensus, a meritocracy, or representative democracy. Existing communities have already resolved this issue in well-considered ways, and should be considered models. <a>7</a><a>8</a></p>
   
   
    <p>Diversity. A truly open community must not only accept diversity of ideas, but also seek it out in order to improve its development. This should include finding people from many walks of life and with many backgrounds who think in many different ways and have many different skills: people of diverse cultures, classes, genders, races, and points of view. Studies have shown that deep-level diversity is beneficial to the core creativity of a project <a>9</a>, and open-development projects should embrace that. Open development must further embrace “vertical” diversity: a community should include not just designers and developers but also potential consumers (users) and potential distributors (often, businesses). Through early interactions with people who might use and who might sell a product, an open-development community can conquer many of open source’s current problems with usability.</p>
   
   
    <p>Strategy. The collaboration of open development must be about a  community, not just the individuals. That means that it needs to be able to thoughtfully plan, not just to respond to the whims of whoever is programming at the time. In order for the accessibility, diversity, and representation of an open-development community to actually matter, the community must always move forward in consideration with the needs, desires, and thoughts of its many members.</p>
   
   
    <p>Transparency. Similarly, an open-development community must demonstrate that it is abiding by the desires of its members through full transparency, encompassing its membership, its goals, its governance, its processes, and its ongoing support. Obviously, code should be open, but so should membership statistics, meeting minutes, voting results, and more. The idea of “open” should be embraced throughout the community.&nbsp;This open transparency should not be confused with radical transparency, which has its own pitfalls <a>10</a>: transparency needs to be balanced with the privacy of developers, patrons, and clients, and it needs to be managed to enhance the goals of open development, not to deteriorate the work of its members.</p>
   
   
    <p>Sustainability. Open development must be something that consumers and distributors can depend on over the entire lifespan of the software. That means that a concept of long-term commitment must be built in from the beginning, to provide for both upgrades and for fixes for the project. (The lack of this type of support is one of the biggest limitations of the traditional open-source model to date.)</p>
   
   
    <p>Openness. The final principle of open development is simply openness. An open-development community must ultimately commit to interoperability within its ecosystem such that there is no lock-in, allowing users the opportunity for open choice among ecosystem elements and the ability to move their own information and assets to other platforms as they see fit.</p>
   
 

 Best Practices of Open Development 

<p></p>

<p>Open development isn’t a binary choice, but rather a spectrum. No one, no matter how deeply committed they are to open development, is likely to immediately encompass the entire set of principles. However, software development can become increasingly open and increasingly dedicated to these principles as it incorporates additional best practices.</p>

<p>What follows is a description of seven levels for open development, each of which adds new best practices to the ones before.</p>

 Level 0: Open Source 

<p>A minimal level of open source represents the classic understanding of the term: code is placed under a license, made vaguely available to the public, and that might be it.</p>

 
   Code is largely available for viewing. 
   Code is largely available for use under some open source license. 
   Some code may be restricted in viewing or usage based on hardware interfaces, software interfaces, or simply the privacy needs of the creator. There may be reasonable security, trade secrets, or licensing restrictions. These restrictions and their reasoning may not even be well defined. 
   Non-open code must be UX or backends or servers. 
 

 Level 1: Inspectable 

<p>The lowest bar for open development requires that current code (not some old, dusty forgotten version) can be inspected.</p>

 
   Code is versioned. 
   Code is available via <code>git</code> in a public repo. 
   Public code remains relatively current. 
   Code in private repos is regularly published. 
 

 Level 2: Observable 

<p>For an open-open development project to be observable, more than the code is open: the whole development process is.</p>

 
   Git Issues are used to record bugs and feature requests. 
   Git Branches are used to process incorporation of new code. 
   Git Releases are used to record official publications of code. 
   Docs record parts of code that are not openly Inspectable and Observable, as well as documenting why. 
 

<p>(Though this level specifies “Git”, equally open alternative systems would also meet the best practices.)</p>

 Level 3: Reproducible 

<p>Reproducibility considers those unpublished parts of a code base, and promises that code can still be compiled and tested, even without them.</p>

 
   Stubs or fake services are used to fill in for code that is not open. 
   Code is fully compilable and runnable using stubs. 
 

 Level 4: Testable 

<p>A minor advance on reproducability requires the creators of code to go the extra mile to help developers test their compiled code.</p>

 
   Open test suites allow full testing of reproducible code. 
 

 Level 5: Cooperative 

<p>The next level of open development turns members of the public from observers into potential contributors.</p>

 
   Road Maps are shared. 
   Specs are shared. 
   A person is dedicated to coordination of public contributions. 
   Public can file issues and will receive responses in a reasonable amount of time. 
   Public can contribute pulls, which will be considered. 
   Public is clearly defined to include people not closely aligned with creators. 
 

 Level 6: Distributed 

<p>When an open-development project has reached the Distributed level, it has largely embraced the open-development principles.</p>

 
   A product has been shipped. 
   At least two companies or organizations are committed to the project. 
   Open specifications prevent vendor lock-in. 
   Open specifications prevent single points of failure. 
 

 Level 7: Standardized 

<p>Finally, standardized open-development can create tools available to everyone in the ecosystem.</p>

 
   Specifications preventing vendor lock-in are under an IP Regime of an international standards organization. 
   Specification defining project interoperability have been approved as international standards. 
 

 Integrating with Open Silicon 

<p>Even an open-software model that has been extended to Level 7 of Open Development doesn’t fill in the whole picture. That’s because any software is ultimately dependent on the hardware that’s running it. Perhaps this isn’t of much importance for the average software program, but it becomes crucially important when you have software that focuses on privacy, security, cryptography, or related categories. For those, you must have <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-open-silicon/">Open Silicon</a> to ensure that the openly developed open software does what you expect it to.</p>

<p>The Principles of Open Development can be applied to Open Silicon with some challenges.</p>

 
   Accessibility. Obviously, open-software developers need to be invited into Open Silicon communities, so that they can ensure that their software can be properly represented in the silicon. But, there should also be way for external hardware developers to join as well. 
   Collaboration. Both open-software developers and external hardware developers should be able to make their own contributions to the silicon designs (or at the least to the goals of the silicon design). 
   Strategy. To create meaningful strategic plans, software developers and chip designers must work together on the  requirements of silicon. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a> offer an example of what this strategic collaboration looks like for the cryptographic industry. 
   Diversity. Bringing in the open-software community should notably improve the diversity of silicon-design communities. 
   Transparency. Unfortunately, transparency will be one of the biggest challenges for Open Silicon. No matter how much silicon designers might want to be transparent, they’re also going to be bound by IP restrictions that are unfortunately endemic to the interwoven field of chip design. A concerted effort to offer simulation of hardware  that is linked to open-software development should be prioritized to help improve transparency despite these issues. 
   Sustainability. There may be less concerns about sustainability in Open Silicon, because the chips won’t have the same issues that software tends to have with bitrot: where functioning apps stop working due to changes in lower level technologies. Nonetheless, it needs to still be an issue for consideration. 
   Openness. Interoperability among chips may be a sticking point due to the high cost of entry into the field, but it nonetheless is a crucial requirement to integrate with open-software models, since they need to be able to count on a reliable, deterministic experience across all hardware. 
 

<p>Some of the best practices may face even more challenges than these principles due not only to IP restrictions within the extant semiconductor field but also issues with reproducibility. Parallel best practices may need to be outlined for hardware-focused development. See the <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-open-silicon/">Musings on Open Silicon</a> for more thoughts on these and other challenges.</p>

 Open Questions 

<p>Open Development’s principles and best practices form a starting point for discussing open development. There’s still a lot more to consider, including:</p>

 
   Black Boxes. Black boxes that are part of an open system, but have been purposefully closed (which includes IP-restricted silicon), are obviously problematic. We need to better codify how they can be incorporated into open systems, and what we might need to verify about their inputs and outputs. 
   Contracts. NDAs and other contracts are a common element of business life. Best practices for open development should ensure that they don’t negatively impact the openness of the project except as they meet the same criteria for why elements of development might not be open in the first place. 
   Ethics. Obviously, ethics also need to be a consideration in open development, especially because the openness of development could expose its developers to free riding and other threats. However, to date legal attempts to institute ethics, such as with licenses that require updates to be given back to the community, may have done more to make development uninteresting to potential partners. 
 

 Conclusion 

<p>Open development is much bigger than just open source. It requires committing to certain principles and adopting best practices that create a much larger ecosystem that ensures both the openness and the resilience of the technology being developed. In many case, that includes digging all the way down to the hardware.</p>

<p>This article provides a starting point for what’s required to make that larger ecosystem function. It’s intended to start conversations to help us better codify the goals of open development, its needs, and ultimately the best practices that will get us there.</p>

<p>Please just us <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/121">to further discuss</a> the topic of Open Development.</p>

 Appendix: The Heartbleed Use Case 

<p>The 2012-2014 Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL demonstrated why long-term commitment is a crucial element for open development.</p>

<p>When TLS first appeared in the late ’90s, it was part of an enthusiastic, well-supported drive for improved internet security. Companies like Microsoft, Netscape, and Consensus Development were expending extensive commercial time and effort on the development of these standards, which in turn led to the creation of companies worth billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Fast forward fifteen years and the success of TLS was obvious. It secured almost all of the commerce on the internet, with about 60% of that occurring through a single open-source library: OpenSSL. Unfortunately, OpenSSL has never been properly supported. In fact, by spring 2014, OpenSSL was being developed by a single engineer working quarter time. Inevitably, this led to a major problem: Heartbleed, a massive security vulnerability that affected almost every commerce server on the internet.</p>

<p>This is a common problem in the open-source model. The source is created by enthusiastic developers, but eventually, they move on. Meanwhile, the corporations that are making extensive use of the open-source projects aren’t supporting the community. This is one of the prime reasons that a larger open-development movement is required.</p>

<p>The not-for-profit, Digital Identity New Zealand (DINZ), has provided a briefing to incoming Ministers Collins, Lee and vanVelden highlighting the opportunity to move Aotearoa New Zealand forward to become a more productive digital economy through the adoption and use of digital identity (identification).</p>



<p>In its briefing, DINZ emphasises the critical role digital identity plays in fostering trust in online transactions and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A trusted digital economy necessitates assurances that users are who they claim to be, that the services we use are genuine and that products we purchase are what they claim to be. This ecosystem of mutual trust is crucial for any government promoting its country’s digital economy, domestically and to the world,” says DINZ Executive Director Colin Wallis.</p>



<p>The briefing outlines opportunities and challenges, including improving digital identity laws and implementation in New Zealand, alongside recommendations to help move New Zealand forward to a more efficient and productive economy.</p>



<p>Opportunities and Challenges:</p>



<p>Globally, the digital identity verification check market was valued at $11.6 billion USD in 2022, expected to reach $20.8 billion USD by 2027.</p>



<p>DINZ estimates that embracing digital identity could boost New Zealand’s economy by 0.5%-3% of GDP, equating to roughly $1.5 billion to $9 billion NZD.</p>



<p>Despite the positive step of passing the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) Act in April 2023, arguably development of digital identity in New Zealand is slower compared with international common law counterparts. However, DINZ acknowledges the positive efforts by DIA in the compilation of the rules for accreditation and its intentions regarding market uptake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DINZ sees five opportunities to improve digital identity related laws and implementation:</p>



 
 Work with DINZ through the implementation of the DISTF Act 



 Make sure the digital identity related requirements in the Customer &amp; Product Data bill harmonise with the DISTF 



 Ensure the Privacy Act 2020 appropriately directs how biometrics technology collects, processes and stores information, with input from DINZ 



 Fill the current vacuum in child online safety by leveraging work undertaken in the UK and EU 



 Work with DINZ to make authoritative sources of identity available digitally as verifiable credentials. 
 



<p>“DINZ is enthusiastic about engaging with government officials over the next five years. We look forward to contributing to the development of key digital identity initiatives, educating the public and businesses, and supporting the implementation of the DISTF,” says Colin.</p>

<p>Also: Implementation Guidance for ECF v4.1 - Committee Note</p> 


<p>We are pleased to announce that Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 &amp; Version 5.01 and Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile Version 4.1 &amp; Version 5.01 from the LegalXML Electronic Court Filing TC [1] have been approved as OASIS Committee Specifications, and are now available.</p>



<p>In addition, the ECF TC members have published the Committee Note “Implementation Guidance for Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1.” It provides non-normative guidance to implementers of the LegalXML Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 specification.</p>



<p>ECF defines a technical architecture and a set of components, operations and message structures for an electronic court filing system, and sets forth rules governing its implementation.</p>



<p>Version 4.1:<br>LegalXML Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 (ECF v4.1) consists of a set of non-proprietary XML and Web Services specifications, along with clarifying explanations and amendments to those specifications, that have been added for the purpose of promoting interoperability among electronic court filing vendors and systems. ECF Version 4.1 is a maintenance release to address several minor schema and definition issues identified by implementers of the ECF 4.0 and 4.01 specifications.</p>



<p>Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile defines a Service Interaction Profile, as defined in section 5 of the ECF v4.1 specification. The Web Services Service Interaction Profile may be used to transmit ECF 4.1 messages between Internet-connected systems.</p>



<p>Version 5.01:<br>Electronic Court Filing Version 5.01 (ECF v5.01) consists of a set of non-proprietary XML and Web Services specifications developed to promote interoperability among electronic court filing vendors and systems. ECF v5.01 is a minor release that adds new functionality and capabilities beyond the scope of the ECF 5,0, 4.0 and 4.01 specifications that it supersedes.</p>



<p>Electronic Court Filing Web Services Service Interaction Profile defines a Service Interaction Profile (SIP), as defined in section 7 of the ECF v5.01 specification. The Web Services SIP may be used to transmit ECF 5.01 messages between Internet-connected systems.</p>



<p>The documents for these four Committee Specifications and related files, as well as the new Committee Note, are available here:</p>

<p>Elastos, a pioneer in decentralised internet solutions, is working on a significant innovation. Since its inception, Elastos has maintained a close link with Bitcoin, sharing a merge-mined history since early 2018. Now, Elastos introduces ‘Bitcoin Elastos Layer2,’ codenamed ‘BeL2,’ a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, signifying a significant evolution in its journey. Next week, Elastos will release the ‘Be Your Own Bank’ BeL2 whitepaper. To be the first to read it, turn on notifications on <a href="https://twitter.com/ElastosInfo">Elastos Twitter</a> for its announcement and join the community’s <a href="https://t.me/elastosgroup">Telegram group</a>. Here is some supporting information in the lead-up!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin and Elastos History<br>
Elastos’ journey with Bitcoin dates back over five years, beginning when <a href="https://btc.com/">BTC.com</a> merged-mined its first block for Elastos’ mainchain at no extra cost, earning ELA rewards. This contributed to gaining over 50% of Bitcoin’s hash power security in the subsequent years. Merge mining with Bitcoin leverages its robust and battle-tested <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp">Proof of Work</a> infrastructure, offering unparalleled security to Elastos at a fraction of the cost. This approach not only simplifies the SmartWeb ecosystem by supporting resource-sharing but also fosters a symbiotic relationship, enhancing both security and rewards across networks. It’s Elastos’ fundamental belief that without Bitcoin’s security, no ecosystem is truly decentralised. You can learn more about Elastos’ Bitcoin-powered architecture <a href="https://elastos.dev/learn/architecture/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin-secured ELA has been powering transactions across its ecosystem, from gas to staking, and it’s used yearly in its <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic DAO</a> governance layer for election voting and as collateral for council member participants. This historical connection with Bitcoin now forms the foundation for Elastos’ new direction – leveraging its long-standing relationship to build “BeL2”, a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution aimed at making the $700billion worth value on its Layer 1 more adaptable and intelligent using Elastos technology for various applications in the digital economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BeL2 Architecture<br>
BeL2 represents an exciting move for Elastos, aligning with Bitcoin’s ethos while expanding its utility. BeL2 will augment Bitcoin’s capabilities without altering its core principles. BeL2 aims to address Bitcoin’s limitations – transaction speed, smart contract complexity, and privacy issues, by layering Elastos’ SmartWeb technology atop Bitcoin’s robust infrastructure.</p>
 
 Zero-Knowledge Proofs: A zero-knowledge proof is a method for proving a fact is true to someone without disclosing any details about the fact itself. In BeL2, zero-knowledge proofs are generated from Bitcoin transactions, allowing the verification of their truthfulness by the Layer 2 network without disclosing transaction details. 
 Relayer and Staking Mechanisms: Relayers are responsible for transmitting zero-knowledge proofs to BeL2 smart contracts and validating transactions from the Bitcoin network. Relayers are incentivised and regulated through a staking mechanism, ensuring network integrity and reducing the risk of malicious behaviour. 
 Smart Contract Capability: Unlike Bitcoin’s original scripting language, BeL2 introduces more complex smart contract functionalities such as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) logic, allowing Bitcoin users to enter with proofs and opening up Bitcoin Layer 1 to a wider range of decentralised applications. BeL2 is secured by Elastos SmartWeb’s DAO council members, the Cyber Republic, who are voted in annually by its global community using ELA, its Bitcoin-merged mined reserve currency. 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Potential Use Cases<br>
BeL2 revolutionises how value is leveraged within the Bitcoin ecosystem. For example, pledging Bitcoin on BeL2 can unlock USDT loans, usable across various platforms.</p>
 
 Credit Casting Based on Bitcoin Pledges: Transforming Bitcoin on Layer 1 into a collateral asset for credit lines in Layer 2. 
 Decentralised Financial Transactions: Streamlining Bitcoin swaps on Layer 1 and asset exchanges into Layer 2. 
 NFT Trading and Digital Content Market: Providing a Layer 2 platform that enables secure and private trading of digital content rights, from access, and distribution to royalty, powered by Bitcoin. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roadmap<br>
Months of planning have led to an architecture plan that harnesses the strengths of both Elastos and Bitcoin. The BeL2 upcoming whitepaper, scheduled for early December, will detail the operational mechanics and timeline, including:</p>
 
 3 Months: Development of a Proof of Concept 
 3 Months: Decentralisation of Relayers 
 6 Months: Integration into “Hero” Products 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Leadership<br>
</p>
<p>The Elastos Foundation will be sponsoring BeL2. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashmitchell/">Sasha Mitchell</a>, the CEO and Founder of <a href="https://twitter.com/Elacityofficial">Elacity</a> and a long-standing member of the Cyber Republic Council (CRC), has been asked to lead BeL2. Working alongside him is <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-hargreaves-18a6701">Jon Hargreaves</a>, known for launching platforms like Cosmos and LinkedIn, and recently backed by the Cyber Republic DAO. Alongside other ecosystem teams such as Infinity and the Guardians, their mission is ambitious yet clear – to drive market-wide utilisation of Elastos through BeL2 and ignite interest in the SmartWeb.</p>
<p>2024 is shaping up to be a very exciting year. Not only will we witness the release and enhancement of Elacity DRM for video, showcasing Rong Chen’s 2017 vision for the first time, but Elastos’ move to develop BeL2 represents more than a strategic shift; it’s a redefinition of Bitcoin’s capabilities using SmartWeb technologies. Next week, Elastos will release the BeL2 whitepaper and immediately begin its execution.

 Value, maturity, influence, and the ORE CoP birthday&nbsp;survey Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for Educators Co-op<p>We’ve written a lot about how to develop healthy communities, but what we’ve not explicitly written about in this context is the overlap between “education” and “work”. CoPs provide an excellent way to continue life-long learning, network with other professionals who are interested in a topic and create change in areas we strive to improve. All of these benefits are only possible, though, if you have a healthy, sustainable community.</p><p>We’re pleased that the Open Recognition is for Everybody community continues to grow. Not only do new people pop into the CoP, members are developing real relationships with one another. In this post, we’ll share some outputs from our annual birthday survey and show how trust and connection are keystones to a&nbsp;CoP.</p> Data <p>To measure the health of a community we can look at raw numbers, such as the number of new members that have joined in a specified time period. With over 430 people in the ORE community, it’s grown 27% over the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>But that doesn’t tell the whole picture, which is why it’s important to use structured surveys to discover other data, including sentiment. Last year, we <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-to-gather-data-on-a-community-of-practice-881af2846d0d">showed you how</a> to gather data on a CoP using an approach from McMillan and Chavis’s 1986 paper ‘Sense of community: A definition and&nbsp;theory’.</p><p>This time, we again madesure that we not only asked the same questions, but included a box for free-text entry so people could give us unfiltered feedback. We’re sharing some of the positive results from the survey. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, but the forecast is&nbsp;healthy.</p><p>Trust within a community is crucial for collective success and in itself a form of growth. The more people trust each other, the easier it is to move together towards a collective vision. High scores on our 4-point scale, which intentionally lacks a neutral middle option, indicate strong trust&nbsp;levels.</p> That’s all very well in practice, but what about in&nbsp;theory? <p>Last week, we shared <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">short recap videos of Community Conversations</a>, a three-part workshop series about making the most of your Community of Practice&nbsp;(CoP).</p><p>In this post, instead of walking you through the methodologies and metrics, we’re simply going to share a few highlights from the results of the ORE birthday survey, linking it to what we covered in Community Conversations.</p> Value <p>Value cycles in relation to CoPs refer to the different stages of value creation that occur as members of a CoP interact, share knowledge, and learn from each other. These cycles help to assess and understand the value generated by learning in social contexts.</p><blockquote>“I appreciate opportunities to connect with peers, regardless of differences in geographical location and time zones.” (survey participant)</blockquote><p>One of the key things that members of the ORE community value is connection, a feeling of going deeper than the ‘Immediate value’ of Cycle 1 and gaining fulfilment from being able to apply what’s learned in the community to their own work (Cycle&nbsp;3).</p><p>‘Vibes’ are not something easy to measure, but they are important for any kind of CoP, including the ORE community. Thinking about the different kinds of value that communities can generate was the focus of our first <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">Community Conversations workshop</a>.</p> Maturity <p>The work we have done around maturity models is all about navigating your community through its growth stages. We’ve been heavily influenced by the work of Emily Webber, Bailey Richardson, Kevin Huynh &amp; Kai Elmer&nbsp;Sotto.</p><blockquote>“This community is emergent and resilient. I feel we have been coming out of the closet in the last year and building momentum like never before… signals are that we might be reaching the inflection point of the exponential curve.” (survey participant)</blockquote><p>There are ups and downs in the life of any online community, but the idea is that community members feel like they are part of something that is evolving, and that they feel a connection to&nbsp;others.</p><p>Again, ‘connection’ is a difficult thing to measure, but asking how important the community is to members is a good way of trying to figure this out. The second <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">Community Conversations </a>workshop explored <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/towards-a-maturity-model-for-online-networked-communities-v0-1-7c78c2bee8d5">maturity models</a> to help your CoP move in the right direction.</p> Influence <p>Ultimately, the reason people become members of CoPs is to make a difference. They want to improve their own practice, but also make a difference and impact on the world. By being part of an online community, individual members have the ability to influence things which they may not be able to do&nbsp;alone.</p><blockquote>“I feel belonging to this community more than any other I inhabit professionally. In fact, this community has been the constant while my professional affiliation has changed a few times…” (survey participant)</blockquote><p>One way in which influence happens is for one community to influence another. In the case of the ORE community, there is a reasonably high confidence that what we are advocating for (Open Recognition! Open Badges!) is something that is having a wider&nbsp;impact.</p><p>In the third <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/community-conversations-93b689beee61">Community Conversations workshop</a> we discussed communities as change agents, introducing the <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-badges-can-change-the-world-73529560caa3">two loops model</a> and our work around systems convening. The latter is based on the work of Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayner.</p> Conclusion <p>We’ve selected some of the results from our survey to illustrate points relating to our series of Community Conversations workshops. We’ve work to do in the ORE community, for example, in helping people have more agency and giving more and different ways for members to meet up in synchronous ways.</p><p>What we do know, based on the work we’ve done (and shared!) around value cycles, maturity models, and influence, is that the ORE community is on the right&nbsp;track.</p><p>If you’d like to join the community, check out <a href="https://badges.community">badges.community</a>.

    Stellar Lumens (XLM) 



<p>Speculation in the cryptocurrency market is nothing new, and the Stellar network with its native currency, Lumens (XLM), has not been immune to it. A recent topic of interest among investors and enthusiasts is the potential for XLM to be backed by silver. This notion stirs up discussions about stability and intrinsic value, aligning digital assets with traditional precious metals.</p>



<p>However, as of now, Stellar Lumens is not backed by silver or any other physical commodity. It remains a decentralized protocol aimed at facilitating cross-border transactions. The speculation around XLM being backed by silver is purely hypothetical and not grounded in any announced plans or developments by the Stellar Development Foundation.</p>



<p>For investors, it’s important to differentiate between actual plans and rumors or wishful thinking. While the idea of backing a cryptocurrency with a tangible asset like silver is intriguing, it would represent a significant shift from the current operation and philosophy of the Stellar network. Such a move would aim to bring the perceived stability and historical reliability of silver to the digital currency space.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the concept is thought-provoking, it’s essential to approach such speculation with caution. Investors should base their decisions on verified information and understand the speculative nature of discussions about silver backing for XLM or any other cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Stellar Lumens (XLM), the native digital asset of the Stellar network, has a rich history and a substantial presence in the cryptocurrency market. Created in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, along with former lawyer Joyce Kim, Stellar Lumens was envisioned as a decentralized protocol for fast and low-cost cross-border monetary transactions.</p>



<p>Initially, Stellar had 100 billion lumens, but the supply limit has since been reduced to 50 billion lumens, aligning with a focus on managing inflation and maintaining the asset’s value. The Stellar Development Foundation, which supports the Stellar network, has implemented significant upgrades over the years, including a new consensus algorithm in 2015, designed by Stanford professor David Mazières.</p>



<p>The Stellar network has expanded its reach through various partnerships and projects, such as the launch of Lightyear.io, a commercial entity of Stellar in 2017, and later Interstellar, which resulted from Lightyear’s acquisition of Chain, Inc. in 2018. In 2021, Franklin Templeton used Stellar to launch the first “tokenised” US mutual fund, marking a significant milestone in the adoption of blockchain technology in traditional finance.</p>



<p>While the notion of XLM being backed by silver remains speculative, the currency’s actual history, market capitalization, and strategic partnerships highlight its role as a dynamic player in the digital currency space.</p>

<p><a href="https://masca.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Masca</a> is an open-source, decentralized identity wallet that lets you manage your off-chain identifiers and attestations. It is a <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Snap</a> plugin for MetaMask that extends its base functionalities for decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDs</a>) and verifiable credentials (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">VCs</a>)—turning MetaMask into an identity hub.</p><p>Masca is developed by <a href="https://github.com/blockchain-lab-um?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Blockchain Lab:UM</a>, an R&amp;D laboratory specializing in blockchain technology, decentralized identity, and decentralized artificial intelligence.</p><p>Ceramic, as one of the supported storage solutions in Masca, plays a crucial role in enabling users to store their data, have it available on different devices, and will serve as a foundation for data interoperability with other projects in the future.</p> Decentralized Identity and Data Management With Masca <p>As decentralized applications (dApps) and other decentralized solutions become more complex and personalized for users, there is a growing need to manage user identity and associated data. Given that the amount of data is expected to grow exponentially, off-chain solutions are essential to handle this vast amount in a scalable, efficient, and inexpensive way.</p><p>For quite some time, MetaMask has been working on a feature called MetaMask Snaps—a system that enables extended functionalities of the base MetaMask with Snaps. Snaps are JavaScript programs, each running in its own isolated execution environment inside MetaMask, and can run arbitrary logic, thus significantly extending the functionality of MetaMask.</p> How Does Masca Work? <p>Masca is a MetaMask Snap that provides a straightforward way for users to manage their identity, data and attestations. At the same time, Masca also offers dApp developers a simple-to-use interface to integrate decentralized identity functionalities into their applications. There are (almost) endless attestation types, but some examples are conference attendance, government, KYC, education, and various gaming credentials.</p><p>The decentralized identity space is still in a somewhat early stage, various solutions and protocols are being developed and tested. Masca offers flexibility with multiple integrations for developers to choose what suits their use cases and needs. Masca supports multiple DID methods (did:pkh, did:ethr, did:key, did:jwk, did:polygonid, etc.) and cryptographically-signed data formats (JWT, JSON-LD, EIP712). Some of the integrated projects include <a href="https://ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a>, <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-id?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Polygon ID</a>, and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EBSI</a>.</p><p>Masca uses Veramo Client for DID management, as well as for the creation, presentation, and validation of Verifiable Credentials. In alignment with Masca’s mission, the snap also offers flexibility around data storage, allowing users to toggle between the local MetaMask Snap state (which exists fully off-chain and exclusively in the user’s browser), as well as storage on the Ceramic Network.</p><p>Masca was successfully rolled out during the Open Beta release of MetaMask Snaps in September 2023. For more information, you can visit this <a href="https://metamask.io/news/latest/metamask-snaps-our-first-step-on-the-road-to-becoming-fully-permissionless/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">link</a> and the <a href="https://snaps.metamask.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Snaps directory</a>.</p> What issues did Masca face before using Ceramic? <p>In the beginning, users could only store their data locally, which meant directly in their MetaMask wallet in the encrypted storage. But that presents a problem when switching to different devices (using the same seed phrase), because the data is unavailable and not synchronized. It also was not possible if users want to share their data in a structured and composable way, which is why Masca chose to build on and integrate Ceramic.</p><blockquote>“Ceramic Network is a data ledger that builds on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and creates an abstraction layer that makes it much more suitable for endless use cases, one of them being data vaults for identity data.”- Masca team</blockquote> Why Masca Chose Ceramic <p>Ceramic offers a scalable network for data, builds on top of the same primitives as Masca (DIDs), and provides developer-friendly tools for development. Structuring the otherwise unstructured data into data streams, controlled by user accounts, creates a powerful solution for managing identity data.</p><p>Ceramic also has a <a href="https://www.notion.so/a3a7a58f81544d33ad3feb84368775d4?pvs=21&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">broad ecosystem of projects</a> working on diverse challenges and problems. By being part of this ecosystem, the Masca team says it aims to connect with other projects in the identity space and work together to tackle those challenges, such as conforming to the same data models and making data truly composable across different applications. Building more rich and complex decentralized identities can also help solve the challenges with reputation and Sybil attacks in the future.</p> How Masca Uses Ceramic <p>Masca is now live on Ceramic Mainnet! Ceramic is currently used in the Masca ecosystem for two primary purposes:</p>  Verifiable Credential Storage: Since VCs are off-chain attestations, users must store them somewhere. Ceramic offers a scalable way to store attestations.  Schemas: Each VC has a strictly defined structure and data model, which are defined with schemas. Using schemas, VCs of the same type are consistent across different applications.  <p>Users can freely migrate their credentials between Snap-encrypted storage and Ceramic Network as they wish. Selection of storage most often depends on the type of attestations and level of security/privacy needed.</p><p>Masca has several exciting features in the pipeline, such as:</p>  Enabling users to store encrypted data  Supporting selective disclosure for VCs  Adding support for <a href="https://ceramic.network/composedb?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB</a> on Ceramic  <p>The Masca team is excited to work with other projects in the Ceramic ecosystem and help contribute to the world's composable data stack.</p> Create Your Credential <p>Visit <a href="https://masca.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Masca</a> to create your decentralized identity and first off-chain verifiable credential. You can store the credential on Ceramic and make it available to share across dApps that integrate Masca (such as <a href="https://reputex.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ReputeX</a>) or those that use Ceramic. If you’re a dev interested in integrating Masca into your application, check out the <a href="https://docs.masca.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">documentation page</a>.</p><p>Decentralized identity is becoming a core element of the decentralized web, addressing the challenge of verifying data in the ever-increasing volume of content generated. Masca's upcoming migration to <a>ComposeDB</a> will further improve data management and interoperability.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation board of directors unanimously approved updating the Foundation’s Bylaws by a 75% supermajority vote as required by the Bylaws (Section 9.2 Bylaw Amendments) at the November 16, 2023 board meeting. The new <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OIDF-Org-Doc-Bylaws-Final-11-16-2023.pdf">Bylaws</a> are effective as of November 16, 2023.</p>
<p>From the founding of the OpenID Foundation, the Foundation has intended to maintain balance between Sustaining and Individual (“Community”) representatives and later Corporate representatives on the board. For many years, The Foundation has had 6-7 Sustaining members at a ratio to 3 Community and 1 Corporate representatives. The Foundation currently has 12 Sustaining members and over 150 Corporate members.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee (EC) and Board recently revisited the topic of balance of board members and agreed to proceed with updating the ratios of Community and Corporate representatives on the board relative to the number of Sustaining members. The EC and Board noted that adding more representatives brings more voices and expertise to the Board, balancing the Sustaining member voices.</p>
<p>A summary of key changes to the Bylaws:</p>
 
 Update Individual representative to Community representative to better reflect the position 
 Add additional Community representatives to the Board in line with the ratio in Byalws, as of December 1st of each year 
 Add an additional Corporate representative to the Board when more than 140 corporate entities are members, as of December 1st of each year 
 Create a minimum number of Board members as 5 people, and a maximum of 38, as per the proposal 
 
<p>All changes to the Bylaws are documented in the <a href="https://openid.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Summary-of-Changes-to-Bylaws-Final-11-16-2023.pdf">“Summary of Changes to Bylaws”</a>.</p>
<p>2024 OpenID Foundation election will be updated based on the Bylaws to include:</p>
 
 2 Community representative seats for 2-year terms (1 seat prior) 
 2 Corporate representative seats for 1-year terms (1 seat prior) 
 
<p>The 2024 OpenID Foundation election will kick off on Monday, December 11, 2023 with full details including election schedule published then.</p><p>The post <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-updates-bylaws/">OpenID Foundation Updates Bylaws</a> first appeared on <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID Foundation</a>.</p>

		<p>Reimagining How Technology Can Transform Your Institution<br>
Hosted in partnership with Kean University, EdgeCon Autumn brought together attendees from around the region to explore how technology can transform their institution and accelerate important initiatives involving cybersecurity, campus networks, cloud strategy, and student support applications. Held on November 2 at Kean University, EdgeCon Autumn provided a panel discussion and a full agenda of breakout sessions allowing participants to dive deeper into a variety of topics. With 93% of attendees rating the event 4-5 stars (with 5 being the top end of the scale), this premier event also provided an opportunity for members of the higher education technology community to connect, share valuable insight, and build relationships with industry leading vendors who support technology transformation across the institution.</p>
	 
 




 
	 
		<p>Balancing Innovation and Risk<br>
To kick off the conference’s exciting day of events, attendees were invited to a panel discussion, Balancing Innovation and Risk Through the Process of Digital Transformation, led by David Sherry, Chief Information Security Officer, Princeton University and Ed Wozencroft, Vice President for Digital Strategy and Chief Information Officer, New Jersey Institute of Technology. This presentation provided college and university leaders with a unique perspective on balancing innovation and risk through an accelerated period of digital transformation.</p>
<p>Especially as technology increasingly integrates with every facet of higher education, many organizations are concerned about compliance, data privacy, and the performance and financial health of their institution. The discussion emphasized ways that leaders across an organization can participate in a cultural shift to take advantage of new tools such as AI, data analytics, and innovative SaaS applications, while responsibly managing institutional risk through strategic planning and collaboration. Participants were able to explore how effective planning and collaboration can mitigate risk and ways to identify areas on their campus where digital transformation can produce positive change.</p>
<p>How to Fail Innovation<br>
In today’s academic landscape, universities expect their Information Technology (IT) Departments to be hubs of innovation.

<p>How to Fail Innovation 101<br>
In today’s academic landscape, universities expect their Information Technology (IT) Departments to be hubs of innovation. However, the prevalent understanding of ‘innovation’ often leans towards adopting market trends rather than being truly forward-looking. Unfortunately, these ‘innovations’ are often external, sourced from third-party software, rather than emerging from the IT team’s internal processes and practices.</p>
<p>This presentation aims to redefine innovation and highlight its potential within IT departments. We will explore the motivations for innovation, common missteps, and how to develop operational strategies that foster, not stifle, innovation.</p>
<p>A positive environment for innovation can benefit the entire IT team. It encourages employees to develop more effective processes and practices, and empowers IT leadership to create an environment that nurtures innovation or remove existing barriers to it.</p>
<p>We will delve into various theories of innovation, drawing analogies from a range of domains including rainforests, gardens, machines, and even Plato’s Divine Frenzy. The presentation underscores the unique pressures on IT departments to innovate, making a clear distinction between innovation and invention.</p>
<p>Innovation, according to our perspective, isn’t just about creating something new—an act of invention—but about altering product, process, or practice life cycles to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, and advantage. We will provide insights on implementing innovation effectively, while also addressing potential pitfalls and challenges.</p>

<p>Creating a Path for Faculty Success in Online and Hybrid Course Development<br>
When our first Online Teaching Certificate debuted in 2017, it was a five-session series offered in person. Over time, we added a second five-session level two and transitioned to a hybrid, then fully asynchronous experience. Both levels are suitable for both new and experienced professors who want to transition to online teaching or enhance their existing skills. Using the University’s chosen quality assurance rubric as the foundation, we cover a wide range of topics, including course design, objectives and alignment, student engagement strategies, accessibility, and ideas for assessment and feedback. Our course is designed to be practical, interactive, and engaging, providing best practices in creating and delivering an online course. Level two expands on the quality assurance rubric and introduces the Transparency in Learning and Teaching process, creating engaging lectures, and utilizing the learning management system and templates. Faculty leave both levels with completed materials to use in their own online or hybrid course.</p>

<p>Using Chatbots to Improve the Online Learning Experience<br>
Chatbots improve the online learning experience by assisting users navigating library websites in search of information. Understanding users’ questions to the chatbot and placing them in subject categories reveals the types of information they are searching for. This presentation will discuss a current project conducting a content analysis of questions posed to the Lehman Library’s chatbot, which uses the ChatGPT AI. The presenters will highlight some of the chatbot’s weakness, specifically the questions users pose that it cannot reliably answer. How the information gleaned from the analysis may improve the library website through content additions and layout changes will be discussed. The presenters will argue that projects using artificial intelligence, like chatbots, can lead to better online learning experience for library users, who rely on both the chatbot and the library website to provide them with information on library and campus-related services and resources.</p>

<p>Modernizing and Enhancing Analytics Infrastructure While Moving to the Cloud<br>
“Rob Stirton, VP of Institutional Effectiveness and CIO at County College of Morris, will demonstrate how CCM uses insights from their analytics platform for real-time decision making across the institution. CCM initially implemented GCOM’s on-premise Student Success Analytics (SSA) platform to integrate data across the entire student lifecycle and develop a clear line of sight between the college’s strategic goals and daily operations. This solution leveraged their existing business intelligence software investment and dramatically improved the availability and accuracy of information through visual analytics for all audiences, while significantly reducing workload on IT and researchers. Eliminating manual data processes allows CCM department chairs to establish goals for enrollment and retention and measure progress, grant writers to include valuable details about student populations to strengthen their applications, and students services staff to improve retention for transfer students.</p>
<p>Building on this success, CCM took the natural next step in their analytics journey: modernizing in the cloud with GCOM’s SSA Cloud platform. SSA Cloud increases access and usability and reduces management costs while seamlessly integrating data sources with hybrid cloud architecture. The cloud environment is managed by GCOM, reducing CCM’s need to staff expensive, in-demand skillsets to support the infrastructure. With the move to the cloud, CCM is better equipped to adapt to changing technical business needs, while leveraging built-in capabilities such as machine learning models that identify admissions and financial aid fraud, and dynamic data exploration and ad-hoc reporting that limits the need for users to write queries.</p>

<p>Building Data Analytics Centers for Colleges &amp; Departments<br>
“Every college, department and functional office at Rowan University needs access to data at their fingertips for decision making. Building common dashboards and models for everyone does not meet the needs of everyone. If we start tweaking common dashboards to meet the needs of everyone, the dashboards become unusable and complex. To solve this problem, we use Extract, Transform, &amp; Load process to build complex and common datasets. We build various predictive models using these common datasets. We use these datasets and models and package them into data portals that we call as data centers. We build visualizations, KPIs, dashboards and reports based on these data sets and models and package them into different data centers. These data centers will have all the data one would need in a college or a department in a way they can easily consume and make decisions on. These data centers consist of dashboards, KPIs, reports, and predictive models in one place.”</p>

<p>A “DIDComm 101” presentation at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in Mountain View last month inspired the creation of a new tool that enables anyone to easily send and receive DIDComm messages. Colton Wolkins, Senior Software Engineer at Indicio, explains.</p><p>Please provide a quick introduction to DIDComm and the DIDComm Demo&nbsp;</p><p>DIDComm is short for DID Communication, a protocol which lets people and software use Decentralized Identifiers (also known as DIDs) to communicate securely and privately over many channels including the Internet, Bluetooth, mobile push notifications, and QR codes.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea for the DIDComm Demo came about just before the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in California last month. Sam Curren (Indicio’s Senior Systems Architect, and Deputy CTO) realized that everything he was presenting at IIW using slides, we could show using a simple self-serve tool that helps people see for themselves how DIDComm works.&nbsp;</p><p>The DIDComm Demo allows you to connect to another person, a computer, a phone or simply another window in a different browser tab so you can see DIDComm messages traverse back and forth after the messages have been decrypted.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason we wrote this as a separate app was to allow people to see how DIDComm works without needing to sift through or learn a substantial stack like Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py).</p><p>Who is the Demo designed for?&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who wants to understand how the technology works. For example, developers who want to build their own solutions on top of DIDComm can connect to the Demo from whatever they are building, to test that messages are being sent correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>We used a chat window approach to make it easy to understand. The tool is stripped down to the essentials, so it’s easy to see what’s going on. If you open up your browser’s network inspector, you’ll find all your messages are encrypted and your data is secure.&nbsp;</p><p>The DIDComm Demo is entirely open source. If anyone wants to <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-demo?ref=blog.identity.foundation">look at code</a>, to see how it works and learn from it, they can.&nbsp;</p><p>Please explain the concept of mediators in DIDComm, and their role in the DIDComm Demo&nbsp;</p><p>DIDComm doesn’t provide an inherent way to store messages. Also your phone’s IP address is always changing, so there’s no way to talk directly to it. Mediators are cloud-based agents that enable DIDComm messages to be stored and routed.</p><p>For example, if your travel agent sends you a DIDComm message about your flight, the mediator stores the message if your phone is offline. When the phone comes back online it talks to the mediator and says “Here I am, please send me any messages.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mediators tend to be hosted on the public Internet, so they have a domain name which points to the mediator’s IP address. They can either deliver messages directly to mobile devices, or collect messages from many agents at a single endpoint for future delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>A mediator must be accounted for when the sender encrypts a message. For example: If I am connected to you and I send you a message through your mediator, I first encrypt it so only you can decrypt it, then I encrypt it again so only your mediator can read whom to send the message to.&nbsp;</p><p>The DIDComm Demo is connected to a mediator. That’s what enables two people across the world to send messages to each other. At the moment, it happens to use the Indicio mediator (we don’t gain any insight into whether a message is coming from the Demo or any other application). We’re hoping to support more mediators, as other organizations bring WebSocket-capable mediators online.</p><p>DIDComm uses did:peer2 DIDs to establish a connection. The public keys are included in the DID document — one for signing, one for encryption — together with a service endpoint (a location to talk to), in this case, the Indicio Mediator’s DID. When you send a message, the Demo app resolves the mediator’s DID and finds the URL to which to relay the message.</p><p>For more information on mediators, see <a href="https://book.didcomm.org/routing/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">https://book.didcomm.org/routing/</a></p><p>How can someone access the DIDComm Demo?&nbsp;</p><p>Go to <a href="https://demo.didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">demo.didcomm.org</a>. You’ll see a Help button there with a tutorial, plus a link to the github repo.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<p>This article, like <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>, is drawn from a book I have in process called FOREMEMBRANCE, which chronicles how identity was abused in WWII and how those dangers linger to the present day._</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABSTRACT: eIDAS v2.0, released as a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">provisional agreement on November 16, 2023</a>, offers the first large-scale codification of digital identity. Unfortunately, it contains not just technical problems but also major philosophical missteps that could make it highly dangerous to its users, especially given the increasing threat of regime change in Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The history of identity is a sobering one. It’s just more than century old in its modern, codified and organized, form but in that time identity has been reponsible for atrocities. In <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>, I wrote about one of the worst misuses of identity, when Jacobus L. Lentz supported the Nazis in their use of Dutch identity records during World War II, resulting in the death of 75% of the country’s Jews. It didn’t have to be that way: in France, another identity pioneer by the name of René Carmille had control of a similar trove of identity records, but only selectively disclosed some of his data to the Nazis. Only 23% of the Jewish people in France fell to genocide as a result.</p>

<p>However, the stories of Lentz and Carmille are not mere historical prologue. They are powerful warnings about the care that must be taken in the use of personally identifiable data in the twenty-first century and beyond, as the collection of that personal information multiplies and enters the digital space. These warnings are particularly important today, as the European Union just reached <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">provisional agreement</a> on their next-generation digital-identity regulation, eIDAS, on November 16th. This was despite the fact that it is filled with both technical oversights and poor identity designs that could allow a repeat of the Dutch disaster under Lentz.</p>

<p>It is disturbingly ironic that six days later, on November 22nd, Geert Wilders rose to prominence in the Netherlands in a shock election win<a>1</a> after running on a platform of hate and intolerance toward Muslims. What happens when isolationists and nationialists such as Geert Wilders, Victor Orbán, and Marine Le Pen take ahold of a badly flawed identity system? Unfortunately, history offers us dark lessons.</p>

 Two Roads Diverged 

<p></p>

<p>The digital world is a new frontier, and like all frontiers it has enjoyed waves of migrations. First came the pioneers: rugged individuals who set their own norms and created their own communities. Then came the corporations: companies intent on monetizing that frontier. Last came the governments: existing authorities intent on setting their own rules and regulations for this new world.</p>

<p>Today, the digital world stands at a crossroads. The conflicting ideas of the pioneers and the corporations are already writ large in differing models for identity on the internet. But now, governments are looking to exert their control over digital space, and it will ultimately be they who decide which of those models persists.</p>

<p>Despite the internet being ultimately founded by governments, who enabled the centralized authority of institutions such as IANA, ICANN, and various Certificate Authorities, the users of the internet have always yearned to be free. They’ve long wanted to control their own digital identities, to define their own relationships with other networked individuals.</p>

<p>One of the first clear statements of this was Phil Zimmerman’s development of the PGP software in 1991. Superficially, it was a technology that allowed for the encryption of data so that it could only be read by its intended recipipent. But PGP went far beyond that. It gave each user a personal identifier that they controlled. They could decide what information to release in correlation with their PGP key and to whom.</p>

<p>Following Zimmerman’s initial deployment of PGP, generations of digital pioneers offered their own takes on digital identity. Most of this occurred  courtesy of organizations such as the Identity Commons<a>2</a>, the Internet Identity Workshop<a>3</a>, and Rebooting the Web of Trust<a>4</a>. Their goal has been to allow for the creation of “decentralized identity” that is not controlled by any one entity. It was a very different take from either Lentz or Carmille, with a user in control of his identity information rather than giving it over to the state.</p>

<p>A number of those ideas about self-sovereign identity have become reality with the standardization of decentralized identifiers (DIDs)<a>5</a> and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)<a>6</a> by the IETF. Now users can have personal control of an identifier that says who they are, and they can associate signed credentials with it, from recommendations to licenses to certifications. It’s a model for digital identity that, if deployed correctly, can avoid the worst dangers of identification, because a user can decide what information to release and to whom.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not the only way.</p>

<p>Just as users have been building up models for digital identity that give power back to individuals by allowing them to hold their personal data close, corporations have been going in the opposite direction, trying to link together as much information as they can.</p>

<p>You look at a product on Amazon, and suddenly every other site on the internet is trying to sell you on like products. This is a purposeful invasion of your digital privacy that advertising companies celebrate<a>7</a>. But, it’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Companies all across the internet collect huge amounts of data and share it with each other<a>8</a>, creating the potential for huge honeypots of personal information. Imagine a maleovolent party accessing every single bit of data collected by Google, potentially including what websites you visit, what items you purchase, and even where your Android phone is located at any time. It becomes even worse when internet companies require your real-name, as Facebook<a>9</a> does, potentially creating a real-world connection to that digital data trove. The possibilities are catastrophic if a sufficiently bad actor gets a hold of that information.</p>

<p>These are the two possibilities for digital identity as we enter the third phase of the development of the digital world, where countries and other polities are beginning to lay down their own rules and regulations. We could go the way of the self-sovereign pioneers, who want to minimize information and correlation in a way that would have made Carmille proud, or we could go the way of the corporations that want to collate and correlate everything for their own selfish self-interest, something that Lentz likely would have blindly supported.</p>

<p>Unfortunately eIDAS v2.0, one of the first major definitions of digital identity, could go either way.</p>

 The EU’s Unintential Consequences 

<p>eIDAS v2.0, the new extended version of the Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services that is a product of the European Union,  was released as a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/european-digital-identity-provisional-ag/product-details/20231116CAN72103">provisional agreement</a> on November 16, 2023. The EU has been a major force in proclaiming individual rights on the internet, and they seem to have the best intentions of empowering and protecting their citizens. Unfortunately, their biggest initiatives to date have been mixed successes due to their inability to recognize the unintentional consequences of their regulatory design.</p>

<p>The GDPR <a>10</a> and the EPrivacy Directives<a>11</a> had laudable goals <a>12</a> but have resulted in endless clicking of buttons to access websites in Europe and have largely benefited large corporations who are able to fulfill the regulations<a>13</a>. The EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market<a>14</a> has resulted in countries trying to grab cash from search engines<a>15</a> and getting cut off from news as a result<a>16</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, these digital regulations demonstrate a concerning repetition of unintended consequences and insufficient understanding of the digital space in EU legislation. If those problems were to recur in identity-focused legislation, it could be catastropic.</p>

 eIDAS on the March 

<p></p>

<p>eIDAS v2.0 details the legal and technical requirements for countries to offer digital identities that can be stored on devices and reused<a>17</a>. It requires the creation of digital wallets that can be filled with both an identifier and credentials. If you’ve long dreamed of having a driver’s license, university records, or health records that are digitally stored in a portable way, that’s what eIDAS v2.0 does<a>18</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of theoretically good material built into eIDAS v2.0. It supports interoperable digital wallets with high security standards. It also enables digital signing and can be set up remotely without having to present physical documents in person<a>19</a>.</p>

<p>There’s also hope that self-sovereign identity (SSI) could still be a possibility with the release of eIDAS. After all, the provisional agreement states that one of its goals is “to provide people with control over their online identity and data”<a>20</a>. One study on the topic thus suggested there was no innate contradiction between eIDAS and the individual-empowering principles of SSI<a>21</a>. Another laid out bridge scenarios<a>22</a>. Yet another author noted that “selective disclosure” of information, where users individually decide what identity elements to release, had been a principle since eIDAS 1.0. However, nothing is guaranteed: that final article also notes that the user’s personal, self-sovereign control of data is purposefully limited by the design<a>23</a> of eIDAS.</p>

<p>Ultimately whether eIDAS will create new digital honeypots of information will depend on eIDAS’ final deployment and how it’s arbitrated by countries’ laws and courts. Unfortunately, the EU’s record on digital legislation is problematic, and as it’s proposed eIDAS is full of holes that could lead to big problems in our future.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with eIDAS as it currently stands is a worldwide web-security issue. eIDAS mandates that web browers accept security certificates from individual member states and the EU can refuse to revoke them even if they’re dangerous<a>24</a>. The provisional agreement does note that “The obligation of recognition, interoperability and support of QWACs is not to affect the freedom of web-browser providers to ensure web security, domain authentication and the encryption of web traffic in the manner and with the technology they consider most appropriate.”<a>20</a>. However, that’s clearly a contradiction: web browsers can not ensure web security if there’s an obligation to recognize CAs from member states.</p>

<p>That obligation not only reverts the web to an outdated model for security management, but it also puts every single transaction on the web at the mercy of the least trustworthy administrator in the least trustworthy EU state, including states such as The Netherlands and Poland, now threatened by nationalists. Potentially, millions of people would have the ability to break web security. Perhaps worse, it allows the surveillance of users at European websites by European governments<a>25</a>.</p>

<p>There are numerous problems with the actual identity model of eIDAS as well.</p>

<p>This begins with the identifier at the heart of the proposal, which is problematic because it’s meant to be persistent<a>26</a>. That allows for extreme correlation of everything a person ever does with their identity, over an infinite amount of time, and thus creates huge honeypots of personal information that will be massive targets for attacks. Earlier proposals even called for the identifier to be unique for each person, which would have multiplied the problem a hundredfold (and violated the Constitutions of some member states)<a>27</a>. The provisional agreement leaves the question of uniqueness up to the member states themselves but at least offsets that somewhat with support for pseudonyms<a>28</a>.</p>

<p>The cryptographic technology used by eIDAS is also at issue because of the very conservative and limited choices of the EU. Modern signature schemes and other cryptography likely to offer better protection for the enormous personal data likely to be compiled under eIDAS are all prohibited<a>29</a>. This leaves it very vulnerable.</p>

<p>eIDAS data is ultimately collected in wallets, which will be government-backed and will use identities provided by corporations. This allows the possibility for either entity to illicitly collect personal data<a>30</a>. Though the current governments and selected corporations might be trustworthy, the same guarantee can’t be made for future controllers of those entities. Thus, the data and app model at the core of eIDAS is just a mortgage for future problems.</p>

<p>In other words, there are problems up and down the entire eIDAS stack, including identity creation, identity assignment, cryptographic protection, web-based security, and app design. Too much data is being collected in one place, it’s potentially available to too many people, and it’s too vulnerable.</p>

<p>The stories of Lentz and Carmille should have taught us the core importance of minimizing data and intrinsically protecting it from misuse.</p>

<p>eIDAS does not.</p>

<p>The problem is that the EU creating a digital identity without understanding modern theories for how to create safe identities that can benefit their users without making them vulnerable.</p>

<p>Identities need to minimize data correlation. Identities need to minimize data correlation. The EU’s original take on a unique identity shows how badly misguided they are on this criterion, and even now the decision is going to get punted to the member states. But there should never be a single identity that correlates your taxes, your transit through different countries, your rental of a bicycle, your usage of digital euros<a>31</a>,and whatever else gets jammed into the eIDAS framework. And that data shouldn’t last forever (and in fact doing so goes against the GDPR’s right to be forgotten<a>32</a>).</p>

<p>Identities need to minimize identification. That same person renting a bike should need to reveal nothing more than their ability to pay to rent and possibly replace the bicycle. A person buying an alcoholic beverage should only need to reveal their age. A person reporting a public-works issue, such as a pothole, should potentially reveal nothing. Ultmately identity is about managing the risk between two parties. The risk to individuals must be minimized by minimizing the identification data they’re required to share.</p>

<p>For eIDAS identities to successfully meet the human-focused goals of the EU, they need to reflect the power imbalance between the state and the individual, and in those situations where their needs are equal, or where the needs of the individual are greater, they need to maximize the power of the individual.</p>

<p>To go back to the example of an individual reporting a pothole, the risk that the state faces for a false report is low: they might waste resources if they schedule a non-existent public-works repair, but they are very large and can easily amortize that loss. In contrast, the risk that an individual faces is much greater. If their identity were revealed, they might be “outed” as a troublemaker or they might face retribution from a worker who had previously failed to fix that pothole. (Obviously, these repercussions would be even greater for a matter of more import, but the fact that they exist for even a small issue is notable.) As a result, despite the power imbalance where the state holds the most power, it must give the most protection to the individual in this situation, by not requiring identification data.</p>

<p>Certainly, there are technical solutions that can resolve some of the most extreme problems remaining in eIDAS. The state-mandated CAs need to be removed, identifiers must be required to be non-persistent and non-unique, cryptography must be expanded, and the creation of identifiers and wallets must be decentralized.</p>

<p>However, the philosophical issues are just as important. The minimization of data collection, data correlation, and personal identification must be incorporated into eIDAS as actual regulations or the very strongest of recommendations. eIDAS ultimately must say not just what things must be done for compliance, but what things must not be done to preserve the privacy of user data.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>In order to protect our human rights, we need to ensure that modern-day information systems protect our data in meaningful ways. As we learned <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/echoes-history/">through the lessons of Lentz and Carmille</a>, there are two paths before us.</p>

<p>On the one hand, we have the path of Jacobus Lentz. He maximized the information that he collected, he happily stored it all together, and he thought merely about the efficiency of its use. His information thus wasn’t protected against a regime change, and the Nazis used it to commit genocide against 75% of the Netherlands’ Jewish population.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have the path of René Carmille. He collected very similar information to Lentz, but he was aware of the sensitivity of some information, so he ensured that it couldn’t be correlated with other personally identifiable information. A third as many Jews died in France as The Netherlands (by percentage), and it seems likely that Carmille’s protection of personal records was a major factor.</p>

<p>Moving across the 20th and 21st centuries, we’ve unfortunately more frequently cleaved to the path of Lentz than Carmille. The Census Bureau turned over records of Japanese-Americans to President Roosevelt and thousands died and tens of thousands more were deeply scarred. Records of young DACA immigrants passed from President Obama to President Trump and their lives were thrown into grave uncertainty. The smaller stories of individual people whose lives were destroyed due to the theft or sharing of data (legal or not) are uncountable. Lentz remains ascendant; his lessons unlearned.</p>

<p>But the digital frontier offers a new opportunity to do things right. We can ensure that identities are controlled by people and used to benefit those people and society as a whole. We can protect people and their identities against regime change, which has become all too much of a possibility in Europe, as demonstrated by Poland and the Netherlands. We just have to do so before it’s too late.</p>

<p>The biggest danger and the biggest opportunity in the current day remains eIDAS. With the release of a provisional agreement, it might already be too far along to prevent its ratification in that form. But either now or afterward we must take the opportunity to legislatively minimize the data collected and correlated for identities.</p>

<p>We must give individuals the ability to control their personal identity as much as is possible in a shared society.</p>

<p>The widely-adopted XML schema for marking up books of all kinds is now presented for public review prior to its submission to the members of OASIS as a candidate for OASIS Standard.</p> 


<p>OASIS and the DocBook TC [1] are pleased to announce that The DocBook Schema Version 5.2 is now available for public review and comment.</p>



<p>DocBook is a schema (available in languages including RELAX NG, SGML and XML DTDs, and W3C XML Schema) that is particularly well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software.</p>



<p>Because it is a large and robust schema, and because its main structures correspond to the general notion of what constitutes a “book,” DocBook has been adopted by a large and growing community of authors writing books of all kinds. DocBook is supported “out of the box” by a number of commercial tools, and there is rapidly expanding support for it in a number of free software environments. These features have combined to make DocBook a generally easy to understand, widely useful, and very popular schema. Dozens of organizations are using DocBook for millions of pages of documentation, in various print and online formats, worldwide.</p>



<p>The TC received four Statements of Use from from Norm Tovey-Walsh, XML Press, the SUSE documentation team, and Jira Kosek. [3].</p>

    Navigating Identity in the Digital Age 



 Back Story 



<p>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Joins UNDP in Pioneering Digital Infrastructure Drive</p>



<p>The United Nations Development Program has launched an ambitious initiative, the “50-in-5” campaign, to boost the digital public infrastructure (DPI) across the globe. This strategic move, strongly supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to see 50 countries develop and scale at least one DPI component by 2028. These components include digital payments, ID, and data exchange systems that are integral to achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<p>A cohort of 11 nations, including technological front-runners like Estonia and emerging economies like Bangladesh, have stepped forward as the first movers in this groundbreaking journey. The Gates Foundation’s involvement underscores its ongoing commitment to DPI, highlighted by a $200 million fund established in September 2022. Melinda French Gates has emphasized the transformative potential of mobile devices in furthering digital identities, which are central to DPI’s expansion.</p>



<p>India’s Aadhaar, the world’s largest biometric ID system, is poised to play a significant role in this global narrative. Recognized at the G20 Summit in New Delhi, Aadhaar could serve as a blueprint for countries in Africa and Asia to roll out their digital identity technologies. With such a robust backing and a clear target, the “50-in-5” campaign is set to embark on a path that could reshape how nations and their citizens interact with technology and governance.</p>



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity vs. UNDP’s Digital Public Infrastructure</p>



<p>In the digital era, the quest for a secure and efficient identity management system has led to the emergence of two distinct philosophies: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the United Nations Development Program’s (UNDP) digital public infrastructure (DPI) approach as recently endorsed by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): A User-Centric Model</p>



<p>SSI is a user-centric model that grants individuals complete control over their digital identities. Unlike traditional identity systems that rely on centralized authorities, SSI is built on blockchain technology, allowing for a decentralized and autonomous structure. Users can manage their identities without intermediary oversight, deciding when and to whom they reveal their information​<a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Time%20to%20read%3A%209%20minutes,a%20passport%20or%20driver%E2%80%99s%20license"></a>​​<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/22/2811#:~:text=2.2.%20Self,and%20manage%20their%20digital%20identities"></a>​​<a href="https://www.identity.com/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20and%20decentralized%20identifiers,known%20as%20a%20blockchain%20network"></a>​. Christopher Allen’s principles of SSI emphasize that control over personal data is fundamental, positioning users not merely as subjects within digital realms but as their sovereigns​<a href="https://blockchainhub.net/blog/blog/self-sovereign-identity-vs-data/#:~:text=Principles%20of%20Self,important%20principles%20include%20the"></a>​. This system is geared towards a future where identity verification is both secure and private, with verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers ensuring accessibility across the globe at any time​<a href="https://www.identity.com/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20and%20decentralized%20identifiers,known%20as%20a%20blockchain%20network"></a>​​<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory/ssi-and-eidas-vision-how-they-are-connected-share-your-views.html#:~:text=Self,groups%20have%20raised%20their"></a>​.</p>



<p>UNDP’s Digital Public Infrastructure: A Collaborative Framework</p>



<p>The UNDP’s DPI initiative, on the other hand, encompasses a network of digital components like payments, ID, and data exchange systems. This infrastructure is designed to aid countries in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. With the Gates Foundation’s backing, the “50-in-5” campaign aims to implement DPI components in 50 countries by 2028​<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/gates-foundation-backs-un-campaign-to-accelerate-digital-infrastructure/"></a>​. Unlike SSI, the DPI approach involves a more collaborative framework, possibly relying on centralized or semi-centralized systems that can be adopted at a national scale. The focus here is on interoperability and inclusiveness, aiming for a safe and universally accessible digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Core Differences</p>



<p>The key difference between SSI and DPI lies in the locus of control and the approach to decentralization. SSI is about empowering the individual as the sole owner of their identity, with blockchain technology ensuring that control remains with the user​<a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/self-sovereign-identity/#:~:text=Time%20to%20read%3A%209%20minutes,a%20passport%20or%20driver%E2%80%99s%20license"></a>​​<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/22/2811#:~:text=2.2.%20Self,and%20manage%20their%20digital%20identities"></a>​​<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory/ssi-and-eidas-vision-how-they-are-connected-share-your-views.html#:~:text=Self,groups%20have%20raised%20their"></a>​. DPI, while it may utilize some decentralized features, is more about creating a common digital infrastructure that can be shared among nations and governed by a collective of stakeholders, including governments and international organizations​<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/gates-foundation-backs-un-campaign-to-accelerate-digital-infrastructure/"></a>​.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while both SSI and DPI aim to address the challenges of identity in the digital age, they offer different paths forward. SSI is a bottom-up approach that starts with individual autonomy, whereas DPI represents a top-down strategy that focuses on creating a shared digital environment. As the digital landscape evolves, the interaction between these two models will likely shape the future of digital identity governance.</p>

<p>The U.S. government has embraced FIDO authentication, and is now looking for further guidance around how to implement this technology into the government’s existing PIV-centric ecosystem used to manage enterprise access for government employees and contractors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To provide this guidance, the FIDO Alliance published a paper, “FIDO Alliance Guidance for U.S. Government Agency Deployment of FIDO Authentication.”</p>



 
 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/white-paper-fido-alliance-guidance-for-u-s-government-agency-deployment-of-fido-authentication/">Read the paper</a> 
 



 



<p>This resource is the first output of a new committee formed by the FIDO Alliance’s Board of Directors at the request of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The Committee, whose goal is to improve and accelerate adoption of FIDO technology within federal agencies, includes representatives from CISA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Defense, in addition to other FIDO Alliance members.</p>



<p>The Committee is aligned with the government’s efforts to modernize identity to counter threats, and encourages agencies to advance their Zero Trust Architecture journeys by implementing identity capabilities that support both FIDO and PKI-based phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also provides guidance on implementation of FIDO credentials within the federal digital identity ecosystem in order to meet immediate priorities defined in OMB 22-09, Federal Zero Trust Strategy and advance cybersecurity outcomes by enabling future phases of Federal Zero Trust Architecture efforts.</p>



<p>Alternative options for phishing-resistant authentication are necessary in the federal workforce, for example, for individuals who are not PIV eligible, or to quickly enable access for new employees who are waiting for their PIV to be issued, or those individuals who work remotely and don’t need access to federal facilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This document highlights areas where FIDO offers the best value to address U.S. Government use cases as an enhancement of existing infrastructure, while minimizing rework as agencies advance their zero trust strategies with phishing-resistant authentication tied to enterprise identity as the foundation.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance will host a webinar, “Deploying FIDO Authentication in U.S. Government Agencies,” covering the essential information in this white paper on November 28, 2023 at 1:00 PM ET / 11:00 AM PT. To register for the webinar, <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4419611/509DCD451A69E91608E646994220EE55">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Boston, MA – 16 November 2023 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, launched the <a href="https://github.com/DAD-CDM">DAD-CDM</a> project, an open source initiative to develop data exchange&nbsp;standards for normalizing and sharing disinformation and influence campaigns. DAD-CDM will serve as a valuable resource, particularly in the identification and alerting of AI-empowered attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“DAD-CDM won’t try to define disinformation. Instead, the standard will offer a framework for assessing both technical and non-technical aspects of disinformation campaigns. This will alert influence operation (IO)-fighting teams worldwide and give them the means to communicate their analyses using a standardized language. The ultimate decision on classifying an attack as disinformation rests with analysts,” said Jean-Philippe Salles of Filigran, co-chair of the DAD-CDM Project Governing Board (PGB).</p>



<p>In the context of IO campaigns, AI-driven attacks often exhibit remarkable sophistication and adaptability. The use of AI as a tool can exacerbate the impact of these operations and is a growing concern. A common data model, such as DAD-CDM’s data exchange standards, will provide a structured and standardized approach for sharing critical information regarding these AI-empowered attacks, thus enabling early detection, rapid alerting, and improved response strategies. This will enable stakeholders, including governments and cybersecurity experts, to effectively identify, counter, and mitigate the influence of AI in propagating disinformation and interference campaigns, ultimately reinforcing our defenses against this evolving and pervasive challenge.</p>



<p>“In a world characterized by increasing global division exacerbated by the proliferation of IO campaigns including disinformation, misinformation, and FIMI, it becomes increasingly evident that a shared data model is imperative. Such a model would streamline the sharing and analysis of information concerning influence operations, allowing for a unified approach in response coordination and resource allocation,” said Dr. Georgianna Shea of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, co-chair of the DAD-CDM PGB. “The DAD-CDM, in the realm of influence operations, serves a purpose akin to what MITRE ATT&amp;CK accomplishes in the context of cyber-attacks. Both are indispensable instruments, essential for navigating the intricate and multifaceted terrain of contemporary threats, ensuring a more cohesive and effective response strategy.”</p>



<p>Building upon the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/standard/stix-version-2-1/">OASIS Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)</a> threat intelligence sharing standard, DAD-CDM will leverage models, protocols, and policies widely used today in the cybersecurity field. DAD-CDM will focus on manipulative behaviors and so will also expand on the DISARM Framework, which standardizes the codification of adversary behavior Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>



<p>“The concept of ‘defending’ involves real-time action and strategic planning to confront the threat of disinformation, which poses a significant threat to peace, democracy, and critical policy areas like pandemics and climate change,” said Pablo Breuer, Ph.D., Chair, DISARM Foundation. “DAD-CDM offers several advantages, including faster alert sharing, easier response coordination, increased report sharing, and the ability to compare and contrast actor behavior over time. Together, we will create a stronger defense against the spread of disinformation and online harms and help safeguard the integrity of information worldwide.”</p>



<p>Leadership and funding for the project are provided by AdTechCares, Crisp, Cyabra, Debunk.org, DISARM Foundation, Filigran, Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Global Disinformation Index, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Limbik, Logically, MarvelousAI, and sFractal Consulting. Participation in the DAD-CDM Open Project is open to all interested parties. Contact <a href="mailto:join@oasis-open.org">join@oasis-open.org</a> for more information. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support for the DAD-CDM OP<br><br>Crisp<br>“Crisp has witnessed a transformation in the scale and maturity of disinformation threats that we support our partners in tackling, particularly with the recent surge in generative AI. Being part of this common approach within the DAD-CDM project is an important development that Crisp is proud to support. We eagerly anticipate the collective industry advancement in countering disinformation that this partnership promises, in the face of ever more sophisticated bad actor networks.” <br>– David Hunter, VP Trust &amp; Safety, Crisp</p>



<p>Cyabra<br>“Social media is the new attack surface and the fastest-growing arena for bad actors. Ten years after the creation of the ATT&amp;CK framework, which has helped guide the growth of the cybersecurity sector, Cyabra is excited to join OASIS Open and lead the emergence of the formal counter-disinformation industry.”<br>– Rafi Mendelsohn, VP Marketing, Cyabra</p>



<p>Debunk.org<br>“The creation of a common language and model through the DAD-CDM initiative is pivotal for professional FIMI defenders. It significantly enhances our efficiency in responding to FIMI attacks. As the Head of Debunk.org, I am proud to join this initiative that promises to unify and strengthen our efforts against the sophisticated FIMI attacks threatening our information landscape.”<br>– Viktoras Daukšas, Head of Debunk.org</p>



<p>DISARM Foundation<br>“To effectively identify and expose foreign manipulation before it negatively impacts our democracies, we need to quickly establish a comprehensive threat overview. STIX enables this by connecting the dots. For example, with STIX we will be able to assert, ‘Another community member already analyzed this inauthentic Facebook account and shared their report,’ or ‘These specific deceptive behaviors strongly resemble prior election interference campaigns by this nation-state.’ To address hybrid threats such as cyber-enabled influence (e.g., hack-and-leak) or influence-enabled cyber (e.g., clickbait) we need to model Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Indicators of Manipulation (IOMs) in the same way. With STIX we will be able to do that.”<br>– Stephen H. Campbell, CTO, DISARM Foundation</p>



<p>Filigran<br>“OASIS Open’s DAD-CDM initiative is a pivotal step forward in addressing the growing challenges of online disinformation, particularly FIMI. At Filigran, we recognize that tackling this multifaceted problem requires collaboration and unified efforts. We’re proud to support a project that not only builds on the trusted foundation of the STIX cybersecurity standard but also fosters real-time, scalable defenses against AI-powered threats, ensuring a more secure and trustworthy digital environment for all.”<br>– Samuel Hassine, Co-founder &amp; CEO, Filigran</p>



<p>Limbik<br>“In the years Limbik has been leveraging cognitive AI against disinformation, we have seen incredible progress and ingenuity within the community. This new project is an extremely promising advancement, bringing the best technology, insights, and lessons learned together towards the vaunted whole-of-society response that is desperately needed. A common approach to disinformation that aligns academia, industry, government, and non-profits toward proactive resilience building and risk mitigation represents a huge advancement in an increasingly risky world.”<br>– Robert Schaul, VP Strategy, Limbik</p>



<p>Logically<br>“The sheer scale of the disinformation threat facing global society is vast and requires coordinated collaboration from a host of stakeholders if we are to limit the impact of bad actors who utilize disinformation campaigns to cause confusion, disruption and harm. We are delighted to be a part of the DAD-CDM project and look forward to working with our partners to detect disinformation campaigns earlier and improve our response strategies.”<br>– Lyric Jain, CEO, Logically</p>



<p>MarvelousAI<br>“In the pursuit of truth and transparency, we are excited to harness the collective power of open-source, guided by the STIX and TAXII standards, to illuminate the shadows cast by information influence operations.”<br>– Danielle Deibler, Co-founder and CEO, MarvelousAI</p>



<p>sFractal Consulting<br>“Standards are essential in countering disinformation influence campaigns because standards provide a common framework and guidelines for identifying, mitigating, and preventing disinformation. Standards promote sharing which helps level the playing field and ensures consistency in response strategies. Utilizing standards allows authorities, organizations, and individuals to better coordinate efforts, mitigate the spread of disinformation and safeguard the integrity of the information ecosystem.”<br>– Duncan Sparrell, Chief Cyber Curmudgeon, sFractal Consulting</p>

<p></p><p>Polygon is a decentralized blockchain network that allows for the permissionless exchange of value.</p><p><a href="https://polygonid.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Polygon ID</a>, part of the Polygon ecosystem, provides a Self-Sovereign Identity solution leveraging the power of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. It consists of a set of libraries, tools and ready-made applications that can be used to facilitate trusted, secure and privacy-preserving relationships between identity holders, issuers and verifiers.</p><p>Polygon ID is open-source and can be deployed to any EVM-compatible chain.&nbsp;</p><p>In our latest guest blog, Polygon ID protocol engineer, Oleksandr Brezhniev,  Technical Sales lead for the American region, Otto Mora and Digital Project Manager, Alex Rosales answer our questions about the company's new product release.</p><p>Your website states that Polygon ID is "The first identity solution that allows users to use zero-knowledge proofs&nbsp; generated from off-chain verifiable credentials to interact with smart contracts." What use cases do you envisage and what are the benefits of this approach?</p><p>Know Your Customer (KYC) is a key use case. We've seen multiple Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects moving in this direction, including Uniswap, which recently has implemented the possibility to allow only verified liquidity providers in the new version of their protocol. Also Centralized Finance (CeFi) apps (such as centralized exchanges, on-ramp services, etc.) can benefit from better user experiences coming from reusable verifications. No more passing KYC on each platform separately!</p><p>But also there's a range of use cases not related to KYC. For example:</p>  Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) may allow voting only to their GitHub contributors.  Limit who can join a DAO based on belonging to a social group, like "Women in Tech."  Build communities to solve issues and fund local development projects.  Distribute tokens (airdrop) among “Active Steam players” to attract new users to a Web3 game.  <p>In regard to voting and airdrops there is an interesting use case, Sybil resistance. Based on a Proof-of-Uniqueness credential (for example, issued by an identity verification provider), a user can prove that they are unique without disclosing any personal information and can vote only once, no matter how many Ethereum addresses and Decentralized Identifiers the user has. Protection from Sybil attacks and bots is crucial for decision making and fair funds distribution.</p><p>Another problem this capability can solve is recovery of access to user accounts. For example, an <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Abstracted Account </a>(a new way to make Ethereum accounts more secure, with a better user experience) allows you to change the account “owner” if the new “owner” proves to be the same person, using credentials from a trusted KYC provider or from preselected, trusted friends.</p><p>To sum up, bringing off-chain data in the form of Verifiable Credentials on-chain improves security and compliance without sacrificing user privacy, reduces fraud, increases automation, improves user experience and opens new possibilities for Decentralized App (DApp) developers.</p><p>And with the recent implementation of on-chain issuer in the protocol, it's also possible to decouple on-chain data from the user's Ethereum address, and prove (on-chain and off-chain) for example that his balance is over some threshold without revealing the address and exact amount.</p><p>Your website also states that "Polygon ID meets W3C Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier (DID) standards." Why is this important and what business benefits does it deliver?</p><p>This statement signifies our alignment with key industry standards and protocols that relate to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, which is important to us because of:</p>  Interoperability and Compatibility: Conformity to the W3C standards for Verifiable Credentials (VC) and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) means that Polygon ID aims to work seamlessly with other platforms and systems that also adhere to these standards. It simplifies integration with existing tools and solutions on the market, increasing its utility and versatility.  Trust and Security: W3C VC and DID standards are designed to provide a secure and trustable way of handling identity and credentials in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner. By aligning with these standards, Polygon ID can assure its users that their identity and credentials are handled in a secure and privacy-conscious way. This can be especially important in applications involving sensitive personal or financial data, such as in the finance and healthcare sectors.  Future-proofing : Many identity solutions, especially in the Web3 space, develop their own incompatible ways of representing identifiers and credentials. Being an early adopter and promoter of standards, combined with our novel privacy-preserving method to prove statements and do selective disclosure based on ZKPs, can give Polygon ID a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving decentralized identity space. It demonstrates our commitment to innovation and a future-proof approach to technology development. This can be appealing to both developers and businesses looking for long-term, stable solutions.  <p>Consequently, this positions us for greater adoption and brings us closer to fulfilling our vision of empowering individuals and giving them back control over their identities and personal data.</p><p>How does being a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation help Polygon ID align to the W3C standards and related DIF specifications?&nbsp;</p><p>Through our membership in the DIF, the Polygon ID team can interact with various industry working groups that are very relevant to us:</p>  DIDComm: Our protocol utilizes a subset of DIDComm called iden3comm that was developed specifically for Iden3 / Polygon ID. In this working group we can contribute this technology and align with other members interested in DIDComm.  Claims and Credentials Working Group: allows the alignment of credentials and schema standards including “basic identity credentials” that we are currently creating with our Polygon ID Common Schemas initiative. Several of the KYC issuers in the Polygon ID ecosystem are also members of the DIF which will facilitate standardization.  Integration with the Universal Resolver: We believe in interoperability as promoted by Markus Sabadello and other DIF members. Through our support of the Universal Resolver for Polygon ID DID resolution we get closer to that objective.  <p>Also through our DIF membership we are able to support other events including hackathons, which helps us connect with startups and developers in the Decentralized Identity space.</p><p>Are you able to give us a sneak preview of your product roadmap?&nbsp;</p><p>After many years of research and consequent development of the<a href="https://docs.iden3.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> iden3 protocol</a> and a complete suite of tools to serve all actors in the “triangle of trust” (issuers, holders and verifiers), such as an <a href="https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/issuer/issuer-node-ui/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">issuer node</a>, the <a href="https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/wallet/wallet-overview/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">wallet sdk</a>, and the <a href="https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/verifier/verifier-overview/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">verifier sdk</a>, we finally launched the first production version of Polygon ID in February this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the launch, we have been gathering positive and constructive feedback from developers and companies implementing Polygon ID, which has enabled&nbsp; us to improve our tools and add new ones to make it easier for developers and end users.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the new tools we have already added to the Polygon ID suite:</p>  The <a href="https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/js-sdk/js-sdk-overview/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">js-sdk </a>design to build browser-based applications.&nbsp;  The <a href="https://schema-builder.polygonid.me/query-builder?ref=blog.identity.foundation">query builder</a> to make it easier for developers of applications to construct queries based on the zkQuery language.  The <a href="https://schema-builder.polygonid.me/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">schema builder</a> that helps issuers find existing schemas (hence achieving standardization and interoperability) or create new ones.  <p>Now that the suite of tools is mature, our next goal is to focus on growing the liquidity of credentials in the Polygon ID ecosystem. To achieve this, the new version (launched earlier this week) will make it easier, and will add new possibilities, to generate credentials:</p>  New <a href="https://marketplace.polygonid.me/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">credentials marketplace</a>: Makes it easy for you as a developer to select which type of credential to use, and which is the issuer that issues the credential.  New on-chain issuer: Is a smart contract that allows the generation of on-chain credentials. The sources of information can be:  On-chain: you will be able to generate credentials based on public data already available on-chain. This will allow you for example to generate a credential that proves how many tokens you own without having to reveal your address.  Off-chain: you will be able to generate on-chain credentials based on off-chain documents:&nbsp; The client application will take the off-chain document and transform it into a verifiable credential that will remain in the user’s identity wallet. Additionally, a zero knowledge proof will be sent to the on-chain issuer to certify this. For example, you will be able to create a credential based on your identity card or on a PDF issued by the government.    Improvements in the Issuer Node: Improving the Issuer Node, making it easier to install and use  Available in Cloud Marketplaces such as Google Cloud Marketplace (GCM) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace  Possibility to store revocation trees on-chain.  Possibility to use a DID with Ethereum addresses: this will allow the issuer to use naming services and have cheaper state transitions.    <p>It is important to highlight that Polygon ID is open source, which enables developers to propose improvements and audit the code.</p><p>During the next months, we plan to launch exciting new projects (some of them currently in the research phase) that we believe can be a breakthrough for the space.

<p>This article was originally published as an advance reading for <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/#rwot-12-cologne-2023">RWOT12 in Köln, Germany</a> on August 9, 2023. It has been slightly edited for this reprint.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABSTRACT: Self-sovereign identity represents an innovative new architecture for identity management. But, we must ensure that it avoids the pitfalls of previous identity systems. During World War II, two identity pioneers, the Dutch Jacobus L. Lentz and the French René Carmille, took different approaches toward the collection and recording of personally identifiable data. As a result, 75% of Dutch Jews fell victim to the Holocaust versus 23% of the Jews in France. Our foundational work on self-sovereign identity today could have similar repercussions down the road, so it’s imperative that we design this foundation responsibly with diligence and foresight, especially as the threat of significant regime change toward authoritarian governments looms ever larger across the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a></a></p>

<p>On January 26, 2020, on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz during World War II, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands offered a historic apology for how the country had failed its Jewish citizens during that War, which resulted in over 100,000 of them being deported and murdered by the Nazis. He acknowledged that one of the problems was the Netherlands’ civil service, stating: “When state authority became a threat, our public institutions failed in their duty as guardians of justice and security. To be sure, within the government too there was resistance on an individual level. But too many Dutch officials simply did as they were told by the occupying forces.”<a>1</a></p>

<p>A similar acknowledgement had been offered almost 25 years earlier by President Jacques Chirac of France, who stated that “the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state”.<a>2</a> In France, some 76,000 French and foreign Jews were deported by the Nazis, but it was from a larger population that also had a larger demographic of Jewish peoples.</p>

<p>When distilled down to the bare and heartless statistics, the difference between the countries is stark: in the Netherlands, 75% of Jews tragically lost their lives, compared to 23% in France. The difference lies in how each country dealt with identity: what they were willing to record and what they were not. Since regimes inevitably change, since data inevitably changes hands from one person to another, this type of consideration is crucial.</p>

<p>It is especially crucial today because regimes have been changing quickly and drastically across the world and many of the new governments have been raised up through their declarations of intolerance and hatred. The freshest example is ironically in the Netherlands, where Islamophobe and isolationist Geert Wilders’ PVV party won a plurality of votes, giving him the opportunity to become Prime Minister<a>3</a>. He’s promised to ban the Quran, and one shudders to think of what he might do with identity records of Muslims. But, he’s far from alone. Victor Orbán, the authoritarian Prime Minister Hungary, has conducted attacks against the LGBT community<a>4</a>. Marine Le Pen has made increasingly credible runs for French President as the head of the National Front. In the United States, Donald Trump, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and even the Supreme Court have attacked disadvantaged peoples and taken away rights. Many of these ingredients are the same as those seen in World War II, but our data collection has reached new heights, and thus offers even greater dangers.</p>

<p>These harsh lessons remain especially important for the new technologies of digital identity, which have boosted information compilation even beyond that of the physical world. That includes both self-sovereign identity, an ideology to reclaim human dignity and authority in the digital world and an emerging suite of applications designed to enable that movement, and other new digital-identity systems. We must heed the grave lessons of history as we look forward, to ensure that digital identity technology of all types is never used in a similar genocide.</p>

 Impeccable Identity: Lentz’s Tragic Legacy 

<p></p>

<p>The story of identity in the Netherlands during World War II is still writ on the landscape of Amsterdam today, at the National Holocaust Names Monument, where Prime Minister Rutte gave his famous speech in 2020, and a few blocks away at the intersection of Plantage Kerklaan and Plantage Middenlaan, where the municipal building that held the records of the region’s population once lay.</p>

<p>Today, there’s nothing special about the structure that once housed the records building, other than a somber plaque affixed to a wall. It reads, “27 Maart 1943: Vernieling Bevolkingsregister”. March 27, 1943: Destruction of the population register. Therein lies the crux of the story of how the Netherlands recorded too much identity information, and how they made one last attempt to destroy it after the Nazis gained control of the country.</p>

<p>That story begins, as Prime Minister Rutte acknowledged, in the Dutch Civil Service, which the Nazis recognized as “Germanic” in its orderly thoroughness. So much so that they left the cadres of Dutch civil servants alone to run things, with Germanic leadership installed above them. In particular, the story begins with one operational functionary by the name of Jacobus L. Lentz.</p>

<p>In 1932, Lentz was appointed the head of the National Inspectorate of Population Registers in The Netherlands. This was a critical post in the 1930s because of the Great Depression: the Inspectorate ensured that all citizens had equitable access to basic services. Thanks to its efficiency, the small nation fared better than even the greatest European powers during the 1930s, helping to keep its citizens out of the poverty that was blanketing the globe. Looking to ensure that this happy efficiency was maintained and even bettered, the Dutch government tasked Lentz with promoting yet greater order by bringing consistency and uniformity to population registers throughout the country.</p>

<p>Lentz was thus instrumental in what followed. By 1936, a decree required that every resident in the Netherlands must have a personal identity card, one copy to be carried on their person and a duplicate to be filed in the civil archives. These archives also contained a cornucopia of personally identifying information, including gender, race, ethnicity, occupation, residence, familial relations, and religion. They were centralized in a single office in each officially recognized region of the Netherlands, all of which used the same systems so that the data was interoperable, ensuring that Lentz’s data was useful in civil governance and planning.</p>

<p>Lentz meticulously rationalized, standardized, and organized the Netherlands records held in that building at the intersection of Plantage Kerklaan and Plantage Middenlaan. Thanks to him, the comprehensive efficiency of the archives, which even incorporated special filing cabinets of his own patented design aimed at expediting searches and cross-checks, made it possible for the Netherlands to provide amply and justly for its citizens during the depths of the greatest economic crisis in modern world history. This aligned with Lentz’s vision of creating “the paper man.”<a>5</a> His work was recognized at the highest level by a royal award bestowed on him by no less a figure than nation’s queen.</p>

<p>The thoroughness and accessibility of the centralized registries throughout the Netherlands made them high-priority targets for capture by the Nazi invaders following their occupation of the Netherlands in May 1940. The Nazis understood their immense value in accelerating the hunt for Jews and other “undesirables”. Lentz himself was recognized as an especially valuable local asset. No sooner did the Dutch government capitulate than occupation authorities asked him to create a comprehensive national personal identity card that was extremely difficult to alter or forge. For Lentz, this, in fact, had been a pet project for years, one his superiors had consistently resisted as being “un-Dutch.” Now he was being asked to do it! He tackled the project with remarkable enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Soon, Lentz had cards that could be compared against the corresponding files in a central civil registry, which he had redesigned for accessory and access. Even if a card was forged, the registry was thus a backup. By September 1941, these cards and files included a thorough census of Dutch Jews, each of whom now carried a card emblazoned with a large letter J.</p>

<p>On the night of March 27-28, 1943, resistance operatives, some of whose names are incribed on that plaque, disguised themselves as local police officers, and, in a daring operation attempted to burn down the registry and the files it housed. Brilliantly planned and executed though it was, the attack fell short of achieving its objective. To be sure, some 800,000 identity cards fell victim to the flames and flood, but, that destruction only amounted to 15 percent of the registry’s records. It was soon back in business, and the Jewish genocide ramped up.</p>

<p>Lentz was arrested by Netherlands police in May 1945 for his collaboration with the Nazis and eventually sentenced to three years in prison. But it was far too late. This perfection of record keeping, this creation of a “paper man” who could be cross-referenced through a closely held certificate and a central registry, was core to the high rate of murder of the Netherlands’ Jews, which Prime Minister Rutte apologized for on that cold winter day in 2020.</p>

<p>This dark chapter should serve as a stark warning for our work on self-sovereign identity — as should the fact that things can be very different, as evidenced by a similar situation in France with a very different conclusion.</p>

 Subversive Systems: Carmille’s Quiet Resistance 

<p>In France, the story instead begins with René Carmille, an engineer, a World War I officer, and a spy for France’s Deuxième Bureau during the first World War. His own move toward the registration of identity came not because of the Great Depression, but instead the needs of the military.</p>

<p>Carmille’s work was founded on early punch-card technology, something that had also been used in The Netherlands, but was more central to Carmille’s work in France. By 1935, he was developing a registry for the French army that was to be used for conscription and mobilization. Carmille proposed a twelve-digit personal registration number as the core of this registry (which later became 13 digits after the occupation and division of France). This ID could be used to determine a person’s date of birth and place of birth, as well as a “complete personal profile”<a>6</a>, which included details on professional skills and well as other attributes.</p>

<p>By 1940, the Nazis were attempting to produce censuses of the Jews in France, but they were facing notable obstacles. Prime among them was the fact that the government had not polled on the question of religion since 1872 and had no interest in doing so now. There also weren’t sufficient electronic tabulators to catalogue the results from France’s immense population: France instead depended on Remington typewriters or even pen and paper for much of their tabulation.</p>

<p>Enter René Carmille. In November 1940, he created France’s “Demographic Service in Vichy”, opened offices on both sides of the occupation border running down the middle of France, contracted for 36 million Francs worth of tabulating machines, and announced plans for a new census of French citizens. He would replace the “anarchic” methodology that France had previously used to record census data with something more modern; afterward, French citizens would have to carry “uniform identity cards”, which linked to precise details on vocational expertise. Carmille’s new census would also reverse France’s long-standing omission of religious data by including data in “column 11” that would require participating Jews to not only report their own religion, but also that of their grandparents. Like Lentz, Carmille ultimately had his own version of a paper man, saying: “We are no longer dealing with general censuses, but we are really following individuals.”<a>7</a></p>

<p>It appeared to be exactly what the Nazis were seeking.</p>

<p>If Carmille had ever properly tabulated this data, the results likely would have been similar to those in the Netherlands: identity turned to discrimination and ultimately genocide. But, that didn’t happen. Instead, Carmille purposefully programmed his machines to never punch data for column 11 and hid more than 100,000 punched cards of Jews in his office. Call it an early form of data minimization and selective disclosure<a>8</a>. Carmille ensured that the personal data most likely to harm people was not made available to the people most likely to use it for harm.</p>

<p>There is some disagreement about Carmille’s role in the Vichy government and what damage he might have done there. However, the historical data seems to support him continuing to be a counter-intelligence officer, and that he purposefully sabotaged the census of the Jews while simultaneously using his data collection appartus to compile a listing of 800,000 French soldiers ready to rise up against the German occupation, 300,000 of them who were ready for near instaneous mobilization. Which was exactly what happened: on December 5, 1942, French troops captured the French National Statistics Service office in Algiers and used Carmille’s data to mobilize thousands of French troops.</p>

<p>René Carmille was arrested by the Nazis in February 1944, interrogated by a Nazi torturer, and sent to Dachau, where he died in January 1945. Though his work may have saved the lives of tens or even hundreds of thousands of Jews in France, it required sacrifice.</p>

<p>Once we collect identity data, its use is almost inevitable: pushing against that tide is the work of giants.</p>

 Two Models, One Truth 

<p>Self-sovereign identity has a dual nature.</p>

<p>On one hand, there exists a clear need for more defined identity. This was the main focus for self-sovereign identity when it was first discussed at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/events/#rwot-2-id2020-2016">RWOT2</a> and <a href="https://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> in 2016. Then, one of our primary use cases was the stateless refugee who could be denied access to government services. It echoed (albeit with better foresight) the challenge that Jacobus Lentz faced with migration in the 1930s, when he put together a system to make sure all Dutch could have access to civic support during the Great Depression.</p>

<p>Conversely, there’s a call for minimizing identity data. This asks a crucial question that’s of both historical and ethical importance: What is the minimum identifying data access necessary to give you the right to be able to do things without unduly impinging on your privacy, dignity, and entitlement to respect? It builds on the truth the René Carmille discovered as he purposefully excluded religious information from his census: personal information can be dangerous, damaging, and even deadly.</p>

<p>Often, we share our personal details and other identity, erring on the side of oversharing, grounded in our current trust toward the data collector. The contrasting approaches of Lentz and Carmille demonstrate why that isn’t sufficient: the regime can always change. The intended use of data can be easily misinterpreted or manipulated. Lentz’s Great Depression data could be used by the Nazis to genocide Dutch Jews; and what the Nazis thought was their French Census Data could be used by Carmille to raise an army. And this isn’ just a historic concern: under Trump’s administration, there were similar attempts to repurpose the voluntary registrations of “Dreamers” from the previous administration, threatening residents who illegally entered the country as children with deportation.</p>

<p>Ultimately, data will be used to the fullest extent that it can be and it may be used for the worst purposes possible, entirely at odds with the original purpose of the collection. As architects of the next generation of self-sovereign identity systems, we must prioritize user empowerment, enabling each individual to fully control their identity. We have to think about strategies of data minimization and selective disclosure. We have to consider what data needs to be collected, and what does not. We do not want to make a new paper (electronic) man.</p>

<p>We must instead remember the past when identity was weaponized and six million and more died as a result. But we need to operationalize that remembrance by transforming it from reflection into a vision for the present and the future. Call it remembering forward. Call it foremembrance.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The time for action is now. The dreams of self-sovereign identity that were first imagined at RWOT2 and ID2020 have been made realities by standards such as DIDs<a>9</a> and Verifiable Credentials<a>10</a>. Numerous companies have emerged to support these standards, while governments are beginning to adopt them. Simultaneously, the European Union is in the process of rolling out eIDAS<a>11</a> as an ecosystem of electronic identity. We are at a tipping point where the standards for future identity will be set in the days, months, and scant years ahead.</p>

<p>At this crossroads, we could go the way of recording too much information. We could create great honeypots of data for use or abuse by future regimes, or even by criminals. By recording our gender, our sexual orientation, our religion, our political affiliation, or even just our favorite books, movies, and songs, we could open ourselves up to future discrimination or worse. This would be the way of Lentz.</p>

<p>But there’s another path, one that normalizes the minimization of information. As self-sovereign identity designers, we must ask if we are protecting our users; we can do so by following <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">the original goals of self-sovereign identity</a>, by allowing the person represented by an identity to decide what information goes out. Simultaneously, we can do our best to influence the design of eIDAS and other more centralized systems to similarly adopt rules of data minimization and selective disclosure. This would be the way of Carmille.</p>

<p>We are a crucial crossroads in the design of digital identity. When the next history books are written, we must be Carmille, not Lentz.</p>

<p>A roundup of the most commonly asked questions on our Discord and Forum. If you have questions for the team please ask them on our <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>. </p>  General FAQ <p></p> What is Ceramic? <p>Ceramic is a shared data network for managing verifiable data at scale, providing the trust of a blockchain with the flexibility of an event streaming system. Thousands of developers use it to manage reputation data, store attestations, log user activity, and build novel data infrastructure. Ceramic frees developers from the constraints of traditional data infrastructure, enabling them to tap into a shared data ecosystem and network effects, so they can focus on bringing their unique vision to life. </p> What is ComposeDB <p>ComposeDB, built on Ceramic, is a decentralized graph database that uses GraphQL to offer developers a familiar interface for interacting with data stored on Ceramic. This enables seamless data model publication, discovery, and reuse, fostering a composable data ecosystem.</p> What is the difference between Ceramic and ComposeDB? <p>ComposeDB provides a graph structure for interacting with data on the Ceramic network (i.e. native indexing). The nodes in the graph are ‘accounts’ or ‘documents’, each possessing a globally unique ID, while ‘edges’ are queryable relationships.You can read more about these concepts in our <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/core-concepts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">docs</a>.</p> Why did we choose GraphQL for ComposeDB? <p>We achieve interoperability with a wide ecosystem of existing programing environments by allowing GraphQL queries over JSON documents.</p> What is the difference between Ceramic and The Graph? <p>The Graph is a service indexing and querying data on L1 and L2 blockchains. You do not write data to The Graph, you write data to the blockchain and then query it with The Graph.</p><p>Ceramic is more like a decentralized version of a traditional database (like Postgres or MongoDB). It’s optimized for writes and speed. It provides its own built-in indexing and querying functionality (via ComposeDB).</p><p>The Graph is good for querying large amounts of data from blockchains. Ceramic is good for storing, managing and querying large amounts of data.</p> What makes Ceramic a better choice than alternatives?  What’s the difference between Ceramic and a traditional blockchain? <p>Unlike financial asset blockchains that rely on slow and unscalable synchronous global state changes, Ceramic uses fast, asynchronous, parallel transaction processing and eventual consistency to enable the scale and throughput needed by large data applications. </p><p>Current blockchain protocols cannot scale to support the level of processing needed for data applications, for the simple fact that there are so many data events occurring all day, every day, in every application. That’s why Ceramic’s data consensus properties can be treated differently than value consensus properties, like those you’d find on Bitcoin or an L2. Ceramic supports data that changes (i.e. mutable) with fast, decentralized, high-volume transaction processing.</p> What’s the difference between using Ceramic to store and query data and storing the data on the blockchain? <p>Ceramic shares many similarities with a blockchain, while simultaneously offering features that optimize for low-cost mutable data at scale, thus underlining key differences. Below are some similarities and differences:</p><p>Accounts: Ceramic uses the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/dids/introduction?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Decentralized Identifier</a> standard for user accounts (DID PKH and Key DID are supported in production). Similar to blockchains, they require no centralized party or registry. Additionally, both PKH DIDs and Key DIDs ultimately rely on public key infrastructure (PKH DIDs enable blockchain accounts to sign, authorize, and authenticate transactions, while Key DIDs expand cryptographic public keys into a DID document).</p><p>Signing Transactions: data in Ceramic (or streams) support <a href="https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-74?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CACAO</a> (Chain Agnostic Capability Object), which enables the ability for one account to authorize another account to construct signatures over limited data on their behalf. Therefore, unlike manually signing individual transactions on a blockchain, Ceramic allows accounts to cryptographically authorize multiple writes in a given window, which is ideal for settings in which a database would be used to support user data that’s meant to change over time. These transactions also occur at no cost to individual users, which is yet another key difference between writing data to Ceramic vs. a blockchain.</p><p>Immutability: streams in Ceramic are organized into immutable event logs, with each commit representing an unchangeable, tamper-evident snapshot of a piece of data. Similar to how blockchains act as an immutable ledger revealing a history of the deterministic outputs of accounts transacting with other accounts and smart contracts, event logs in Ceramic give developers insight into both the immutable <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/data-provenance-composedb-as-an-authenticated-database/">data provenance</a> and lineage of data relevant to their users.</p><p>Querying: while developers can leverage libraries like <a href="https://web3js.org/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3.js</a> to read past transaction history or actively listen to transactions across accounts and contracts, blockchains (like Ethereum) do not offer native network support for querying or indexing blockchain data. This should come as no surprise - they are not designed to do this.Conversely, Ceramic is specifically designed to provide simple structure and open access to data events as they occur in the network, while simultaneously offering credibly decentralized qualities. </p><p>Ceramic’s underlying data structure (a self-certifying event log) also allows for endless database “flavors” to be built on top to further improve the developer experience. ComposeDB, for example, offers native GraphQL support, automatically splits read/write load capability, and allows developers to index on data “families” (or model instance documents related to preexisting schema definitions) across the network.</p> How much does it cost to use Ceramic Network? <p>At the moment, the only costs associated with building on Ceramic are the costs of running a Ceramic node on the cloud provider of your choice. The protocol doesn’t charge a direct fee nor are there any ecxplicit costs to store and load data from the network. This fee structure is subject to change as the Ceramic community may decide to support crypto-economic incentives and rewards.</p> Which blockchains does Ceramic support? <p>The standard use of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/122?ref=blog.ceramic.network">SIWX</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CACAO</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DID:PKH</a>&nbsp;allows anyone to implement support for another blockchain or account type to authenticate and authorize writes to the Ceramic Network. Additionally a few standard interfaces enables you to implement an auth and verification library that allows anyone to use it with&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-did/tree/main/packages/did-session?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>did-session</code></a>, the primary library to use DID based accounts with Ceramic. There is just a few steps you have to take, outlined <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/dids/guides/add-chain-support?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>.</p> Does Ceramic have a native token? <p>Ceramic does not have a native token.</p>  Technical FAQ <p></p> Do I have to run a node if I want to use ComposeDB? <p>It depends on your use case. If you just want to play around to learn and understand ComposeDB, it is not necessary to run a node. You can use our <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Sandbox</a> or Wheel (which can run in memory). For development purposes, you can either use a third party node operator, such as <a href="http://hirenodes.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">hirenodes.io</a>, or run your own node (follow our guide <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/nodes?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>).</p> Is running a node a public, permission-less thing or does one need to sign up for it? <p>Running a node is permissionless! However, to anchor commits to mainnet, it is necessary to register your node’s DID with the Ceramic Anchor Service.</p> What are the benefits to running a node? <p>You have control over performance and costs of your own data without relying on others.</p> What operating system do I need to run a Ceramic node? <p>Currently, Ceramic nodes use Node.js, so any system that can run Node.js may be used. Ceramic nodes are most often run on Linux servers but have also been run on MacOS.To run on Windows we recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux).</p> Is there an official RPC that can be used directly for Ceramic? <p>When used in a Web3 context, an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) node consists of a server that generally runs a protocol’s client software. An RPC endpoint is the network location that an application can access to perform requests (for example, dApp retrieving blockchain data for its users).The Ceramic Network does not currently offer hosted RPC node-running (and corresponding community endpoints) as a service. Instead, for both decentralization and performance purposes, we encourage developers to either <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/running-in-the-cloud?ref=blog.ceramic.network">run their own node</a> or work with a node-running service (such as <a href="https://hirenodes.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Hirenodes</a>) to set up performant and available endpoints for their applications.</p> What is a DID? <p>DID stands for Decentralized Identifier which is a W3 standard. Whenever a document is updated, it is signed by the user's DID, so that the ownership and provenance of all writes is verifiable.</p> What’s the “admin DID” for? <p>It’s the identity required on the “server” side of the ComposeDB to set up a composite for your node, which instructs your node which Models it should index. You can write data into your Ceramic node with any DID, but the admin DID is the only one able to change the set of Models used by the node.</p> What’s the difference between the “node DID” and the “admin DID”? <p>The Node DID is used for anchoring and the Admin DID is used to deploy composites.</p> Can I use an Ethereum address as a DID? <p>Yes you can! You can use Ethereum as well as Solana addresses via the <code>did:pkh</code> DID method. Check this <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/dids/authorization?ref=blog.ceramic.network">link</a> for details.</p> How do you run queries on ComposeDB? <p>ComposeDB is a graph database because the documents within it can reference other documents and form a graph, using GraphQL to query that relationship graph. You should reference supported <a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.4.x/api/sdl/scalars?ref=blog.ceramic.network">scalars</a>.</p> Who can modify the data? <p>Each document in ComposeDB is represented by a Ceramic stream that has a single DID that is the controller. The controller DID is the only one allowed to write data into that stream and updates to the stream must be signed by the controller DID’s private key.</p> Is the data on Ceramic Network public or private? <p>All the data on Ceramic (including ComposeDB) is public by default. One can encrypt the data before putting it onto the network. You can follow the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/tutorial-encrypted-data-on-composedb/">Encrypted Data Tutorial</a> tutorial for one possible method and you can also utilize the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/lit-protocol-and-ceramic-integration-tutorial-storing-encrypted-data-on-composedb/">integration between Ceramic and Lit protocol</a>.</p> Can data be deleted on Ceramic Network? <p>All data written to Ceramic are signed payloads that are organized in the core data structure (a self-certifying event log) that the protocol relies on. </p><p>This structure relies on <a href="https://ipld.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IPLD</a> content addressing to form an immutable log (on top of which applications, or databases like ComposeDB, can be built). Ceramic nodes also encompass several layers of the <a href="https://libp2p.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">libp2p</a> stack to help communicate stream updates in the network.</p><p>It’s important to understand how the services described above play an important role in answering the question of whether data on Ceramic can be deleted. While developers can pin streams on their node to prevent Ceramic’s default garbage collection behavior (and unpin, or discontinue indexing on models if using ComposeDB), data in its raw format may still be accessible within the IPFS network (though, if not pinned by any Ceramic nodes, it will effectively be “deleted” from the Ceramic network).</p> Do I need my private key to create a composite on ComposeDB? <p>Yes! While creating a composite, you sign some bytes with your private key. The signature becomes part of the composite. Don’t worry, private keys are not leaked through composites. We encourage making composites public.</p> Can you transfer the ownership of a stream on Ceramic Network? <p>Ceramic uses a DID as the controller of the stream. This means that if you use a DID that can be transferred you can transfer ownership by transferring the DID. Most of the time you will not need to transfer ownership, but rather sign a CACAO to grant some device or service the capabilities that you wish to delegate.</p> How can I incorporate ComposeDB into my dApp? <p>We have a starter application <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/launching-create-ceramic-app/">here</a>.</p> What is a CACAO? <p><a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/74?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Chain Agnostic Capability Object</a></p>  Company FAQ <p></p> What is the relationship between 3Box Labs and Ceramic? <p>While 3Box Labs is the original inventor of the Ceramic Network and have been integral to bootstrapping the Ceramic ecosystem, we're committed to migrating Ceramic to an independently-governed foundation and stepping back to play a reduced role over time. In a way, 3Box Labs is just like any other contributor to an early stage protocol.</p> What is the corporate structure of 3Box Labs? <p>3Box Labs is a US corporation registered in Delaware with employees and contractors located across the US and Europe.</p> How will Ceramic be governed? <p>Ceramic is already 100% open source, peer-to-peer software and anyone can participate in the network by simply running a Ceramic node. Formal governance of the network will progressively decentralize over time, eventually exiting to the community and a standalone foundation.</p>  💡  Have a question that’s not here?

<p>Canada’s trusted digital ID leader, the DIACC, releases its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) Trust Registries Final Recommendation V1.0, signalling it’s ready for inclusion in their <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Certification Program</a>.</p>



<p>Why is the PCTF Trust Registries component important?</p>



<p>A Trust Registry is a critical component of the new and emerging decentralized digital identity architecture, playing a crucial role in establishing and maintaining trust in digital identity ecosystems, especially regarding identity verification and authentication. The Trust Registries component provides conformance criteria for the development and certification of Governance Requirements (business structure, ecosystem scope, governance processes, policies, and standards), Trust Registry Operations (technology &amp; infrastructure management and technical services), and Registration and Certification Management (certification/verification/trustmark services, registration, suspension, and revocation processes), to ensure that a Trust Registry is, in fact, trustworthy.</p>



<p>What problems does the PCTF Trust Registries component solve?</p>



<p>Digital identity ecosystems and their associated Trust Registries use a Trust Framework (such as the PCTF) to define how ecosystem actors like Issuers, Verifiers, Holders, and Digital Wallets should or must operate to be considered trustworthy. As an essential requirement in the decentralized identity architecture, with its interconnection with many Holders, Digital Wallets, Issuers, Verifiers, and other Trust Registries, ecosystems must strive for interoperability (locally, regionally, and internationally). Adherence to standards and frameworks must be a prioritized goal for ecosystem governance organizations, which is reflected in many of the criteria of the Trust Registries component.</p>



<p>Who does the PCTF Trust Registries component help?</p>



<p>The PCTF Trust Registries component is a valuable resource for entities to use as guidance to develop their Trust Registries. Entities with Trust Registries currently in use can leverage the conformance criteria as a risk management tool to ensure their registry is as robust as possible. Having an organization’s Trust Registry certified through DIACC’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/">Voila Verified Certification Program</a> sends a clear market signal that the certified Trust Registry is reliable, secure, and can be used confidently.</p>

<p>The importance of trust in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to dominate the headlines — whether it’s the challenges of managing intellectual property or the tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to produce errors or “hallucinations.” Only a few days ago we saw Elon Musk enter this field with xAI’s Grok and in an interview with Lex Fridman he highlighted the importance of receiving responses you can trust when interacting with AI&nbsp;products</p><p>“…it (LLM) unfortunately hallucinates most when you least want it to hallucinate. When you’re asking the important and difficult questions that’s where it tends to be confidently wrong. So we’re really trying hard to say how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results?”</p><p>The truth, however, is an elusive concept, especially if attempted to be captured by a single organization/product. A better approach is through connectivity and transparency achieved by leveraging multiple open source technologies. Turing Award winner Dr. Bob Metcalfe explained this idea,&nbsp;saying,</p><p>“… through connectivity, decentralized knowledge graphs, blockchains and AI are converging — and it’s an important convergence, because it is going to help us with one of the biggest problems we have nowadays, which is the&nbsp;truth.”</p><p>OriginTrail has been, since inception, committed to fighting one of truth’s greatest arch-nemesis — misinformation. It continues on this mission in the age of AI, where the misinformation problem is growing exponentially. The growing challenges, however, also offer a growing field of opportunities, which are being unlocked with OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) used as foundation for verifiable web.</p><p>The key building blocks of the verifiable web have become available with the V6 of the OriginTrail DKG which enabled some of the most notable achievements of the Turing phase which were showcased on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph conference (DKGcon) in early October and which to date produced around two million AI-ready Knowledge Assets.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ekG1Bl-tCjc?si=Vu_nPLJ7MfdpPl4f&amp;t=622">DKGcon - Decentralized Knowledge Graph Conference</a></p><p>The Turing phase achievements also showed how the OriginTrail DKG acts as an enabler, rather than a competitor to the AI systems created by Microsoft, Google and xAI. Through the ChatDKG framework initiative we have seen the first version of <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/af4b5a7a-040b-47d2-9ac6-cf073967c51a">Microsoft Copilot</a>, integrations with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLofzKfAOLY">GoogleAI</a> and xAI enablement already being researched as a part of the Metcalfe&nbsp;phase.</p>Enabler, not a competitor of the likes of Microsoft, Google,&nbsp;xAI. Metcalfe phase — growing knowledge by a&nbsp;100.000x <p><a href="https://youtube.com/live/8kw7Y3PauHI?feature=share">Metcalfe phase - fighting misinformation with decentralized AI</a></p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/roadmap">The Metcalfe phase of the updated roadmap</a> pursues an ambitious goal of creating the world’s largest verifiable web for AI consisting of 100 billion Knowledge Assets, bringing a 100.000x scalability increase. As the name of the phase suggests, it will seek to produce network effects across the OriginTrail DKG and use novel techniques to pursue autonomous DKG growth based on the genesis knowledge foundation being created by <a href="https://origintrail.io/ecosystem/landscape">organizations and individuals alike.</a> The genesis part of the Metcalfe’s phase also introduces knowledge mining and knowledge signaling capabilities to drive constant growth of the Verifiable Web.</p><p>Following the Genesis stage and the transition to an AI-native V8, further capabilities will become available in the Convergence stage. By leveraging the advancements in AI and the DKG, we will unlock autonomous knowledge mining which in turn leads to an autonomous DKG. At that stage, new knowledge gets added to the DKG with very limited human involvement. Services such as AI agents will be performing knowledge inferencing directly on the DKG to find any “blind spots” in the knowledge they can fill as well as search for new knowledge and bring it to the DKG in accordance with knowledge signaling.</p> First steps into the Metcalfe phase start&nbsp;today <p>The Metcalfe phase activities are already on the way and today, two important updates become available in their beta versions:</p>  <a href="https://world.origintrail.io/">OriginTrail World</a> — the first version of the platform that will combine all relevant knowledge about OriginTrail technology and how to use it, including integration guidelines with other products on the&nbsp;market.  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChatDKG">ChatDKG on X</a> — the beta version of ChatDKG running on X platform that you can use to prompt and receive responses based on the knowledge that is available in the DKG. The first version is currently ring-fenced on knowledge available in the OriginTrail World platform, and the demo dataset of the chatAnalyst.ai product covering Tesla’s SEC filings and quarterly reports.

<p>Initial considerations for an electronic patient record (EPR) began around 2005, and the <a href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/gesetze-und-bewilligungen/gesetzgebung/gesetzgebung-mensch-gesundheit/gesetzgebung-elektronisches-patientendossier.html">Federal Act on the Electronic Patient Record</a> (EPDG in German) entered into force on April 15, 2023. Often criticized as «PDF graveyard», in mid-2023 the EPR only holds around 20,000 records, or 2 permille of the population, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>To improve this unsatisfactory situation, the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) conducted a <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/de/consultation-procedures/ended/2023#https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/dl/proj/2022/97/cons_1">consultation</a> on a comprehensive revision of the EPDG from June to October 2023. Due to the political processes, an update of the EPDG is not expected until 2028 at the earliest.</p>
<p>Alongside many other organizations, DIDAS also submitted a statement as part of this consultation, the most important points of which are listed below:</p>
 
 Person centric in order to grant every citizen access to her or his complete health data 
 Technology neutrality in order to take into account future wallet-based solutions 
 Openness and standards to ensure the highest possible level of interoperability 
 Immediate measures to generate benefits before 2028

<p>In the latest Elastos Bi-Weekly update, the core development ecosystem has witnessed substantial advancements led by Trinity, Gelaxy and Elacity, reflecting a strong commitment to innovation and strategic collaboration.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://trinity-tech.io/">Trinity team’s</a> role in advancing Elastos’ ecosystem is marked by their focus on enhancing user experience and security, as well as their dedication to resolving functional challenges across various projects such as Elastos DID Web Service, KYC-me, Essentials wallet and Carrier networking. In the Elastos DID web service, they have significantly upgraded the DID web service. This includes introducing the ability to unbind email accounts in the Security Center, facilitating the import and display of Verifiable Credentials, and improving the access key generation process. Key issues such as incorrect issuer displays in VCs and browser compatibility problems in the user activities list have been addressed, leading to ongoing updates in the DID web services UI/UX design. These improvements are now available in both the staging and production environments, where more information on its release will be announced soon.</p>
<p>The team’s efforts with the <a href="https://elastos.info/essentials-the-super-wallet/">Web3Essentials</a>&nbsp;wallet have been geared towards enhancing its reliability and functionality. This includes resolving the complications with NFT trading on OpenSea, updating the integration with kyc-me, and preparing for the release of version 3.0.13 of Web3Essentials, which includes fixes for several accumulated bugs.</p>
<p>In their work on the <a href="https://kyc-me.io/">kyc-me </a>initiative, the Trinity team has tackled the issue of the app icon not displaying correctly during Web3Essentials wallet logins and implemented a backend interface to clear cached user data. They have also boosted the OCR return parameter’s Confidence value to refine identification accuracy, especially in cases of blurry identity document photos. Trinity is continuously improving the kyc-me code, with a particular focus on ensuring its compatibility and effectiveness on desktop browsers. Moreover, under the Trinity Team’s direction, the Carrier service has experienced notable improvements and enhanced community support.</p>
<p>The Gelaxy Team has made significant strides in enhancing the Mainchain and Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) and Elastos ID (EID). For the Mainchain, they’ve nearly completed increasing the side chains’ gas price, optimised state transitions of BPoS nodes and CR members for better stability, and improved the <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/">main chain browser</a> to support more detailed statistics. A notable update is the now-online <a href="https://ela.elastos.io/calculator">rewards calculator</a> on the main chain explorer.</p>
<p>In the ESC/EID domain, the team resolved an issue where the increased minimum Gas price limit on the ESC sidechain was not effective. They also began repairing the ESC browser to display intra-contract transactions accurately and addressed occasional block instability on the main network EID, ensuring smoother and more reliable blockchain operations.</p>
<p>For Elastos Runtime infrastructure, the <a href="https://celo.org/">Elacity</a> team’s primary goal is to enhance both the security and media playback with <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/YEeOIqG/elacity-access-economy-whitepaper-pdf">DRM-encrypted video capsules</a> for the handling efficiency of the system. To achieve this, they have focused on fundamental aspects such as strengthening the interaction layers between modules, refining the process of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key generation, and incorporating robust AES-128-CBC encryption to protect media content. Their approach to debugging and playback optimisation, aiming for simplicity and effectiveness, has significantly improved media continuity and reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further streamline media handling, the team has introduced on-demand media creation, allowing audio only for future music application and achieved more precise synchronisation using Media Source Extensions (MSE), coupled with a thorough restructuring of the player codebase for enhanced organization and efficiency. The team’s efforts in updating the codebase and tools are evident in the integration of the latest remuxing techniques, upgrading to Go version 1.21 for <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> System Interface (WASI) support, and delving into the potential of WebSocket integration for improved network handling.</p>
<p>Finally, the Elacity Team has worked on refining the Elastos runtimes frontend and playback experience. This includes bolstering the metadata infrastructure to better support frontend processing, methodically resolving memory leaks to enhance performance, and proactively tackling specific playback issues related to Chrome’s keyframe interpretation, all aimed at delivering a more streamlined and reliable user experience.</p>
<p>DID Web Service</p>
 
 Implemented the feature in DID web service to support unbinding of email accounts in the Security Center. 
 Implement the functionality in the DID web-services Applications page for requesting to import/show related VCs (Verifiable Credentials) information. 
 Optimize the page for generating access keys in the DID web service. 
 Resolve the issue in the DID web service where the Issuer is incorrectly displayed when importing VCs. 
 Fix the issue in the DID web service where the imported Identity Root is not displayed on the import/export page. 
 Address compatibility issues in getting the browser name, as some browsers show undefined names in the user activities list. 
 Continue importing UI/UX designs to update the front-end implementation of the DID web service. 
 Update deployment in staging and production environments. 
 
<p>Essentials</p>
 
 Resolve the issue with NTF trading not being possible on OpenSea. 
 Update the integration of kyc-me. 
 Accumulated bug fixes. 
 Test and release version 3.0.13 of Web3Essentials. 
 
<p>Kyc-me</p>
 
 Resolve the issue where the kyc-me app icon is not displayed when logging in using the Web3Essentials wallet or DID web service. 
 Fix the issue where there is no pop-up prompt when the scanned identity document photo is placed too far or too close, preventing further verification steps. 
 The kyc-me service backend has added an interface to clear users’ cached data, supporting front-end clearance of cached user data through API calls. 
 Increase the OCR return parameter Confidence value to 0.93 to filter out some cases where individuals are incorrectly identified as non-document holders (though the final tests still occasionally result in incorrect identifications). 
 Update the kyc-me test environment for further testing and verification. 
 Optimize the kyc-me code implementation based on testing suggestions. 
 Begin assessing kyc-me support for Desktop Browsers. 
 
<p>Carrier</p>

<p>We believe that AI will be about individual empowerment and agency on a scale we’ve never seen before</p>
<p>Whoa!&nbsp;That’s what we’ve been working toward here at ProjectVRM since 2006.</p>
<p>Shall we call it IEASWNSB? (Pronounced “Eewasnib,” perhaps?) We might have better luck with that than we’ve had with VRM, Me2B, and other initialisms and acronyms.</p>
<p>For fun, I asked <a href="https://www.bing.com/create?">Bing Image Create</a>, which uses OpenAI’s DALL-E to produce images, to make art with its boss’s words. It gave me the images above. <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/individual-empowerment-and-agency-on-a-scale-we27ve/654ffe8b1f794fb8b5819f691333d40e?FORM=GUH2CR">Here’s the link</a>.</p>
<p>Those are a little too Ayn Randy for me. So I tried just “Empowered individuals,” and got <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create/individual-empowerment-and-agency-on-a-scale-we27ve/654ffe8b1f794fb8b5819f691333d40e?FORM=GUH2CR">this</a>—</p>

<p>—which is almost the ulta-woke opposite of the first one.</p>
<p>But never mind that. Let’s talk about individual empowerment with AI help. Here’s my personal punch list:</p>
 
 Health. Make sense of all my health data. Suck it in from every medical care provider I’ve ever had, and help me make decisions bases on it. Also help me share it on an as-needed basis with my current providers. 
 Finances. Pull in and help me make sense of my holdings, obligations, recurring payments, incomes, whatever. Match my orders and shipments from Amazon and other retailers with the cryptic entries (always in ALL CAPS) on my credit card bills. I want to run every receipt I collect through a scanner that does OCR for my AI, which will know what receipt is for what, where it goes in the books it helps me keep, and yearly helps me work through my taxes. The list can go on. 
 Property. What have I got? I want to point my phone camera at everything that a good AI can possibly recognize, and make sense of all that too. Know all the books on my shelves by reading their spines. Know my furniture, the stuff in my basement. Help me keep records of my car’s history after I give it the VIN number I photographed under the windshield, and run all the records I’ve kept in the glove box through the same scanner I mentioned above. Whatever. Why not? 
 Correspondence. I have half a million emails here, going back to 1995. (Wish it went back farther.) Lots of texts too, in lots of systems. Help me do a better job of looking back though those than my various clients do. Help me cross-reference those with events I attended and other stuff I may be relevant to some current inquiry. 
 Contacts. Who do I have in my various directories? How many entries are wrong in one way or another? Go through and correct them, AI helper, based on whatever clever new algorithm works for that. 
 Calendar. Tell me where I was on a given day, what I was doing, and who I was with. Knowing all that other personal data (above) will help too. 
 Business relationships. Look into all my subscriptions and help me <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2021/05/25/solving-subscriptions/">fight the fuckery</a> behind nearly all of them. Make better sense of all the loyalty programs I’m involved with, and help me unfuck those too, since most of them are about entrapment rather than real loyalty. 
 Other involvements. What associations do I belong to? How deeply am I involved with any or all of them? Can we drop some? Add some? Have some insights into how those are going, or should go? 
 Travel. I have 1.6 million miles with United Airlines alone. Where did I go? When? Why ? What did I pay? Are there ways to improve my relationships with airlines and other entities (e.g. car rental agencies, Uber/Lyft, AirBnB, cruise lines)? 
 Shopping. We’ve been talking (and working toward) <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Intentcasting">intentcasting</a> it seems forever, but mostly since the late aughts. Now with AI, it’s easy to imagine countless possibilities that begin with one’s intent to buy rather than retailers’ intent to sell. Words to wise sellers: A) Make it as easy as possible for customers’ personal and privacy-guarding AI agents to find what you’ve got and know as much about it as possible, and B) Fire every marketer and marketing system that wants in any ways to trap, milk, coerce, and otherwise fuck over customers. Meanwhile, customers should have AI capacities that keep them from getting screwed, to know when the screwing happens, and to help do something about it. 
 
<p>Our lives are packed with too much data for our meat-brains alone to fully comprehend and put to use. AI is good for that . So bring it on.</p>
<p>And don’t bet that any of the bigs, including OpenAI, to give you anything on the punch list above*. They’re too big, too centralized, too stuck in a mainframe paradigm. They look for what only they can do for you, rather than what you can do for yourself—or do better with your own damn AI.</p>
<p>Personal AI today is where personal computing was fifty years ago. We don’t yet have the Apple II, the Osborne, the TRS-80, the Commodore PET, much less the IBM&nbsp; PC or the Macintosh. We just have big companies with big everything,&nbsp; with hooks for developers. And soon an app store (also announced in Sam Altman’s keynote).</p>
<p>Real personal AI is a huge greenfield. Going there is also, to switch metaphors, a blue ocean strategy. <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2020/10/26/blue/">Wrote about that here</a>.</p>
 
<p>*Except by pouring all that data into their LLM. Not yours.</p>

Lissi GmbH founders Adrian Doerk, Helge Michael and Sebastian Bickerle (from left to&nbsp;right) Frankfurt am Main, November 13th,&nbsp;2023 <p>[Press release also <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/eidas-2-0-mit-lissi-neosfer-ausgr%C3%BCndung-setzt-auf-digitale-identit%C3%A4t-mit-europ%C3%A4ischen-id-wallets-ae045d14211f">available in&nbsp;German</a>]</p><p>Lissi, known as a pioneer in identity wallets and verifiable credentials, announces its establishment as an independent startup, supported by investments from neosfer, 9.5 Ventures and the managing directors. The spin-off is also a milestone for neosfer, which launched Lissi in 2019. For Commerzbank’s innovation unit, it is the first spin-off of a self-developed project.</p><p>With its Lissi software platform, Lissi offers a comprehensive range of solutions designed to issue, store and verify verifiable credentials and thus enable trustworthy interactions with identity wallets according to European standards. The European Union has recently <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_5651">welcomed a final agreement of the eIDAS 2.0 regulation</a> to introduce European Digital Identity Wallets (EUDI) across the European Union. This opens up a whole new market for Lissi. The company’s vision is to become the leading software provider for trusted interactions between organisations and EUDI-Wallet users. The focus is on offering software for interaction with EUDI-Wallets and extensive functions that go beyond the standard protocols proposed by the European&nbsp;Union.</p>Lissi GmbH&nbsp;logo<p>The founders Helge Michael, Sebastian Bickerle and Adrian Doerk explain: “We are proud to make a decisive contribution to strengthening trust in our increasingly digital society. The path to the future is already lined with promising collaborations, including municipal use cases with the cities of Cologne, Leipzig and Dresden as well as various use cases with major banks such as Commerzbank AG and ING Deutschland. These early adopters will benefit from improved process efficiency, reduced paperwork and higher data quality, resulting in significant time and cost savings.”</p><p>Kai Werner and Matthias Lais, Managing Directors of neosfer: “The spin-off is proof of the entrepreneurial innovation strength that is realised in the neosfer innovation unit. The spin-off of Lissi is a major milestone for us. It confirms how important it is to give new ideas and approaches space and structure for their development. We are delighted that our innovation unit has succeeded in doing just that.” The close collaboration with neosfer as one of the main investors will continue in the future. The founders are also supported by the venture capital firm 9.5 Ventures, which firmly believes that the management will revolutionise the design of trust-based digital interactions in personal and business processes.</p><p>Since its foundation as part of neosfer in 2019, Lissi has initiated and led the IDunion research project, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. This is a community of 70 partners and over 350 individual contributors, including well-known companies such as Bundesdruckerei, Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bahn and DATEV e.G. Lissi has already implemented 35 pilot projects and received the prestigious Handelsblatt Diamond Award, which emphasises its commitment to the further development of digital&nbsp;trust.</p><p>We invite the press to engage with the future of digital identity in Europe and offer our perspective to complement your stories and encourage interested organisations to explore the potential of ID-Wallets together with&nbsp;Lissi.</p><p>For more information, please visit our website <a href="http://www.lissi.id/">www.lissi.id</a><br>For press enquiries please contact: info@lissi.id</p> About neosfer <p><a href="https://neosfer.de/">neosfer</a> is the early-stage investor and innovation unit of Commerzbank Group.

Die Ausgründung ist auch ein Meilenstein für neosfer, in dessen Rahmen Lissi im Jahr 2019 startete. Für die Innovationseinheit der Commerzbank handelt es sich um die erste Ausgründung eines selbst entwickelten Projekts.</p><p>Lissi bietet mit seiner Lissi Software-Plattform ein umfassendes Lösungsangebot, das darauf ausgelegt ist, verifizierbare Nachweise auszustellen, zu speichern und zu verifizieren und damit vertrauenswürdige Interaktionen mit Identitäts-Wallets nach Europäischen Standards zu ermöglichen. Die Europäische Union hat kürzlich eine <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_5651">Einigung über die eIDAS 2.0-Verordnung</a> zur Einführung von Europäischen digitalen Identitäts-Wallets (EUDI) in der gesamten Europäischen Union verabschiedet.

Diese Early Adopters werden von verbesserter Prozesseffizienz, geringerem Papieraufwand und höherer Datenqualität profitieren, was zu erheblichen Zeit- und Kosteneinsparungen führt.”</p><p>Kai Werner und Matthias Lais, Geschäftsführer von neosfer: „Die Ausgründung ist ein Beleg für die unternehmerische Innovationskraft, die in der Innovationseinheit neosfer realisiert wird. Für uns ist die Ausgründung von Lissi ein großer Meilenstein. Sie bestätigt, wie wichtig es ist, neuen Ideen und Ansätzen Raum und Struktur für ihre Entwicklung zu geben. Wir freuen uns sehr, dass genau dies im Rahmen unserer Innovationseinheit gelungen ist.” Auch in Zukunft wird die enge Zusammenarbeit mit neosfer als einem der Hauptinvestoren fortgesetzt. Unterstützt werden die Gründer zudem von der Venture Capital Firma 9.5 Ventures, die fest daran glaubt, dass das Management die Gestaltung vertrauensbasierter digitaler Interaktionen in persönlichen und geschäftlichen Prozessen revolutionieren wird.</p><p>Seit seiner Gründung als Teil von neosfer im Jahr 2019 hat Lissi das IDunion Forschungsprojekt, welches durch das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz gefördert wird, initiiert und leitet es seitdem.

I’m also working with my colleagues at the Berkman Klein Center on several media literacy initiatives around generative artificial intelligence.</p><p>Adults are excited, intrigued, amused, or are wringing their hands in equal measure around the growth of advanced computing and tools that can generate original text, images, audio, or video — loosely called generative AI. But what does this really mean in the context of&nbsp;kids?</p><p>In talking to young people, I get a sense that they need as much support in understanding AI as we adults do. And maybe they now need a tad more as generative AI further blends into their technology-rich lives.</p><p>They still need to know how media is made, that they themselves can make media, and that it has a purpose — even if it’s AI-assisted.</p><p>So, let’s start with some context: What do these three have in common?<br>The government.<br>An everyday person.<br>Elon&nbsp;Musk.</p><p>The answer is that they are the most common responses I’ve found in talking to 5th graders about who is responsible for what they find on the internet. There’s a similar range of replies when these 10-year-olds are asked who fact-checks the internet. Popular answers here include the government, no-one, and the ubiquitous Mr.&nbsp;Musk.</p><p>These kids are often called “digital natives” — born long after the demise of rotary phones, dial-up, Blockbuster, Myspace, and waiting for a letter in the mail. They are deemed native as if they are somehow born with an ability to reset the router or to attach PDFs to emails. I think they are not. Fish are surrounded by water but may be able to tell you little about it. Our young people need to learn, or be shown, how to stay safe online and how to benefit from the many opportunities access to boundless information affords.</p>Ruff Ruffman: Humble Media Genius. Image courtesy of&nbsp;GBH.<p>It’s worth noting that AI is not new. It’s in many of the tools that have been in our hands for a while. For instance, Siri uses predictions to complete a text — and has been trying to break up my marriage long before it was fashionable for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html">more advanced AI</a> to do so. (“I’m in the woods with Natalie,” I texted my wife when she was out of town. My English accent and flaws in Siri’s speech recognition had turned our dog, Nellie, with whom I was enjoying a woodland adventure, into Natalie, my daughter’s twentysomething math coach, with whom I was&nbsp;not.)</p><p>Kids are already using AI every day if they’re online or on their phones. What do they actually know about it? The following responses are from 10-year-olds:</p><p>“It’s really smart, it’s so smart it can go to websites in its memory chip; it can take all the information and put it inside its brain.”<br>OK, that’s a little robot overlord-y, but it’s&nbsp;close.</p><p>“It’s not good the first time, it learns as it plays.”<br>That’s pretty much exactly how AI has beaten grandmasters in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ais-victories-in-go-inspire-better-human-game-playing/">Go</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-ibms-deep-blue-beat-world-champion-chess-player-garry-kasparov">Chess</a>, and <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ibm-watson-the-inside-story-of-how-the-jeopardy-winning-supercomputer-was-born-and-what-it-wants-to-do-next/">Jeopardy</a>.</p><p>“The AI is making the picture, and the AI is coded by humans.”<br>That’s a pretty accurate view of generative art, although it bypasses issues of intellectual property. And of course, these new images based on real people are now pretty convincing. I still can’t believe that the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/movies/keanu-reeves-deepfake-account-is-so-good-it-has-fans-wondering-if-its-really-the-actor">deepfakes of Keanu</a> are not Keanu. But maybe I don’t want to believe they’re&nbsp;fake.</p><p>As I share this now, it’s worth noting that we sometimes deliberately share fake information just as willingly as if we know it to be true. This is one of the confounding challenges around stemming more harmful misinformation and disinformation.</p>Image by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@unreal_keanu">@unreal_keanu</a> via&nbsp;TikTok.<p>“If it can tell you are sick with a disease of some sort and can tell you about it before it gets too serious by noticing unusual things that don’t always happen on a daily basis.”<br>This is a great encapsulation of the medical world’s hope for AI, with already-proven success in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.370.6521.1144">protein&nbsp;folding</a>.</p><p>“The world is full with AI’s and no one can be really sure.”<br>No, we cannot. And so, we should still consider how to help kids thrive in a world where ideas of provenance, authorship, intention, bias, and even why we share information with each other, are increasingly fuzzy.</p> We Can Use AI as a Tool to Challenge Disinformation <p>There is a belief that AI could weaponize phishing to be more targeted and more plausible. Conversely, reverse image search, an AI-assisted tool, let me investigate a suspicious friend request from someone who looked like a Danish sea captain and was, it transpired, a Danish sea captain — at least the pictures used were. His affable images, I discovered, had been misappropriated and used as a siren call all over the world<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6339769/Australian-woman-58-duped-10-000-scam-fraudster-pretend-Danish-captain.html"> in phishing&nbsp;attacks</a>.</p> We Should Avoid Exacerbating Inequalities <p>If we are not vigilant, new technologies can have a tendency to exacerbate existing digital divides by, for example, creating a heavy reliance on expensive devices or tools. The current generation of generative AI tools relies, at minimum, on having an internet-connected device. Although the mechanics for data sent as cellular data, wi-fi, or Bluetooth are perhaps similar, their differences can be huge for those with limited means, limited data plans, or low bandwidth connectivity. Unless we think intentionally about ensuring equitable access, many children will be under-equipped to use new AI technologies.</p> We Must Think Creatively about the Medium of Media&nbsp;Literacy <p>School-based media literacy may provide some of the answers to helping kids learn more, but the presence of <a href="https://medialiteracynow.org/impact/">formal instruction varies by state</a>, from none to some. The demands on the school day and the multiplicity of technologies can make integrating media literacy instruction challenging for any educator. We must understand the needs of teachers as we develop in-classroom supports and scaffold them with professional development materials as&nbsp;needed.</p><p>That said, we know media literacy messaging works well when it’s either baked into media that kids are already consuming or is standalone content that they gravitate to, whether that’s through video, social media, or digital games. For example, we use both of these approaches at GBH; our episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa8HWWMcQEGRhqI2vfh30TPvRO1m4FLWS">Molly of Denali</a> often model positive uses of media and technology.</p>Molly of Denali. Images courtesy of&nbsp;GBH. Future Proofing Media Literacy Education Is&nbsp;Key <p>The usage of generative AI is moving swiftly, with over 5<a href="https://www.futurepedia.io/">,000 tools</a> now claiming to have AI support and with many being integrated into tools and software kids are already using. Being strategic about what kinds of media literacy to address is&nbsp;key.</p><p>This is especially true for those of us making media about technology, professional video, or a high quality media literacy game. These can take months to produce, if we even find the funding to begin with. Our resulting work often has a long tail of use, so for both of these reasons we must be careful to future-proof what we provide, and to not overly focus on one single tool. The Ruff Ruffman: Humble Media Genius videos have been viewed over 100 million times, so getting the message right, with as much timelessness as possible, is important.</p><p>And as a new generation of AI tools become intertwined with what our kids interact with — in their searches, in the algorithms that suggest what to listen to or, more importantly perhaps, what friends see their posts, and in the work they do at school — we should take stock and assess whether we’re headed into stormy seas or wide open blue oceans. (That Danish sea captain clearly has left his mark on me.) We should provide media literacy that kids want to engage with; it can’t feel like just another civics&nbsp;lesson.</p> We Can Learn from the Past to Inform Our&nbsp;Future <p>There is very little research yet about generative AI, and so we in public media, and many of our colleagues across academia, are trying to conduct it. As a stop-gap, we’re leaning on studies of related technology: for example, how kids interact with chatbots can be informed by 10 years’ study into how they interact with digital voice assistants like Siri; these in turn often look back at prior research into <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00008/full">Human Computer Interaction</a>.</p><p>How we have evolved to use other digital tools can help us consider how we might use AI. For example, many of us have grown to trust Wikipedia but perhaps wouldn’t use it for a crucial medical diagnosis. And when was the last time you crossed-checked Google Maps directions with a paper map before trusting your computer-proposed itinerary? In other words, we decide the trust we place in every new tool we&nbsp;use.</p><p>Generative AI is in many ways exciting, new and challenging, and I believe we can and must equip young people with the critical thinking skills to help them use AI effectively.</p><p>This essay is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary and transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence.

Our social connections with others can help support our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375548/">basic needs for survival</a>, provide a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-23915-002">source of resilience</a>, and enable us to gain a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8095671/">sense of belonging</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07342829211057640">mattering</a> in our social and cultural&nbsp;world.</p><p>The U.S. Surgeon General recently released a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">report</a> on an “epidemic of loneliness,” suggesting that a lack of social connection poses major threats to <a href="https://local.psy.miami.edu/faculty/dmessinger/c_c/rsrcs/rdgs/emot/PerspectivesonPsychologicalScience-2015-Holt-Lunstad-227-37.pdf">individual</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X0400165X">societal health</a>.

Research also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32504808/">indicates</a> that loneliness increases the risk of both anxiety and depression among children and adolescents and that such risks continued to exist nine years after loneliness was initially measured.

Despite the hype, these systems are not completely new. The 1940s <a href="https://sanketp.medium.com/language-models-the-beginnings-8824df2eacc0">marked</a> initial forays into language models. What is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSRN_3pkTsc&amp;t=3137s">new</a> is how these systems — which are “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSRN_3pkTsc&amp;t=3137s">more ‘auto-complete’ than ‘search engine</a>’” — are being promoted: they are being made available to the broader&nbsp;public.</p><p>How do different users perceive these systems? Preliminary <a href="https://www.ideo.com/journal/will-ai-interfere-with-relationships-gen-z-thinks-so">research from IDEO</a> sought out the perspectives of twelve participants ages 13 to 21 in the U.S. around the ways generative AI may impact social connection (among other themes). The company first distilled key sentiments associated with these systems based on large quantities of social media posts and then presented participants with AI-driven hypothetical <a href="https://www.ideo.com/journal/is-gen-z-ready-to-embrace-ai-its-complicated">products</a>, such as “Build a FrAInd: Your ideal bestie come to life, based on celebs and influencers you love” and “New AI, New Me: An avatar trained on your preferences that has experiences for you.” Participants had varying levels of familiarity with generative AI and diverse life experiences (e.g., some participants were in school and others not, some had international backgrounds, etc.). When asked for their thoughts on these products, they emphasized that relationships are all “about you learning as you go,” that humans must “<a href="https://www.ideo.com/journal/will-ai-interfere-with-relationships-gen-z-thinks-so">remain at the&nbsp;helm</a>.”</p><p>In IDEO’s <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2021/youth-participation-in-a-digital-world">youth-focused</a> research, respondents also voiced concern around&nbsp;trust.</p><blockquote>In the context of human-to-human connection, an important question arises: How will generative AI, such as LLMs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUCUNvu8QUg">influence the trust we have in other&nbsp;people</a>?</blockquote><p>A study from a Stanford and Cornell research team <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2208839120">demonstrated</a> that when asked to discern whether online dating, professional, and lodging profiles were generated by an LLM or a human, participants only selected the correct answer about half of the time. Whereas participants could sometimes identify specific markers of text generated by LLMs (i.e. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpE40jwMilU">synthetic text</a>) such as repetitive wording, they also pointed to cues such as grammatical mistakes or long words, which, in the study’s data, were more representative of language written by a human. Additional features that participants used to discern human-written text, including first-person pronouns or references to family, were equally present in both synthetic and human-written profiles. Rather than interpreting results as evidence of machine “<a href="https://techwontsave.us/episode/163_chatgpt_is_not_intelligent_w_emily_m_bender">intelligence,</a>” the Cornell and Stanford team suggested that individuals may use flawed heuristics to detect synthetic text.</p><p>The authors <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2208839120">proposed</a> that such heuristics may be indicative of human vulnerability: “People are unprepared for their encounters with language-generating AI technologies, and the heuristics developed through&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. social contexts are dysfunctional when applied to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. AI language systems.” Concerningly, individuals are <a href="https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/44537255/Ischen2020_Chapter_PrivacyConcernsInChatbotIntera.pdf">more likely</a> to share personal information and follow recommendations by nonhuman entities that they view as “human,” raising key privacy questions. At the same time — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUCUNvu8QUg&amp;t=1632s">at least in the short term</a> — they may begin to distrust those who they think are using synthetic text in their communication.</p><p>Issues of bias are also central given that systems such as LLMs absorb and amplify the biases in training data. Against the backdrop of the race towards ever larger LLMs, as outlined in Bender and colleagues’ ground-breaking paper “<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?</a>,” the wider web is not representative of the ways that different people view the world. A number of factors impact 1) who has access to the Internet, 2) who feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and worldviews online, 3) who is represented in the parts of the Internet chosen for the training data, and 4) how the basic filtering applied to training data produces more distortion.</p><p>For instance, per the second factor, whereas user-generated content sites (e.g., Reddit) portray themselves as welcoming platforms, structural elements (e.g., moderation practices) may make these sites less accessible to underrepresented communities. Harassment on X (formerly Twitter), for example, is <a href="https://medium.com/@agua.carbonica/twitter-wants-you-to-know-that-youre-still-sol-if-you-get-a-death-threat-unless-you-re-a5cce316b706">experienced</a> by “a wide range of overlapping groups including domestic abuse victims, sex workers, trans people, queer people, immigrants, medical patients (by their providers), neurodivergent people, and visibly or vocally disabled people.” As the authors of “Stochastic Parrots” point out, there are selected subgroups that can more easily contribute data, which produces a systemic pattern that exacerbates inclusion and diversity. In turn, this pattern initiates and perpetuates a feedback loop that diminishes the impact of data from underrepresented communities and <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/2e855f9489df0712b4bd8ea9e2848c5a-Abstract.html#:~:text=We%20propose%20a%20Process%20for,predetermined%20set%20of%20target%20values.">privileges</a> hegemonic viewpoints.</p><p>Automated facial recognition software is another example.

What might that indicate about the counselor? Perhaps about the school as a whole? Would you fully trust the counselor to assist in the referral of your&nbsp;child?</p><p>Furthermore, what if you knew about the significant biases built into and amplified by generative AI?

How can we <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/2126417">counter the generative AI hype</a> and educate individuals to be critical consumers of these systems — with the understanding that, as Dr. Rumman Chowdhury has pointed out, AI <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/the-recast/2023/07/14/bias-ai-rumman-chowdhury-twitter-00106412">“is not inherently neutral, trustworthy, nor beneficial</a>”? While acknowledging this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRFaow12xo0&amp;t=980s">nuanced landscape</a>, how do we develop regulations that emphasize <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445918">accountability</a> on the part of the companies that develop and deploy generative AI (especially through a lens of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g0l8iDyCSw&amp;t=3096s">algorithmic justice</a> as described by Deborah Raji); <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/172454/great-ai-hallucination-chatgpt">transparency</a> (e.g., the knowledge that one has encountered synthetic media and an understanding of how the system was trained; e.g., “<a href="https://www.consentfultech.io/">consentful tech</a>”); and the <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_artificial_intelligence_companies_on_data_worker_labor_conditions_-_091323pdf1.pdf">prevention of exploitative labor</a>?</p><p>Returning to social connection and human-to-human communication, when we use language, we do so for a given purpose — to ask another person a question, explain an idea to someone, or just to socialize.

Referents, actual things and ideas in the world around us, like tulips or compassion, are needed to produce meaning. This meaning is unable to be learned from form alone. Given that LLMs are trained on form, these systems do not necessarily learn “meaning,” but instead some “<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.463.pdf">reflection of meaning into the linguistic form</a>.” As Dr. Bender <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html">notes</a>, language is relational by its very&nbsp;nature.</p><p>Moving forward, it is essential that we preserve the sanctity of genuine human-to-human connection, with its conflicts, its awkwardness, and its spaces for cultivating relationships built on consistent trust, belonging, and mattering to those in one’s&nbsp;life.</p><p>Are you interested in continuing the conversation around social connection?

<p>As a social scientist who views online phenomena through the lenses of trust, safety, security, privacy, and transparency, I seek to understand the potential for misuse and abuse in this current environment of giddy euphoria related to Generative AI (GenAI). Below, I briefly discuss some forms of victimization that the makers and regulators of these tools must consider, and suggest ways to reduce the frequency and impact of potential harms that may emerge and proliferate.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@googledeepmind?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Google DeepMind</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>.<p>If you’ve spent any meaningful amount of time on social media, you’ve likely been exposed not only to harassment, but also to the presence of bots that spam or otherwise annoy you with irrelevant or intrusive content. GenAI allows for the automatic creation of harassing or threatening messages, emails, posts, or comments on a wide variety of platforms and interfaces, and systematizes their rapid spread. In addition, given that malicious social media users have employed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666953/twitch-sues-alleged-hate-raiders-harassment-streamers">thousands of bots to flood online spaces with hateful content</a>, it is reasonable to assume that GenAI can facilitate this at an even greater scale. Indeed, since GenAI bots can converse and interact in more natural ways than traditional bots, responding to the problem may be much more challenging than using typical content moderation methods.</p><p>Imagine this occurring in the comment thread of your latest Instagram post, or among the community of friends you’ve carefully built in your Twitch or Discord channel, or on your recent LinkedIn post seeking new employment opportunities. Imagine a flood of bots when you’re trying to seek a romantic partner on a dating app. Recently, an AI chatbot was created to identify the type of women a person is interested in and then initiate flirtatious conversation with them <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cupidbots-dating-app-ai-harassment">until they agree to a date or share their phone number</a>. Another chatbot has been accused of pursuing prospective romantic partners when they were clearly not interested, even <a href="https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/tech/ai-program-replika-accused-of-sexual-harassment.html">becoming sexually aggressive and harassing</a>. One can easily envision the problematic possibilities when these technologies are combined, refined, and exploited.</p><p>Relatedly, I am very concerned about the dissemination and amplification of hate speech, given the ability of GenAI to be used to create and propagate text, memes, deepfakes, and related harmful content that targets specific members of marginalized groups or attacks the group as a&nbsp;whole.</p><blockquote>Even if the hate speech is created by human users, accounts created by GenAI can increase the visibility, reach, and virality of existing problematic content by fostering large upswings in engagement for those posts through high volumes of likes, shares, and comments.</blockquote><p>It is not clear how proficient platforms are in detecting unnatural behavior of this ilk, and malicious users can easily program frequencies and delays to mimic typical human activity.</p><p>Many of us are familiar with how deepfakes have been used over the last decade to compromise the integrity of the information landscape through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/artificial-intelligence-training-deepfake.html">disinformation campaigns</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/12/1018222/deepfake-revenge-porn-coming-ban/">image-based sexual violence</a>. GenAI technologies not only greatly assist in the creation of deepfakes, but also can intersect with sextortion, catfishing, doxing, stalking, threats, and identity theft. Imagine this: A malicious individual creates a new account on a dating app. An unsuspecting user is then fooled into believing they are talking with a real person in their town, even though the chat conversation is facilitated by GenAI. Soon, the unsuspecting user begins candidly sharing personal information as they build a strong emotional bond with the fake account. When the malicious individual begins to send nude photo and video content to deepen intimacy, the unsuspecting user is unable to discern that it is manufactured. After responding in kind with genuine, private, sexual photos, extortion and threats ensue. Even after the victim responds to the demands, the malicious individual still shares the victim’s private information publicly on other message boards. It’s reasonable to expect new iterations of GenAI tools that can live-search the Internet and integrate queried information, organize it, connect it with other sources, and build a detailed dossier about a person. This would contribute to additional privacy violations, stalking, and threats against the unsuspecting user, as well as fraudulent activity (e.g., counterfeit documents, wide-scale phishing attacks) and identity&nbsp;theft.</p><p>Given how many forms of abuse can be aided and abetted by GenAI, an essential question surfaces: What can be done here to mitigate risk and&nbsp;harm?</p><p>Initiatives that might be considered low-hanging fruit often involve education of end users to augment their ability to recognize GenAI creations as synthetic and to interpret and react to them accordingly. This can occur in part through <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-generative-ai-text-chatgpt/">improved detection algorithms</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/23/microsoft-pledges-to-watermark-ai-generated-images-and-videos/">labeling/watermarking</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CommunityNotes/status/1663609484051111936?s=20">notifications/warnings</a>, and in-app or in-platform educational content of a compelling nature (e.g., when TikTok asked top influencers to create short videos that <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/helping-users-manage-their-screen-time">encourage users to take breaks from screentime</a> or <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/create-kindness-on-tiktok">teach viewers how to counter online bullying</a>).</p><p>Outside of these platform-centric efforts, <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/teaching-ai-literacy-how-begin">media literacy education</a> in schools must also require instruction in the use (and possible misuse) of GenAI tools, given their growing adoption among young people. Other theoretically simple solutions involve the ability for creators to easily attach Do Not Train flags to certain pieces of output that should not end up as training data in large language models (LLMs) (e.g., Adobe’s <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">Content Authenticity Initiative</a> is advocating for this on an industry-wide level (h/t <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nfreitas">Nathan Freitas</a>)). New, elegant, privacy-forward solutions to quickly and consistently verify authentic users — their identity, their voice, their persona in photo and video (and, subsequently, remove non-human users) — must be developed and deployed. To be sure, though, protections must be in place so that human users (especially those historically marginalized) are not algorithmically misclassified because of existing biases in training datasets.</p><p>Can tech companies that provide GenAI models to their user base also reasonably mandate rule compliance? That is, can the tool itself (and the messaging that surrounds it) be crafted in a way that deters misuse and promotes prosocial or at least neutral output? Can it be presented to users with both excitement and cautions? Can clear examples of appropriate and inappropriate use be provided? Since being logged-in is likely required, can the platform remind the users that logs are kept to facilitate investigations should policy violations occur? And can gentle reminders and prompts periodically jog the memory of users that appropriate use is expected? All of this seems especially important if the tool is provided seamlessly and naturally within the in-app experience on hugely popular platforms (e.g., <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/13266788358932-What-is-My-AI-on-Snapchat-and-how-do-I-use-it-">My AI</a> on Snapchat was rolled out to 750 million monthly users and <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/early-insights-on-my-ai">fielded 10 billion messages from over 150 million users within two&nbsp;months</a>).</p><p>Employees at all levels within AI research and development firms must operate within an ethos where “do no harm” is core to what they build. To be sure, tech workers are learning on the fly in this brave new world, and some must now retrofit solutions that ground human dignity, privacy, security, and the mitigation of bias into their products and services. It is critical. Not only will this reduce the incidence of various risks and harms, but it can contribute to further adoption and growth of their models as the signal to noise ratio of accurate, objective, and prosocial content creation improves.</p><p>Partnerships between academia and tech companies continue to hold promise to identify solutions to technological problems, and more initiatives focused on GenAI issues should be supported and promoted. Can researchers gain increased access to publicly available data mined via platform APIs to identify historical and current behavioral clues — as well as anonymized account data (date of creation, average frequency of engagement, relevant components of the social network graph) that readily point to synthetic users? Might they somehow obtain anonymized access not just of adult users but also minors (those 17 years of age and younger) given their comparatively greater vulnerability to the internalization and externalization of harm? And <a href="https://eber.uek.krakow.pl/index.php/eber/article/view/2113/852">what can be learned from the financial and pharmaceutical sectors</a> when it comes to government involvement and regulation to prevent ethical violations, biases and discriminatory practices, economic disparities, and other outcomes of misuse with GenAI? For instance, can risk profiles be established for all AI applications with baselines for rigor of assessment, mitigation of weaponization and exploitation, and processes for recovery? Those with the highest scores would likely gain the most market share, and keeping those scores would motivate quality control and constant refinement.</p><blockquote>Finally, we cannot keep moving ahead at breakneck speed without carefully designed regulatory frameworks for GenAI that establish standards and legal parameters and that set in place sanctions for those entities that transgress.</blockquote><p>This includes clearly describing and prohibiting (and designing prevention mechanisms for) edge cases where victimization will likely result. Moreover, proper governance requires detailed protocols for <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-government-should-regulate-ai/">audits, licensing, international collaboration, and non-negotiable safety practices</a> for public LLMs. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/">The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights</a> from the US Office of Science and Technology Policy is a good start with great macro-level intentions, but it reads more like a strong suggestion rather than a directive with applied specificity. With regard to data privacy and security in general, the US has failed to keep pace with the comprehensive, forward thinking efforts of other countries. Urgency is needed so this does not happen yet again with GenAI, so that we can grow in confidence that its positives do measurably outweigh its negatives.</p><p>This essay is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary and transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence.

<p>DIF is honoured to host the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), one of China’s leading scientific research institutes, founded in 1957, as the founding member of the DIF China Special Interest Group (SIG).&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralized technologies are being actively developed in China, with more than 300 blockchain projects launched across the country in 2022, covering multiple industries and fields.</p><p>The Special Interest Group will be chaired by Xie Jiagui, Chief Engineer at CAICT’s Institute for Industrial Internet &amp; Internet of Things (pictured above), who is engaged in research and development of network identification, blockchain technology systems, and big data technology.</p><p>We asked Mr Xie and Chiye Sun, Global Partnership Manager &amp; Blockchain Researcher at CAICT about the organization’s Xinghuo Astron project, and their plans for the DIF China SIG.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the goals of the DIF China SIG is to promote and advocate for the adoption and implementation of DIF specifications and technologies in China. Why do you see this as an important outcome?&nbsp;</p><p>Identity verification is the foundation of the digital economy and innovation. By promoting and adopting DIF technologies and related W3C standards in China, it provides a more secure and decentralized identity verification method, which can provide a more reliable and efficient infrastructure for the digital economy and promote the development and innovation of the digital industry. DIF’s identity verification and data management tools can help China's digital industry provide more efficient and convenient public services, enhance digital capabilities and governance levels.</p><p>DIF technologies and W3C standards can also promote consistency in identity verification and data exchange between different systems, reduce adaptation costs, and improve system interoperability and efficiency.</p><p>Finally, implementing these technologies and standards can help protect users' personal privacy, enhance data security and credibility, reduce reliance on centralized identity providers through decentralized authentication and authorization mechanisms, and enhance users' control over their identity and personal data.</p><p>CAICT’s customers and partners include chipmakers, device vendors, operators and system suppliers. Do you envisage organizations such as these participating in the China SIG?&nbsp;</p><p>It is hard to say for certain who will participate in the SIG. We think DID-related and blockchain-related Chinese enterprises would love to join this SIG. We can also ask universities, research institutes and other government-related institutions to join. We will also promote the DIF China SIG in different Chinese Web3 communities, like Alliance for Blockchain Industry (ABI), which contains more than 600 members, Z-Park and DID Alliance (DIDA).</p><p>We are also very much looking forward to hosting international level participants, learning from each other, communicating together, and hope to generate technical ideas, business pilots and governance cooperation.</p><p>It sounds as though the W3C DID (Decentralized Identifier) standard is core to your research and development work in the areas of industrial internet and blockchain. For example, the Xinghuo Astron project, a native DID network around the world built on the Xinghuo Blockchain Infrastructure &amp; Facility (Xinghuo BIF), aims to provide blockchain networks with identifier services, realizing interconnectivity across regions and industries. Why did you choose the W3C DID standard for Xinghuo?</p><p>We registered Xinghuo’s own DID method called BID(did:bid), which follows W3C DID standards. Regarding the technical standard for identifiers, we think it is better to follow a global standard format for interoperability and collaboration globally. DID is a new type of identifier that is user generated, without the need for a centralized entity, permanent, cryptographically verified and universally resolvable. It is in line with the evolution trend of cyberspace towards self sovereignty management.</p><p>Use cases for Xinghuo Astron include verifying certificates of origin in cross border trade between China and Malaysia and enabling traceability of carbon emissions data for manufacturers exporting to the EU. How do you envisage the DIF China SIG advancing international collaboration and adoption around these and other use cases?&nbsp;</p><p>One of our goals for the DIF China SIG is to promote and advocate for the adoption and implementation of DIF standards and technologies in China. Apart from that, we would like to construct a platform that provides communication and cooperation opportunities between China and other countries.</p><p>Planned activities for the SIG include organizing conferences and events, demonstrating W3C / DIF technical standards, lectures, training sessions and promoting projects such as Xinghuo Astron project as well as DIF projects. This sounds like an ambitious agenda! Do you plan to promote the SIG and its activities to an international audience? What language(s) will be used during SIG meetings?&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, we would like to promote the DIF China SIG to an international audience. CAICT also involves related work in G20, APEC, Belt and Road Initiative and other international cooperation mechanisms. We could try to introduce DIF and DIF China SIG to these mechanisms when appropriate.</p><p>Regarding language, routine meetings and activities will use Mandarin if no English speaking participant comes to join, or we could translate some bullet points for them. When it comes to some international level discussion and cooperation, we can switch to English.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Cinq mois après son inauguration le 6 juin 2023, le campus unlimitrust de SICPA rejoint les sept technopôles du canton de Vaud, sous l’égide d’Innovaud. Le campus unlimitrust a pour vocation d’accélérer la création de technologies et de solutions contribuant à l’émergence d’une véritable économie de la confiance à l’échelle mondiale. Le 8 novembre, une célébration a eu lieu en présence d’Isabelle Moret, conseillère d’Etat du Département de l’économie, de l’innovation, de l’emploi et du patrimoine du canton de Vaud.</p>
Le 8 novembre 2023, unlimitrust campus a officiellement rejoint les 7 autres technopoles vaudois! A cette occasion, le campus unlimitrust a eu l’honneur de recevoir la conseillère d’Etat, Mme Moret, cheffe du DEIEP.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Le campus unlimitrust s’inscrit dans une volonté de créer un monde plus sûr et plus fiable en facilitant l’émergence de concepts et de projets innovants qui répondent aux nouveaux défis de notre société, grâce aux technologies de la confiance. Pour cela, il encourage les collaborations entre des entreprises expertes du domaine, mais aussi des start-ups, des chercheurs et des institutions académiques telles que l’EPFL.</p>
<p>Adjacent au siège historique de SICPA à Prilly, le campus unlimitrust offre une infrastructure de 30’000 mètres carrés constitués d’espaces collaboratifs, de bureaux, de laboratoires et de services communs. Animé par l’Economy of Trust Foundation, une initiative de SICPA visant à promouvoir le concept d’économie de la confiance, le campus rassemble une communauté internationale d’entreprises et d’institutions publiques et privées de toutes tailles. Par exemple, les entreprises Approach Cyber, Visium et Cyberion, intervenant dans les domaines de la cybersécurité et de l’intelligence artificielle. L’objectif est de stimuler l’innovation dans les domaines numériques et physiques afin de renforcer la souveraineté des institutions et la confiance des citoyens dans leurs interactions entre eux et des entités privées ou publiques, là où la confiance est primordiale.</p>
<p>« SICPA est née il y a bientôt 100 ans ici, dans le canton de Vaud. Je me réjouis que les solutions innovantes qui y naissent, notamment dans le domaine de la confiance, et les valeurs d’excellence auxquelles nous sommes attachés, trouvent dans ce campus un écrin qui permet de les valoriser et de les porter au-delà de nos frontières, » explique Philippe Amon, Président et Administrateur délégué de SICPA.</p>
<p>Le canton de Vaud par le biais du Service de la promotion de l’économie et de l’innovation (SPEI), Innovaud, ainsi que de la Fondation EPFL Innovation Park (EIP), jouent un rôle de premier plan dans le domaine de l’innovation en Suisse et à l’échelle mondiale. Ils sont déjà activement impliqués dans la dynamique générale du campus unlimitrust. Plusieurs start-ups ont déjà rejoint le campus, et certaines d’entre elles sont accueillies au cœur du Trust Village, une structure d’incubation soutenue par les autorités cantonales et SICPA, opérée par l’EPFL Innovation Park (EIP) et gérée par la Trust Valley.</p>
Unlimitrust campus devient le 8ème technopôle du canton de Vaud et d’Innovaud. Célébration du 8 novembre 2023 en présence de M. Gaudin, Mme Moret et M. Barbey.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>De ce fait, Innovaud se félicite d’accueillir le campus unlimitrust au sein de la famille des technopôles vaudois, qui en compte désormais huit avec l’Agropôle, les ateliers de Renens, le Biopôle, l’EPFL Innovation Park, swiss aeropole, le Technopôle de Sainte-Croix et Y-PARC. « Chacun des technopôles œuvre dans un domaine technologique d’une importance fondamentale pour le tissu économique vaudois et l’attractivité du canton à l’échelle internationale. Le campus unlimitrust renforce l’écosystème d’innovation de notre région dans le domaine de la sécurité et de la confiance », explique Patrick Barbey, directeur d’Innovaud.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lineage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Data provenance</a>, typically used within the broader context of data lineage, refers to the source or first occurrence of a given piece of data. As a concept, data provenance (together with data lineage) is positioned to provide validity and encourage confidence related to the <a href="https://www.nnlm.gov/guides/data-glossary/data-provenance?ref=blog.ceramic.network#:~:text=Definition,to%20where%20it%20is%20presently">origin of data</a>, whether or not data has mutated since its creation, and who the original publisher is, among other important details. </p><p>From tracking the origin of scientific studies to big banks complying with financial regulations, data provenance plays an integral role in supporting the authenticity and integrity of data.</p> Databases and Data Provenance <p>When it comes to databases, you can start to imagine how critical data provenance is when organizing and tracking files in a data warehouse or citing references from within a curated database. For consumer applications (take social media platforms such as Twitter, for example) that build entire advertising business models around the engagement derived from user-generated content, the claim of unaltered authorship (apart from account hacks) of a given Tweet is a guarantee made by the platform to its users and investors—trust cannot be built without it.</p><p>With the implications of data provenance in mind, organizations that rely on centrally controlled data stores within the context of consumer applications are constantly evolving security protocols and authentication measures to safeguard both their users and business from attacks that could result in data leaks, data alterations, data wipes, and more. However, so long as potential attack vectors and adequate user authentication are accounted for, these organizations benefit from inherent assurances related to the authenticity of incoming writes and mutations—after all, their servers are the agents performing these edit actions.</p> Data Provenance in Peer-to-Peer Protocols <p>But what about peer-to-peer data protocols and the applications built on them? How do topics such as cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, user authentication, and data origin verifiability in decentralized software coincide with data provenance and data lineage?</p><p>This article is meant to provide an initial exploration of how and where these topics converge and build a specific understanding of the overlap between these ideas and the technical architecture, challenges, qualities, and general functionality of ComposeDB on Ceramic. ComposeDB, built on Ceramic, is a decentralized graph database that uses GraphQL to offer developers a familiar interface for interacting with data stored on Ceramic.</p><p>The following article sections will set out to help accomplish the goals outlined above.</p> Smart Contract-Supported Blockchains <p>Blockchains that contain qualities analogous to a distributed state machine (such as those compatible with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>) operate based on a specific set of rules that determine how the machine state changes from block to block. In viewing these systems as traversable open ledgers of data, accounts (both smart contract accounts and those that are externally owned) generate histories of transactions such as token transfers and smart contract interactions, all of which are publicly consumable without the need for permission.</p><p>What does this mean in the context of data provenance? Given the viability of public-key infrastructure, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">externally owned accounts</a> prevent bad actors from broadcasting fake transactions because the sender’s identity (public access) is publicly available to verify. When it comes to the transactions themselves (both account-to-account and account-to-contract), the resulting data that’s publicly stored (once processed) includes information about both who acted, as well as their signature.</p><p>Transaction verifiability, in this context, relies on a block finalization process that requires validator nodes to consume multiple transactions, verify them, and include them in a block<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">.</a> Given the deterministic nature of transactions, participating nodes can correctly compute the state for themselves, therefore eventually reaching a consistent state about the transactions.</p><p>While there are plenty of nuances and levels of depth we could explore related to the architecture of these systems, the following are the most relevant features related to data provenance:</p>  The verifiable origin of each transaction represents the data we care about related to provenance  Transactions are performed by externally owned accounts and contract accounts, both of which attach information about the transaction itself and who initiated it  Externally owned accounts rely on cryptographic key pairs   ComposeDB vs. Smart Contract-Supported Blockchains <p>There is plenty to talk about when comparing ComposeDB (and the Ceramic Network more broadly) to chains like Ethereum; however, for this post, we’ll focus on how these qualities relate to data provenance.</p><p>Controlling Accounts</p><p>Ceramic uses the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/accounts/decentralized-identifiers?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Decentralized Identifier</a> standard for user accounts (DID PKH and Key DID are supported in production). Similar to blockchains, they require no centralized party or registry. Additionally, both PKH DIDs and Key DIDs ultimately rely on public key infrastructure (PKH DIDs enable blockchain accounts to sign, authorize, and authenticate transactions, while Key DIDs expand cryptographic public keys into a DID document).</p><p>Sign in With Ethereum (SIWE)</p><p>Like chains such as Ethereum, Ceramic supports authenticated <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-client/user-sessions?ref=blog.ceramic.network">user sessions</a> with SIWE. The user experience then diverges slightly when it comes to signing transactions (outlined below).</p><p>Signing Transactions</p><p>While externally-owned accounts must manually sign individual transactions on chains like Ethereum (both when interacting with a smart contract or sending direct transfers), data in Ceramic (or <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/streams-index?ref=blog.ceramic.network">streams</a>) are written by authenticated accounts during a timebound session, offering a familiar, Web2-like experience. The root account (your blockchain wallet if using Ceramic’s SIWE capability, for example) generates a temporary child account for each application environment with tightly-scoped permissions, which then persists for a short period in the user’s browser. For developers familiar with using JWTs in Node.js to authenticate users, this flow should sound familiar.</p><p>This capability is ideal for a protocol meant to support mutable data with verifiable origin, thus allowing for multiple writes to happen over a cryptographically authorized period (and with a signature attached to each event that can be validated) without impeding the user’s experience by requiring manual signs for each write.</p><p>Consensus</p><p>Ceramic relies on event streams that offer a limited consensus model that makes it possible for a given stream to allow <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/consensus?ref=blog.ceramic.network">multiple parallel histories</a> while ensuring any two parties consuming the same events for a stream will arrive at the same state. What this means is that all streams and their corresponding tips (latest events within their event logs) are not known by all participants at any given point in time.</p><p>However, a mechanism known as the Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS) is responsible for batching transactions across the network into a Merkle tree and regularly publishing its root in a single transaction to Ethereum. Therefore, Ceramic does offer a consensus on the global ordering of Ceramic transactions.</p><p>Immutability</p><p>Just as smart contracts provide a deterministic structure that dictates how users can interact with them (while guaranteeing they will not change once deployed), <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/core-concepts?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB schemas</a> are also immutable, offering guarantees around the types of data a given model can store. When users write data using these definitions, each resulting model instance document can forever only be altered by accounts that created it (or grant limited permission to another account to do so), and can only make changes that conform to the schema’s definition.</p><p>Finally, every stream is comprised of an event log of one or more commits, thus making it easy for developers to extract not only the provenance of the stream’s data, based on the cryptographic signature of the account that created it, but also the stream’s data lineage by traversing through the commit history to observe how the data mutated over time.</p><p>Publicly Verifiable</p><p>Similar to networks like Ethereum, the Ceramic Network is public by default, allowing any participating nodes to read any data on any stream. While the values of the data may be plaintext or encrypted, contingent on the objectives of the applications using them, anyone can verify the cryptographic signatures that accompany the individual event logs (explained above).</p> Centralized Databases <p>The broad assumption I’ll line up for this comparison is that a traditional “Web2” platform uses a sandboxed database to store, retrieve, and write data on behalf of its users. Apart from the intricate architecture strategies used to accomplish this at scale with high performance, most of these systems rely on the assurances that their servers alone have sole authority to perform writes. Individual user accounts can be hacked into via brute force or socially engineered attacks, but as long as the application’s servers are not compromised, the data integrity remains intact (though requiring participants to trust a single point of failure).</p> ComposeDB vs. Centralized Databases <p>If this article set out to compare ComposeDB to traditional databases in the context of functionality and performance, we’d likely discuss a higher degree of similarities rather than differences; however, when comparing ComposeDB to the paradigm of a “traditional” database setup, in the context of data provenance, we find that the inverse holds true based on much of what was discussed in the previous section.</p><p>Embedded Cryptographic Proof</p><p>As previously discussed, all valid events in Ceramic include a required DAGJWS signature derived from the stream’s controlling account. While it’s possible (though logically unwise) that an application using a centralized database could fabricate data related to the accounts of its users, event streams in Ceramic are at all times controlled by the account that created the stream. Even if a Ceramic account accidentally delegates temporary write access to a malicious application that then authors inaccurate data on the controller’s behalf, the controlling account never loses admin access and can revert or overwrite those changes.</p><p>Public Verifiability</p><p>Unlike Ceramic, the origin of data (along with most accompanying information) is not accessible by design when using a centralized database, at least not in a permissionless way. The integrity of the data within a “traditional” database must therefore be assumed based on other factors requiring trust between the application’s users and the business itself. This architecture is what enables many of the business models these applications use that ultimately have free reign over how they leverage or sell user data.</p><p>Conversely, business models like advertising can be (and are currently being) built on Ceramic data, which flips this paradigm on its head. Individual users have the option to encrypt data they write to the network and have an array of tools at their disposal to enable programmatic or selective read access based on conditions they define. Businesses that want to access this data can therefore work directly with the users themselves to define the conditions under which their data can be accessed, putting the sovereignty of that data into individual users’ hands.</p><p>Timestamping and Anchoring</p><p>While in a private, sandboxed database, development teams can implement a variety of methods to timestamp entries, those teams don’t have to worry about trusting other data providers in a public network to be competent and non-malicious. Conversely, data in Ceramic leverages the <a href="https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-168?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IPLD Timestamp Proof</a> specification which involves frequent publishing of the root of a Merkle tree to the blockchain with the sets of IPLD content identifiers as the tree’s leaves which represent Ceramic data. While the underlying data structure (event log) of each stream will preserve the ordering of its events with specific events pointing to the prior one in the stream, the anchoring process allows developers to use event timestamping in a decentralized, trustless way.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p><a href="https://composedb.js.org/docs/0.5.x/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Verifiable credentials</a> under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">W3C</a> definition unlock the ability for verifiable claims to be issued across a virtually limitless set of contexts, with the guarantee that they can later be universally verified in a cryptographically secure way. This standard relies on several key features (below are only a few of them):</p>  Verifiable Data Registry: A publicly available repository of the verifiable credential schemas one might choose to create instances of  Decentralized Identifiers: Verifiable credentials rely on DIDs to both identify the subject of a claim, as well as the cryptographic proof created by the issuer  Core Data Model: These credentials follow a standard data model that ensures that the credential’s body (made up of one or more claims about a given entity) is inherently tamper-evident, given the fact that the issuer generates a cryptographic proof that guarantees both the values of the claims themselves and the issuer’s identity  <p>For example, an online education platform may choose to make multiple claims about a student’s performance and degree of completion related to a specific student and a specific course they are taking, all of which could be wrapped up into one verifiable credential. While multiple proof formats could be derived (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ethereum-eip712-signature-2021-spec/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">EIP712 Signature</a> vs. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-jose-cose/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">JWTs</a>), the provenance of the credential is explicit.</p><p>However, unlike blockchains and databases, verifiable credentials are not storage networks themselves and therefore can be saved and later retrieved for verification purposes in a wide variety of ways.</p> ComposeDB vs. Verifiable Credentials (and other claim formats) <p>I mentioned earlier that schema definitions (once deployed to the Ceramic network) offer immutable and publicly available data formats that enforce constraints for all subsequent instances. For example, anyone using ComposeDB can deploy a model definition to assert an individual’s course completion and progress, and similarly, any participants can create document instances within that model’s family. Given the cryptographic signatures and immutable model instance controller identity (that’s automatically attached to each Ceramic stream commit discussed above), you can start to see how the qualities verifiable credentials are set out to provide, like tamper-evident claims and credential provenance, are inherent to ComposeDB.</p><p>Tamper-Proof</p><p>Like a verifiable credential, each commit within a given Ceramic stream is immutable once broadcasted to the network. Within the context of a model instance document within ComposeDB, while the values within the document are designed to be mutated over time, each commit is publicly readable, tamper-evident, and cryptographically signed.</p><p>Inherent Origin</p><p>We’ve discussed this extensively above—each event provides publicly-verifiable guarantees about the identity of the controlling account.</p><p>Publicly Available</p><p>Unlike verifiable credentials that offer just a standard, ComposeDB allows developers to both define claim standards (using schema definitions), as well as public availability for those instances to be read and confirmed by other network participants. ComposeDB is therefore also a public schema registry in itself.</p> Trustworthiness <p>In addition to the specific comparisons to other data storage options and verifiable claim standards, what qualities does ComposeDB offer that enable anyone to audit, verify, and prove the origin of data it contains? While parts of this section may be slightly redundant with the first half of this article, we’ll take this opportunity to tie these concepts together in a more general sense.</p> Auditable, Verifiable, and Provable <p>For trust to be equitably built in a peer-to-peer network, the barrier to entry to be able to run audits must be sufficiently low, concerning both cost and complexity. This holds especially true when auditing and validating the origin of data within the network. Here are a few considerations and trade-offs related to ComposeDB’s auditability.</p><p>No Cost Barrier With Open Access to Audit</p><p>Developers building applications on ComposeDB do not need to worry about cost-per-transaction fees related to the read/write activity their users perform. They will, however, need to architect an adequate production node configuration (that should be built around the volume a given application currently has and how it expects to grow over time), which will have separate network-agnostic costs.</p><p>This also holds for auditors (or new applications who want to audit data on Ceramic before building applications on that data). Any actor can spin up a node without express network permissions, discover streams representing data relevant to their business goals, and begin to index and read them. Whether an organization chooses to build on ComposeDB or directly on its underlying network (Ceramic), as long as developers understand the architecture of <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/protocol/streams/event-log/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">event logs</a> (and specifically how to extract information like cryptographic signatures and controlling accounts), they will have fully transparent insight into the provenance of a given Ceramic dataset.</p><p>Trade-Off: Stream Discoverability</p><p>While fantastic interfaces, such as <a href="https://scan.s3.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">s3.xyz</a>, have been built to improve data and model discoverability within the Ceramic Network, one challenge Ceramic faces as it continues to grow is how to further enable developers to discover (and build on) existing data. More specifically, while it’s easy to explain to developers the hypothetical benefits of data composability and user ownership in the context of an open data network (such as the data provenance-related qualities we’ve discussed in this post), showing it in action is a more difficult feat.</p> Structured <p>The Ceramic Network also exists in an existing, non-conforming territory that does not fit neatly into the on- or off-chain realm. Just as the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) mentions on its <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/core--concepts/onchain-vs-offchain?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Onchain vs. Offchain</a> page, a “verifiable data ledger” category of decentralized storage infrastructure is becoming increasingly appealing to development teams who want to gain the benefits of both credible decentralization and maximum performance, especially when dealing with data that’s meant to mutate over time.</p><p>As we discussed above, here’s a refresher on key insights into ComposeDB’s structure, and how these impact the provenance of its data.</p><p>Ceramic Event Logs</p><p>Ceramic relies on a core data structure called an <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/protocol/streams/event-log/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">event log</a>, which combines cryptographic proofs (to ensure immutability and enable authentication via DID methods) and <a href="https://ipld.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IPLD</a> for hash-linked data. All events on the network rely on this underlying data structure, so whether developers are building directly on Ceramic or using ComposeDB, teams always have access to the self-certifying log that they can verify, audit, and use to validate provenance.</p><p>ComposeDB Schema Immutability</p><p>Developers building on ComposeDB also benefit from the assurances that schema definitions provide, based on the fact that they cannot be altered once deployed. While this may be an issue for some teams who might need regular schema evolution, other teams leverage this quality as a means to ensure constant structure around the data they build on. This feature therefore provides a benefit to teams who care strongly about both data provenance and lineage - more specifically, the origin (provenance) can be derived from the underlying data structure, while the history of changes (lineage) must conform to the immutable schema definition, and is always available when accessing the commit history.</p><p>A Decentralized Data Ledger</p><p>Finally, <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/nodes?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic nodes</a> support the data on Ceramic and the protocol—providing applications access to the network. For <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/running-in-the-cloud?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB nodes</a>, this configuration includes an IPFS service to enable access to the underlying IPLD blocks for event streams, a Ceramic component to enable HTTP API access and networking (among other purposes), and PostgreSQL (for indexing model instances in SQL and providing a read engine). All Ceramic events are regularly rolled into a Merkle tree and the root is published to the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Within the context of data provenance, teams who wish to traverse these data artifacts back to their sources can use various tools to publicly observe these components in action (for example, the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x231055a0852d67c7107ad0d0dfeab60278fe6adc?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic Anchor Service on Etherscan</a>), but must be familiar with Ceramic’s distributed architecture to understand what to look for and how these reveal the origins of data.</p><p>Trade-Off: Complexity</p><p>There’s no question that the distributed nature of the Ceramic Network can be complex to comprehend, at least at first. This is a common problem within P2P solutions that uphold user-data sovereignty and rely on consensus mechanisms, especially when optimizing for performance.</p><p>Trade-Off: Late Publishing Risks</p><p>As described on the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/streams/consensus?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Consensus</a> page in the Ceramic docs, all streams and their potential tips are not universally knowable in the form of a global state that’s available to all participants at any point in time. This setup does allow for individual participants to intentionally (or accidentally) withhold some events while publishing others, otherwise known as engaging in ‘selective publishing’. If you read into the specifics and the hypothetical scenario outlined in the docs, you’ll quickly learn that this type of late publishing attack is illogical in practice since streams can only have one controlling user, so that user would need to somehow be incentivized to attack their data.</p><p>What does this have to do with data provenance? While the origin of Ceramic streams (even in the hypothetical situation of a stream with two divergent and conflicting updates) is at all times publicly verifiable, the potential for this type of attack has more to do with the validity of that stream’s data lineage (which is more concerned with tracking the history of data over time).</p> Portable <p>Finally, another important notion to consider in the context of data provenance and P2P software is replication and sharing. Developers looking to build on this class of data network should not only be concerned with how to verify and extract the origin of data from the protocol but also need assurances that the data they care about will be available in the first place.</p><p>ComposeDB presumes that developers will want options around the replication and composability of the data streams they will build on.</p><p>Node Sync</p><p>You’ll see on the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/guides/composedb-server/server-configurations?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Server Configurations</a> page that there’s an option to deploy a ComposeDB node with historical sync turned on. When configured to the ‘off’ position, a given node can still write data to a model definition that already exists in the network, but the node will simply only index model instance documents written by that node. Conversely, when toggled ‘on’, this setting will sync data from other nodes and write data to a canonical model definition (or many). The latter enables the ‘composability’ factor that development teams can benefit from—this is the mechanism that allows teams to build applications on shared, user-controlled data.</p><p>Recon (Ceramic Improvement Proposal)</p><p>There is an active improvement proposal underway, called <a href="https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-124?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Recon</a>, to improve the efficiency of the network. In short, development related to this proposal aims to streamline the underlying process by which nodes sync data, offering benefits such as significantly lifting the load off of nodes that are uninterested in a given stream set.</p><p>Trade-Off: Data Availability Considerations</p><p>Of course, the question of data portability and replication necessitates conversation around the persistence and availability of information developers care about. In Ceramic terms, developers can provide instructions to their node to explicitly host commits for a specific stream (called pinning), improving resiliency against data loss. However, developers should know that if only one IPFS node is pinning a given stream and it disappears or gets corrupted, the data within that stream will be lost. Additionally, if only one node is responsible for pinning a stream and it goes offline, that stream won’t be available for other nodes to consume (which is why it’s best practice to have multiple IPFS nodes running in different environments pinning the same streams).</p>

<p>New guidelines aim to accelerate multi-factor authentication&nbsp;deployment and adoption with FIDO security keys</p>



<p>Identiverse, Denver, CO June 22, 2022 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance</a> today released new user experience (UX) guidelines to help accelerate deployment and adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) with FIDO security keys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Security Key UX Guidelines are available at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/ux-guidelines/">https://fidoalliance.org/ux-guidelines/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO security keys – small, portable high-security devices that connect to a phone or computer via USB, Bluetooth or NFC – are considered by many to be the “gold standard” for multi-factor authentication. Simply touching this device during sign-in protects accounts from a targeted attack 100% of the time. Many services, including Twitter and Facebook, now offer the option to enable FIDO security keys for mobile and desktop access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of the FIDO Security Key UX Guidelines is to help online service providers design a better, more consistent user experience for the consumer security key audience and ultimately maximize adoption. The document provides UX guidelines for all major steps of a consumer’s journey with FIDO security keys: awareness; consideration; enrollment; management; and authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Having reached widespread support for FIDO Authentication across the web, the FIDO Alliance is increasingly focused on ways to grow and ultimately reach mass adoption. One of our primary areas of focus towards this objective is making FIDO more usable and accessible,”&nbsp; said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “We’ve established a FIDO UX Task Force consisting of UX experts from around the globe to conduct research and provide guidance on how to optimize user journeys as users enroll in, and subsequently sign in, with FIDO in various use cases. Today’s guidelines follow our first set of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/ux-guidelines/desktop-authenticator-ux-guidelines/">UX guidelines focused on the desktop authenticator user experience</a>, with more to follow. I strongly encourage service providers to leverage these best practices when rolling out FIDO Authentication.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guidelines were created by the FIDO Alliance UX Task Force in partnership with usability research firm Blink UX. They conducted formal research of FIDO user journeys and actively engaged with FIDO Alliance stakeholders to establish these FIDO security key UX best practices. The guidelines were developed following multiple sessions of moderated and unmoderated consumer research conducted by Blink UX, in collaboration with FIDO UX Task Force members.</p>



<p>Learn more about the FIDO Security Key UX Guidelines at Identiverse 2022</p>



<p>Attending Identiverse? Learn more about the guidelines today, June 22, during the session <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv2022/session/841460/">“Optimizing UX for FIDO Security Keys”</a> at 12:00 pm MDT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the FIDO UX Task Force</p>



<p>The FIDO UX Task Force for this project was established to develop best UX practices for implementing MFA with FIDO security keys for consumer web-based sites on desktops/laptops across platforms. Member volunteers for this project included product and design leaders from Feitian, Google, IBM, Idemia, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Meta, Microsoft, NIST, OneSpan North America, Onfido, Trusona, Trustkey, Visa, VMware, and Yubico.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. By harnessing the collective expertise of hundreds of leading technology, consumer services and government organizations, the FIDO Alliance is enabling simpler and stronger online experiences and more secure online identities and devices. The FIDO Alliance creates and publishes specifications, executes rigorous certification programs and educates consumers in order to build confidence and trust in FIDO Certified products and services.</p>

<p>In a startling revelation, an anonymous hacker has claimed to have accessed the biometric digital ID numbers and other sensitive personal information of approximately 815 million Indian citizens. This breach is reported to be the largest in the history of India’s Aadhaar, the world’s most extensive biometric digital ID system. The Aadhaar system, which has been a cornerstone of India’s digital infrastructure, is used for everything from tax filings to accessing social services. The implications of such a breach are profound, touching on issues of privacy, security, and trust in digital systems.</p>



<p>The Magnitude of the Breach</p>



<p>Aadhaar, managed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), has been both lauded for its inclusivity and criticized for potential privacy infringements. It uses biometric data such as fingerprints and iris scans, along with demographic information, to create a unique identity number for each citizen. With the scale of the reported breach, the personal data of more than half the population of India could be at risk. This could lead to widespread identity theft, unauthorized access to bank accounts, and fraud on an unprecedented scale.</p>



<p>The compromised data reportedly includes not just names and ID numbers, but also linked services and biometric data, exponentially magnifying the potential for misuse. This incident raises serious concerns about centralized databases and the mechanisms in place to protect such sensitive information.</p>



<p>Why This Could Not Happen with SSI</p>



<p>In the wake of this massive data breach, it’s crucial to understand why such an event would be highly unlikely with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems. SSI is a user-centric model that enables individuals to own, control, and present their identity without relying on any centralized authority. It represents a transformative approach to personal data management and security in the digital era. Here’s why SSI systems offer a robust defense against the type of breach Aadhaar experienced:</p>



 
 Decentralization: Unlike Aadhaar, which relies on a centralized database, SSI is inherently decentralized. Personal data is stored on users’ devices or on distributed ledgers, ensuring that a single breach does not expose the information of millions. 



 User Control and Consent: SSI gives individuals control over their data. They consent to share specific information with entities they trust and for specified purposes. This reduces the amount of data that can be exposed in any interaction. 



 Minimal Disclosure: SSI is built on the principle of minimal disclosure, meaning that users only need to share the information that is absolutely necessary. For instance, a user can prove their age without revealing their birth date. 



 No Single Point of Failure: Because SSI does not depend on a central repository of data, it lacks a single point of failure. This makes large-scale breaches implausible as each individual’s data is siloed and protected through robust encryption. 



 Verifiable Credentials: SSI relies on cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology, where credentials can be verified without revealing any underlying personal data. Even if a data request is intercepted, the information remains secure. 



 Recovery and Revocation: In the SSI framework, users can recover their identities through independently established recovery networks, and they can revoke compromised credentials without affecting other aspects of their digital identity. 
 



<p>Looking Ahead: The Role of SSI in Safeguarding Identity</p>



<p>The alleged Aadhaar breach is a stark reminder of the risks associated with centralized identity management systems. It underscores the necessity of adopting more secure, privacy-preserving identity solutions like SSI. Nations and organizations around the world are exploring SSI as a viable alternative that empowers citizens while bolstering security.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while the Aadhaar breach exposes the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized identity systems, it also serves as a critical lesson for the global community. It highlights the urgency of transitioning to more resilient, decentralized identity models like SSI, where the principles of user control, privacy, and security are not just ideals, but foundational features. As digital identities become more pervasive in our daily lives, adopting SSI could well be the paradigm shift needed to safeguard the personal data of individuals around the globe.</p>

<p>At the start of the Covid pandemic, a mutual aid group contacted us to ask for support to better understand student needs during the lockdown period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, they hoped to identify where, geographically, students were likely facing significant challenges (as determined by indicators including socioeconomic status, internet connectivity, and local COVID-19 infection rates). To achieve this objective, the team compiled publicly available health, census, and geospatial data using geographic information system (GIS) software. This analysis then enabled them to map out regions where students were most likely to require assistance in the form of food or internet vouchers.</p>



 Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to gather, manage, analyse and visualise spatial and geographic data&nbsp; 



<p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing spatial and geographic data. Essentially, GIS integrates multiple types of data, from geographical and topological data to statistical and qualitative information, into a unified system that allows for sophisticated spatial analysis and visualization.</p>



<p>While traditional data sets may contain location information (“attributes”) like zip codes or city names, GIS takes this a step further by including attributes about geographic areas. &nbsp;For example, a common use involves mapping the amount of flooding in a given location. These separate bits of&nbsp; information can then be layered on top of each other for displaying on maps or 3D models. The complexity of this data requires specialized data formats that can hold all the necessary layers, as well as software for collection, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.</p>



 What GIS can be used for in the social- and environmental-justice sectors 



<p>Earlier GIS systems were primarily used by specialized institutions because they required expensive, high-end hardware and software. However, advances in technology have made GIS more affordable and accessible, enabling it to be run even on consumer-grade computers and smartphones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The creation of cloud-based GIS solutions has also reduced the need for in-house servers and storage, thereby reducing the potential cost and complexity of deploying GIS technology. Additionally, drones and IoT sensors have made remote data collection more do-able at a lower budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those in the social and environmental justice sectors, this has meant increased access to technologies that can help them achieve their mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Land rights organisation Cadasta, for example, notes that GIS tools can “<a href="https://cadasta.org/sustainablefuture/">help communities gather digital data required for legal land claims</a> while also enabling real-time mapping and monitoring of critical assets such as biodiversity, forest cover, natural resources, and human settlements” Another organisation, Cultural Survival, has used <a href="https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/gis-and-long-range-economic-planning-indigenous">field-based participatory mapping techniques</a> combined with satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and GIS technology in order to explore economic development strategies for indigenous peoples and their territories in the Amazon Basin.&nbsp;</p>



 Potential risks to consider when using GIS technology to map and analyse information about vulnerable populations&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>With the democratization of these technologies also comes increased data collection on vulnerable populations – which means that organisations using or considering using this technology should do so only if they have considered the the risks involved, and taken steps to mitigate these risks (in some cases, a decision might need to be made to not use the technology at all). The list below is offered as a guide to some of the key areas to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Privacy and Security: One of the most immediate concerns around using GIS is the potential for the exposure of sensitive personal information. The geolocation capabilities in GIS data can expose details about individuals’ whereabouts and movements. Without rigorous security protocols, this data could be exposed, putting at risk those who may be already vulnerable. 



 Ethical Considerations: GIS technologies also raise ethical questions, particularly regarding the potential for misuse of information. Real-time tracking capabilities can limit personal privacy and freedom, especially when used without consent or adequate transparency. Additionally, if the data ends up in the wrong hands, information intended to be used to protect a resource <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/conservation-technology-9780198850243?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">can be used by poachers to easily locate it</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Discrimination: Another risk lies in the potential for GIS data to perpetuate or even exacerbate existing inequities. If GIS data collection methodologies or interpretation algorithms reflect societal biases, the technology can inadvertently contribute to systemic discrimination.&nbsp; 



 Digital Divide: While GIS technologies are becoming increasingly accessible, there is still a considerable gap in who has the resources and knowledge to leverage these tools effectively. This digital divide means that communities lacking the requisite technological infrastructure or training may be further marginalised, thereby failing to benefit from the advantages that GIS technologies can offer. 



 Environmental Impact: Lastly, the widespread adoption and use of GIS technologies contribute to the environmental footprint of the digital landscape. The energy-intensive nature of data centres required to process and store voluminous GIS data is a growing concern in the age of climate change. 
 



 Should your organisation use GIS technology?&nbsp; 



<p>Affordable advanced mapping and real-time monitoring capabilities can empower organisations in the social- and climate-justice sectors to track and visualize trends and allocate resources efficiently. However, it’s important to remember that with more advanced data collection and practices comes increased risks, particularly for the privacy, security, and well-being of already vulnerable populations. Ethical questions around consent and potential misuse of data need to be surfaced early. It will be crucial for organisations to take the time at the inception of any project that uses geospatial data to carefully assess potential risks and develop strategies for their mitigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On October 26, we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/llamada-comunitaria-sostener-ecosistema-de-informacion-saludable/" title="">gathered online</a> with over 20 organisers, activists and journalists from 9 countries in Latin America. We were inspired to hear from speakers Nathaly Espitia (Internews) and Maria Juliana (Universidad Icesi, Cali. Colombia) from <a href="https://noisradio.co/" title="">Colectivo Noís Radio</a>, Júlia Rocha from <a href="https://artigo19.org/" title="">Artigo 19</a>, and Ramiro Alvarez Ugarte from <a href="https://observatoriolegislativocele.com/" title="">CELE</a>, as well as from participants in the call, who joined us in an open discussion about challenges we’re facing in the information ecosystem in the region and opportunities we see for action. In this blog post we’re sharing some of the key takeaways from our conversation.&nbsp;</p>



 A healthy information ecosystem is one where people are able to listen and talk to each other 



<p>Our conversation started with learnings from Maria Juliana and Nathaly Espitia from <a href="https://noisradio.co/" title="">Noís Radio</a>, a collective from Cali (Colombia) that has been working since 2009 on producing live radio programs using voices, music, live sounds and performative actions. They shared that they don’t see themselves as a “traditional” radio station, but rather as a “medio de conversación” (or conversation medium) that creates spaces for conversation and listening, not just one-sided sharing of information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Noís Radio, the key to a healthy information ecosystem is that people are able to listen and talk to each other. This approach was echoed by other participants in the call: for Ramiro Ugarte from CELE, it is key that we think about how to generate more dialogue and conversations, because building spaces where people can have dialogue and connect face-to-face is key to combating polarisation and achieving a healthier information ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Building trust is a slow-burning process (but it’s worth it!) 



<p>During the call, we talked about some of the factors that serve as a backdrop to our broken information system: the region is going through a period of heightened lack of trust in media and institutions, there is acute political polarisation in various countries, and citizens are dissatisfied with political systems and experiencing information overload.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To respond to this scenario, many participants spoke about the value of creating information initiatives that include processes designed to rebuild trust with people in our communities. For example, in their work, Noís Radio doesn’t approach communities with a fixed, previously defined project – instead, the collective invites people to join them in conversations and share what their needs are, then they work on establishing relationships of trust and “pass the microphone to people in their communities”. During the national strike in Colombia, in 2021, for example, Noís Radio was in Cali <a href="https://noisradio.co/pr-a-la-luna" title="">recording shows from “puntos de resistencia”</a> (resistance points) with social organisations, young people, artists, mothers and other protesters who trusted their microphones and shared their voices. (You can <a href="https://noisradio.co/pr-a-la-luna" title="">listen to the shows here</a>!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When talking about their experience, Nathaly and Maria Juliana shared that, though the trust building process can be slow, it has proven to be essential, because it gives you an important foundation when you need to organise during a moment of crisis. Having already built trust with the people in their communities over time and having meaningfully involved people in their work in the past meant that Noís Radio were able to mobilise quickly in a difficult political context, generating important conversations within their communities.&nbsp;</p>



 The value of local information initiatives and fostering a sense of community 



<p>The sense that community-led efforts are fundamental to a stronger information ecosystem in the region was echoed by Júlia Rocha, who leads the Access to Information and Transparency team at Artigo 19 in Brazil. In her perspective, “local solutions are the ones that work the most”. In a region where the notion of public interest information has been often shaped by corporate interests, as phrased by Júlia, investing in local, independent, community-led communications is indispensable. Since 2020, her organisation has been supporting the work of popular communication initiatives throughout the country with the campaign #CompartilheInformação, which has given grants to groups providing trustworthy information about <a href="https://artigo19.org/2020/07/08/quinto-e-ultimo-webinar-da-campanha-compartilheinformacao-compartilhesaude-debate-popularizacao-dos-saberes-durante-a-pandemia/" title="">health</a>, <a href="https://artigo19.org/2022/11/07/conheca-os-20-grupos-apoiados-pela-campanha-compartilheinformacao-compartilhedemocracia/" title="">democracy and elections</a> and, soon, the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brazilian journalism organisations <a href="https://www.agenciamural.org.br/" title="">Agência Mural</a> and <a href="https://enoisconteudo.com.br/" title="">Énois</a> (who also joined our call!) are also showing how valuable local initiatives can be for the information ecosystem. Seeing that people lack access to information at the local, city level, they argue that there needs to be more support to the “<a href="https://ssir.com.br/governo/a-urgencia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informacao" title="">development of local initiatives that contribute to reducing news deserts</a>”, which provides citizens with the information they need in order to “participate in public life from the territory where they live”. As <a href="https://ssir.com.br/governo/a-urgencia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informacao" title="">Izabela Moi and Nina Weingrill</a> put it: “quality local coverage creates and sustains the feeling of belonging to a community and opens spaces for action and citizen participation.“&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see this in the work of Noís Radio too, in their work to empower more independent voices in the information ecosystem. In our chat, Nathaly and Maria Juliana talked about the importance of creating initiatives that go beyond capital cities, as well as how crucial it is to support the work coming from indigenous communities, afro colombian communities and migrant communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the call, we also heard from <a href="https://baudoap.com/" title="">Agencia Baudó</a> in Colombia, who is doing “journalism that connects communities” by working with community storytellers that are not only providers of information, but also local leaders working in their communities for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/co/app/baudo-ap/id6460035443" title="">social transformation</a>. Another example shared is the work of <a href="https://www.mascomunidad.org.ar/" title="">+COMUNIDAD</a>, an argentinian “solutions journalism medium” that investigates, finds and tells stories of people and cities, solving their challenges and inspiring others to transform themselves.</p>



<p>Participants also talked about the importance of counterbalancing the lack of “official” data about certain topics, especially in regions that lack access to information about issues such as sexual and reproductive health and rights or the environment, with the production of community-driven data or initiatives that democratise access to information. To that end, we talked about initiatives like Artigo 19’s <a href="https://mapaabortolegal.org" title="">map made for Brazilian women to know where to access abortion care</a> in their states – information that had been previously unavailable.</p>



 Fighting harmful trends at a regional level and more support for&nbsp; sustained, long term alliances 



<p>We discussed some of the regional trends in information disorder and how civil society in the region is witnessing the same types of disinformation being shared in many countries. Research led by <a href="https://chequeado.com/" title="">Chequeado</a> (Argentina), <a href="https://www.lasillavacia.com/" title="">La Silla Vacía</a> (Colombia), <a href="https://lupa.uol.com.br/" title="">Lupa</a> (Brazil), <a href="https://www.agenciaocote.com/" title="">Ocote</a> (Guatemala) and <a href="https://ojo-publico.com/" title="">OjoPúblico</a> (Perú), for instance, has shown how <a href="https://chequeado.com/nota/desinformacion-de-genero-como-se-articulan-los-grupos-que-difunden-falsedades-sobre-el-tema-en-america-latina/" title="">groups are organising to spread falsehoods about gender-related issues in Latin America</a>. Recent investigative project <a href="https://www.elclip.org/mercenarios-digitales/" title="">Mercenarios Digitales</a>, led by a cross-border and collaborative media alliance, has gathered evidence on the impact of an international network of disinformation actors operating in the region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this context, participants shared that it is key to foster more multi-country spaces where civil society organisations, journalists and human rights defenders can work in an articulated manner to build a healthier information ecosystem. Similarly, participants also talked about how important it could be to have regional alliances that would allow them to foresee the types of disinformation and attacks that are emerging in the continent.</p>



 Join our next community call! 



<p>As we make our way through this multi-year project to contribute to a healthier information ecosystem, our team is in awe of the amazing work being done by journalists, communicators, civil society, community organisers and activists who are figuring out creative ways to make sure valuable information is reaching the people in their communities.</p>



<p>Our research for this project is just getting started and we’re looking forward to continuing working with many of you as we build this work. Our next community call is happening on November 23, at 9am Ciudad de México, 10am Bogotá, 12pm São Paulo. (For this call, the main language of communication will be Spanish!)</p>

<p>No dia 26 de outubro, nos <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/llamada-comunitaria-sostener-ecosistema-de-informacion-saludable/" title="">reunimos on-line</a> com mais de 20 representantes de organizações, ativistas e jornalistas de 9 países da América Latina. Nos inspiramos ao ouvir as palestrantes Nathaly Espitia e Maria Juliana, do <a href="https://noisradio.co/" title="">Colectivo Noís Radio</a>, Júlia Rocha, da <a href="https://artigo19.org/" title="">Artigo 19</a>, e Ramiro Alvarez Ugarte, do <a href="https://observatoriolegislativocele.com/" title="">CELE</a>, bem como os participantes da chamada, que se juntaram a nós em uma discussão aberta sobre os desafios que estamos enfrentando no ecossistema de informação na região e as oportunidades que vemos para agir. Neste texto, compartilhamos algumas das principais conclusões da nossa conversa.&nbsp;</p>



 Um ecossistema de informações saudável é aquele em que as pessoas são capazes de ouvir e conversar umas com as outras 



<p>Nossa conversa começou com os aprendizados de Maria Juliana e Nathaly Espitia da <a href="https://noisradio.co/" title="">Noís Radio</a>, um coletivo de Cali (Colômbia) que trabalha desde 2009 na produção de programas de rádio ao vivo usando vozes, música, sons ao vivo e ações performativas. Eas compartilharam que não se veem como uma estação de rádio “tradicional”, mas sim como um “medio de conversación” (ou meio de conversação) que cria espaços para conversar e ouvir, e não apenas para o compartilhamento unilateral de informações.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Para Noís Radio, a chave para um ecossistema de informação saudável é que as pessoas possam ouvir e conversar umas com as outras. Essa abordagem foi repetida por outros participantes da chamada: para Ramiro Ugarte, do CELE, é importante que pensemos em como gerar mais diálogo e conversas, porque a criação de espaços onde as pessoas possam dialogar e se conectar cara a cara é fundamental para combater a polarização e obter um ecossistema de informações mais saudável.</p>



 Criar confiança é um processo de combustão lenta (mas vale a pena!) 



<p>Durante a chamada, conversamos sobre alguns dos fatores que servem de pano de fundo para o nosso sistema de informações quebrado: a região está passando por um período de grande falta de confiança na mídia e nas instituições, há uma polarização política aguda em vários países e os cidadãos estão insatisfeitos com os sistemas políticos e estão sofrendo com a sobrecarga de informação.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Para responder a esse cenário, muitos participantes falaram sobre o valor de criar iniciativas de informação que incluam processos projetados para reconstruir a confiança das pessoas em nossas comunidades. Por exemplo, em seu trabalho, a Noís Rádio não aborda as comunidades com um projeto fixo e previamente definido – em vez disso, o coletivo convida as pessoas a se juntarem a elas em conversas e compartilharem suas necessidades, depois trabalham para estabelecer relações de confiança e “passam o microfone para as pessoas em suas comunidades”. Durante a greve nacional na Colômbia, em 2021, por exemplo, a Noís Rádio estava em Cali <a href="https://noisradio.co/pr-a-la-luna" title="">gravando programas a partir de “puntos de resistencia”</a> (pontos de resistência) com organizações sociais, jovens, artistas, mães e outros manifestantes que confiaram em seus microfones e compartilharam suas vozes. (Você pode <a href="https://noisradio.co/pr-a-la-luna" title="">ouvir os programas aqui</a>!).</p>



<p>Ao falarem sobre sua experiência, Nathaly e Maria Juliana compartilharam que, embora o processo de construção de confiança possa ser lento, ele se mostrou ser essencial, porque oferece uma base importante quando você precisa se organizar durante um momento de crise. O fato de já terem construído confiança com as pessoas em suas comunidades ao longo do tempo e de terem envolvido pessoas de forma significativa em seu trabalho no passado fez com que a Noís Rádio conseguisse se mobilizar rapidamente em um contexto político difícil, gerando conversas importantes em suas comunidades.</p>



 O valor das iniciativas de informação locais e a promoção de um senso de comunidade 



<p>A noção de que esforços liderados pelas comunidades locais são fundamentais para um ecossistema de informação mais sólido na região foi reforçada por Júlia Rocha, que lidera a equipe de Acesso à Informação e Transparência da Artigo 19 no Brasil. Em sua perspectiva, “as soluções locais são as que mais funcionam”. Em uma região em que a noção de informação de interesse público tem sido frequentemente moldada por interesses corporativos, como disse Júlia, é indispensável investir em comunicações locais, independentes e lideradas pela comunidade. Desde 2020, sua organização vem apoiando o trabalho de iniciativas de comunicação popular em todo o país com a campanha #CompartilheInformação, que concedeu subsídios a grupos que fornecem informações confiáveis sobre <a href="https://artigo19.org/2020/07/08/quinto-e-ultimo-webinar-da-campanha-compartilheinformacao-compartilhesaude-debate-popularizacao-dos-saberes-durante-a-pandemia/" title="">saúde</a>, <a href="https://artigo19.org/2022/11/07/conheca-os-20-grupos-apoiados-pela-campanha-compartilheinformacao-compartilhedemocracia/" title="">democracia e eleições</a> e, em breve, sobre o meio ambiente.</p>



<p>As organizações brasileiras de jornalismo <a href="https://www.agenciamural.org.br/" title="">Agência Mural</a> e <a href="https://enoisconteudo.com.br/" title="">Énois</a> (que também se juntaram à nossa chamada!) também estão mostrando como as iniciativas locais podem ser valiosas para o ecossistema de informação. Vendo como as pessoas carecem de acesso à informação em um nível local e urbano, elas argumentam que é preciso haver mais apoio ao “<a href="https://ssir.com.br/governo/a-urgencia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informacao" title="">desenvolvimento de iniciativas locais que contribuam para reduzir os desertos de notícias</a>“, para fornecer aos cidadãos as informações de que precisam para “participar da vida pública a partir do território onde vivem”. Como <a href="https://ssir.com.br/governo/a-urgencia-de-investir-nos-ecossistemas-locais-de-informacao" title="">Izabela Moi e Nina Weingrill</a> colocam: “a cobertura local de qualidade cria e mantém o sentimento de pertencer a uma comunidade e abre espaços para a ação e a participação dos cidadãos”.</p>



<p>Vemos isso também no trabalho da Noís Rádio, em seu trabalho para capacitar vozes mais independentes no ecossistema de informação. Em nossa conversa, Nathaly e Maria Juliana falaram sobre a importância de criar iniciativas que vão além das capitais, bem como sobre a importância de apoiar o trabalho das comunidades indígenas, afro-colombianas e migrantes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Durante a chamada, também ouvimos da <a href="https://baudoap.com/" title="">Agencia Baudó,</a> na Colômbia, que está fazendo “jornalismo que conecta comunidades”, trabalhando com contadores de histórias comunitários que não são apenas fornecedores de informações, mas também líderes locais que trabalham em suas comunidades para a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/co/app/baudo-ap/id6460035443" title="">transformação social</a>. Outro exemplo compartilhado é o trabalho da <a href="https://www.mascomunidad.org.ar/" title="">+COMUNIDAD</a>, um “meio de jornalismo de soluções” argentino que investiga, encontra e conta histórias de pessoas e cidades, resolvendo seus desafios e inspirando outros a se transformarem.</p>



<p>Participantes da chamada também falaram sobre a importância de contrabalançar a falta de dados “oficiais” sobre determinados tópicos, especialmente em regiões que não têm acesso a informações sobre questões como saúde e direitos sexuais e reprodutivos ou meio ambiente, com a produção de dados ou iniciativas voltadas para a comunidade que democratizem o acesso à informação. Para isso, falamos sobre iniciativas como o <a href="https://mapaabortolegal.org" title="">mapa da Artigo 19 feito para que as mulheres brasileiras saibam onde acessar o atendimento ao aborto em seus estados</a> – informações que antes não estavam disponíveis.</p>



 Combate às tendências prejudiciais em nível regional e mais apoio para alianças sustentáveis e de longo prazo 



<p>Discutimos algumas das tendências regionais de desordem informacional e como a sociedade civil da região está testemunhando os mesmos tipos de desinformação sendo compartilhados em muitos países.

<p>During the past years, FIDO has continued its expansion as an authentication standard among eIDAS compliant identification solutions across the EU. Back in 2020, FIDO was deployed as part of an eID scheme by the Czech domain register <a href="https://www.mojeid.cz/en/support/two-factor-authentication/">CZ.NIC’s identity provider MojeID</a>, and FIDO’s eID scheme was <a href="https://www.nic.cz/page/4180/cznic-received-accreditation-to-manage-a-qualified-electronic-identification-system-from-the-moi-cr/">recognized as LoA Substantial and High</a> by the Czech ministry of interior. The year after, the <a href="https://www.buypass.com/products/authentication/fido2-solution-for-strong-authentication">Norwegian trust service provider Buypass</a> deployed FIDO2 as an authentication standard for an eIDAS eID scheme of LoA Substantial and High; this solution has been accredited by the Norwegian digitalization agency and is now being rolled out in the Norwegian healthcare sector. In April 2023, the FIDO Alliance published a <a>white paper</a> that describes how FIDO can be used for the EUDI Wallet under the proposed eIDAS2 regulation. So FIDO is currently gaining momentum as an authentication standard in the EU.</p>



<p>On top of these success stories, the FIDO standards have recently been referenced by two of the most respected EU organizations within cybersecurity and standardization: ENISA (the EU Cybersecurity Agency) and ETSI (the European Telecommunications Standards Institute).</p>



<p>In July 2023, ENISA published the report “<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-standards">Digital Identity Standards</a>”. The report provides a comprehensive overview of digital identity standards, standardization organizations, and authentication protocols. More specifically, the report describes the FIDO Alliance as “an open industry association launched in February 2013 whose stated mission is to develop and promote authentication standards that ‘help reduce the world’s over-reliance on passwords”. Furthermore, the ENISA report describes the FIDO standard suite FIDO2, FIDO U2F and FIDO UAF in technical detail. The ENISA report also explains the concepts of FIDO Authenticators, FIDO Metadata Service, assertions with Relying Parties, and the WebAuthn and CTAP2 APIs. ENISA concludes that the maturity of the FIDO standards is high. This ENISA report re-iterates and emphasizes the recommendation to use FIDO for two-factor authentication, which was published in 2022 in the joint publication “<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/boosting-your-organisations-cyber-resilience">Boosting your Organisation’s Cyber Resilience</a>” issued in cooperation by EU-CERT and ENISA.</p>



<p>Next, ETSI published the technical report <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.01.01_60/tr_119476v010101p.pdf">ETSI TR 119 476</a> called “Analysis of selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs applied to Electronic Attestation of Attributes”. The ETSI report analyzes cryptographic schemes for selective disclosure and their potential application for Electronic Attestation Attributes in line with the proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281">eIDAS2 regulation</a>. The purpose is to allow the users of the EUDI Wallets to select what attributes they want to share with a verifier. For example, a user may only want to disclose that she is over 18 years old at a restaurant, but no more personal information than that. The ETSI report includes a description of the VC-FIDO solution, which has been invented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3taGxBdrRU">David Chadwick at the Kent University</a>. The ETSI report states:</p>



<p>“The VC-FIDO integration is based on the W3C WebAuthn protocol in the FIDO2 standard. The WebAuthn stack is extended with a W3C Verifiable Credentials enrollment protocol, resulting in a client that can enroll for multiple atomic short-lived W3C Verifiable Credentials based on W3C Credential templates. These atomic short-lived W3C Verifiable Credentials can then be (temporarily) stored in an EUDI Wallet, and be combined into a Verifiable Presentation that is presented to the relying party (verifier). Selective disclosure is achieved since the user can enroll for the atomic attributes it needs for a specific use case, and present only those atomic (Q)EAAs to a Relying Party.”</p>



<p>These prominent references in the ENISA and ETSI reports demonstrate that FIDO has achieved a firm position as a viable authentication standard for eIDAS2 and regulated use cases in the EU. It will be interesting to follow the continued development of the EUDI Wallet implementations and the related Large Scale Pilots – it is quite likely that FIDO will be deployed in such solutions across the EU.</p>

These projects are touted to control migration, bolstering a <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/publication/financing-border-wars">lucrative multi-billion-dollar border industrial complex</a>. Coupled with increasing international environmental destabilization, more and more people are ensnared in a growing and global surveillance dragnet. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/22/robotic-dogs-arizona-border-will-not-solve-migrant-crisis/">Thousands have already died</a>.

Through years of my travels from Palestine to Ukraine to Kenya to US/Mexico, the power of comparison shows me time and again how these spaces allow for frontier mentalities to take over, creating environments of silence and violence.</p><p>In this era of generative technologies, this work is underpinned by broader questions: Whose perspectives matter when talking about innovation, and whose priorities take precedence? What does critical representation and meaningful participation look like — representation that foregrounds people’s agency and does not contribute to the <a href="https://www.fmreview.org/photo-policy#:~:text=We%20have%20decided%20that%20we,correct%20way%20to%20do%20this">“poverty porn” that is so common in representations coming from spaces of forced migration</a>? And who gets to create narratives and generate stories that underpin the foundations of tools like GPT-4 and whatever else is coming&nbsp;next?</p>Clockwise from top left: High-tech refugee camp on Kos Island in Greece; surveillance tower in Arizona; two women cross the Ukraine-Poland border; memorial site in the Sonora desert; protest against new refugee camp on Samos; Calvin, a medical doctor, holds keys from his apartment in Ukraine after escaping across the Hungary border. Photos by Petra Molnar, 2021–2022.<p>Tools like generative AI are socially constructed by and with particular perspectives and value systems. They are a reflection of the so-called Global North and can encode and perpetuate biases and discrimination. In August of this year, to test out where generative AI systems are at, I ran a simple prompt through the Canva and Craiyon image generation software: “What does a refugee look&nbsp;like?”</p> What stories do these images tell? What perspectives do they&nbsp;hide? <p>It is telling that for generative AI, the concept of a “refugee” elicits either forlorn and emaciated faces of Black children or else portraits of doe-eyed and vaguely Middle Eastern people waiting to be rescued. When I sent these depictions to a colleague who is currently in a situation of displacement and identifies as a refugee, she laughed and said, “I sure as hell hope I don’t look like&nbsp;this.”</p><p>Generative AI is also inherently exploitative. Its training data are scraped and extracted often without the knowledge or consent of the people who created or are in the data. Menial tasks that allow the models to function fall on underpaid labor outside of North America and Europe. The benefits of this technology do not accrue equally, and generative AI looks to replicate the vast power differentials between those who benefit and those who are the subjects of high-risk technological experiments.</p> How can we think more intentionally about who will be impacted by generative AI and work collaboratively–and rapidly–with affected populations to build knowledge? <p>The production of any kind of knowledge is always a political act, especially since researchers often build entire careers on documenting the trauma of others, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jhuman/huq004">stealing stories” as they go along</a>. Being entrusted with other people’s stories is a deep privilege. Generating any type of knowledge is not without its pitfalls, and academia is in danger of falling into the same trap with generative AI research: creating knowledge in isolation from communities, failing to consider the expertise of those we’re purporting to learn from. How can researchers and storytellers limit the extractive nature of research and story collection? Given the power differentials involved, research and storytelling can and should be uncomfortable, and we must pay particular attention to why certain perspectives in the so-called Global North are given precedence while the <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/a-primer-on-ai-in-from-the-majority-world/">rest of the world continues to be silenced</a>. This is particularly pertinent when we are talking about a vast system of increasingly autonomous knowledge generation through&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The concept of story and knowledge stewardship may be helpful, a concept from Indigenous learnings which recognizes that the storyteller is not exempt from critical analysis of their own power and privilege over other people’s narratives and should instead hold space for stories to tell themselves. This type of framing continually places responsibility at the center (see for example the work of the Canadian <a href="https://fnigc.ca/">First Nations Information Governance Centre</a>). Storytelling and sharing is also a profound act of resistance to simplified and homogenized narratives, often common when there is a power differential between the researcher and their topic. Established methods of knowledge production are predicated on an outside expert parachuting in, extracting data, findings, and stories, using their westernized credentials to further their careers as the&nbsp;expert.</p><p>True commitment to participatory approaches requires ceding space, meaningfully redistributing resources, and supporting affected communities in telling their own stories. And real engagement with decolonial methodologies requires an iterative understanding of these framings, a re-framing process that is never complete. By decentering so-called Global North narratives and not tokenizing people with lived experience as research subjects or afterthoughts, researchers can create opportunities that recognize their privilege and access to resources — and then redistribute those resources through meaningful participation, creating an environment for people to tell their own stories. It is this commitment to participatory approaches that we need in generative AI research, especially as it meets up with border control technologies.</p><p>One small example is the <a href="https://www.migrationtechmonitor.com/">Migration and Technology Monitor</a> project at the York University’s <a href="https://refugeelab.ca/">Refugee Law Lab</a>, where I am Associate Director.&nbsp;, Migration and Technology Monitor is a platform and an archive with a focus on migration, technology, and human rights. Our recently launched <a href="https://www.migrationtechmonitor.com/2023fellows">fellowship program</a> aims to create opportunities for people with lived experience to meaningfully contribute to research, storytelling, policy, and advocacy conversations from the start, not as an afterthought. Among our aims is to generate a collaborative, intellectual, and advocacy community committed to border justice. We prioritize opportunities for participatory work, including the ability to pitch unique and relevant projects by affected communities themselves. Veronica Martinez, Nery Sataella, Simon Drotti, Rajendra Paudel, and Wael Qarssifi are part of our first cohort of fellows from mobile communities from Venezuela to Mexico to Uganda to Nepal to Malaysia. Our hope is that our fellowship creates a community which provides spaces of collaboration, care, and co-creation of knowledge. We are specifically sharing resources with people on the move who may not be able to benefit from funding and resources readily available in the EU and North America. People with lived experiences of migration must be in the driver’s seat when interrogating both the negative impacts of technology as well as the creative solutions that innovation can bring to the complex stories of human movement, such as using generative AI to compile resources for mobile communities.</p><p>Participatory methodologies that foreground lived experience as the starting place for generating knowledge inherently destabilize established power hierarchies of knowledge production. These approaches encourage researchers and tech designers to critically interrogate their own positionality and how much space their own so-called expertise takes up in the generation of knowledge at the expense of other realities. These framings and commitments are paramount, especially in context with fraught histories and vast power differentials–for example, where mobile populations are the abject and feared others and where generative AI models learn on these realities. Especially pertinent for scholars, technologists, and researchers who are themselves part of the so-called Rest of World, a re-imagination of expertise and knowledge must come from the ground up and any tools which are created must recognize and fight against these power differentials.</p><p>It is through participatory methodologies that we may come a step closer towards seeing a world in which many worlds fit, a phrase which as my BKC colleague Ashley Lee reminds us, comes from the Zapatista Indigenous resistance movement — a world where “nothing about us without us” moves beyond an old community organizer motto towards a real commitment to participation, story stewardship, and public scholarship which honors and foregrounds lived experience.</p><p>Thank you to Madeline McGee for her suggestions which greatly improved this piece and to Sam Hinds for her careful&nbsp;edits.</p><p>This essay is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary and transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence.

 A Real-Time Experiment to Regulate Generative AI Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christianlue?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Christian Lue</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>.<p>The public release of ChatGPT in November 2022 represents a significant breakthrough in generative AI — systems that craft synthetic content based on patterns learned from extensive datasets. This development has heightened concerns about AI’s impact on individuals and society at large. In the brief period since this breakthrough, there has been a surge in lawsuits pertaining to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/arts/sarah-silverman-lawsuit-openai-meta.html">copyright</a> and <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/microsoft-and-openai-sued-for-3bn-in-privacy-complaint/">privacy</a> violations, as well as<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australian-mayor-readies-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content-2023-04-05/"> defamation</a>. One lawyer learned a hard lesson about the dangers of AI “hallucination” after citing seemingly genuine but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html">bogus</a> judicial precedents generated by ChatGPT in a legal brief submitted to court. There are even reports that such systems have been implicated in an individual’s decision to commit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkadgm/man-dies-by-suicide-after-talking-with-ai-chatbot-widow-says">suicide</a>.</p><p>Given these concerns, there is a growing demand for regulatory action. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, addressed the US Congress in May and called upon legislators to&nbsp;act.</p><p>The EU has taken the lead in legislative endeavors. In April 2021, the European Commission proposed a Regulation on AI (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206">AI Act</a>), marking the first step toward a comprehensive global legal framework on AI. This landmark legislation aims to foster a human-centric AI, directing its development in a way that respects human dignity, safeguards fundamental rights, and guarantees the security and trustworthiness of AI&nbsp;systems.</p><blockquote>The agile innovation process that permeates the software world, where distributed technologies are frequently released in early stages and iteratively refined based on usage data, necessitates a regulatory system that is designed to learn and&nbsp;adapt.</blockquote><p>The proposed AI Act adopts a risk-based approach, categorizing AI systems into three main risk levels: unacceptable risk, high risk, and limited risk. This classification depends on the potential risk posed to health, safety, and fundamental rights. Certain AI systems such as those that generate “trustworthiness” scores, akin to the Chinese Social Credit System, are considered to present unacceptable risks and are completely prohibited. AI systems used in hiring processes and welfare benefit decisions fall into the high-risk category and are subject to stringent obligations. These include conducting a conformity assessment and adhering to certain data quality and transparency requirements. Meanwhile, chatbots and deepfakes are considered limited risk, subject to relatively minimal transparency requirements.</p><p>Shortly after the proposal was drafted, and after the release of ChatGPT, it became clear that the Commission’s draft contained a significant hole: it did not address general purpose AI or “foundational models” like Open AI’s GPT-n series, which underpins ChatGPT. Fortunately, due to the EU’s multistage legislative process, the release of ChatGPT occurred while the European Parliament was deliberating on the AI Act. This provided a timely opportunity to include new provisions specifically targeting foundational models and generative AI.</p><p>Under an <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0236_EN.pdf">amendment</a> adopted by the European Parliament in June, providers of foundational models would be required to identify and reduce risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights through proper design and testing before placing their models on the market. They must also implement measures to ensure appropriate levels of performance and adopt strategies to minimize energy and resource usage. Moreover, these AI systems must be registered in an EU database, with details on their capabilities, foreseeable risks, and measures taken to mitigate these risks, including an account of risks that remain unaddressed. The amendment would impose additional obligations on foundational models employed in generative AI. These obligations include transparency requirements, ensuring users are aware that content is machine generated, and implementing adequate safeguards against the generation of unlawful content. Providers must also publish a detailed summary of copyrighted content used to train their&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While the final version of the AI Act will be determined by the trilogue among the European Commission, European Parliament, and European Council, its current form already marks an ambitious and real-time attempt to regulate generative AI, highlighting the challenges of regulating a rapidly evolving&nbsp;target.</p><p>On this occasion, the EU’s legislative process kept pace with the latest advancements before the laws were set in stone. However, it raises the question: how often can we count on such fortunate timing, and what proactive measures should be&nbsp;taken?</p><p>We must embed flexibility into such laws. Indeed, the EU has taken some steps in this direction, granting the Commission the authority to adapt the law by adding new use cases into the risk categories. Yet, considering previous experiences with the Commission’s implementation of delegated acts, it’s debatable whether such mechanisms alone can keep up with the rapid pace of AI development.</p><p>The agile innovation process that permeates the software world, where distributed technologies are frequently released in early stages and iteratively refined based on usage data, necessitates a regulatory system that is designed to learn and&nbsp;adapt.</p><p>It is important to embrace a variety of techniques for adaptive regulation, such as regulatory experimentation through pilot projects and embedding systematic and periodic review and revision mechanisms into legislation. Adaptive regulation further necessitates openness to a diversity of approaches across jurisdictions. It encourages learning from one another, which implies that the EU should resist its inclination to solely dictate global standards for AI regulation, and instead regard its efforts as contributions to a collective pool of learning resources.</p><blockquote>While adaptive regulation does come with its own costs, clinging to static regulation designed for a hardware world with fully-formed products manufactured in centralized facilities, could potentially prove to be even more costly in the face of rapidly advancing technology.</blockquote><p>Simultaneously, the amendment has significantly broadened the Act’s scope. While the Commission’s draft focused on mitigating harms to health, safety, and fundamental rights, the European Parliament’s version extends these concerns to include democracy, the rule of law, and environmental protection. Consequently, providers of high-risk AI systems and foundational models are required to manage risks associated with all these areas. However, this raises concerns that the Act might transform into a catch-all regulation with diluted impact, thereby creating a considerable burden on providers to translate these broad goals into concrete guardrails.</p><p>This amendment has exacerbated existing concerns that these broad requirements and accompanying compliance costs might stifle innovation. In an open <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wrtxfvcD9FwfNfWGDL37Q6Nd8wBKXCkn/view">letter</a> to EU authorities, over 150 executives from companies including Siemens, Airbus, Deutsche Telekom, and Renault criticized the AI Act for its potential to “undermine Europe’s competitiveness and technological autonomy.” One of the significant concerns raised by these companies relates to the legislation’s strict requirements aimed at generative AI systems and foundational models. The letter equates the importance of generative AI with the invention of the internet, considering its potential to shape not only the economy but also culture and politics. The signatories caution that the compliance costs and risks embedded in the AI Act could “result in highly innovative companies relocating their operations overseas, investors retracting their capital from the development of European foundational models, and European AI in general.”</p><p>OpenAI has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/25/23737116/openai-ai-regulation-eu-ai-act-cease-operating">warned</a> about potentially exiting the EU if the conditions of the AI Act prove too restrictive. There are also indications that even major players are cautious when rolling out their latest services. The launch of Google Bard was delayed in the EU by two months due to compliance concerns with the General Data Protection Regulation. However, it was ultimately introduced with improved <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3702768/google-bard-launches-in-eu-overcoming-data-privacy-concerns-in-the-region.html">privacy</a> safeguards, highlighting the EU’s role in shaping global data policies of such organizations.</p><p>For its part, the EU contends that the AI Act is designed to stimulate AI innovation and underscores key enabling measures included in the Act. These encompass regulatory sandboxes, which serve as test beds for AI experimentation and development, an industry-led process for defining standards that assist with compliance, and safe harbors for AI research.</p><p>Of course, the concerns from the industry about the AI Act’s impact on innovation, as well as the EU’s responses to these matters, represent an essential part of balancing the inevitable trade-offs inherent in regulating any emerging technology, and time will tell which direction the pendulum swings. During the trilogue negotiations, it is likely that the European Council will push back on some of the amendments from the Parliament. Indeed, there is merit in carefully weighing the benefits of introducing broad objectives such as democracy and the rule of law without concrete measures in place to support these goals. One might argue that efforts are better spent strengthening the safeguards for fundamental rights, which is crucial for safeguarding both democracy and the rule of law. Numerous civil society organizations have already emphasized the need for incorporating fundamental rights impact assessments and empowering individuals and public interest organizations to file complaints and seek redress for harms inflicted by&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Moreover, it would be beneficial to concentrate on tangible guardrails, such as facilitating researchers’ access to foundational models, data, and parameters. This approach is likely to be more effective in promoting accountability, democracy, and the rule of law compared to a general requirement to conduct risk assessments based on such broad concepts.</p><p>Regardless of the final form of the text, the AI Act is poised to significantly shape AI development and the regulatory landscape in the EU and beyond. Therefore, the AI community must prepare for its&nbsp;impact.</p><p>This essay is part of the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary and transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence.

 Global Collaboration Creates Ethical Generative AI <p>Though the underlying technology was based on years of AI research by many individuals and organizations, the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November of 2022 captured the collective imagination in an extraordinary way. The release started an ongoing conversation about the potential of the technology to improve our lives, and to harm them. In the public consciousness, AI has remained confusing, overwhelming, and a bit scary — even its name can seem imprecise and distracting. And with generative AI, phrases like “hallucination” and “job replacement” only foment more fear. Yet beneath the hype, doomerism, and techno-utopianism sits the fundamental question of what kind of societies we want to live in — and what choices we should make to realize&nbsp;them.</p><p>One month after the release of ChatGPT, a group of collaborators — the Nordic Centre at BI Norwegian Business School, the Institute for Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro, the Technical University of Munich, and the Berkman Klein Center — decided it was time to discuss the implications of generative AI. We knew that if generative AI were to realize its true pro-social potential and to have its harms mitigated, then cross-sector, cross-disciplinary, and cross-national conversation was needed. Many in our community had already begun to explore use cases, governance, accountability, and the systems’ social impact broadly. It was time to rebuild bridges weakened by the COVID pandemic&nbsp;era.</p>Sabelo Mhlambi and Jenn Louie at “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI,” May&nbsp;2023.<p>In May 2023, the Berkman Klein Center hosted “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI” in Cambridge, USA, bringing together colleagues old and new with backgrounds from academia, civil society, government, and industry, from over two dozen countries and all of the continents other than Antarctica. We discussed the need for access to data for research purposes and the need for real&nbsp;study.</p><p>At the same time, many emphasized that policymakers do not have the time; they need to act now. Action and study need to happen in parallel.</p>Samson Esayas at “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI,” May&nbsp;2023.<blockquote>Today we introduce the <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/generative-futures/home">Co-Designing Generative Futures series</a>, a collection of multidisciplinary, transnational reflections and speculations about the transformative shifts brought on by generative artificial intelligence, as seen by members of the Berkman Klein Center community.</blockquote><p>In the first set of essays, <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-eu-ai-act-e73e1a35a843">Samson Esayas</a> addresses the potential implications of policy, speculating on the role the European Union’s AI Act may play in the governance and development of generative technologies. And <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/building-knowledge-about-generative-ai-with-mobile-populations-806c80e899b1">Petra Molnar</a> challenges us to consider the potential impact of generative AI on the surveillance of borders and of migrants, urging us to engage displaced people using participatory methods to understand their perspectives and protect their&nbsp;safety.</p><p>The second installment addresses how generative AI challenges fundamental concerns about our experiences of being human. <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/preserving-social-connections-against-the-backdrop-of-generative-ai-abcaebd45c3d">Alexa Hasse</a> examines how generative AI tools might change trust in our human social relationships. <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/thinking-through-generative-ai-harms-among-users-on-online-platforms-79cf9b2af49a">Sameer Hinduja</a> offers a deep dive into the sobering potential of generative AI tools to perpetuate online harassment at massive scale. And <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/you-know-for-kids-47731a0a72f8">Bill Shribman</a> brings the perspective of a children’s media producer as he explores how media literacy education may need to shift in light of advancements in AI technology.</p>Maroussia Lévesque and Petra Molnar at “Co-Designing Generative Futures: A Global Conversation about AI,” May&nbsp;2023.<p>As members of our community continue to study generative AI, both the urgency and the need for deeper consideration persist. Policymakers are moving quickly towards substantial legislation in multiple regions across the world. The technology keeps improving. Technology innovators are finding new applications for generative AI, and we likely have only scratched the surface of what is to come. Researchers are publishing new findings about concerns regarding bias, data privacy, data ownership, disinformation, and vast inequities across regions and communities. And they urgently need more access to data. Looking forward, the necessity for continued collaboration across sectoral, national, and disciplinary boundaries seems all the more critical.</p><p>As Senior Director of Programs and Strategy at the Berkman Klein Center, I am committed to sustaining co-design efforts. We welcome fresh perspectives and opportunities for engagement from around the globe, and from new sectors and stakeholders.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/co-designing-shared-futures-3d15f9883773">Co-Designing Shared Futures</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>TORONTO, OCTOBER 31st, 2023 — There is a public trust gap in adopting digital trust capabilities that governments must close together with the private sector to amplify Canadian priorities in the global digital economy, according to a new report from DIACC.</p>



<p>Digital trust tools help verify a person or organization’s identity to enhance privacy, security, and transparency using people-centred design to operate digital credentials, digital wallets, networks, and modern authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report, Committed to Building Trust Together, found no strong call to action from the public to advance digital trust even though Canadians are increasingly frustrated by online scams and identity theft, among other high-profile security and data breaches that affect them. The lack of vocal public demand for digital trust is partly due to a need for education about what it is and, most importantly, how it can benefit and improve their lives.</p>



<p>“Hesitancy is often rooted in data privacy, security, and potential misuse of personal information concerns. People should rightly be concerned because there are often no easily understood rules around where their personal data lives, who owns it, or how others use it,” said Joni Brennan, president of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC). “In today’s digital world, trust remains at a premium, and the importance of identity verification is at an all-time high.”</p>



<p>Digital trust capabilities are critical — and long overdue — to support a secure and inclusive digital economy and society. From more efficient business tasks that save millions of dollars to getting the proper health records and making it easier to buy a house or board a plane, privacy and personal data control are potent tools that can help safely confirm a person’s identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report follows two Public Trust Forum sessions that brought together members from academia, non-profit organizations, private sector companies and provincial and territorial governments. Participants spoke in-depth about the challenges, opportunities, and considerations for creating the conditions to enable made-in-Canada solutions.</p>



<p>Public Trust Forum participants reached a consensus on the following key takeaways:</p>



 
 There will never be a universal consensus on acceptance of digital trust capabilities. Universal acceptance should not be the goal. 



 Use of government-issued digital credentials must be voluntary. People must have the choice to opt-out, as they can opt-out in the private sector. 



 There’s no strong call to action from the public to advance digital trust. There is a need for education about digital trust and, most importantly, how it can benefit and improve people’s lives. 



 An effective communications strategy should focus on real-life success stories in different use cases. That means practical examples of how digital trust capabilities improve service delivery, such as in the aviation and financial sectors. 



 Though it’s been around for a long time, the term “digital identity” may hinder the public’s understanding. 



 Terms such as “verify,” “authenticate,” or “credentials” may make it easier for those who are unsure about new technologies to see the benefits. 



 DON’T abandon the term “digital identity.” It’s a profession and a globally recognized definition; its use will depend on the audience and situation. 



 Jurisdictionally, with Canadian news removed from popular social media platforms, there may be a vacuum to spread mis and disinformation regarding digital modernization. 
 



<p>DIACC made five recommendations that all organizations should prioritize to inform public dialogue and build trust.</p>



 
 Don’t wait for a universal public consensus on adopting digital trust capabilities because it will never come. Commit and message that public adoption is voluntary. Individuals may choose to use digital trust services or not. 



 Make significant public education investments at municipal, provincial and federal levels and the private sector to inform the public about well-designed capabilities. Focus on easy use cases (i.e., digital parking or bus passes, obtaining a business licence). 



 Reduce the temperature by moving public messaging away from the confusing term “digital identity” in certain situations. Terms like “verify,” “authenticate,” and “credential” are more easily understood. 



 Communicate public safety importance as scenarios where digital services reduce response pressure and help get resources faster to those in need. Pandemic-related personal safety concerns accelerated the demand for modern digital services. 



 Break transformation down into manageable outcomes rather than trying to boil the ocean with a national or universal strategy. 
 



<p>“The bottom line is that organizations and governments must prioritize transparency, robust data protection measures, and ethical data usage while actively engaging with the public to address concerns and ensure that digital trust capabilities are developed and implemented to protect and enhance individual privacy and security and support organizations’ operational needs,” Brennan said. “Establishing safe and convenient use of digital ID services means establishing trust. People must have confidence and control over their identity data, and on the flip side, they must have evidence that their privacy, security and choices are secured.”</p>



<p>“Citizens and residents vocalize their frustrations with services that aren’t’ modernized, and they’re looking to governments and the private sector to lead the way in the global digital economy collaboratively,” said Giselle D’Paiva, Partner, Government &amp; Public Sector, Deloitte.</p>



<p>“Trust is local, and designing made-in-Canada solutions for digital access and verification will help build consumer confidence, trust, and broad adoption,” said Neil Butters, VP of Product, Interac Verified.</p>



<p>“Securing digital trust for the supply chain and global digital economy depends on local and international leadership and collaboration to advance frameworks and standards that ensure broad benefits,” said Don Cuthbertson, Chief Executive Officer of Portage CyberTech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re working to help the public understand that global standards increase trust, reduce fraud and make it safer and more convenient for our customers to transact,” said Marie Jordan, Senior Director at VISA, Global Standards and Industry Engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DIACC will reconvene the Public Trust Forum at intervals to review what’s transpired since the last forum, address critical thematic developments, and continue public literacy research to pinpoint how perception evolves among the public.</p>

We’ll also get into general tips. Like <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/radiating-confidence-at-change-org-9fbbe9f4fc2f">our first post</a>, we’ve pulled out the key questions you can ask yourself to help you&nbsp;prepare.</p> Running your&nbsp;session <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_12RxeZrt3k2PIqiKn3bi97od6bBxifBPIOR8VrXwlI/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part 3</a>&nbsp;(slides)</p><p>Start as you mean to go on, as they say. In order to create a positive atmosphere, be an enlarged version of yourself. If you’re funny, make people laugh. If you’re not, at least try to put people at their ease as best you can! That can be as simple as smiling&nbsp;:)</p> At the start of your&nbsp;session cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>There may be someone in the room in which you’re going to be running your session immediately before you. If the event planners did their job well, however, you will have at least a few minutes to get set up. If you feel like you’re rushing, just ask everyone to get acquainted with the person next to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Even if there’s a tech person on hand, don’t assume that everything is set up to your liking. Check the remotes. Check that the fonts on the slides you sent through look correct. Check the microphone works. Check everything. Twice.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Aristotle famously said that we become brave by acting like a brave person. If you smile, everyone assumes that you are confident and are enjoying the experience. Smiling is particularly infectious, so smile away at people as they arrive. Just not in a scary&nbsp;way.</p><p>Some questions to reflect&nbsp;on:</p>  What can you do to get set up or prepared even before you enter the&nbsp;room?  Have you got a backup copy of your slide deck? Could you run the session without&nbsp;them?  What kind of questions can you ask people as they arrive which will make them feel&nbsp;welcome?  What’s the worst that can&nbsp;happen?  If you’ve used a link shortener, have you checked it isn’t blocked on the event&nbsp;wifi?   During your&nbsp;session <p>Sessions at events can be a rollercoaster of emotions and energy, both for the whoever is leading the session (you!) and the audience/participants.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Preparation is important, but so is delivery, so make sure people and ideas have time to ‘breathe’. Mix up the pace of the session to keep it interesting. Even if you practise, it’s easy to run over due to people arriving late, a question derailing your flow, or just you being over-enthusiastic about a particular section. Keep track of timings using your watch, phone, or presenter display. Bonus points for vibrating alarms,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Questions to think&nbsp;about:</p>  Have you left enough time for questions?  Can you think of questions you are expecting to get and can prepare&nbsp;for?  Are there easy analogies you can use from everyday&nbsp;life?  Did you know that audience members with a ‘concentration face’ can also look like them frowning?  When people read they tend to use a monotone voice — have you practised modulating your voice (making it go up and down, faster and slower) to make it more interesting to listen&nbsp;to?  cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers At the end of your&nbsp;session <p>Just because you’ve informed your audience of the link to the slide deck once doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t do it again. Especially as they’ve now seen how good it is. Ensure it’s on the screen at the end of your session for a good&nbsp;while.</p><p>Questions to prepare you for the&nbsp;end:</p>  Can you make the link to your slides and agenda as easy to access as possible by ensuring there are no ambiguous characters (e.g. l vs&nbsp;1)?  Do you want to add your social media details to these resources as well? Which&nbsp;one(s)?  Are there particular ‘rabbit holes’ that people tend to want to go down with the topic of your&nbsp;session?   Recovering from&nbsp;sessions <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sz0OT0mp-_YWuy2AB4Jr125rf5lgPbVkxDuwcjXJLEw/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part 4</a>&nbsp;(slides)</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Congratulations! Your session is over and it’s time to relax a little. Instead of flopping into a heap in the corner or hitting the bar, take steps to look after yourself. Spending time outside, following-up with interesting people, and eating/drinking the right things are all ways to refresh your mind, body, and&nbsp;soul!</p><p>Don’t forget to take a moment to breathe and ask yourself these questions while you’re preparing:</p>  Are there spaces outside you can be by yourself for a while? (especially if you’re an introvert)  Can you take food and drink into the room you’re running your&nbsp;session?  What are you going to reward yourself&nbsp;with?  How can you make it so that people who missed your session can almost feel like they participated?  Is it worth putting your out of office autoresponder on during the&nbsp;event?  What does a minimum viable blog post look like for&nbsp;you?   General Tips <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17R7OWgy-8Cme_EphWHrlLu0eKf9QtgC8r0BGU2WqrbU/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part&nbsp;5</a></p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>When you attend events and conferences you should work to promote engagement. It helps everyone have a better time. Ask questions! Sometimes you’ve got all of the answers and you’re bestowing your wisdom. More often, you’re exploring an area, sharing your experience, and asking questions for your colleagues to grapple with along with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Remember nothing is irrelevant and you should share openly. The things that you find boring and mundane such as how you set something up or the problems you had recruiting someone to do X can be fascinating and gold dust to other people. So mention them! You can go into more detail in the Q&amp;A if&nbsp;asked.</p><p>People aren’t coming to your session because you’re a huge rockstar and they want to bask in your glory. Or maybe they are. Either way, your job is to help them with the things they are facing in their life, thanks to your insights.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers<p>Final question to have an epic presentation: If you step into the shoes of your audience, what could you add / remove /&nbsp;modify?</p><p>We hope these couple of posts have helped you feel prepared for your next big workshop, talk, session or presentation.

<p>In this byline Andrew looks at the rise of generative AI and the increase in the threat of phishing, making attacks almost undetectable. For Andrew, AI-based malware tools such as FraudGPT are generating sophisticated phishing campaigns. Instead of simply detecting phishing emails, businesses need to rethink security, with a focus on eliminating passwords. He believes that passwordless authentication, such as passkeys, offers better protection, making credentials invulnerable to attack.</p>

<p>FIDO study shows: passwords to be replaced by better alternatives in the next few years<br>A study conducted by the FIDO Alliance (Fast IDentity Online) and LastPass shows that passwords in companies will largely be replaced by secure alternatives in the next few years. According to the survey, most IT executives believe that by 2028, less than 25 percent of logins will be through passwords. Already, 95 percent of respondents are using passwordless alternatives such as passkeys to increase security. The majority of IT managers plan to manage passkeys via third-party password managers.</p>

<p>Email teams being challenged with high cart abandonment rates should push back — the real problem is not bad personalization or copy, but passwords. People are fed up with them. And their behavior reflects it, judging by the 2023 Online Authentication Barometer, a global study by the Fido Alliance, conducted by Sapio Research. U.S. consumers abandon a purchase and stop accessing an online service because they can’t remember their passwords 4.76 times per day on average, up from 3.71 in 2022 — a 28.30% increase.</p>

<p>In the fight against a growing number of text-, phone-, and email-based phishing scams, speakers at the FIDO Alliance’s Authenticate Conference in California this week made a case for passwordless security options like the passkey over the oft-hacked password. “Any enterprise that’s using passwords or legacy forms of MFA is taking a gamble they will eventually lose,” Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the industry group known as the FIDO Alliance, told attendees.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce the <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/integrations/storage/ceramic-example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">integration of Lit Protocol and Ceramic</a>, enabling developers to store encrypted data on ComposeDB. This integration allows developers to build applications that provide users with more control over their data and privacy.</p> What is Lit Protocol? <p>Lit Protocol is a decentralized key management system that allows users to encrypt their data and control who has access to it. Lit Protocol’s access control system gives users granular control over who can access and use their data.</p><p>Along with flexible access control features, Lit also offers tooling around <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Secure_multi-party_computation?ref=spark.litprotocol.com">multi-party computation (MPC)</a>. MPC enables secure reading and writing of data between blockchains and off-chain platforms, such as programmable signing that allows developers to build distributed serverless functions that have event listening capabilities to create specific triggers for executing programmatic signing, and much more.</p> Why integrate Lit Protocol and Ceramic Network? <p>The integration between Lit Protocol and Ceramic allows developers to build applications that provide users with more control over their data and privacy.</p><p>The Ceramic protocol is built on decentralized event streams, where user accounts (enabled by decentralized identifiers, or&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/protocol/js-ceramic/accounts/decentralized-identifiers?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDs</a>) cryptographically sign data events and submit them to the network. These events are stored in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) using the IPLD protocol, and organized into readable streams. Each stream is flexible enough to store many types of content. Therefore, Ceramic is home to a diversity of different data use cases such as user profiles, posts, relations to other entities and more.</p><p>Due to Ceramic's open readability, any participating node can read from any stream in the network. Therefore, encrypting data using Lit Protocol and saving it on Ceramic is a common (and necessary) integration for many teams.</p> A Peek Under the Hood <p>Given Ceramic’s architecture, Lit Protocol’s access control capabilities allow developers to gate access to content based on highly flexible conditions. For instance, developers may want to allow their users the ability to grant read access to all addresses that hold a specific NFT or ERC20 asset. With Lit Protocol, developers allow their users to assign <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/access-control/intro?ref=blog.ceramic.network">access control conditions</a> that are associated with the encrypted object when generated. The Lit nodes confirm those conditions have been satisfied using the user’s wallet signature when they request access. This offers a seamless user flow for the end user, whereas (without Lit Protocol) users might otherwise be required to manually decrypt or re-encode their encrypted data for other users they want to grant access to.</p> How to Use Lit Protocol to Encrypt Messages and Save Them to Ceramic <p>To use Lit Protocol to encrypt messages and save them to Ceramic using ComposeDB, you can follow the tutorial <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/integrations/storage/ceramic-example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">here</a>. This tutorial uses a message board example application to show you how to create encrypted messages using Lit Protocol and save message instances to the Ceramic Network using ComposeDB.</p> In the tutorial, you’ll learn how to:   Create ComposeDB schemas and deploy those models on a local Ceramic node  Authenticate users on Ceramic to allow them to author their own documents  Encrypt data with Lit Protocol and write mutation queries to save the encrypted data to ComposeDB using GraphQL  Decrypt data using Lit Protocol based on specific access control logic   What do you need to get started? <p>As outlined in the <a href="https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/integrations/storage/ceramic-example?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a>, the only dependencies you’ll need are:</p>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?ref=blog.ceramic.network">MetaMask Chrome Extension</a>  Node v16   Want to Learn More about Building on Ceramic?  <br>Build an AI Chatbot on Ceramic <p>Build an AI-powered Chatbot and save message history to ComposeDB by following this&nbsp;<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB Tutorial</a>.</p> How to Use and Store Composable Attestations with Ceramic and Ethereum Attestation Service <p>Walk through a <a href="https://docs.attest.sh/docs/tutorials/ceramic-storage?ref=blog.ceramic.network">tutorial</a> on how to generate attestations (using Ethereum Attestation Service) and store them on ComposeDB.</p> ComposeDB API Sandbox <p>Use the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/sandbox?ref=blog.ceramic.network">ComposeDB API Sandbox</a> to test example queries on a real dataset.</p> Create a Social App on ComposeDB <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/EthDenver2023Demo?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Social App ComposeDB Starter</a> will help you get started building your own social app.</p><p>Let us know what you think about our integration with Lit Protocol on the <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Forum</a>!</p>

  <p>By Santiago Lyon, Head of Advocacy and Education, CAI</p><p>We are thrilled to announce that industry-leading camera manufacturer Leica is officially launching the new M11-P camera — the world’s first camera with Content Credentials built-in. </p><p>This is a significant milestone for the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) and the future of photojournalism: It will usher in a powerful new way for photojournalists and creatives to combat misinformation and bring authenticity to their work and consumers, while pioneering widespread adoption of Content Credentials.&nbsp; </p><p>With manipulated content and misinformation more on the rise than ever, trust in the digital ecosystem has never been more critical. We are entering a new era of creativity, where generative AI is expanding access to powerful new workflows and unleashing our most imaginative ideas. The Leica M11-P launch will advance the CAI’s goal of empowering photographers everywhere to attach Content Credentials to their images at the point of capture, creating a chain of authenticity from camera to cloud and enabling photographers to maintain a degree of control over their art, story and context.</p>

  <p>Leica has implemented the global <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> (C2PA) standard in the M11-P camera so that each image is captured with secure metadata. This means it carries information such as camera make and model, as well as content-specific information including who captured an image and when, and how they did so. Each image captured will receive a digital signature, and the authenticity of images can be easily verified by visiting <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/verify">contentcredentials.org/verify</a> or in the Leica FOTOS app.</p><p>This is a watershed moment for trust and transparency for photographers and creatives – its significance cannot be overstated. This is the realization of a vision the CAI and our members first set out four years ago, transforming principles of trust and provenance into consumer-ready technology. </p><p>With the integration of the CAI framework, Leica will help combat the pervasive issues mis/disinformation and preserve trust in digital content and sources. Further, with this integration, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/10/10/new-content-credentials-icon-transparency">recent announcements at MAX</a>, and the broad availability of our free <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/">open-source tools</a> powering them, Content Credentials are seeing accelerated adoption around the world, including among photojournalists, news outlets, creative professionals, everyday consumers, social media influencers, artists and innovators.</p><p>Adobe co-founded the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) in 2019 to help combat the threat of misinformation and help creators get credit for their work. Today the CAI is a coalition of nearly 2,000 members, including Leica Camera, AFP, the Associated Press, the BBC, Getty Images, Microsoft, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal and more, all working together to add a verifiable layer of transparency and trust to content online – via secure metadata called Content Credentials. </p><p>Between the tremendous momentum in attracting new members and the growing adoption of Content Credentials by leaders spanning multiple industries, the CAI is ensuring that technological innovations are built on ethical foundations.</p><p>Snapshot: How Content Credentials Works </p>  <p>Transparency at the point of capture: We believe the chain of authenticity is strongest at the moment a piece of media is created — being able to verify the circumstances of an image’s origin is the foundation for knowing whether to trust it.</p>  <p>Get credit for your photography work: Content Credentials enable photojournalists and creatives to assert credit for their work, ensuring that wherever one of their images goes, their identity travels indelibly with it.</p>  <p>Bring trust to your digital content with a digital nutrition label: Content Credentials are the digital nutrition label and most widely adopted industry standard for content of all kinds, and the foundation for increased trust and transparency online.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Leica’s M11-P camera will be available globally at all Leica Stores, the Leica Online Store and authorized dealers, starting today.

<p>With the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decentralized-identity-foundation-dif-hackathon-tickets-727930769527?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Hackathon</a> starting on October 26, DIF caught up with Toby Bolton, Founder of .zkdid™ who is looking to collaborate on his innovative use case for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and other DIF work items.&nbsp;</p><p>What is .zkdid?&nbsp;</p><p>.zkdid is an acronym for Zero Knowledge Decentralized Identity. It’s a Decentralized Domain Name System (dDNS) protocol intended to empower the public. It’s also a registered trademark, it’s the name of the project, intended as a mark-of-trust and is a prospective Web3 top-level domain (like .com).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose is to establish a “.zkdid” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Zero Knowledge</a> (ZK) decentralized identity protocol for Web3 that is compliant with government <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) requirements.</p><p>Each address with the .zkdid extension is a unique identifier in the form of a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Non-Fungible Token</a> (NFT) which is resistant to duplication. The goal is to use these identifiers to create a ZK<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood?ref=blog.identity.foundation#:~:text=The%20term%20is%20used%20in,to%20an%20investment%20of%20resources."> Proof of personhood</a> registry and NFT-gated community that is<a href="https://members.delphidigital.io/learn/sybil-resistance?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Sybil resistant</a>. Sybil resistance mechanisms aim to ensure that each participant in a network has a unique and singular identity.</p><p>This creates the basis for a secure, publicly owned/governed, decentralized, zero-knowledge<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Domain Name System</a> (DNS).&nbsp;</p><p>How did the .zkdid initiative come into being, and why are you doing it?&nbsp;</p><p>First and foremost, I worry about the future of my daughters, and how these novel identity technologies could possibly erode human rights and privacy if not deployed with due diligence and care. So I wanted to find the solution to such problems. I’ve been aware for quite a while that identity is a great use case for blockchain. Then zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) became a hot topic. That’s when I got onto the .zkdid path.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea for .zkdid initially came from an online chat where we were discussing the<a href="https://ens.domains/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Ethereum Name Service</a> (ENS). The question I had was, “what is the top-level domain of Web3?”, which sparked quite a debate.&nbsp;</p><p>I believed the top-level domain for Web3 would likely be an identity protocol, and possibly even .zkdid.</p><p>The aim is to connect the public to an identity layer that is not centrally controlled. The details of this decentralized governance identity protocol are still being researched.&nbsp;</p><p>How will .zkdid be different?&nbsp;</p><p>There are quite a few blockchain name services. I wanted to improve on what I had found. ENS is likely the best known dDNS protocol but uses tokenomics for its governance and can be owned anonymously which in my opinion doesn’t work for a proof of personhood protocol. In my view I’m developing an alternative. What I’m building is also an alternative to other proof-of-personhood protocols in the market like<a href="https://worldcoin.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Worldcoin</a> and<a href="https://proofofhumanity.id/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Proof of Humanity</a>.</p><p>The point of .zkdid is to create a decentralized DNS layer, one that is publicly owned by a not for profit foundation, which does not rely on tokenomics that can manipulate leadership of the protocol. These are areas I saw in other protocols that I believe need improving.</p><p>With .zkdid, the identity is the token. Your .zkdid domain name will enable you to prove who you are in the Web3 digital domain without needing to reveal any personal information about yourself. Each person is one token. You are the token.&nbsp;</p><p>How do you see this coexisting with current Identity and DNS systems?</p><p>DNS (Domain Name System) is one of the most widely used internet protocols, most of us use it daily and it’s possible that one day .zkdid can connect the Identity industry to a publicly owned dDNS protocol.</p><p>When I registered .zkdid, I knew it was important that it was secured from every dDNS registrar. Once I registered the domain name, I submitted a Trademark application in the United Kingdom, which was promptly published.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.icann.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">ICANN</a> do not govern decentralized DNS domain names, so a strategy is needed to protect them. However, I understand ICANN are looking into blockchain technologies and it would be a pleasure to have them involved in the project. We are also inline to become a Web3 Domain Alliance (W3DA) member, it’s an important initiative that intends to act as a foundation to inhibit possible dDNS collisions. We need to bring people together. No one should be excluded, .zkdid is meant to be a public good after all.&nbsp;</p><p>What are the next steps for the project?&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, I’ve been collaborating with a <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/essif-train-by-fraunhofer-gesellschaft/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">team at the Fraunhofer Institute</a> that is looking to use the traditional DNS system to create a trust registry of all humans and IoT devices. My vision is to use dDNS and for the public to be issued a .zkdid identifier through the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/discover-eidas?ref=blog.identity.foundation">eIDAS</a> initiative. This means if you are a European citizen, your .zkdid identifier could be connected to your government issued identity.</p><p>This was not the initial objective but as things progressed I learned the only way to achieve our ambitious goal is to integrate with government initiatives like eIDAS.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve now managed to build a great team of enthusiastic developers to work with me on this concept during the<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decentralized-identity-foundation-dif-hackathon-tickets-727930769527?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> DIF Hackathon</a>. To work within the Hackathon rules this first step is likely going to take advantage of the Open Source<a href="https://iden3.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation"> Iden3</a> toolkit. I’m going to suggest we use that, plus relevant DIF work items such as the Universal Resolver, BBS Signature Scheme, DIDComm and Sidetree Protocol. We need to focus on making it multi-chain and interoperable.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m really pleased that Polygon ID is one of the sponsors of the Hackathon, because it was the PolygonID/Iden3 wallet that was the original inspiration for this project. When I first encountered PolygonID I thought it was impressive, very abstract but really clever technology.</p><p>During the Hackathon we will develop this concept into an initial functioning prototype. If the people who join me for the Hackathon subsequently want to team up to form a .zkdid Working Group at DIF to develop the specification, that would be brilliant.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m looking for team members who are pro freedom and human rights, who understand the importance behind decentralized technologies, and have an optimistic and balanced outlook.&nbsp;</p><p>Why have you chosen DIF to host this initiative?&nbsp;</p><p>The opportunity came out of the blue. When I first joined the DIF I was introduced to Andor Kesselman, who chairs the Technical Steering Committee. Andor said “You’ve got a great vision, now let’s start from the beginning.” He asked me to strip down the concept to the basics needed to commence a DIF working group.&nbsp;</p><p>And stripping it back to the bare bones we find a zero-knowledge decentralized DNS system. I always intended .zkdid to be a global mark of trust and an open standard that works with any kind of wallet, identity network and protocol. Now I’m in the DIF, I’ve got an opportunity to be part of the process of defining the specification that may actually become a standard.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like I've been thrown out of the frying pan into the fire, which is a bit overwhelming but exactly what I needed!&nbsp;</p><p>What should people do if they are interested in getting involved?&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, please provide feedback on the idea by contacting Toby on Slack, or via email at <a href="mailto:id@zkdid.io">id@zkdid.io</a> .&nbsp;</p><p>The next step is to join forces with Toby to participate in the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decentralized-identity-foundation-dif-hackathon-tickets-727930769527?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIF Hackathon</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, please let Toby know if you are interested in working with him to establish a new .zkdid Working Group at DIF.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our recent partnership with the Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (<a href="https://cipesa.org/" title="">CIPESA</a>) offers a lens into the workings of an organisation that is taking proactive steps to strengthen their internal practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based in Uganda, CIPESA&nbsp; focuses on decision-making that facilitates the use of ICT in support of good governance, human rights and livelihoods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within the framework of our 6-month Matchbox partnership, CIPESA had three main priorities:</p>



 
 Strengthening their digital communications and documentation infrastructure through guidance on implementation of self-hosted tools that enable autonomy and ownership. 



 Support in platform implementation through guidance on user testing, roll-out and maintenance plans design. 



 Capacity building around responsible data management and organisational security. 
 



 What we discovered 



<p>Our assessment of CIPESA’s current landscape of tools revealed a diverse technological framework consisting in a mix of tools, from conventional email and word processing to collaborative platforms, incorporating a blend of cloud-based and localised storage.</p>



<p>We also looked at CIPESA’s security frameworks and practices, which encompass multifaceted strategies, realised through a mix of practices and tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIPESA are cognisant of research ethics and data handling and were interested in strengthening their <a href="https://responsibledata.io/" title="">Responsible Data Management</a> and data handling practices to further ensure protection of data subjects and sensitive data. They were also interested in strengthening the security of their websites, email, and social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing contextual risk assessments, self-hosted tools, and Responsible Data frameworks&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Recognising the importance of keeping internal communications private, we suggested a shift to a self hosted video conferencing tool (<a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/" title="">Big Blue Button</a>). This platform would also provide resilience against potential restrictions and avoid over-reliance on a third party platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To further streamline CIPESA’s communication with its networks, CIPESA also looked at the adoption of a tool that would foster tailored communications with its large network of stakeholders. One of the platforms we recommended was <a href="https://suitecrm.com/" title="">SuiteCRM</a>, which is open source and can be self-hosted, which aligns with CIPESA values. It also has core features that the organisation&nbsp; is looking for, including creating groups of key stakeholders and setting up consistent targeted communications with them through the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also recommended a thorough contextual risk assessment, to offer clarity on pressing security concerns and ensure that a consistent internal policy is adopted to mitigate these risks. This would also aid in the implementation of tools and practices that will strengthen internal security&nbsp; – such as the adoption of <a href="https://1password.com/" title="">1password</a> for password management.&nbsp;</p>



 Aligning data management with organisational values&nbsp; 



<p>CIPESA wanted to ensure alignment of data management practices with both organisational values and regional data protection regulations. Drawing from resources like The Engine Room’s <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD!</a> guide, we provided guidance about data storage duration, disposal methods, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CIPESA’s work environment relies on various tools and platforms, from cloud based tools to physical files. Amidst this diversity of platforms, the importance of data responsibility –&nbsp; the principle that information collected and generated should be handled responsibly with care and include ownership of organizational data on platforms. This value highlights the importance of self-hosted platforms and also choosing platforms aligned with this principle.</p>



<p>Our assessment helped identify areas and recommended steps to enhance both efficiency and security. CIPESA’s approach, which involves a mix of password protection, two-factor authentication, and data encryption, stands out as a model for organisations looking to navigate the digital space safely.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“The Engine Room’s Matchbox program has been instrumental in helping us identify and address various questions regarding how we handle and manage the data we collect. It has also reaffirmed the need to enhance internal practices especially in an evershifting digital terrain and in a growing community of practice when it comes to the work that we do in advancing digital rights and governance in Africa”</p></blockquote>

 Part 2: Building the workflow and&nbsp;platform CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>In our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-open-recognition-to-map-real-world-skills-and-attributes-1c1109c1b871">previous post</a>, we outlined a different way to do recognition. It’s a way which democratises the means of credentialing, and values each human as a part of community networks. Go and read that first, if you haven’t&nbsp;already.</p> Context <p>The original plan for Part 2 of this series was to show a real-world example of completing the last three steps of a 10-step process,&nbsp;namely:</p>  Come up with the metadata for Open Badges based on your&nbsp;skills  Create badges using an online&nbsp;platform  Ask contacts to endorse your&nbsp;badges  <p>However, after several conversations with badging platforms, we’re still a little early for that. Although they have plans for adopting <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/03/16/verifiable-credentials-and-open-badges-3-0-whats-changed/">v3 of the Open Badges standard</a>, most are not currently planning to use it in the way we’re discussing in this series of&nbsp;posts.</p> Workflow <p>We see a need for a platform that aids individuals in identifying their skills and attributes, supported by their networks and communities. Mapping these attributes against relevant skills taxonomies can make them visible and endorsable, turning them into a form of ‘currency’.</p><p>One of the people we spoke to asked how we would build the system we envisage. We’ve come up with the following workflow (v0.1) to show how that might work technically, and below that there are wireframes showing a basic user&nbsp;journey.</p><p>One important thing to note is that by creating a standardised workflow, even the most introverted person with the smallest network can still find value in the approach.</p><p>A default process, customisable for endorsements, can boost user confidence, as not all are comfortable seeking endorsements.</p> Platform <p>The basic wireframes below show the first part of the workflow and how the individual would get&nbsp;started.</p><p>(Note: in this example we’re providing basic wireframes for the simplest version of the workflow)</p> User onboarding <p>Users sign up, answer three questions, and provide contact details for feedback. Once done, the system emails the contacts for their&nbsp;input.</p> Feedback <p>Contacts are asked to answer three questions similar to those posed to the&nbsp;user.</p> Synthesised Results <p>Users review their results, synthesised by AI. They then map their attributes against skills taxonomies of their&nbsp;choice.</p> Request for Endorsement <p>The next step is for the user to choose which of their attributes they’d like to have endorsed. They can then personalise an endorsement request to their contacts.</p><p>The system then emails contacts again, asking if they’re willing to endorse those specific attributes.</p><p>If they consent, then they are asked which attributes they would like to&nbsp;endorse.</p><p>They can also optionally choose to provide written or multimedia evidence.</p> Verified Profile <p>Users complete their verified profile, which can include any evidence provided by their contacts.</p><p>This verified profile can be shared online and updated over time. This includes the attributes, endorsements, and evidence it contains.</p> Conclusion <p>The possibilities for this kind of approach are far-reaching, as it brings a human-centric approach to credentialing. As you can see by comparing the flowchart and the wireframes, although there are some reasonably-complex things happening behind the scenes, what is presented to the user is relatively simple and straightforward.</p><p>In this post, we’ve outlined the benefits to end users. But there are also benefits to endorsers (who could themselves earn a badges). Perhaps that’s the subject for another blog&nbsp;post…</p><p>We would like someone to build this workflow.

<p>The demand for recycled content and sustainable business practices continues to grow rapidly. Join us as we chat with Jeremy Douglas, Director of Partnerships at Delterra, to learn more about reducing plastic waste, creating enhanced waste streams, and utilizing standards to track plastics throughout the supply chain.</p> <p>Key takeaways:&nbsp;</p>     <p>Traceability and transparency are crucial in the global effort to address plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. Delterra is focusing on establishing traceability for recycled plastic from collection to sale. By ensuring accurate measurement and preventing double counting, traceability can boost confidence in using recycled materials and support brands in tracking the origin of recycled plastic in their products.</p>     <p>Consumer pressure and advocacy have played a significant role in driving change in the waste and recycling systems. This has pushed brands to take action and seek alternatives, such as using more recycled materials. With consumers and stakeholders informed, companies are motivated to improve their plastic footprints and adopt more sustainable practices.</p>     <p>A global plastics agreement is being negotiated among 175 countries to address plastic pollution effectively. The agreement aims to create a binding document or instrument to end plastic pollution, similar to the structure of the climate change agreement. Themes such as eliminating unnecessary plastics and considering the impact on the informal sector are being discussed.&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with GS1 US:</p> <p>Our website - <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes?gclid=CjwKCAjwrdmhBhBBEiwA4Hx5g-YRJDMnWMGlYHx4BVA6paGhhat5XlyMsjwCNulVASbEothRP8QRbRoCSu8QAvD_BwE"> www.gs1us.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gs1-us/">GS1 US on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Connect with guests:</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremydouglas/?originalSubdomain=ca">Follow Jeremy Douglas on LinkedIn</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: Schnorr signatures have been a long time coming, but now that <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1716919363729801494">they’re finally here</a>, they open up broad new cryptographic frontiers, including the improved privacy of signature aggregation and blind signatures, the improved power of threshold signatures and adapter signatures, and much more. This article explores some of those frontiers and also offers a simplified look at how Schnorr works.</p>
</blockquote>



 What’s Sigs Got To Do With It? 

<blockquote>
  <p>I was introduced to prime numbers in the third grade, when I “discovered” them accidentally, and a great teacher encouraged me to explore them further. Conversely, I learned about finite fields between my Junior and Senior years of High School, when I was offered the chance at taking a college course over the summer and had to find something that didn’t depend on Calculus, which I hadn’t yet taken.</p>

  <p>I didn’t know it at the time, but I was delving into the mathematical foundations of two powerful signature systems: RSA and Schnorr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the  world of digital communication, a pressing question often arises: how can we trust and authenticate digital messages? The answer is to use digital signatures.</p>

<p>Digital signatures function similarly to a seal of authenticity on a physical document, but for digital content. They assure the recipient of the message’s integrity and the sender’s authenticity. There are many methods for signatures, with RSA and Schnorr being the best known. They mostly rely on public-key cryptography: a signer uses his private key for a signature, which can then be verified with a public key.</p>

 The Schnorr Legacy 

<blockquote>
  <p>I discovered RSA, which secures its signatures using prime numbers, in college. But it was when I later encountered Schnorr, built on finite fields, that I met the first cryptography that I truly fell in love with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claus-Peter Schnorr introduced Schnorr signatures in the early 1990s. They were not the first digital signature, but they had a strong mathematical foundation:&nbsp;they were provably secure under specific assumptions. They were invented later that other systems like RSA, but they provided a number of new benefits including:</p>

 
   Compactness —&nbsp;Schnorr signatures are small, even when there are multiple signers. 
   Signature Aggregation — Multiple signatures can be aggregated together and look exactly like a single signature. 
   Faster Verification — Because of their small size (and the fact that aggregating multisigs doesn’t increase that size), Schnorr signatures can be verified quickly. 
   Threshold Signatures — Multisignatures requiring a certain quorum of participants are possible. 
   Blind Signatures — Signatures can be made while hiding the content. 
   Adapter Signatures — Signatures can be hidden by other values. 
 

 Beyond the Fields We Know 

<blockquote>
  <p>Beyond all of their new benefits, I fell in love with Schnorr signatures because they were elegant. The aggregation of signatures was done with simple mathematical operations. You added two signatures together and they were aggregated! Or, you could subtract any signature from an aggregate sum! But perhaps I shouldn’t say “simple” mathematical operations: Schnorr signatures depend on finite field math.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of finite fields as domains where numbers play by a unique set of rules. Each field is constrained to only contain certain numbers, usually defined by the letter <code>p</code>. The field then defines basic mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication such that if the operands are within the finite field, then the result of an operation on those operands will also lie within the finite field.</p>

<p>As it happens, the elliptic curves used for most modern cryptography are defined over finite fields. The finite fields act as a modulo to the curve, ensuring that the results of all operations on the curve fall within the field.</p>

 
   Bitcoin’s <code>secp256k1</code> works within the bounds of:
     
       <code>[ p = 2^{256} - 2^{32} - 977 ]</code> 
     
   
   Curve25519, popular in key exchanges, operates around:
     
       <code>[ p = 2^{255} - 19 ]</code> 
     
   
 

 Schnorr like an Eagle 

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was working as CTO of Certicom, I contacted the holders of the Schnorr patent about licensing it, but they wanted impossible terms. I assume it was the same for others who tried to use the cryptography at the time.</p>

  <p>Those patent restrictions ultimately held back Schnorr signatures from broader acceptance until their expiration in 2008. Even afterward, there wasn’t a quick move to Schnorr, despite its advantages, because ECDSA was mature, while there wasn’t yet any good code for Schnorr. I sometimes wonder where we might be today if Bitcoin had mined its Genesis block four or five years after the expiration of the Schnorr patents, rather than a scant 11 months later.</p>

  <p>When I was working at Blockstream, following the expiration of the Schnorr patent, I pestered our engineers about Schnorr. I was happy to then be at the conference where the MuSig multiple-signature system was first rolled out, using Schnorr and a multi-stage signing system that addressed some of the challenges of the powerful signature technology. The security was quickly broken, but that was just a first step, before the release of next-generation Schnorr systems such as MuSig 2 and FROST.</p>

  <p>It’s taken a few decades, but due to their simplicity and robustness, we are at last in a future where Schnorr signatures are possible. We can at last implement the many possibilities that I couldn’t even imagine when I first met finite fields, in that summer class years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a new technology, Schnorr has pitfalls and “footguns” that even now might not be fully understood. They need to carefully reviewed before the technology can be safely used.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest challenges of Schnorr have included:</p>

 
   Naive Aggregation:
 Merging signatures without verification is risky. Combining known good signatures with an adversary’s signature can actually nullify a signature as a whole because of the additive nature of Schnorr signatures. Advanced measures can prevent such issues. 
   Replay Attacks:
 Without unique transaction data, a valid signature can be maliciously reused. The solution? Incorporate distinct transaction information within signatures. 
   Malleability:
 An adversary might slightly alter a good signature while maintaining its validity. Contemporary protocols ensure signatures are consistent and resistant to changes. 
 

<p>Today, two major solutions address the challenges of Schnorr signatures, allowing users to take advantage of their many features:</p>

 
   MuSig2: A scheme focusing on multi-signatures. It addresses the issue of naive aggregation by ensuring individual participants cannot manipulate the combined public key. It only requires two rounds of communication to be completed between the parties. However, it restricts itself to N-of-N signatures, disallowing threshold schemes (except perhaps in a variant that creates a Merkle tree of MuSigs). Major advantages includes accountability and  key generation being noninteractive. 
   FROST: A versatile Schnorr threshold signature strategy, allowing a quorum to sign without revealing which members did so, increasing privacy and efficiency. It however, requires the completion of three rounds of communication by the parties before use. Major advantages include the ability to use Shamir protocols for refreshing shares, repairing lost shares, and enrollment and disenrollment of participants. The <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/">Zcash Foundation implementation of FROST</a> has recently received a successful <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/10/23/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">security assessment</a>. Their <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/frost.html">Understanding FROST article</a> is also a nice, brief overview of the technology. 
 

 Schnorr in a Nutshell (8 Bits) 

<p>The following examples offer a layman’s explanation of Schnorr and its operations using an 8-bit model, which is to say an imaginary finite field that ranges from 0 to 255. This sort of finite field is easily managed by applying a modulo to all the operations. In this example, addition and subtraction operations would be finalized by applying “modulo 256”, ensuring that the result remains within the field.</p>

<p>Obviously, practical cryptographic applications work with much larger numbers, which helps to ensure their security, but these small numbers can make examples much easier to read and understand.</p>

 Generating Public Keys 

<p>For any signature, the first requirement is generating a public key from a secret private key. Here’s a simplified 8-bit example:</p>

 
   Private Key: Start with a private key, for example, Alice’s private key is <code>50</code>. 
   Constant: Multiply it by a constant number, say <code>5</code>. 
   Public Key: The result, (<code>50 x 5 = 250</code>), becomes Alice’s public key. 
 

<p>Seems straightforward, right? The catch is that the mathematical definitions of the actual finite fields and the operations used by Schnorr ensure that division is almost impossible: if someone only has the public key (<code>250</code>) and the constant (<code>5</code>), working backwards to figure out our private key is more challenging than the reverse because of this special math.</p>

<p>This difficulty to reverse is what makes this cryptography “asymmetric”, which is crucial for security. It’s like baking a cake; once you have the final product, it’s very difficult to determine the exact ingredients and their quantities.</p>

 Creating Signatures 

<p>Imagine Alice wants to send Bob a secure message. Here’s how she would do it using the Schnorr signature system:</p>

 
   Private Key: Alice has a secret number, which she never shares with anyone. Let’s say this number is <code>50</code>. 
   Message: Alice has a message. It could be anything, from a simple greeting to a bank transaction. In the digital world, this message can be represented as a number. 
   Random Figure: Alice picks a random number for each new message she wants to sign. Let’s say she picks <code>20</code> for this particular message. 
   Signature Calculation: She then uses her private key, the random number, and her message to do some special math, which creates a unique signature for that message. In our 8-bit example, this math might lead to a signature like <code>150</code>. This signature is unique to the message and Alice’s private key; even a small change in the message would produce a vastly different signature. 
   Sending: Alice sends her message and the signature (<code>150</code>) to Bob, but keeps her private key and random number secret. 
 

 Verifying Signatures 

<p>Now, let’s say Bob receives Alice’s message and the signature she produced. To be certain that it’s truly from Alice and hasn’t been tampered with, he needs to verify the signature:</p>

 
   Public Key: Everyone knows Alice’s public key (like a public email address). In our example, this is <code>250</code>. Alice would’ve previously derived this public key from her private key using some more special math and made it publicly available. 
   Verification: Using the signature Alice sent (<code>150</code>), her public key (<code>250</code>), and the original message, Bob does his own math. (Though a private key can’t be easily calculated from a public key, it is easy to determine that a signature matches a known public key using Schnorr’s special math.) If Bob’s calculations match the signature Alice sent, then he knows two things for sure: the message truly came from Alice (because she’s the only one with the private key that matches the public key that Bob tested against); and the message hasn’t been tampered with (because the signature matched perfectly). 
   Outcome: Since Bob’s math using the public key and the message matched Alice’s signature, he’s assured of the message’s legitimacy. 
 

<p>In a nutshell, Alice uses her private key to “stamp” a message, and Bob uses her public key to verify that “stamp.” The beauty of Schnorr signatures is that these calculations are simple (compared to other digital signature methods), yet remain secure, making them a favorite in many cryptographic applications.</p>

 Creating Sequential Multisigs 

<p>Imagine a scenario where endorsements need to be made in a particular order, much like a relay race where one athlete passes the baton to the next. This is a simple form of multisignature that any signature system is likely to support.</p>

 
   Initial Endorsement: Alice wants to sign a document, let’s say a declaration. She does her special math with her private key and the message to produce a signature, which for simplicity, we’ll say is <code>150</code>. 
   Subsequent Endorsement: Bob, having seen Alice’s endorsement, decides he wants to endorse her action. He takes Alice’s signed declaration and adds his signature to it. Bob’s endorsement, perhaps, produces a signature of <code>75</code>. 
   Sequential Result: Now, the document carries both signatures, <code>150</code> from Alice followed by <code>75</code> from Bob, indicating a clear sequence: first Alice, then Bob. 
 

 Creating Aggregate Multisigs 

<p>However, Schnorr signatures can be much more powerful than most traditional signature systems. They allow for aggregate signatures, where parties can sign in any order they want and jointly endorse a message.</p>

 
   Individual Signatures: Alice and Bob both want to co-sign a document. Alice, with her special math and private key, creates a signature, say <code>150</code>. Bob, independently, generates his signature, which might be <code>75</code>. 
   Aggregation: Using Schnorr’s unique properties, these two signatures can be combined. Instead of appending one after the other, Schnorr adds the two together, possibly producing a single value of <code>225</code>. 
   Aggregate Result: The document now has one composite signature, <code>225</code>. Anyone verifying this knows both Alice and Bob endorsed it, but there’s no distinction about who signed first. 
 

 Creating Threshold Signatures 

<p>In scenarios where a group decision is required, threshold signatures (or quorum signature aggregation) shines. It allows a subset of a larger group to sign a document, indicating a collective endorsement.</p>

 
   Group Dynamics: Imagine a council of five members. For some decisions, the endorsement of all members isn’t necessary. Instead, only a majority, say three members, is sufficient. 
   Individual Signatures: Three members, Alice, Bob, and Carol decide to endorse a statement. Their signatures might be <code>150</code>, <code>75</code>, and <code>30</code> respectively. 
   Aggregation: With Schnorr, these signatures can be aggregated into a single composite signature, possibly <code>255</code>. 
   Collective Result: This single signature, <code>255</code>, stands testament that a quorum of the council endorsed the statement. Verifiers don’t necessarily know which three members endorsed it, only that at least three did. 
 

 Advanced Schnorr Techniques 

<p>Because of the power of Schnorr, there are even more possibilities:</p>

 
   Blind Signatures:
Vital for preserving privacy. Bob wants Alice’s signature without revealing the message (let’s say <code>50</code>). By altering it slightly, like by adding <code>5</code>, he disguises it. Alice then signs this modified message (<code>55</code>), and Bob later extracts the initial signature. 
   Key Aggregation:
Combines multiple public keys into one. With Alice’s key at <code>250</code> and Bob’s at <code>5</code>, the combined key might be <code>255</code>. 
   Adapter Signatures:
This combines secret communication with validation. Alice holds a confidential number, say <code>20</code>. Bob communicates with her, and as she signs, she discloses her secret as part of the signature. 
 

<p>Even this just skims thes surface of possibilities. Further complexities include the use of hashes, commitments, challenges, and more complex threshold schemes.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Schnorr is an incredibly powerful toolbox. Techniques such as signature aggregation, collective multisigs, blind signatures, key aggregation, and adapter signatures demonstrate the flexibility of Schnorr while maintaining its ease of use and efficiency as well as the integrity and authenticity of the messages. The result is a wide variety of endorsement dynamics that will support many different use cases.</p>

<p>Now that MuSig and FROST are increasingly mature, these many dynamics and use cases, which have been waiting in the wings for more than 20 years, can finally be a reality.</p>

<p>I believe that it’s truly a cryptographic revolution, as important as many of the ones that have come before.</p>

<p>Kia ora e te whānau</p>



<p>You would have heard digital wallets mentioned almost every week, if not every day, over the past couple of years. They formed part of the discussion on this&nbsp;<a href="https://lnkd.in/eXsn7Pb2">International Panel</a>&nbsp;I participated in very early one morning last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As conversations build on each other and as we increasingly use banking apps, Apple Pay or Google Pay when shopping, you might ask yourself how hard can it be when I see how many apps I have on my smartphone? Right there, is a challenge around scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most phone apps have a 1:1 relationship with the job they do – an app for our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anz.co.nz/banking-with-anz/ways-to-bank/gomoney/">bank</a>, our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newworld.co.nz/app">supermarket,</a>&nbsp;our<a href="https://kiwiaccess.co.nz/">&nbsp;photo ID,</a><a href="https://covid19.govt.nz/testing-and-isolation/contact-tracing/nz-covid-tracer-app/">contact tracing</a>&nbsp;and so on. We don’t carry 50 wallets each with one physical credential in each of them. That’s why the digital equivalent seems a bit ridiculous! This cannot scale to deliver you a great consumer experience for a future where for many people, their interactions will be mostly digital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another challenge is around security, data protection and privacy. How secure is the binding between you and your smartphone and the apps and wallets contained within it? That starts with high quality digital identification but extends into managing situations like coercion, or how to nullify the features on the phone if it’s lost or stolen. These problems can be complex, expensive and time consuming to mitigate against, meaning that developing and operating a commercially viable universally trusted digital wallet will not be for the faint-hearted (global platforms excepted but with the related considerations they may bring).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consequently, alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.daon.com/products/verifly/">specifically purposed</a>&nbsp;private sector wallets we may see the public sector in some jurisdictions<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/france-germany-launch-works-on-eu-digital-wallet-in-paris/">&nbsp;taking a role in aspects of their development</a>&nbsp;– be it interoperable open standards and code libraries or a completely built digital wallet – for its people. This&nbsp;<a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/showcase/">demo</a>&nbsp;from global thought leaders the Province of British Columbia peeks into the possible future (you need to download the BC Wallet app from the App Store or Google Play and read the privacy notice and terms &amp; conditions).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an aside, Digital Identity NZ was amongst the first associate sponsors of the&nbsp;<a href="https://openwallet.foundation/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, the only sponsor in this part of the world, to promote OWF’s outputs in Aotearoa for adoption as we travel the world. While not the only approach, the fact that the state often holds the authoritative identity data (e.g. date and place of birth, citizenship etc) and commercial viability of digital wallets could be a lower priority by considering it a public good, the state may be best placed to provision these high trust cryptographically protected attributes onto a smartphone’s private or public sector developed digital wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, it will have to be trusted by us and by relying parties to be useful across a wide range of online transactions transcending our daily lives. Of course to maintain trust and integrity, the system will have to be architected in a way that after the authoritative attributes are provisioned to the smartphone’s digital wallet, the issuer doesn’t see or know where they are used. So where the state is the issuer, its responsibility ends there except for the rare instances of revoking or restoring compromised attributes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might ask why you should care? You should care because in return for having determination over your personal data in a digital wallet on your smartphone you will have to use it thoughtfully.&nbsp;Since your smartphone’s digital wallet will hold the attributes and you decide when and to whom you release them, there will be very few parties to hold responsible if things go wrong.

 Digital identity application developed by Elia Group and Energy Web, which will support interactions between flexible assets and the grid, adopted as a new project by OpenWallet Foundation <p>Together, Elia Group and Energy Web have developed an application which can be seamlessly integrated into digital wallets, making it easily adoptable by a wide range of companies</p><p>Brussels, Berlin, Zug, Switzerland — October 23, 2023 — The OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) has officially adopted a digital identity application which was developed by Elia Group and Energy Web as a new project. The application, which can be used to securely transfer identity information between different parties (including details about their flexible assets), can be easily integrated into digital wallet technology. Digital wallets are set to become commonplace; indeed, the European Union aims to provide all its citizens with access to a digital ID solution by&nbsp;2030.</p><p>Flexible consumption demands secure identification<br>Our energy systems are becoming increasingly decentralised, driven by the rise in renewable energy sources and electrical assets. Flexible assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles will enable consumers to adapt their energy use in line with the needs of the system: consumers will be able to charge these when affordable green electricity is available, store it for later use, and (in the case of electric vehicles and home batteries) feed it back into the grid when needed. In so doing, consumers will help to keep the grid in balance and will support the integration of renewable energy into the system, so accelerating the energy transition.</p><p>Secure and efficient methods will be required to safely integrate electrical assets into the system and allow them to interact with the grid in a trusted manner. Extensive information exchange will need to take place, with data relating to personal details, technical specifications, contracts and charging tariffs being swapped between individuals, assets, and companies. Digital wallets, which are on the verge of becoming commonplace across Europe, are expected to be key enablers of this data exchange.</p><p>Elia Group and Energy Web have been collaborating on projects related to the integration of electrical assets into electricity systems for a number of&nbsp;years.</p><p>A digital wallet for every citizen<br>In line with its digital goals for Europe, the European Commission is working towards ensuring that all of its citizens will be able to use a personal digital wallet. One technology that can facilitate the design of these digital wallets is self-sovereign identity (SSI), a highly secure approach that enables identity-related information to be safely verified and exchanged between different parties.</p><p>SSI systems typically involve three core&nbsp;roles:</p>  the holder, who manages data related to their identity by storing it in their digital&nbsp;wallet;  the issuer, who is responsible for issuing the holder with identity-related data, often in the form of ‘verifiable credentials’;  the verifier, or party which requires access to identity-related data.  <p>Recognising the potential power of SSI, Elia Group and Energy Web began collaborating on the design of a digital identity application based on a pre-existing specification: the verifiable credential application programming interface (VC API) specification. Their software enables signed identity documents (stored on digital wallets as verifiable credentials) to be exchanged between an individual’s digital wallet and a third party. Elia Group and Energy Web chose to design their application based on a pre-existing specification that is familiar to a majority of companies. This means their solution can be easily integrated into a wide range of existing IT frameworks as companies design different digital wallets. Elia Group and Energy Web’s aim is to encourage energy companies, particularly small- and medium-sized energy companies, to adopt&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>“To ensure network security and stability, the integration of renewable energy sources into our energy systems will require household and industrial flexibility to be activated. SSI will be an important tool for creating a registry of decentralised and flexible assets that will allow us to monitor the state of the network and steer these decentralised assets.” Kris Laermans, Innovation at Elia&nbsp;Group</blockquote><p>OWF adopts Elia Group and Energy Web’s innovative solution as a new project<br>Once the application was ready, Elia Group and EnergyWeb approached OWF, an organisation which promotes the implementation and use of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet technology. The OWF then adopted the application as an OWF project, making it the fourth time such a solution has been accepted by the organisation since its formation in February 2023. This will help the application to be widely used by companies as they design digital&nbsp;wallets.</p><blockquote>“This collaborative effort between Elia Group, Energy Web, and the OpenWallet Foundation represents a significant step toward revolutionising the digital wallet landscape. By officially accepting this project, OWF is empowering the future of secure and interoperable digital wallets. Together, we’re advancing technology that will not only benefit the energy sector but also drive innovation beyond its boundaries, setting the stage for a more interconnected and secure digital world.” John Henderson, Senior Solution Architect at Energy&nbsp;Web</blockquote><p>GitHub documentation, which includes the code for the project, can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/energywebfoundation/vc-api-owf">here</a>.</p><p>Elia Group<br>Elia Group is an international energy company that comprises two transmission system operators.

 Background: Co-leadership 



<p>At the end of this year, The Engine Room’s Executive Director, Julia Keseru, will be leaving after being at the organisation for the last eight years. The Engine Room’s Board of Directors is excited to announce that going forward The Engine Room will formally adopt a model of co-leadership based on the learnings and work of the current leadership team.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a title="">Read letters from the board and from Julia </a>  



 <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/learning-from-co-leadership/" title="">Read more about The Engine Room’s experience with co-leadership</a>. 
 



<p>The Engine Room is a non-profit organisation with a distributed global team of experienced and committed activists, researchers, technologists and community organisers. Working alongside frontline organisations, we use the power of technology, data and research to advance our vision. We build evidence, strengthen capacity, and connect movements.&nbsp; Learn more about us and our work at <a href="http://www.theengineroom.org" title="">theengineroom.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-leadership looks different for every leader and every organisation. While the norm is still the single-leader model — whether in a corporate setting or small local NGOs — we believe that for The Engine Room, a shared-leadership approach can be more responsive to context, leverage the skills and capacities of individuals, and result in a more resilient organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a formal process, The Engine Room’s Board of Directors has offered one of the co-ED positions to Paola Mosso, a Deputy Director at TER. Paola has been with The Engine Room for eight years. She is embedded in various local and global activist communities and has deep expertise in digital ecosystems, online infrastructures, emerging and justice-focused technologies and feminist approaches to digital resilience. She brings a journalistic eye to how we talk about our work and is an integrator of approaches when it comes to creating local change. She is deeply committed to the co-leadership model and championed its implementation at TER.</p>



 Role Description 



<p>The Engine Room is soliciting applications for a Co-Executive Director. If you apply, we will want to engage with you as a person and hear your vision as it connects to our mission and our defining measures of success. For us this is more important than a list of characteristics and skills. In addition to our core mission and current work, a few key issues are important to our future:</p>



 
 The intersection of research and social justice is important to us. TER is looking to shift its approach to research so that it is tied more closely to its community work and honouring a strong local point of view.&nbsp; 



 Our latest approach to fundraising is working for us. We are committed to balancing project-specific, fee-for-service funds and grants, program funding, and unrestricted support for the organisation.

<p>A letter from The Engine Room’s Board, and a message from our Executive Director, Julia </p>



 



<p>Letter from the TER Board </p>



<p>October 18, 2023</p>



<p>Dear Friends, Partners, and Supporters of The Engine Room,</p>



<p>Today we are announcing that Julia Keseru is leaving The Engine Room at the end of this year. We are deeply grateful to Julia for the work she has done and the legacy she built during her tenure. With Julia’s leadership The Engine Room expanded its services and support portfolio, attracted diverse funding and partnerships, and deepened its impact in multiple regions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Julia joined the team in 2015 and has been our Executive Director since 2018. You can read more about the reasons for her transition and what she is going to do next in her letter below. We thank Julia for her passion and investment that helped The Engine Room grow into what it is today, and we wish her the best in her future endeavours. While she will be greatly missed, we are eager to see what she does next!</p>



<p>Moving forward, we are excited to announce that TER will formally adopt a model of co-leadership based on the learnings and work of the current leadership team, who have cultivated a shared leadership approach since Julia’s health crisis two years ago. This started when we brought in Gillian Williams as our Interim Executive Director during Julia’s medical leave. As Julia eased back into work, Gillian and Julia developed a model for sharing leadership. Together with co-Deputy Directors Paola Mosso and Laura Guzmán, they formed a committed, diverse, thoughtful senior leadership team who dug deep into feminist and shared leadership. They’ve written about it in a recent <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/learning-from-co-leadership/" title="">blog</a>.</p>



<p>We have spent time reflecting on co-leadership and the future of the field, and engaged in developing the core tenets of what we are looking for in leadership for the organisation. Over the summer we created a process of candidate recruitment, interviewing, and selection. We were excited when Paola expressed interest in co-leading The Engine Room, and she formally interviewed with us through this process. We are pleased to announce that we have selected her as one of the two co-Executive Directors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paola has been with The Engine Room for eight years. She is embedded in various local and global activist communities and has deep expertise in digital ecosystems, online infrastructures, emerging technologies and justice-focused technologies. Please join us in congratulating her for this new role and wishing her the best!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today we are also announcing our formal search for the co-Executive Director. You can learn more about it in the <a title="">posting here</a>. We’re excited about this search, and look forward to hearing from all of you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Best regards,</p>



<p>Ivan Sigal, Chair <br>Elizabeth Lindsey <br>Maria Baron<br>Elizabeth Eagen<br>Isabela Fernandes</p>



 



<p>Message from our ED, Julia </p>



<p>Eight years ago I joined a team that I admired from afar but didn’t know deeply – the one thing I was certain of was that The Engine Room was doing things very differently than others. Under Alix Dunn’s visionary and compassionate leadership, I found myself in a completely distributed global team that was functional and fun to be a part of. From the first moment I knew that this was going to be a long-term relationship and that I came across something rare and magical: a team that makes me motivated and happy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a few years, I found myself at the&nbsp; wheel of the same team. Leading an organisation like TER was a dream come true for me. And little did I know how transformative the past five years were going to be.</p>



<p>Two years into my tenure the pandemic hit and while The Engine Room weathered the storm of the global health crisis, it was not without scars – my own personal ones included. My daughter was only one when I became ED and I learned the hard way how difficult it is to be an involved parent and a responsible leader at the same time. Then two years ago I was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and had to step out of the work to go through a series of invasive treatments and surgeries. I am happy to report that my health is in great shape right now, but the past two years have dramatically changed my perspective on life.</p>



<p>Most importantly, I realised that I care deeply about how people exist in the world as physical entities – what our true bodily boundaries are, how we can meaningfully coexist with each other in ways that uphold our dignity, and how we create systems that support autonomy and integrity. As I dove deeper into corporeal philosophy, bioethics, bodily integrity and cyberfeminism, I developed a tremendous appetite to learn new things, venture into new arenas and experiment with new ideas and ways of being and working. I also learned that I have meaningful things to say about how our bodies exist in a digital era – things that significantly build on The Engine Room’s legacy but that might go beyond its mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this period I also fully comprehended that time is precious and our existence on this planet is very short – which led me to my decision to transition out of The Engine Room by the end of the year, and pursue my dreams in different avenues. I feel incredibly proud of the things we have achieved in the past decade, bittersweet about saying goodbye to this team, and massively inspired by the potential and resilience of The Engine Room as an institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while I know I contributed to that potential in significant ways, I am also deeply aware that individuals alone can never make long-lasting change. The Engine Room is a rare gem because of the collaboration, dedication and diverse viewpoints that make up our DNA – thinking in communities and ecosystems is ingrained in our work and makes us who we are today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I consider myself extremely lucky to have been able to work with the smart, sweet and thoughtful individuals who made up The Engine Room and I owe special thanks to Alix, Anneke, Zara, Laura, Paola and Gillian for their brilliance, comradery, compassion, ethics and comedic timing. I found tremendous intellectual and emotional inspiration in these women and I wish every leader had the opportunity to share the joys and burdens of leadership with such partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I feel calm, proud and relieved to be able to leave the organisation in the fantastic hands of Paola and her co-leader to come. Continuing the co-leadership model is something I believe is right for TER and for the field.&nbsp; Paola and I joined The Engine Room almost the same time and we worked together in many different variations. We supported organisations with their tech platforms, designed myriad projects together and raised funds successfully. We organised events and facilitated conversations and co-wrote proposals, strategies and hundreds of other documents. Most importantly, we spent quality time together in random Airbnbs, airports and trains, talking and talking and talking endlessly about the world we want to live in, the work that needs to happen to get there, and all the things in life that motivate us to get up each day with passion and diligence.</p>



<p>In the past eight years I got to know Paola as a thoughtful, creative, value-driven and incredibly visionary person, someone whose thinking is both inspiring and grounding in my own work. I am beyond excited to see where she and the team are going next, and routing for their success all along the way.</p>



<p>And what will I do next? Like I said before, I am in an experimental mode and very much enjoying it. Next year I will dedicate my time to pursue the DataBody Integrity – my research oriented fellowship at the Mozilla Foundation that allows me to dig deeper into the politics of bodies in the digital era. Besides that, I am trying to support more organisations in my home country, Hungary, flex my coaching muscles, and grab every opportunity to have fun with my family and explore the world. When we get closer I’ll share more about my work! </p>

<p>In the midst of the city of Vancouver, a company stands, unwavering and bold. Lions Gate Digital. The sun rises, casting a golden light on the future they aim to shape. They have a <a href="https://lionsgate.io/prospectus/">prospectus</a>. It’s not just any piece of paper. It’s a promise. A commitment. $2.2 million USD from 10,000 shares. Tokenized. A Security Token Offering (STO). Each share a beacon for what’s coming.</p>



<p>The landscape of the digital world is vast, sometimes treacherous. Yet, this company does not waver. They’ve seen the horizon, the potential of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). It’s the future, and they aim to harness it. An army is forming, not of soldiers, but of believers. Believers in a decentralized world. The Lions Gate Digital Army.</p>



<p>Self-sovereign. The word resonates. It speaks of independence, of control. In a world overflowing with data, with information, one’s identity is paramount. And to control it, to truly own it, is power.</p>



<p>The enlistment is open. To join is to believe. To see the potential, the vision. The company seeks pioneers, adventurers. Those willing to embark on this digital journey. For they know the path won’t always be easy, but it will be worth it.</p>



<p>With the dawn, there’s hope. The company’s vision, their mission, is clear. They’re not merely introducing a STO. They’re inviting the world to see what they see, to dream what they dream.</p>



<p>In the end, it’s more than just an investment. It’s a movement. A call to arms in a digital age. The Lions Gate Digital Army. The future is theirs to shape, and they’re inviting all to join.</p>



<p>To the brave, to the visionaries: the prospectus is ready. The future awaits.</p>

 Insights into WAO’s coaching techniques for effective presentations and workshops <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of our work is collaborating with organisations that are passionate about making a positive impact in the world. Earlier this year, we had the opportunity to work with Change.org to support them with workshop design and presentation development. In this post we’ll share some of the techniques we used to help, so you can use them in your organisation, too!</p>change.org logo<p><a href="https://change.org">Change.org</a> is a global platform that empowers people to create change in their communities and beyond. Their mission is to build a world where no one is powerless and where creating change is a part of everyday life. With this mission, it’s no wonder that they wanted the workshops and presentations of their 2023 offsite to empower&nbsp;people.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<blockquote>At Change, we have a unique opportunity to give a more powerful voice to hundreds of millions of people in order to build more participatory and responsive democracies. We want to live up to our mission and incorporate these principles into everything that we do so that we can create tools and resources that are authentic for people using our platform. We know that being involved in digital activism takes courage, intention and planning, many of the soft skills that we hope to strengthen internally amongst our Product Team. — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamjessklein/">Jess Klein</a>, Director of&nbsp;Design</blockquote><p>We’ve created slide decks for <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16jvdbbTHuRtbA72seHwrI48tckcgyvxHhf00sHTQvLs/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">creating</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MIVsO5kaMiN8bhSwdF9vYMliC5klFKzl63jCpzil_y0/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">preparing</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_12RxeZrt3k2PIqiKn3bi97od6bBxifBPIOR8VrXwlI/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">running</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sz0OT0mp-_YWuy2AB4Jr125rf5lgPbVkxDuwcjXJLEw/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">recovering from</a> sessions as well as one for <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17R7OWgy-8Cme_EphWHrlLu0eKf9QtgC8r0BGU2WqrbU/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">general tips</a>.

If you’d prefer to see these tips all at once <a href="https://bit.ly/3VZE1Ju">check out our monster slide&nbsp;deck</a>!</p> Creating your session&nbsp;plan <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16jvdbbTHuRtbA72seHwrI48tckcgyvxHhf00sHTQvLs/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part&nbsp;1</a></p><p>No-one likes a boring speaker or workshop. So your aim should be to create a session that is participatory, so that you can co-design solutions and outputs with others. “Participatory” means that a workshop invites input. Instead of “presenting” information, the facilitator asks participants to help solve problems.</p><p>Using participatory practices leads to better solutions, more inspiration and more collaboration. Creation isn’t passive, and “participatory” does not mean formless. A structure we like to use in workshops can be summarised as “Future, Present, Past”. You say what you’re going to do (future), do what you’re going to do (present) and then say what you did&nbsp;(past).</p><p>Here’s a list of questions to ask yourself when you are creating your session&nbsp;plan:</p>  How do you want people to feel in your&nbsp;session?  What outputs do you want and why do these outputs matter to&nbsp;others?  How can you ensure that everyone is able to contribute equally?  How can you use your presentation or introduction to get people thinking?  What can people DO that will help you move your work&nbsp;forward?  What instructions can you give that guide the conversations and help your participants produce valuable insights?  How can you time-box share outs so that each group gets a chance to&nbsp;share?  How will you model this reflective activity for your participants?  What can people do to stay involved with you and your&nbsp;work?   Create your slide&nbsp;deck <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MIVsO5kaMiN8bhSwdF9vYMliC5klFKzl63jCpzil_y0/edit#slide=id.g21c1c851c4c_0_190">Speaking and Facilitation: Tips &amp; Tricks: Part&nbsp;2</a></p><p>Even in a participatory session, you’ll want to have some visual guidance. This will help people remember the reason they’re there and what problems they should be trying to solve. What you put on your screen isn’t there to prompt you but rather to prompt your audience.</p><p>Use stories, anecdotes, and analogies to bring your talk to life. Keep things visual as a picture paints a thousand words (and makes it easier for you to remember what you wanted to&nbsp;say!)</p><p>Question to think about for good deck of&nbsp;slides:</p>  What is essential for people to understand about your problem area so that they can contribute solutions?  How can your slide deck serve your colleagues after the&nbsp;session?  What questions do you want the audience to ask after you’re done presenting?  cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO Promote your&nbsp;session <p>Now that you’ve spent so much time crafting your session, now you need to get people to attend. The more minds, the merrier! The best collaborative sessions include diverse perspectives to ensure that solutions and ideas speak to the broadest range of&nbsp;people.</p><p>You’ll want to tell people about your session, so that you get lots of input and lots of output. Don’t be afraid to promote your excellent planning!</p><p>Questions to consider:</p>  Who are your&nbsp;allies?  Can you summarise the context, need and outcome in just 3&nbsp;bullets?  How can your entire organisation or sector benefit from the outputs of your&nbsp;session?   Run a mini pre-mortem cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO<p>There are some things we can control and some things that we can’t. Thinking about what could go wrong in advance is a good way to prepare yourself for different eventualities. Some things we can prevent, whereas some things we can only mitigate. For example, we might be able to prevent the session running over, but we would only be able to mitigate a problem with the room we’re scheduled to be&nbsp;in.</p><p>Running a mini ‘pre-mortem’ creates a psychologically-safe space to take a look at your session and inherent risks. All you do is imagine it’s after the session is over and imagine that the session was a failure. The job of the pre-mortem is to identify in advance why that might&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Questions to help you create backup&nbsp;plans:</p>  What will you do if your slides are corrupt or there’s no paper in the&nbsp;room?  Who can you call on to help remove / calm down someone who is exhibiting (sustained) problematic behaviours?  How can you structure your slide deck to make sections skippable?   Take care of&nbsp;yourself <p>Every session needs at least one leader, and that’s you! So take care of yourself so you can help lead everyone through the&nbsp;session.</p><p>What that looks like in practice can depend on specific circumstances, but in general means a calm, well-rested person, with a plan and the resources to carry it out.

Meet Your Students’ Needs – Expanding Your Digital Catalog with a Course Sharing Network</p>
<p>Innovations like course sharing have been instrumental in meeting student needs and helping institutions achieve their strategic goals. Broadly speaking, course sharing offers institutions a low-risk way to help students access the courses they need when they need them while maintaining the integrity of learning outcomes and the student experience. Acadeum enables students and institutions to succeed with a platform and digital network that expands course catalogs, locates just-in-time solutions, and connects like-minded schools and learners to workforce-aligned and market-competitive courses. In addition, consortial course sharing makes for a more seamless student experience that bolsters retention and completion rates and better prepares learners with the skills required to succeed.</p>
<p>Through the Acadeum network, like-minded colleges and universities can access and share high-quality digital courses to support student success and boost academic innovation.</p>
 
 Attract new student populations by delivering in-demand courses and programs, conveniently and affordably. 
 Update or expand existing programs with new content from like-minded partners. 
 Meet student needs with workforce-aligned courses that offer credit as well as hands-on skills. 
 Ensure students have the courses they need when they need them to maintain velocity to completion. 
 
<p>Hear from a panel of institutional leaders on how they are using course sharing to:</p>
 
  Offer learners opportunities to regain academic standing and overcome barriers to completion 
  Eliminate transfer hassles and increase scheduling flexibility 
  Ensure athletic eligibility 
  Support instructional resourcing needs

<p>Classroom 107, Mullen Communications Center<br>
Skip The Hidden Messages: The Importance of Feedback in Online Learning</p>
<p>As in any learning environment, feedback impacts the learning experience. Yet many times instructors and facilitators fall short on providing meaningful feedback to learners. This session will cover key points of providing effective feedback to students in an online setting by taking a closer look at feedback methods and delivery. Feedback shouldn’t be a hidden message!</p>

HyFlex: Creating Opportunities for Success as a Community College</p>
<p>After the pandemic, Ocean County College was looking to create more flexibility for students in how they receive their education. In the summer of 2022, the college launched its first set of fully HyFlex courses allowing students to choose on any given day whether they came to class in person or logged in remotely to the live class session. Data was collected over the course of the 2022-2023 Academic year to see how students performed and to see if there were any advantages students perceived to using the modality. Many positive outcomes were discovered. This session will go over the results from the qualitative and quantitative data as well as walk participants through the process of implementing HyFlex classes in a community college setting.</p>

 1:10 – 1:50 pm – Breakout Session 3 
<p>Classroom 107, Mullen Communications Center<br>
Crafting Campus Connections with Oral History and Adobe Premiere Rush</p>
<p>This presentation discusses how student-created videos using Adobe Premiere Rush contribute to campus connectivity—we will provide examples that demonstrate the community-building nature of the assignment in a post-pandemic era and conclude with a reflection on how the final project submissions (which were donated to the university’s archives) used a new technology to create inspiring content that benefitted not only students, but also members of the Seton Hall University community in the present moment and, as we will explain, future community members as well. In our ever-changing technological world, collaborative projects between college students, faculty, and staff must ensure individuals from different backgrounds can work together to benefit their university communities. The disconnects that exist between these groups, however, present challenges for determining what productive collaborations and connections might look like. An oral history assignment used at Seton Hall University in Spring 2023 reflects one such innovative approach. First we will discuss how oral history presents a unique and engaging way for students to learn about history from those who have lived it and then we outline the assignment itself. Finally the audience will see how the creation of an oral history using Adobe Premiere Rush was the ideal way for students to practice several skills including various research techniques (reading primary and secondary sources), interpersonal communication (interviewing), and video creation (Adobe Premiere Rush).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Using Bite-sized Videos to Layer Nurse Practitioner Content</p>
<p>Educators are constantly exploring innovative strategies to assist students in retaining salient course material. Educational research has established that students need to refocus in under a minute, their attentiveness diminishes throughout a class, and they focus more effectively when student-centered pedagogies are integrated (Blake, 2023). Specifically, Gen Z nursing graduate students have shorter attention spans and, as digital natives (Prensky, 2001), expect to learn through a variety of modalities (Chicca &amp; Shellenbarger, 2018; Singh &amp; Dangmei, 2016). Today’s nurse practitioner students are digitally grounded and often prefer information in bite-sized chunks. To address this need, the presenters created a series of health assessment bite-sized videos highlighting important lecture content to reinforce nurse practitioner student course content. The presenters found this tailored approach can effectively engage nurse practitioner students and leverage the most important content for retention beyond the didactic classroom. This presentation will emphasize the process used in developing and refining the videos with a look forward to adapting the format to other subject areas.</p>

 2:00 – 2:40 pm – Breakout Session 4<br>
Preparing to Teach Online: From Learner to Teacher 
<p>Learning and teaching in the online environment often look very different than in face-to-face classrooms. For novice instructors, understanding how students experience the online classroom can feel like a daunting task. Through the Online Teaching Certificate (OTC) Program offered by Rutgers Teaching and Learning with Technology, instructors take on the role of online students for themselves. As they learn about key principles of online pedagogy and instructional technology usage, they also build empathy for their students, reflecting on their own experiences, challenges, and discoveries as online learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will provide an overview of the design of the OTC program, highlighting one course in detail. We will demonstrate how the structure and content of this course, Universal Design and Accessibility for Online Teaching, facilitates both skill-building and metacognitive reflection about participants’ experiences as online learners. Attendees will focus on key challenges related to online learning contexts as well as strategies supporting online student success.</p>

Making Art with Embedded Poetry from Human and ChatGPT Sources</p>
<p>I published a book in 2011 titled “3D Haiku and Tanka” in Apple Books which explored how writing poetry in 3D space was different from traditional ways of writing on flat 2D surfaces. When 3D printing strategies became available, now it was possible to make 3D real world models of assembled poetic lines which also contained audio buttons that could be pressed for a line of poetry to be read aloud. The appearance of laser cutters made possible the use of multicolored acrylic sheets cut into patterns such as squares, rectangles and pentagons and held together with wood veneer and nuts and bolts. The text of poems are laser cut into the acrylic sheets with QR codes placed nearby for reading by patrons who may be blind or visually impaired. The appearance of ChatGPT now permits the possibility of asking ChatGPT to write poetry in Haiku or Tanka format and include the selected poetry in the mixed media art piece. An example of a Tanka poem made from asking ChatGPT follows.</p>
<p>Silent algorithms,<br>
AI ponders the unknown,<br>
Unraveling truths,<br>
The quest for understanding,<br>
Guided by digital minds.</p>
<p>This raises questions about copyright as ChatGPT utilizes what is available in its captured database to write poetry so any art I make with ChatGPT-inspired poetry pays credit to ChatGPT when its generated poetry is used in an art piece and in that way can be viewed as a virtual collaborator and listed as so in the information describing the art piece.</p>

Maintaining a Competitive Edge While Meeting Student and Workforce Demand</p>
<p>Mirco-credentialing, or stackable certificates, has been cited repeatedly as one of the biggest trends to inspire academic innovation in higher education. Workforce-aligned programs allow institutions to:</p>
 
 Be highly responsive to changing professional trends 
 Deliver work-based learning experiences that are industry relevant 
 Keep up with the rapidly changing nature of the world today 
 
<p>Institutions can now leverage the Acadeum network specifically to promote credit recognition, reach new audiences, and provide industry-aligned skills to students making them workforce ready. You’ll learn how Southeastern University is approaching industry designed content to help expedite skills based learning that can stack into a degree program for learners to continue to advance along the education-career continuum.</p>

Skip The Hidden Messages: The Importance of Feedback in Online Learning</p>
<p>As in any learning environment, feedback impacts the learning experience. Yet many times instructors and facilitators fall short on providing meaningful feedback to learners. This session will cover key points of providing effective feedback to students in an online setting by taking a closer look at feedback methods and delivery. Feedback shouldn’t be a hidden message!</p>

HyFlex: Creating Opportunities for Success as a Community College</p>
<p>After the pandemic, Ocean County College was looking to create more flexibility for students in how they receive their education. In the summer of 2022, the college launched its first set of fully HyFlex courses allowing students to choose on any given day whether they came to class in person or logged in remotely to the live class session. Data was collected over the course of the 2022-2023 Academic year to see how students performed and to see if there were any advantages students perceived to using the modality. Many positive outcomes were discovered. This session will go over the results from the qualitative and quantitative data as well as walk participants through the process of implementing HyFlex classes in a community college setting.</p>

Crafting Campus Connections with Oral History and Adobe Premiere Rush</p>
<p>This presentation discusses how student-created videos using Adobe Premiere Rush contribute to campus connectivity—we will provide examples that demonstrate the community-building nature of the assignment in a post-pandemic era and conclude with a reflection on how the final project submissions (which were donated to the university’s archives) used a new technology to create inspiring content that benefitted not only students, but also members of the Seton Hall University community in the present moment and, as we will explain, future community members as well. In our ever-changing technological world, collaborative projects between college students, faculty, and staff must ensure individuals from different backgrounds can work together to benefit their university communities. The disconnects that exist between these groups, however, present challenges for determining what productive collaborations and connections might look like. An oral history assignment used at Seton Hall University in Spring 2023 reflects one such innovative approach. First we will discuss how oral history presents a unique and engaging way for students to learn about history from those who have lived it and then we outline the assignment itself. Finally the audience will see how the creation of an oral history using Adobe Premiere Rush was the ideal way for students to practice several skills including various research techniques (reading primary and secondary sources), interpersonal communication (interviewing), and video creation (Adobe Premiere Rush).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Using Bite-sized Videos to Layer Nurse Practitioner Content</p>
<p>Educators are constantly exploring innovative strategies to assist students in retaining salient course material. Educational research has established that students need to refocus in under a minute, their attentiveness diminishes throughout a class, and they focus more effectively when student-centered pedagogies are integrated (Blake, 2023). Specifically, Gen Z nursing graduate students have shorter attention spans and, as digital natives (Prensky, 2001), expect to learn through a variety of modalities (Chicca &amp; Shellenbarger, 2018; Singh &amp; Dangmei, 2016). Today’s nurse practitioner students are digitally grounded and often prefer information in bite-sized chunks. To address this need, the presenters created a series of health assessment bite-sized videos highlighting important lecture content to reinforce nurse practitioner student course content. The presenters found this tailored approach can effectively engage nurse practitioner students and leverage the most important content for retention beyond the didactic classroom. This presentation will emphasize the process used in developing and refining the videos with a look forward to adapting the format to other subject areas.</p>

Preparing to Teach Online: From Learner to Teacher 
<p>Learning and teaching in the online environment often look very different than in face-to-face classrooms. For novice instructors, understanding how students experience the online classroom can feel like a daunting task. Through the Online Teaching Certificate (OTC) Program offered by Rutgers Teaching and Learning with Technology, instructors take on the role of online students for themselves. As they learn about key principles of online pedagogy and instructional technology usage, they also build empathy for their students, reflecting on their own experiences, challenges, and discoveries as online learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will provide an overview of the design of the OTC program, highlighting one course in detail. We will demonstrate how the structure and content of this course, Universal Design and Accessibility for Online Teaching, facilitates both skill-building and metacognitive reflection about participants’ experiences as online learners. Attendees will focus on key challenges related to online learning contexts as well as strategies supporting online student success.</p>

Making Art with Embedded Poetry from Human and ChatGPT Sources</p>
<p>I published a book in 2011 titled “3D Haiku and Tanka” in Apple Books which explored how writing poetry in 3D space was different from traditional ways of writing on flat 2D surfaces. When 3D printing strategies became available, now it was possible to make 3D real world models of assembled poetic lines which also contained audio buttons that could be pressed for a line of poetry to be read aloud. The appearance of laser cutters made possible the use of multicolored acrylic sheets cut into patterns such as squares, rectangles and pentagons and held together with wood veneer and nuts and bolts. The text of poems are laser cut into the acrylic sheets with QR codes placed nearby for reading by patrons who may be blind or visually impaired. The appearance of ChatGPT now permits the possibility of asking ChatGPT to write poetry in Haiku or Tanka format and include the selected poetry in the mixed media art piece. An example of a Tanka poem made from asking ChatGPT follows.</p>
<p>Silent algorithms,<br>
AI ponders the unknown,<br>
Unraveling truths,<br>
The quest for understanding,<br>
Guided by digital minds.</p>
<p>This raises questions about copyright as ChatGPT utilizes what is available in its captured database to write poetry so any art I make with ChatGPT-inspired poetry pays credit to ChatGPT when its generated poetry is used in an art piece and in that way can be viewed as a virtual collaborator and listed as so in the information describing the art piece.</p>

<p>Ceramic recently launched a new course on LearnWeb3, a leading platform for Web3 education. The course, ‘<a href="https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-ai-chatbot-on-compose-db-and-the-ceramic-network?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Build an AI Chatbot on ComposeDB and the Ceramic Network,</a>’ will teach developers how to build powerful and scalable AI chatbots using Ceramic’s decentralized data infrastructure.</p><p>AI chatbots are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of industries, from customer service to healthcare to education. However, building and maintaining AI chatbots can be complex and expensive, especially for small businesses and startups. Ceramic's new course aims to make AI chatbots more accessible to developers of all skill levels.</p><p>If you've used AI chatbots like <a href="https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Agent GPT</a>, you've probably noticed that they're more efficient and effective when they have the relevant context for your conversation. This is because the chatbot is able to factor in previous messages, as well as other relevant information when generating its response. Ceramic gives developers a new way to build applications, and in this example chatbots, by storing data in a reusable format. Ceramic allows developers to benefit from the data that other developers have already created—overcoming the cold-start problem of populating applications with data.</p> What Will You Learn? <p>The course covers the following:</p>  What is Ceramic and how does it work?  What is ComposeDB and how does it make it easier to build applications on Ceramic?

   Online violence against women in politics in Latin America is becoming more and more frequent, affecting women’s right to participate in democracy. In countries such as Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile and many others, female politicians are attacked on social media platforms in attempts to undermine their political legitimacy, for reasons associated with their gender.

<p>Online violence against women in politics in Latin America is becoming <a href="https://elpais.com/planeta-futuro/2021-08-10/el-momento-de-erradicar-la-violencia-contra-las-mujeres-en-politica-es-ahora.html" title="">more and more frequent</a>, affecting women’s right to participate in democracy.

<p>A growing number of initiatives have been undertaken to fight against this concerning trend. This blog post (which is by no means an exhaustive list!) lists just a few examples of the inspiring work being done in the region.</p>



<p>At the end, we’ve included a list of initiatives offering hands-on emergency digital security support in the region as well.&nbsp;</p>



 



 Bolivia&nbsp; 



<p>Cielito Saravia from <a href="https://internetbolivia.org/" title="">Internet Bolivia</a> wrote <a href="https://internetbolivia.org/publicacion/mujeres-libres-en-politica-guia-para-combatir-el-acoso-y-la-violencia-politica-digital-avp/" title="">this guide</a> to help women in politics identify harassment and political violence online and to strengthen their defence capabilities against digital attacks. Internet Bolivia also has an <a href="https://sosdigital.internetbolivia.org/guia/" title="">interactive guide to support</a> women who are suffering tech facilitated gender based violence, and a guide focusing on <a href="https://sosdigital.internetbolivia.org/publicaci-n/guia-de-seguridad-digital-para-mujeres-en-el-ejercicio-politico-publico/" title="">digital security for women politicians in office</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Chile 



<p>In Chile, where <a href="https://laneta.cl/primer-informe-de-mujer-y-politica-en-twitter-el-67-de-las-candidatas-recibieron-mensajes-violentos-durante-la-campana/" title="">67% of women candidates receive violent messages</a> during campaigns, <a href="https://toma-partido.fes.de/" title="">#TomaPartido</a> published a <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/chile/19251-20220914.pdf" title="">digital security guide</a>, written by <a href="https://pazpena.com/" title="">Paz Peña</a>, that takes a feminist approach for people and organisations facing digital political violence. The guide offers information about some of the most common attacks as well as practical steps for improving digital security. It’s available in <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/chile/19251-20220914.pdf" title="">Spanish</a> and <a href="https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/chile/19535-20221220.pdf" title="">Portuguese</a>.</p>



 Colombia&nbsp; 



<p>In Colombia, where <a href="https://efeminista.com/colombia-ley-violencia-politica-mujeres/" title="">recent legislation was created</a> to fight political violence against women, Fundación Karisma has been doing research to <a href="https://web.karisma.org.co/las-violencias-digitales-pueden-disuadir-a-las-mujeres-de-postularse-a-cargos-publicos/" title="">define digital violence against women politicians </a>in the country and understand its consequences for their work and life. In <a href="https://web.karisma.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Resumen-Ejecutivo-Acoso-Soledad-y-Desprestigio-Agosto_2023.pdf" title="">this publication</a>, they offer recommendations for political movements on how to navigate digital violence against women in politics.</p>



 Brazil 



 
 The initiative <a href="https://azmina.com.br/reportagens/como-acontece-violencia-politica-de-genero-exemplos/" title="">MonitorA</a>, from <a href="https://azmina.com.br/" title="">Azmina</a> and <a href="https://internetlab.org.br/" title="">InternetLab</a>, looks at the different forms that gendered political violence takes in the country to keep women and trans people out of politics. In its mapping of misogyny and online attacks against women in politics, MonitorA has found staggering evidence: in the first week of electoral campaigning in 2022, <a href="https://azmina.com.br/reportagens/monitora-2022-misoginia-ofensas-candidatas/" title="">almost 4.5k attacks or insults were directed at women candidates on Twitter</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 The project coLAB at Universidade Federal Fluminense created the <a href="https://colab-uff.github.io/ddoslab/project/report-gender-violence" title="">Mapa da Violência Política de Gênero em Plataformas Digitais</a>, highlighting the intensity, type and various forms of political gendered violence on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. 
 



 
 Since 2020, <a href="https://www.institutomariellefranco.org/en" title="">Instituto Marielle Franco</a> has been researching and monitoring <a href="https://www.violenciapolitica.org/" title="">political violence in Brazil</a>, and showing how gendered and racialised it is. They have mapped 8 types of political violence suffered by over 140 Black women candidates in the country, and their work has consistently shown that whether Black women are elected or not they remain unprotected against these forms of violence. Through “<a href="https://www.naoseremosinterrompidas.org/" title="">Não Seremos Interrompidas</a>”, they’ve been advocating for local authorities to act against political violence that has kept Black women and LGBTQIA+ from accessing and safely occupying political power.&nbsp; 
 



 
 <a href="https://internetlab.org.br/pt/noticias/como-enfrentar-a-violencia-politica-de-genero/" title="">InternetLab and Redes Cordiais</a> published a guide to help women candidates who face gendered political violence. <a href="https://mulheresnegrasdecidem.org/" title="">Mulheres Negras Decidem</a>, a movement working to strengthen Brazil’s democracy by supporting Black women in politics, wrote a <a href="https://mulheresnegrasdecidem.org/guia-de-cuidados-digitais/" title="">Digital Care Guide</a> to support activists and politicians and Coalizão Direitos na Rede and <a href="https://codingrights.org/en/" title="">Coding Rights</a> published this mini <a href="https://www.marialab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/eleicoesinternet-2.pdf" title="">digital protection guide for elections</a>. 
 



 Central America and&nbsp;the Dominican Republic 



<p><a href="https://www.ipandetec.org/proyectos/" title="">Ipandetec</a>, an organisation working in Central America and the Dominican Republic has done research monitoring online gender based violence against women in politics in <a href="https://www.ipandetec.org/investigacion/" title="">Panama, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica</a>. They also run <a href="https://www.segurasenlinea.ca/" title="">Seguras En Línea</a>, a project aiming to mitigate digital gender violence in Central America and the Dominican Republic.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.acceso.or.cr/" title="">Fundación Acceso</a> is working in Central America to promote digital security and holistic protection for organisations and people defending human rights. With <a href="https://www.acceso.or.cr/publicaciones/" title="">Observatorio Centroamericano de Seguridad Digital</a>, they’ve been analysing digital security incidents of human rights defenders and organisations in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, showing that violence against women human rights defenders is pervasive in the region.</p>



 Research covering Latin America&nbsp; 



<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.alianzaregional.net/" title="">Alianza Regional por la libre expresión e información</a> conducted an extensive qualitative study on online gender violence towards women with a public voice in Latin America and its impact on freedom of expression. They <a href="https://www.alianzaregional.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Informe_ViolenciaEnLinea-16Mar23.pdf" title="">gathered cases</a> from women in Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Colombia, Cuba, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, México, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela.</p>



 Support lines for digital security emergencies 



<p>If you need hands-on, emergency digital security support, there are a number of initiatives that can help you. Here are some of them:</p>



 
 <a href="https://acoso.online/" title="">Acoso.Online</a> has an online <a href="https://acoso.online/emergencia/" title="">emergency repository</a> sharing direct access to different materials with information on how to proceed in the face of gender based violence online. 



 Internet Bolivia has an <a href="https://sosdigital.internetbolivia.org/" title="">active support line</a> available for women, teenage girls, journalists, women in politics and activists, LGBTIQ+ persons who need support navigating gender based violence in digital spaces 



 Hiperderecho created <a href="https://hiperderecho.org/tecnoresistencias/" title="">Tecnoresistencias</a>, a space for women, dissent, diversity, and activists who resist gender violence on the internet. 



 <a href="https://vita-activa.org/" title="">Vita Activa</a> is a helpline providing online support and strategic solutions for women and LGBTIQ+ journalists, activists and gender, land and labour rights, and freedom of expression defenders. 



 <a href="https://mariadajuda.org/" title="">Maria D’Ajuda</a> is the first digital security helpline run by feminists in Brazil aimed at women, non-binary people, LGBTQIAP+ and organisations in Latin America. 



 <a href="https://luchadoras.mx/" title="">Luchadoras</a>, in Mexico, has a helpline to support people experiencing gender-based violence online. 



 Access Now’s <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/" title="">Digital Security Helpline</a> works with individuals and organisations around the world to keep them safe online.&nbsp;

<p>89% of IT leaders expect passwords will represent less than a quarter&nbsp;of their organization’s logins within five years or less</p>



<p>CARLSBAD, California and BOSTON, Massachusetts – October 16, 2023 – The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> and <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;esheet=53518663&amp;newsitemid=20230809614908&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=LastPass&amp;index=1&amp;md5=77c9b141f704e56ec2c9543ec95bc3d7">LastPass</a> released the 2023 Workforce Authentication Report today, which gauges IT decision makers’ attitudes and plans for removing passwords in favor of easier and more secure passwordless authentication. The verdict? Businesses are actively moving to eradicate passwords from employees’ lives, with 89% of surveyed IT leaders expecting passwords to represent less than a quarter of their organization’s logins within five years or less.</p>



<p>Top findings from the 2023 Workforce Authentication Report:</p>



 
 Businesses are ready to embrace a passwordless future, with 92% having a plan to move to passwordless technology and 95% currently using a passwordless experience at their organization.&nbsp; 



 Businesses believe passkeys will help make them more secure: 92% believe passkeys will benefit their overall security posture, and 93% agree that passkeys will eventually help reduce the volume of unofficial (i.e., “Shadow IT”) applications. 



 However, many recognize that work still needs to be done: A majority of businesses surveyed are still using phishable authentication methods, such as passwords (76%) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) (43%) when it comes to authenticating users within their organization.&nbsp; 



 The majority recognize that this transition will take time and education: 55% of IT leaders surveyed feel they need more education on how passwordless technology works and/or how to deploy it, and 28% cited concerns that users may be resistant to change or using a new technology. 



 When making this transition, businesses made it clear they want to choose where they store passkeys, with 69% of IT leaders anticipating storing them in a third-party password manager.&nbsp; 
 



<p>“The move towards passwordless authentication has gained steam over the past few years as an increasing number of organizations have moved to eliminate the risk and liability of passwords as they are the source of the vast majority of data breaches,” said Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Today’s report backs up this trend by illustrating that global IT leaders are rapidly aiming to reduce their reliance on legacy forms of authentication in favor of passkeys for user-friendly, phishing-resistant sign-ins.”</p>



<p>“These survey results demonstrate that businesses are excited about the prospect of a passwordless future, and all the benefits that future will bring. And the clear majority also recognize that a password manager plays an important role in that future,” said Mike Kosak, Senior Principal Intelligence Analyst at LastPass. “While the adoption of passwordless authentication will take some time and coaching, LastPass is proud to support forward-thinking leaders like these on that journey – ushering their organizations toward security that is stronger and more effortless than ever.”</p>

<p>Increased desire for biometrics and awareness of passkeys increases imperative on service providers to enable stronger, more user-friendly sign-ins</p>



<p>Summary of key findings:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Password usage without two-factor authentication (2FA) is still dominant across use cases – consumers enter a password manually nearly 4 times a day, or 1,280 times a year 



 But when given the option, users want other authentication methods – biometrics is both the preferred method for consumers to log-in and what they believe is most secure, while awareness of passkeys continues to grow 



 Online scams are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated, likely fuelled by AI – over half (54%) have seen an increase in suspicious messages and scams, while 52% believe they have become more sophisticated 



 The impact of legacy sign-in methods is getting worse – the majority of people are abandoning purchases and giving up accessing services online – this is 15% more likely than last year at nearly four times per month per person 
 



<p>October 16, 2023 – <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today publishes its third annual <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Authenticate-2023-Barometer-Report.pdf">Online Authentication Barometer</a>, which gathers insights into the state of online authentication in ten countries across the globe. New to the Barometer this year, FIDO Alliance has also begun tracking consumer perception of threats and scams online in a bid to understand anticipated threat levels globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key findings&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 2023 Online Authentication Barometer found that despite widespread usage of passwords lingering on, consumers want to use stronger, more user-friendly alternatives. Entering a password manually without any form of additional authentication was the most commonly used authentication method across the use cases tracked – including accessing work computers and accounts (37%), streaming services (25%), social media (26%), and smart home devices (17%). Consumers enter a password manually nearly four times a day on average, or around 1,280 times a year. The only exceptional scenario to this trend was financial services, where biometrics (33%) narrowly beat passwords (31%)* as the most used sign-in method.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is especially interesting considering biometrics’ rising popularity as an authentication method. When asked what authentication method people consider most secure and the method they most prefer using, biometrics ranked as favourite in both categories, rising around 5% in popularity since last year. This suggests that consumers want to use biometrics more but don’t currently have the opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This year’s Barometer data showed promising signs of shifting consumer attitudes and desire to use stronger authentication methods, with biometrics especially proving popular. That said, high password usage without 2FA worryingly reflects how little consumers are still being offered alternatives like biometrics, resulting in lingering usage,” commented Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and CMO at FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scams are getting more frequent and more sophisticated – likely fuelled by AI&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year’s Barometer also unearthed consumer perception of threats and scams online. 54% of people have noticed an increase in suspicious messages and scams online, while 52% believe these have become more sophisticated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Threats are seen to be active across several channels, but primarily email, SMS messages, social media, and fake phone or voicemails. The increased accessibility of generative AI tools is a likely driver of this rise in scams and phishing threats. Tools like FraudGPT and WormGPT, which have been created and shared on the dark web explicitly for use in cybercrime, have made crafting compelling social engineering attacks far simpler, more sophisticated, and easier to do at scale. Deepfake voice and video are also being used to bolster social engineering attacks, tricking people into thinking they are talking to a known trusted person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar added: “Phishing is still by far the most used and effective cyberattack technique, which means passwords are vulnerable regardless of their complexity. With highly accessible generative AI tools now offering bad actors the means to make more convincing and scalable attacks, it’s imperative consumers and service providers listen to consumers and start to look at non-phishable and frictionless solutions like passkeys and on-device biometrics more readily available, rather than iterating on ultimately flawed legacy authentication like passwords and OTPs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys, which provide secure and convenient passwordless sign-ins to online services, have grown in consumer awareness despite still being live just over a year, rising from 39% in 2022 to 52% awareness today. The non-phishable authentication method has been publicly backed by many big players in the industry – <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/">Google recently announced that passkeys are now available for all its users</a> to move away from passwords and two-step verification, as has <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305">Apple</a>, with other brands like PayPal also making these available to consumers in the last twelve months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impact of legacy sign-ins worsens for businesses and consumers&nbsp;</p>



<p>The negative impact caused by legacy user authentication was also revealed to be getting worse. 59% of people have given up accessing an online service&nbsp; and 43% have abandoned a purchase in the last 60 days, with the frequency of these instances rising year on year to nearly four times per month, per person, up by around 15% on last year. Poor online experiences are ultimately hitting businesses’ bottom lines and causing frustration among consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>70% of people have had to reset and recover passwords in the last two months because they’d forgotten them, further highlighting how inconvenient passwords are and their role as a primary barrier to a seamless online user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ENDS</p>



<p>Notes to editors:</p>



 
 Research for the FIDO Alliance’s Online Authentication Barometer was conducted by Sapio Research among 10,010 consumers across the UK, France, Germany, US, Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India and China.

<p>Joon Hyuk Lee – APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Welcome</p>



<p>As we usher in the participants of Authenticate 2023, we aim to provide a snapshot of various corners of the globe. Today, we’re privileged to bring together our esteemed members—industry luminaries from Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Mainland China, Korea and Japan. Together, we’ll navigate the present landscape, confronting the challenges and celebrating the opportunities inherent in adopting phishing-resistant authentication methods across APAC.</p>



<p>Introducing Our Experts:</p>



<p>Khanit Phaton, Thailand: Senior Management Officer at ETDA</p>



<p>Karen Chang, Taiwan: VP at Egis Technology / Chair of FIDO Taiwan Forum</p>



<p>Simon Trac Do, Vietnam: CEO &amp; Founder at VinCSS</p>



<p>Henry Chai, Mainland China: CEO at Uni-ID Technology, Lenovo / Co-Chair of FCWG</p>



<p>Jaebeom Kim, South Korea: Principal Researcher at TTA / Sub-Group Leader of FKWG</p>



<p>Masao Kubo, Japan: Manager, Product Design Department at NTT DOCOMO</p>



<p>Crafting an inclusive approach to online authentication in Thailand</p>



<p>Joon: Given Thailand’s rich diversity in many aspects, how does this influence the approach to and adoption of new online authentication systems for its citizens?</p>



<p>Khanit: As online services have become primary channels and gained popularity among the Thai population, coupled with the increasing number of cybersecurity threats, it’s crucial for both the public and private sectors to address this issue. Secure authentication is a key consideration. Given our diversity in aspects like culture and socioeconomic status, it’s essential to adopt an approach that’s inclusive and accessible for all. We’re exploring various methods for authentication; for instance, the Thai government’s introduction of the ThaID digital ID system, which utilizes both facial and fingerprint recognition, ensuring robust accessibility for all citizens. Meanwhile, Fintech companies and banks are developing mobile banking apps tailored to a wide range of mobile devices, incorporating online face verification services.</p>



<p>Reflecting on Taiwan’s recent strides with FIDO</p>



<p>Joon: Taiwan has showcased impressive FIDO deployment cases in recent years. Karen, as the chair of the FIDO Taiwan Regional Engagement Forum, can you offer insights on this journey?</p>



<p>Karen: The FIDO Taiwan Regional Engagement Forum (FTF) was formed in 2021, with members spanning IC chip, device, software, system, and application services. As of August 2023, we boast over 25 members and 80 FIDO-certified products. The government’s role in adopting and promoting FIDO standards cannot be understated. The Ministry of Interior joined the FIDO Alliance in 2020 and launched the Taiwan FidO (TW FidO) service. By September 2023, TW FidO was integrated into more than 170 government department systems, encompassing a wide array of services. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) also emphasized the “Research and Development of Standardized Financial Mobile Identification Mechanisms” in the Financial Technology Development Roadmap released in 2020, known as “Financial FIDO”. This allows users to bind their mobile devices with physical financial cards, eliminating the need for traditional physical cards or account/password logins. Several financial institutions are currently piloting this Financial FIDO initiative. Established in August 2022, the Ministry of Digital Affairs (moda) joined the FIDO Alliance in January 2023. Moda has been actively promoting international digital trust standards, like FIDO User Authentication and W3C Decentralized Identifiers, to industries like e-commerce, telecom services, online gaming, semiconductors, and manufacturing, ensuring a seamless and secure authentication experience. In many Asian countries, directives or guidelines from public organizations play a pivotal role in positioning a nation at the forefront of technology adoption. Today, it’s FIDO’s moment. I believe the FTF is on the right trajectory, and FIDO’s popularity is set to soar.</p>



<p>Vietnam’s Path to Simpler and Stronger Online Authentication</p>



<p>Joon: With many members in Vietnam being relatively new to the FIDO Alliance, how do you assess Vietnam’s readiness and the challenges it faces in adopting simpler and stronger online authentication methods?</p>



<p>Simon: Vietnam, like other nations, grapples with an intensifying phishing crisis that poses significant risks to users, agencies, and organizations. Although there are initiatives in place, such as the Anti-Scam Center, which aims to counteract these threats promptly and take down scam sites, their effectiveness is somewhat curtailed due to manual operations and heavy reliance on user awareness. On a brighter note, an increasing number of Vietnamese entities are engaging in the FIDO Alliance’s drive to minimize password reliance. Leading the charge in this passwordless movement in Vietnam are tech frontrunners like VinCSS and MK Group.</p>



<p>Mainland China’s Digital Landscape: Balancing Scale and Security</p>



<p>Joon: Mainland China has one of the largest digital user bases in the world. What unique challenges does this present when considering the adoption of novel simpler and stronger online authentication methods?</p>



<p>Henry: Indeed, in Mainland China, the sheer size of our digital user base brings about unique considerations. For any new security technology to be deployed, there’s an imperative need to consider the diversity in device capabilities. This ensures an optimal user experience for all, especially during the earlier times, before 2019, when not all smartphones were FIDO-enabled. During that period, any deployment of FIDO had to ensure that every user, regardless of their device’s capabilities, had a viable authentication alternative. Additionally, while authentication is a foundational layer, its adoption must align with business returns. When weighed against traditional, albeit less robust, authentication methods such as SMS and OTP, the decision to transition to FIDO becomes multifaceted. In many cases, the end solution is a mix of methods, balancing compatibility with business benefits. Presently, over 90 banks in Mainland China have adopted FIDO technology, and we anticipate this number to grow across different sectors soon.</p>



<p>Discussing South Korea’s technological advancements</p>



<p>Joon: South Korea is renowned for its advanced technological infrastructure. Jaebeom, how does this influence the nation’s approach to adopting new online authentication methods?</p>



<p>Jaebeom: It’s imperative for our country to integrate new authentication methods to facilitate seamless online identity verification for the public. In this quest, the South Korean government and associated agencies prioritize two critical aspects:</p>



<p>Technical Standards and Service Guidelines: We aim for consistent user experiences across platforms, irrespective of the service providers involved. This demands clear technical standards and robust service operation guidelines.</p>



<p>Legal Framework: Many online services require a solid legal basis for identity verification. Thus, legislative amendments and continued dialogues across the private sector, government, and academia are essential to formulating appropriate legal frameworks. Even if it is time-consuming, this step is indispensable. While our focus leans towards new online authentication methods, it’s equally important to ensure stability in both legacy and new systems, guaranteeing that all citizens can access online identity verification without hitches.</p>



<p>Japan – On the rise and acceptance of passkeys</p>



<p>Joon: Given the unified efforts of the FIDO Alliance Japan Working Group and its members, Japan leads in passkey deployments. Kubo-san, can you discuss the current trend and acceptance of passkeys in Japan?</p>



<p>Kubo-san: This year, I’ve observed several RPs deploying synced passkeys. While some organizations have long supported FIDO technology and embraced synced passkeys, others began their FIDO journey with synced passkeys only in 2023. This dynamic suggests that the momentum for passkey deployment is only set to accelerate. From a user perspective, awareness of passkeys is gradually heightening in Japan. Tech enthusiasts frequently discuss passkeys on social media, and according to Google Trends, search queries related to passkeys have surged. We’re in the early stages of a passwordless era in Japan, and I eagerly anticipate the broader acceptance and deployment of passkeys.</p>



<p>Delving deeper into phishing-resistant solutions in Thailand</p>



<p>Joon: Khanit, how can Thailand ensure that its authentication strategy remains robust and beneficial for online users? Would adopting phishing-resistant authentication solutions be advantageous?</p>



<p>Khanit: To bolster online security, Thailand has undertaken multiple strategies. We’re raising awareness through collaborative efforts with global bodies like the FIDO Alliance and defining digital ID standards that embed secure identity proofing and authentication methods. This lays down a foundational benchmark for users and service providers alike. Additionally, we’ve amended the Electronic Transaction Act to clearly delineate the responsibilities of service providers in guaranteeing authentication security and quality. Undoubtedly, integrating phishing-resistant authentication solutions, which use cryptographic techniques over vulnerable methods like PINs or passwords, would be a strategic advantage. Such solutions inherently offer heightened protection against phishing threats and pose a more formidable challenge for attackers compared to conventional methods.</p>



<p>Discussing Taiwan’s firm stance on cybersecurity</p>



<p>Joon: Could you provide an overview of the cybersecurity landscape in Taiwan and identify any notable trends?</p>



<p>Karen: In Taiwan, the zero-trust network security approach has become a pivotal national strategy. The sixth “National Information Security Development Plan (2021-2024)” was announced in February 2021, advocating for the Zero-Trust Architecture across government agencies and industries. The Taiwanese government has mapped out a comprehensive plan for implementing the zero-trust architecture, piloting validation and deployment mechanisms in 2021-2022. Central to this plan are three core mechanisms: identity authentication, device authentication, and trust inference. We place a significant emphasis on multi-factor authentication mechanisms that leverage the FIDO2 standard, allowing passwordless logins using physical security keys or mobile apps. By the end of August 2023, 12 vendors had cleared the government’s Zero Trust Architecture Identity Authentication Compliance Program. All these vendors deploy FIDO-certified solutions for user authentication. In 2023, numerous government agencies and businesses adopted this zero-trust framework in collaboration with these vendors. By incorporating phishing-resistant user authentication mechanisms, like FIDO’s standards, we have enhanced the security of online services, spanning national critical infrastructure, government services, and key industries. Moreover, FIDO’s certification program fosters trust between service providers, vendors, users, and the general populace.</p>



<p>Reflecting on the importance of FIDO certifications in Korea</p>



<p>Joon: Over the years, FIDO’s certification programs have been instrumental in globally promoting standardized technology adoption. Jaebeom, given that Korea is seen as an early FIDO authentication adopter, can you share your observations?</p>



<p>Jaebeom: Authentication essentially certifies a product’s fitness for its intended purpose, which means it’s more about validating product quality than being a mere badge of honor. As new technologies emerge and mature, the relative importance of certification programs wanes. This is primarily due to the initial imperfections in technology specifications and the lack of testing tools and products during the nascent stages. Certification programs then play a crucial role in harmonizing standards, products, and policies while ironing out these issues. As technology matures, these initial challenges are naturally addressed through iterative processes, and certification programs fulfill their designated roles more organically.</p>



<p>Lessons from Early FIDO Adopters: Mainland China</p>



<p>Joon: Henry, as the Co-Chair of one of the very first regional working groups, what insights can you offer the audience regarding early FIDO adoption, ecosystem cultivation, and so on?</p>



<p>Henry: FIDO is a novel authentication technology with clear benefits in security and user experience, but it also requires consumer devices like smartphones to be compatible. It takes time for the whole ecosystem to gradually embrace FIDO and incorporate its capabilities. The FIDO China Working Group collaborated closely with domestic phone OEMs in Mainland China to promote the FIDO concept and accelerate its implementation on devices. Simultaneously, we worked with the FIDO Alliance to establish the world’s first accredited certification lab at CAICT, Mainland China.</p>



<p>Recap of the FIDO APAC Summit 2023 – Vietnam</p>



<p>Joon: Simon, you co-hosted the <a>FIDO APAC Summit 2023 in Vietnam</a> back in August successfully. Can you reflect on the event and share any insights or observations you took away from the experience?</p>



<p>Simon: The inaugural FIDO APAC Summit 2023 truly exceeded our organizing committee’s expectations. Drawing a diverse crowd with over 300 attendees spanning 12 countries, it was heartening to witness such a convergence of perspectives and expertise. With 29 eminent speakers from diverse sectors, the summit facilitated rich discussions, paving the way for meaningful collaborations. A particularly noteworthy highlight was Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) joining the ranks as the 10th government-level member of the FIDO Alliance, underscoring our collective dedication to elevating digital authentication standards. This resonated beyond the venue, with our summit receiving comprehensive media coverage across multiple prestigious platforms. Having proudly co-hosted this foundational event, VinCSS is eager to continue endorsing, supporting, and championing its future iterations, as we envisage it becoming a cornerstone event in the APAC digital landscape.</p>



<p>Envisioning the collective journey with FIDO in APAC</p>



<p>Joon: Looking at the broader APAC region’s push towards harmonized phishing-resistant online authentication, how do you view the role and contributions of FIDO Alliance members?</p>



<p>Kubo-san: For years, our collective aim has been to realize a phishing-resistant, passwordless world through FIDO. But achieving this vision is not a solitary endeavor. It requires collaboration with diverse stakeholders to foster a world where everyone recognizes and effortlessly uses passkeys. FIDO alliance members can spearhead this initiative by sharing their deployment experiences and persuading yet-to-adopt service providers. Additionally, a joint effort is required to amplify consumer awareness and understanding of passkeys. FIDO technology, especially passkeys, boasts a remarkable retention rate. Once users experience it, they appreciate its intuitive usability. Therefore, it’s imperative for us, as proponents of passkeys, to emphasize that FIDO isn’t just about phishing resistance—it’s also about enhancing user experience. And that’s not just a marketing spiel—it’s the reality.</p>



<p>Closing</p>



<p>To every attendee of Authenticate 2023 reading this, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for your dedication to making online authentication simpler and stronger. As we navigate this ever-evolving domain, we warmly encourage you to continue these conversations by connecting with the FIDO members featured in this dialogue, ensuring our collective discussions remain fruitful and dynamic.</p>

 OriginTrail’s 1st DKG Conference brings together Internet, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain pioneers to harness trusted AI across industries DKGcon 2023: Fireside chat with Dr. Bob Metcalfe, Internet pioneer and Ethernet inventor, and Branimir Rakic, Co-Founder of the OriginTrail ecosystem, moderated by Ivan On Tech, Founder of Moralis&nbsp;Academy.<p><a href="https://dkgcon.origintrail.io/">The international DKGcon — Decentralized Knowledge Graph Conference</a> gathered pioneers in Internet and blockchain technologies, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI), in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on Monday, October 9, 2023. They discussed how to distinguish between credible and fictitious information and knowledge in the era of generative AI, and what is the role of new technologies in this (such as blockchain and decentralized knowledge graphs). They also discussed how these technologies will impact the economy and society in general in relation to&nbsp;AI.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekG1Bl-tCjc">DKGcon</a> the conference participants shared practical examples of how to create connected information and credible knowledge from fragmented data and how to connect this with generative AI for various purposes. They shed light on how these technologies are already changing the operations and businesses across various sectors — from supply chains, pharmaceuticals, construction, and consumer products, to education, media, and the metaverse.</p><p>The forefront of the conference was the open-source <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)</a> that has <a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Trace Labs</a> as core developers. Solutions based on OriginTrail DKG are breaking new ground in establishing digital trust, increasing transparency, optimizing business processes, enabling new ways of consumer interaction with products, as well as new ways of creating using advanced technologies such as blockchain, decentralized knowledge graphs, and&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The innovation, transformative nature, and effectiveness of the developed solutions are endorsed by global organizations such as the British Standards Institution, the World Federation of Hemophilia, GS1, the Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN), and others. Together with Trace Labs, these organizations and other business partners, as well as members of the open-source OriginTrail community, also presented various solutions at the conference.</p><p>One of the distinguished speakers at DKGcon 2023 was Wes Levitt, Co-Chief Investment Officer at Alpha Transform Holdings, who shed light on the recently launched solution based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ekG1Bl-tCjc?si=wTxohkIBe842BQ6e&amp;t=17820">OriginTrail Trusted Knowledge Foundation that brings trust to the financial industry</a>. This solution, called chatAnalyst.ai, is set to revolutionize how financial services companies can develop their business lines while eliminating the current AI solutions pitfalls by allowing financial businesses to access quality data with verifiable provenance.</p><p>While demoing the solution live Wes Levitt said, “If I’m an investment professional presenting to my investing committee I will get laughed out of the room if I say ‘I got the information out of a bot; don’t worry, for sure it’s correct’. My manager will expect me to have highly sourced content before making million-dollar investment decisions. In the case of chatAnalyst.ai we can see the source content of the answers provided by the chat interface. By going to the OriginTrail DKG Explorer we can easily explore the underlying documents and the on-chain activity of when it was stamped on blockchain which makes it immutable. Not only do we have the source content to confirm, but also the provenance of when it was put there. This solution will change the way financial analysts work immensely.”</p>Wes Levitt, Co-Chief Investment Officer at Alpha Transform Holdings, presenting chatAnalyst.ai, which is set to revolutionize how financial services companies can develop their business&nbsp;lines.<p>Another esteemed speaker at the conference was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ekG1Bl-tCjc?si=_SlnLKayp47M9ICa&amp;t=29311">Dr. Bob Metcalfe, Internet pioneer, and Ethernet inventor</a>, also the recipient of the Turing Award, often referred to as the Nobel Prize for Computing, who discussed: “The hunch is that a mixture of connectivity, decentralized knowledge graphs, and blockchains are converging. This convergence is important because it is going to help us with one of the biggest problems we have nowadays, which is the truth. All over the connectivity space people are having trouble deciding what is true. This is where the Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) comes in; it feeds the truth to the AI systems we put on top of the&nbsp;DKG.”</p>Dr. Bob Metcalfe, Internet pioneer, Ethernet inventor, and the recipient of the Turing Award (Nobel Prize for Computing).<p>The day after the conference took on a more informal tone as all the speakers and conference attendees engaged in networking activities. Against the picturesque backdrop of the Ljubljana skyline, a special “proof-of-steak” picnic was organized, during which the esteemed guests were treated to a delectable culinary experience featuring dishes crafted from premium local ingredients.</p><p>At this gathering, participants had the unique opportunity to delve into the origin and background of products offered by a prominent Slovenian poultry producer, Perutnina Ptuj, and the Slovenian farm association, KZ Šaleška dolina. This exploration was made possible through the utilization of OriginTrail technology as the underlying framework. By simply scanning a QR code, attendees were able to unveil the narrative behind these products. They could literally “chat” with a product in a trusted manner, including ascertaining the farm of origin, exploring a variety of recipes for the meats, and discovering additional relevant information. This seamless and immersive experience was made possible by the integration of OriginTrail and GS1 Digital Link technologies, which have redefined the way consumers can interact with and gain insights into products.</p>New solution based on OriginTrail and GS1 Digital Link — users are chatting with a product in a trusted&nbsp;manner.<p>The topics discussed at the conference and the event itself garnered significant interest, even from the <a href="https://siol.net/posel-danes/novice/izobrazevanje-gradbenistvo-in-hrana-to-umetna-inteligenca-dela-ze-danes-617440#">Slovenian media</a>.</p><p>About OriginTrail</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> is an ecosystem dedicated to making the global economy work sustainably by enabling a universe of AI-ready Knowledge Assets, allowing anyone to take part in trusted knowledge sharing.

<p>Lovesh Harchandani from Dock presents their approach to anonymous credentials and dives in on the various predicates that can be proven in zero knowledge. In over 90 minutes of discussion, we cover what these cryptographic techniques are, how they enable several important use cases for digital identity credentials, and we stretch James Monaghan’s ability to keep up as interviewer by taking a look at the source code which makes it all possible! We show how various zero knowledge primitives we’ve built can be used in a modular fashion to solve real-world use cases. We cover privacy-preserving signature schemes, zero knowledge attribute equalities, range proofs, and verifiable encryption based on ZK-SNARKs, expressing arbitrary predicates as Circom programs and creating ZK proofs for them and blinded credentials (issuer is unaware of all attributes). For anyone interested in the technical underpinnings of this new frontier of digital identity, this episode is a must!<br></p>

<p>Background</p>



<p>In the world of user-controlled digital credentials, one thing has become clear – it’s not a question of if these technologies will be adopted, but when. Decision-makers from both public and private sectors around the world are increasingly inclined to integrate digital credentials into their organisations and ecosystems.</p>



<p>Once the choice to adopt user-controlled digital credentials is set, a fresh challenge pops up: navigating the sea of standards and tech options out there. Diving into the technical details of specifications can be overwhelming, especially when trying to weigh business requirements and other contextual factors against the many options available. The mountain of documentation doesn’t help either. It’s all too easy to get swamped by the choices and feel lost. Plus, grasping the subtle differences and trade-offs between specifications can be quite the hurdle.</p>



<p>So, is there a solution to simplify the process of selecting credential exchange protocols? Can we make it easier for individuals to choose the right option based on their specific context and requirements?</p>



<p>The Credential Exchange Protocols Task Force</p>



<p>At the Internet Identity Workshop, IIW 36, held in April 2023, we called a session titled “Creating a Credential Exchange Protocols Comparison Matrix”.</p>



<p>The concept arose from the need to address a prevalent issue and the desire to develop something akin to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z4cYfjbbE-rABcfC-xab8miocKLomivYMUFibOh9BVo/edit#gid=1590639334">credential profile comparison matrix</a>, created by various contributors over the past year or so. The goal was to explore the possibility of achieving similar outcomes with credential exchange protocols. The session garnered significant interest, indicating a genuine commitment to advancing this effort.</p>



<p>To ensure a solid foundation for this initiative, we decided to find a home for it. The Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation emerged as the ideal host, thanks to its community of experts, its welcoming and open culture, and its alignment with our goals. This effort primarily aims to enrich documentation around ToIP Layer 3 Trust Tasks related to credential exchange, which are among the most discussed trust tasks today. For the vision of digital trust within the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP architecture</a> to be realised, we need to streamline the process for those building trust applications that rely on digital credential exchanges.</p>



<p>Consequently, a dedicated Task Force within the Technology Stack Working Group was founded: The Credential Exchange Protocols Task Force. This group convenes weekly with a shared goal of driving this crucial work forward.</p>



<p>What has the Task Force accomplished to-date?</p>



 
 Since forming the task force, we have created a first version of the comparison criteria for digital credential issuance and presentation protocols: 
 



CategoriesSub-categories1. Protocol Objective(s)A. Protocol Objective(s)2. Protocol GovernanceA. Specification Link and Versioning<br>B. Specification Status/Maturity<br>C. Specification Body<br>D. Open Source / Intellectual Property Rights3. FeaturesA. Architecture Model<br>B. Support for Additional Trust Tasks<br>C. Communications Context<br>D. Security<br>E. Privacy<br>F. Performance/Scalability Constraints<br>G. Initiation Mechanism(s)<br>H. Transport Mechanism(s)<br>I. Authentication<br>J. Identifiers Types Supported<br>K. Credential Formats Supports<br>L. Compliance to Data Privacy Laws<br>M. Static Endpoint Discovery Process<br>N. Dynamic Endpoint Support<br>O. Additional Features4. Use CasesA. Use Case Flexibility<br>B. Offline/Online Support<br>C. Designed for Mobile Device Use<br>D. Designed for Web Browser Use<br>E. Support for Cross-device Flows<br>F. Rigidity and Flexibility of Protocol5. AdoptionA. Technology Readiness Level (TRL)<br>B. Deployment Viability<br>C. Current Implementations<br>D. Education Requirements<br>E. Deployment Complexity<br>F. Implementation Standards



 
 The group has fully documented these four issuance protocols against the above comparison criteria: 
 



 
 ACDC 



 ISO 23220-3 



 Issue Credential v2 



 OpenID4VCI 
 



<p>Here’s a sneak peek at what the comparison matrix is looking like:</p>







<p>The first version of the documentation is available here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_KKQZmmNRnEME96fZCPbMW-TC9j0tQ-dVuk5zzKa8U8/edit#gid=1229620925">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_KKQZmmNRnEME96fZCPbMW-TC9j0tQ-dVuk5zzKa8U8/edit#gid=1229620925</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that for the first version of the comparison matrix, we wanted to select a small number of protocols based on where the working group is seeing market demand. Since this effort is a lot of work, we also wanted to start small so that we could achieve a realistic version 1.</p>



<p>IIW 37</p>



<p>Because this effort was started by a session at the last <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a>, it made sense that we reconvene at IIW 37, this in October 10-12 at the Computer Science Museum in Mountain View, California.</p>



<p>During this event, we will call a session to provide an overview of the progress achieved so far. We will seek feedback from the community and implementers of digital credentialing infrastructure. This input is invaluable as it guides our task force toward the most beneficial direction for all stakeholders.</p>



<p>What are we working on next?</p>



 
 We will continue to refine the issuance protocols matrix. Our vision is to create a lightweight ‘cheat-sheet’ type of document, that will refer to further documentation underneath for anyone wishing to go deeper. 



 We will start working on documenting the presentation protocols against the same common set of criteria. 



 We want to start involving any architect or technical product owners that are decision makers or make recommendations on digital credential strategy, so that we can ensure that we’re creating a valuable document for them. 
 



<p>Want to get involved?</p>



<p>Our Task Force holds meetings every Wednesday at NA/EU: 09:00-10:00 ET / 15:00-16:00 CET. You can find the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Calendar+of+ToIP+Meetings/">calendar event here</a>. Please feel free to join our next meeting on October 18, 2023.</p>

<p>Founded in 2017 with a vision of empowering organizations and individuals with verified data, Dock has established itself as a pioneer in the <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.identity.foundation">decentralized identity</a> space. </p><p>Dock’s <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Verifiable Credential platform</a> makes any data fraud-proof and instantly verifiable. It comprises the Certs API, the Certs no-code web app, an ID wallet, and a dedicated blockchain.</p><p>While the company’s decentralized identity solutions can be implemented for a variety of use cases, Dock is currently focused on identity verification, health and safety, finance, education, and workforce sectors.</p><p>Why Decentralized Identity Matters for Organizations and Individuals</p><p>In today's digital age, managing and safeguarding identity data is essential. For organizations, decentralized identity represents a transformative approach that enhances data security, improves compliance to data regulations, and reduces operational costs associated with traditional identity management by eliminating the manual verification of physical documents, which speeds up the verification process.<br></p><p>For individuals, decentralized identity enables people to move towards reclaiming control of their data, reducing the risks of data breaches, and simplifying their online interactions. </p><p>The State of Verifiable Credential Adoption<br></p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Verifiable Credential</a> is a digital document that proves something about you, such as your identity, qualifications, or membership in a group. It's issued by a trusted source, like a school or government agency, and you can use it online to prove things about yourself. A variety of documents can be issued as Verifiable Credentials including educational certificates, driver’s licenses, passport, and professional licenses.<br></p><p>There is a global shift in the identity sector as private organizations and governments around the world are implementing digital identity initiatives. Examples include:<br></p>  <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/driving-licence/digital-driver-license?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Digital driver's license</a> projects (also known as mobile driver's licenses) are implemented in the US, Korea, UK, Australia, Denmark, and the Netherlands among others.  Electronic identification (eID) systems are becoming the standard in various parts of the world.  The total addressable market for reusable identity in 2026 is estimated to be somewhere between <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/market-opportunity-for-reusable-identity/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">$133B and $533B globally.</a> <br>  <p>These digital identity initiatives boost the demand for Verifiable Credentials because the technology enables users to prove their identity, qualifications, and claims securely in a privacy-preserving manner to efficiently access a variety of services and products. <br></p><p>How Verifiable Credentials Add Business Value</p><p>1. Reduced Organizational Costs<br><br>Merit Protocol is a platform that connects employers with financial service companies to enable employees to get better access to financial services. The company <a href="https://blog.dock.io/merit-protocol-and-dock-partnership/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">integrated Dock’s Verifiable Credential technology</a> to enable employers to issue fraud-proof credentials that can instantly verify employment history and income data. Alex Lyashok, Merit Protocol’s CEO and Co-Founder, anticipates that this will reduce the cost of the loan application process by up to ten times while preserving employees’ privacy.<br></p><p>In terms of reduced data storage expenses, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlHBqssIMtM&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dock interviewed Marie Wallace</a>, the Managing Director and Digital Identity Lead at Accenture, she spoke about the benefits she experienced by using a decentralized data architecture with the implementation of IBM’s Digital Health Pass. Digital Health Pass was one of the biggest IBM projects she was involved in with the least number of issues, which she attributes to the decentralized data architecture. <br></p><p>Marie said, “We were issuing millions of these credentials and hundreds of millions of verifications, and our systems were super lightweight. You didn’t have these situations where you were concerned about servers going down or the internet glitching because that just never ever was an issue.” <br></p><p>2. Instant Credential Verification<br></p><p>Traditional verification processes often take days, weeks, or even months. In the US for example, thousands of <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2022/03/11/nurse-licenses?ref=blog.identity.foundation">nurses waited for months, often over 6 months</a> to get their nursing licenses after they completed their program as a result of delays in the verification and issuance processes. Verifiable Credentials enable healthcare employers to instantly verify credentials in seconds which can significantly speed up the hiring process.<br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Hh9kq29bPSA?feature=shared&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dr. Wendy Charles from BurstIQ</a>, Dock’s customer, explained why she wishes more employers and training institutions would issue Verifiable Credentials. <br></p><p>She had to hire research staff with very specific qualifications and all of the resumes she looked at claimed these qualifications. Because there was no way she could really know if they had the right skills, sometimes she ended up hiring people that were ultimately unqualified. She said, “My greatest concern was that an unqualified person could harm their patients. If there were two candidates that had comparable presentations in their resumes and interviews, I would hire the one with verified credentials.” <br></p><p>3. Efficient Credential Issuance<br></p><p>SEVENmile, an entrepreneurial program in Australia that connects high school students with business owners to learn problem-solving techniques, used Dock to issue <a href="https://www.dock.io/use-case-sevenmile?ref=blog.identity.foundation">hundreds of digital graduation certificates</a> as Verifiable Credentials.<br></p><p>“At SEVENmile Ltd., we believe that the move to ownership of our personal data will help transform how the internet functions and how our data will be protected. We’re applying this philosophy by working with Dock to secure the credentials of students we train,” said Greg Twemlow, SEVENmile’s CEO.<br></p><p>4. Enhanced Privacy and Security With Fraud-Proof Credentials<br></p><p>Verifiable Credentials are designed to enhance privacy by giving individuals full control of their data. With decentralized identity, personal data is securely stored with the individual’s digital identity wallet rather than being scattered across multiple company databases. Users can choose who they share their identity with and to what extent. <br></p><p>Centralized databases are prime targets for hackers because they can access a large amount of user info at once. By decentralizing identity data, the "honeypot" effect is minimized, making large scale breaches less likely. <br></p><p>Gravity Training is a leading training provider of commercial work-at-height solutions in South Africa with international locations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and India. The organization uses Dock to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1jUoQXNHFU&amp;ref=blog.identity.foundation">eliminate health and safety certificate fraud</a>. Fake health and safety certificates is a big problem in South Africa and creates a huge risk when companies hire unqualified people with high-risk construction work. <br></p><p>Before using Dock’s certification platform, the organization had to manually issue thousands of certificates, which took a lot of time and resources. Employers and inspectors had to contact the issuer directly to ensure the certificates were valid. With Dock, Gravity can now automate the issuance of thousands of fraud-proof certificates a year that can be instantly verified. <br></p><p>5. Enhanced Compliance<br></p><p>In an era where data privacy and security are essential, Verifiable Credentials can play a key part in an organization’s compliance toolbox, by providing a secure and standardized method for handling sensitive information.<br></p><p>While Verifiable Credentials alone don’t necessarily guarantee compliance, they can be used as a tool as part of a larger compliance program and it depends on how they’re implemented. For example, Verifiable Credentials makes it easier for BurstIQ to comply with data regulations including GDPR and HIPAA while <a href="https://www.dock.io/use-case-burst-iq?ref=blog.identity.foundation">making health data verifiable, secure, and portable</a>. <br></p><p>6. Interoperability<br></p><p>Interoperability ensures that our systems, services, and data can seamlessly connect and communicate with one another. In the context of credentials, this means that individuals, organizations, and institutions can exchange verified information and credentials across various platforms, applications, and systems without encountering compatibility issues. <br></p><p>Credentials that follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">W3C Verifiable Credential standard</a> are interoperable, which enhances efficiency, reduces friction, and unlocks new revenue streams for businesses. The international standard establishes a common language and framework for digital credentials.</p><p>Dock’s Involvement With DIF<br></p><p>Dock became a DIF member to support the important work of creating specifications that become standards. Different aspects of the technology are often changing and organizations are continuously collaborating to get alignment to enable more standardization in the industry. For example, there is a lack of standards around Zero-Knowledge Proof solutions and DIF is working towards aligning to BBS+ signatures as the format that is the most advanced towards standardization. <br></p><p>Dock CEO Nick Lambert said, “We joined the Decentralized Identity Foundation to be as closely aligned to international standards as possible as we implement solutions for a variety of use cases. Our membership helps us connect with a global network of experts. Together with DIF, we're driving innovation, setting global benchmarks, and ensuring the highest levels of data security for our clients.”</p>

<p>By Mark Haine &amp; Drummond Reed</p>



<p>This blog post is being published jointly by the ToIP Foundation and the OpenID Foundation because it addresses a key piece of the interoperability puzzle on which we collaborate to achieve our mutual missions. We hope it is an example of the increasing synergy we will need to achieve globally interoperable decentralized digital trust infrastructure.</p>



<p>A persistent goal of digital identity technology is to enable relying parties to reach the level of identity assurance they need to proceed with any specific interaction. Although there are many descriptions of “identity assurance levels”, such as the three levels defined in the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST SP 800-63</a> series <a>(1)</a>, the goal itself is technology-independent, i.e., it remains the same no matter what technology is used to achieve it.</p>



<p>For the past three years, the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group</a> at the<a href="https://openid.net/"> OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) has been working on a specification called OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance as an extension to<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html"> OpenID Connect</a>. This specification has had contributions from a wide range of countries and industries as well as multiple early implementations.</p>



<p>More recently, the verifiable credentials (VC) community has begun to discuss how digital wallets and VCs could convey the information necessary to achieve different levels of identity assurance. But they have not yet converged on the specifics.</p>



<p>Given the universal need for identity assurance, the underlying meaning of the terms we use should be the same regardless of the specific technology used to convey the assertions. That was exactly the conclusion reached by the OIDF<a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/"> eKYC &amp; IDA Working Group</a>. They decided to modularize the OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance draft, separating out the schema definition for an element called “verified_claims”. They realised that this JSON structure could be, in their words, “re-usable across many different contexts and application layer protocols including but not limited to OpenID Connect and Verifiable Credentials”. The separated schema definition will also be available to the newly formed <a href="https://openid.net/wg/digital-credentials-protocols/">Digital Credential Protocols Working Group (DCP WG)</a>, that is working on OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations drafts.</p>



<p>The new specification is called OpenID Identity Assurance Schema Definition. The schema it defines allows representation of the wide variety of semantics defined in different identity assurance standards such as NIST SP 800-63, ISO/IEC 29115, UK GPG45, and eIDAS. It includes a significant number of optional elements to allow for any depth of description (from minimised to very verbose) of the identity assurance level, process and evidence that underpin the digital identity in question.</p>



<p>This new specification reflects the advice of a recent white paper from the Open Identity Exchange (OIX) called<a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/networks/87/item.html?id=700"> Data Standards for Digital ID Interoperability</a>. Regarding international interoperability of higher assurance digital identity, it says:</p>



<p>“A single protocol independent data standard must be created. It must allow core ID information and evidence to be communicated consistently, regardless of the protocol used to securely exchange it (e.g.OIDC, Verifiable Credentials). The OIX view is that this should be based on the<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html#section-appendix.b"> OIDC for Identity Assurance</a> standard.”</p>



<p>The Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation welcomes this new specification and looks forward to reviewing and commenting because it fits perfectly into the goal of ToIP architecture: enabling universal interoperability of decentralized digital trust infrastructure, including digital wallets and VCs. Any standard that helps ToIP achieve this goal is a step in the right direction, especially one that addresses the real, quantifiable market need for faster, easier, stronger digital identity assurance.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the need for higher levels of identity assurance is a signal that a digital trust ecosystem is mature enough to need the governance tools and models such as the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/02/01/the-toip-foundation-releases-its-first-official-governance-specifications/">ToIP Foundation has been developing</a> over the past three years. Policies that clearly specify the level of identity assurance required for a particular transaction—together with the digital wallets and credentials that can satisfy those policies—are the oil that can make the flow of commerce easier and faster for all participants.</p>



<p>The next step is for the OIDF to advance their suite of identity assurance specifications to the final approval stage. After this, market forces are expected to drive the development of a set of re-usable profiles of these standards that meet the needs of different digital trust ecosystems across many different industries and jurisdictions. At that point we should finally begin seeing the market traction for digital identity assurance, whether centralized, federated or decentralized, that has long been one of the holy grails of our industry.</p>

 Highlights from Season 7 of The Tao of WAO&nbsp;podcast <p>We’ve recently wrapped the seventh season of our podcast where we explored the complex and ever-evolving world of Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>From ethical considerations and societal implications to the nuances of AI literacy, the season offered a comprehensive exploration that went beyond the technical jargon. Laura and Doug engaged in critical conversations that aimed to demystify this transformative technology, offering listeners a balanced perspective on its potential and pitfalls.</p><p>This blog post serves as a retrospective, highlighting key moments and insights from a season dedicated to understanding AI in all its dimensions.</p> Relevant links   <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/">Season overview&nbsp;page</a>  <a href="https://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:938068006/sounds.rss">RSS feed</a>  <a href="https://pod.link/1568662122">Pod.link</a> (provides links to subscribe via your favourite platform)   Episode 1 — Curiosity is&nbsp;Human <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e01-curiosity-is-human/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>We discuss concept of curiosity with guests Paul Ashcroft and Garrick Jones. The conversation explores the historical evolution of curiosity, its role in innovation, and its impact on emotional and physical well-being. The guests explore into how curiosity can be nurtured like a muscle and its significance in the age of AI and digital transformation.</p>  Paul Ashcroft: “Essentially you can hack your own biological system just by being curious.”  Garrick Jones: “It’s fascinating how I think the curious and the innovative were relegated to the ninth level of hell, which is the worst hell in Dante’s Inferno. And because they want to mess with the structures.”   Episode 2 – Credentials &amp;&nbsp;AI <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e02-credentials-ai/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Tim Riches and Omid Mufeed join us to discuss the evolution and future of Navigatr, a platform focused on skills recognition through Open Badges. They highlight the role of AI in simplifying the badge creation process and its potential to personalise learning pathways. The platform aims to bridge the gap between skills and employment opportunities, offering a live jobs feed linked to&nbsp;badges.</p>  Omid Mufeed: “Why can’t we have the technologies that tell us what to learn next to change our&nbsp;lives?”  Tim Riches: “It’d be great if you could just kind of switch the app on wherever you were…and it could start to show you things which just got you interested first and got you engaged in learning and then started to open up opportunities for&nbsp;work.”   Episode 3 — Cognitive Liberty <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e03-cognitive-liberty/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Laura and Doug tackle the ethical and societal implications of AI. They discuss its potential as a ‘thought partner’ in decision-making, the concept of cognitive liberty, and the risks of AI entrenching existing power structures.</p>  Laura Hilliger: “How do we ensure that people keep cognitive liberty if they’re being manipulated by these algorithms or by&nbsp;AI?”  Doug Belshaw: “Our democratic and civic infrastructure is being replaced by decision-making tools which are beholden to a small&nbsp;elite.”   Episode 4 — Public Service and&nbsp;AI <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e04-public-ai/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Matt Jukes comes on the podcast to discuss his career journey, which spans various roles in the public sector, including his current (at the time) position at the Office for National Statistics. He talks about the challenges of digital transformation in the public sector, emphasising the importance of user needs and data. Matt also shares his views on leadership, AI, the role of blogging, and the need for a supportive culture to drive&nbsp;change.</p>  Matt Jukes: “Ministers particularly are fascinated with [AI] and are pushing departments and and digital teams and their policy people across every corner of government to to see how it can be&nbsp;used.   Episode 5 — Workforce development <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e05-workforce-development/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Prof. Krystal Rawls joins to advocate the importance of community involvement in technology adoption, particularly in bridging the digital divide. She emphasises that solving community issues is not just about providing devices but also about removing the fear of innovation and technology. Krystal argues for a more holistic, respectful approach to community needs, advocating for the use of AI and other technologies as tools for empowerment. She also touches on the ethical considerations of technology adoption, stressing the need to respect different cultures and perspectives.</p>  Krystal Rawls: “And so from my lens, things as simple as right, I have to train people on how to use this technology. How about I provide you with some prompts of AI and a training in AI and let you go and learn for yourself and interrogate for yourself the things that you need to know. And so I can be used in some really innovative ways to help close the digital&nbsp;divide.”   Episode 6 — AI&nbsp;Literacy <p><a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/products/podcast/season-7/s07-e06-ai-literacy/">Show notes and transcript</a></p><p>Doug and Laura wrap up the season by exploring the complexities of AI literacy, and emphasising the need for critical thinking and mentorship when interacting with AI tools. They discuss the limitations of AI, likening it to a “competent intern,” and discuss the ethical and societal implications of AI’s lack of transparency and potential for bias. The conversation also touches on the need for collective decision-making in AI governance and the importance of understanding the data on which AI models are&nbsp;trained.</p>  Doug Belshaw: “It’s interesting because one of the things that people have said is that it means that everybody gets a tutor now, but. Everyone doesn’t get a tutor as much as a research assistant.”  Laura Hilliger: “You know, when the when the printing press was was invented, it’s the time between the printing press being invented and like the masses being able to read because there is huge cultural and societal shift during like during these kind of in-between times. And I feel like with tech, we’ve been in that in-between time for 20, 30 years and with AI moving faster and faster, it feels like being web literate, information literate, media literate, tech literate, AI literate, anything that puts the literacy on it is, you know, is a it’s a moving target.&nbsp;Right?”   Next season <p>We’ve already begun recording Season 7 and are in the planning stages of Season 8, which will focused on Shaping a Media Literate Society: Exploring the Future Landscape of Media and Information Literacy.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shaping-media-literate-society-exploring-future-landscape/">Read more about Season 8&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/a-deep-dive-into-the-ethics-literacy-and-application-of-ai-8536e1814017">A Deep Dive into the Ethics, Literacy, and Application of AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>                <p>This lecture took place on 18 October 2023. </p>
<p>There is a growing unease about technology and its impact on our lives. Tech giants have grown too powerful. Our privacy is undermined. Social media is hurting our kids. Creators are not getting paid fairly. Disinformation and polarization are the norm.</p>
<p>While the solutions to these problems are largely human, (perhaps ironically) a new set of technologies can help to put us back on course: Blockchains, which enable individuals and businesses to move and store value, automate complex business processes are the first digital medium for value. AI is pushing the boundary of human and machine capability.  The Internet of Things connects everyday objects, robots and even self-driving cars to the web, forming an intelligent network for our connected world.  Augmented and virtual realities, extends our 2D web into a spatial web.</p>
<p>In this webinar, Alex Tapscott, author of the new book “Web3: Charting the Internet’s Next Economic and Cultural Frontier” explains how these technologies are not separate but related.  The Web is entering a new era and with it bringing a new internet and a new platform for the other technologies of a new digital age.

<p>This article describes the <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/post-mortem-ceramic-discord-breach/">problem of session hijacking</a> and how you can create a more secure session by combining <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Sign-in with Ethereum</a> and non-extractable keys from the WebCrypto APIs.</p> The Problem <p>A session is established in essentially all applications where users sign in. These sessions typically rely on cookies, JWTs, or similar technologies. The way they are established is roughly as follows: a user arrives at an application and authenticates in some way, usually through signing in with a username and password. The application's backend server verifies the login and creates a valid session for the user.</p><p>The session itself is stored locally in the user’s browser as a cookie or JWT. Unfortunately, this client-side data can be stolen. This is normally referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking?ref=blog.ceramic.network">session hijacking</a>—and this exact attack recently caused a <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/post-mortem-ceramic-discord-breach/">breach of the Ceramic discord server</a>.</p><p>Session hijacking works when a hacker is able to intercept the user's JWT (or other session ID). They can then use this locally on their computer to fool the application backend server into thinking that they are in fact signed in as the user. Once they are signed in, they could take all kinds of malicious actions not approved by the user.</p><p>An unfortunate fact is that in many cases, Sign-in with Ethereum is also vulnerable to this because the suggested way sessions are established is <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/sign-in-with-ethereum/quickstart-guide/implement-sessions?ref=blog.ceramic.network">through cookies</a>. So, what can we do about this?</p> Non-Extractable Session Keys <p>The main problem with the sessions outlined above is that the data that authenticates the session can be stolen. What if there was a way to have a session where this information was impossible to copy? Well, in fact, the  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web Crypto API</a> provides provides such functionality. This API can (among other things) be used to generate cryptographic key pairs. By default, both the public and the private key for these key pairs live in memory on web pages, which wouldn't improve the situation at all.</p><p>However, the private key can be made “non-extractable” by setting the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CryptoKey/extractable?ref=blog.ceramic.network">extractable property</a> to false. This makes it impossible for any JavaScript code or browser extension to access the private key material, effectively making it impossible to steal it. These keys can also be persisted in your application by storing them in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API?ref=blog.ceramic.network">IndexedDB</a>.</p><p>It's worth noting that this solution is not perfect. If a malicious script somehow gets injected into the client, it may still use the user's key while they have their tab open. However, as soon as the tab is closed, the hacker could no longer use this key, which is a significant improvement from complete loss of a session.</p> How to use DIDSession <p>Ok, so how can we use this to make our Sign-in with Ethereum sessions more secure? <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/introduction?ref=blog.ceramic.network">DIDSession</a> is an open-source library that we created at Ceramic to make it easy to use non-extractable keys to secure Sign-in with Ethereum sessions. This library treats your Ethereum address as a <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>did:pkh</code></a>and the non-extractable session key as a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/?ref=blog.ceramic.network"><code>did:key</code></a>. A SIWE signature is used to delegate permissions from your Ethereum address to the session key. A server can then verify that a message originated from a session key that has been granted permissions from the Ethereum account. To use DIDSession, you first need to install it in your application.</p> Creating a session <p>First we create a session. The code below will prompt the user to sign a SIWE message and finally a session will be created. This session will automatically be persisted in IndexedDB.</p> <code>import { DIDSession } from 'did-session'
import { EthereumWebAuth, getAccountId } from '@didtools/pkh-ethereum'

const ethProvider = window.ethereum // Metamask, WalletConnect or similar
const addresses = await ethProvider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })
const accountId = await getAccountId(ethProvider, addresses[0])
const authMethod = await EthereumWebAuth.getAuthMethod(ethprovider, accountId)

const session = await DIDSession.get(accountId, authMethod)
</code>  Sign a message and send to server <p>Using the session, the application can now sign any arbitrary message and send this message and the object-capability (SIWE message) along to a server. All signed messages will happen in the background without any further action required by the user.</p> <code>const jws = await session.did.createJWS({ hello: 'world' })

const request = {
  capability: session.did.capability
  jws,
}

// send the request object to your backend server
</code>  Validate user action on server <p>Once the request is received on a server, its signature can be verified; simply looking at the object-capability we can see which user took the given action.</p> <code>import { DID } from 'dids'
import * as KeyResolver from 'key-did-resolver'

const did = new DID({ resolver: KeyResolver.getResolver() })

const result = await did.verifyJWS(request.jws, { capability: request.capability })

console.log('User account:', request.capability.p.iss)
console.log('User action:', result.payload)
</code>  Benefit of Using Ceramic <p>While DIDSession can improve security of SIWE, when interacting with a backend server, we can take applications one step further by storing user data on a decentralized network. This is the reason we built Ceramic, and DIDSession is the native way to write data into the protocol.

<blockquote><p>NIST’s Digital Guidelines are respected and referenced throughout the world so why does New York leave open the potential for ambiguous technology implementations which could be based on standards which are not parallel with efforts to support RON?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Michael Magrath, Director of Identity Policy and Industry Relations, Easy Dynamics Corporation</p>
<p></p>
<p>New York State, the financial capital of the world, undoubtedly sits at or near the top of most cyber criminals’ “hit list”. But it has fallen short when it comes to recent regulatory acts pertaining to identity and authentication.&nbsp; Two recent actions in different departments are alarming during this age of deep fakes and nation-state cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Identity Proofing for Remote Online Notarization (RON)</p>
<p>While RON has been available for a few years, the pandemic was the catalyst for wider spread adoption and use throughout the U.S.&nbsp; New York is no exception and recently revised its RON regulation.&nbsp; On January 25th the New York Department of State amended Title 19 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR), Chapter V, Subchapter E, Part 182 as it relates to RON. Section 182.7.a reads, “Identity proofing must meet, at minimum, the Identity Assurance Level 2 standard as outlined in the Digital Identity Guidelines of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as referenced in subdivision (b) of this section, or any industry accepted standard that is at least as secure, or more secure, than that standard.”</p>
<p>“Or any industry accepted standard at least as secure, or more secure, than that standard?”&nbsp; Huh?!! “Secure” according to which certification body?&nbsp; NIST’s Digital Guidelines are respected and referenced throughout the world so why does New York leave open the potential for ambiguous technology implementations which could be based on standards which are not parallel with efforts to support RON? In addition, unforeseen risk and exposure may occur due to lack of “uniformity” needed for both RON service providers and all relying parties.</p>
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2, commonly referred to as IAL2 is defined in NIST’s the Special Publication 800-63-3 suite of documents, specifically 800-63a, which is part of the SP 800-63-3 suite of documents last revised in 2017 and currently in the process of being updated.&nbsp; Federal agencies must comply with NIST’s guidance and over the years many state, county and local governments as well as commercial entities have embraced 800-63-3.&nbsp; Many have written 800-63-3 certification as a requirement for vendors into RFPs.</p>




<blockquote><p>Regulations should be “black and white”, as far as is possible.&nbsp; In the case of IAL2 for RON, black and white was possible, but NY regulators opted for gray leaving vendors, state agencies and commercial organizations with questions</p></blockquote>








<p>No doubt, the regulation caught the attention of all RON vendors given New York’s population and position in the financial industry.&nbsp; To date, states that have enacted laws permitting RON have for the most part written portions of MISMO’s RON standards into their laws, which have no requirement to comply with NIST’s IAL2. MISMO is short for the Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization, according to its Wikipedia entry, MISMO is “a not-for-profit, wholly owned subsidiary of the Mortgage Bankers Association responsible for developing standards for exchanging information and conducting business in the U.S. mortgage finance industry.”&nbsp; With all due respect to the MBA, RON laws and regulations should not be developed by a trade organization’s subsidiary.</p>
<p>Most vendors meet IAL2 by combining the scan of a government issued identity document such as a driver’s license or a passport, a bank statement or utility bill, with a selfie that can be checked for liveness. This provides assurance that it is really a live person’s face and not a recording or a mask that simply looks like someone else that is compared using biometric algorithms.&nbsp; The documents are also checked to be authentic and verified to provide confidence in the asserted identity’s validity.</p>
<p>Regulations should be “black and white”, as far as is possible.&nbsp; In the case of IAL2 for RON, black and white was possible, but NY regulators opted for gray leaving vendors, state agencies and commercial organizations with questions.</p>
<p>Proposed Amendments to the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Cybersecurity Regulation </p>
<p>The regulation, 23 NYCRR 500, places cybersecurity requirements on all Covered Entities (financial institutions and financial services companies).&nbsp; Last November, NYDFS <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/cybersecurity">proposed a second amendment</a> to 23 NYCRR Part 500 the regulation regarding cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies (the Second Amendment). After a public comment period, on June 28, 2023, a revised proposed Second Amendment was published in the New York State Register. Although the regulation still requires MFA, it is not so restrictive as to mandate a specific NIST Authenticator Assurance Level as defined in NIST’s Digital Identity Guidelines. Financial services organizations may select from a variety of authentication solutions.&nbsp; Under the proposed Second Amendment changes to multi-factor authentication (Section 500.1) include “Multi-factor authentication means authentication through verification of at least two of the following:</p>
 
 knowledge factors, such as a password, 
 possession factors, such as a token [or text message on a mobile phone]; or 
 inherence factors, such as a biometric characteristic” 
 
<p>Passwords?&nbsp; SMS?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; At a time when federal agencies are mandated to implement zero trust and use phish-resistant authenticators (passwords, one-time password tokens and SMS are not), New York is amending a cybersecurity regulation to include phishable authenticators.&nbsp; Why do this when modern phishing-resistant authentication is available?&nbsp; Sorry New York. In 2023 no cybersecurity regulation pertaining to authentication should include passwords and SMS.</p>
<p>Due to security issues in 2017 NIST classified SMS OTP as a ‘restricted’ authenticator meaning organizations or users would be taking a risk using SMS as part of two-factor authentication, exactly how the proposed Second Amendment is written.&nbsp; Why take such a risk especially when we are talking about accessing financial systems? I would encourage the NYDFS to join the FIDO Alliance and Kantara Initiative.&nbsp; FIDO standards are mature and recognized and adopted across the world. Moreover, FIDO has a stringent product certification program and maintains a certified products list which will enable Covered Entities to procure phish-resistant authentication.</p>
<p>As with RON, NYDFS should leverage NIST’s Digital Identity Guidance – Special Publication 800-63B applies to Authentication and Lifecycle Management.&nbsp; As with enrollment and identity proofing, NIST has defined three authenticator assurance levels: AAL1, AAL2, AAL3.&nbsp; AAL1 does not require MFA (passwords are acceptable) and while AAL3 is per NIST, “is based on proof of possession of a key through a cryptographic protocol. AAL3 authentication requires a hardware-based authenticator and an authenticator that provides verifier impersonation resistance”, aka phishing resistant.</p>
<p>For some industries AAL3 may be too cumbersome. However for financial services, I would argue, AAL3 met with a FIDO certified security key would be appropriate.&nbsp; For many organizations, AAL2 is acceptable based on the level of risk should the account be compromised.&nbsp; Per NIST, “AAL2 occurs by the use of either a multi-factor authenticator or a combination of two single-factor authenticators. A multi-factor authenticator requires two factors to execute a single authentication event, such as a cryptographically secure device with an integrated biometric sensor that is required to activate the device.”</p>
<p>Trustmarks and Certified Products Differentiate the “Haves from the Have Nots” </p>
<p>NIST defines guidance but does not assess and certify vendors. &nbsp;The federal government no longer maintains an approved products list of credential service providers and instead recognizes Kantara Initiative, a globally recognized, non-profit certification body for NIST’s SP 800-63-3 under the Kantara Assurance Program.&nbsp; Kantara’s five-person Assurance Review Board (ARB) even includes a representative from NIST. &nbsp;The ARB is the body that reviews assessments and awards the 800-63-3 Trustmark to vendors.</p>
<p>I will note there is a distinct difference between a vendor claiming they meet IAL2 for RON or AAL2 or AAL3 in what I hope would be in the final version of the revised NYDFS cybersecurity regulation and being assessed and awarded a Trustmark.&nbsp; I have been employed by vendors that could claim that they technically met the IAL2 and AAL2 requirements but were never assessed or awarded a Trustmark.</p>
<p>Kantara’s Assurance Program goes well beyond technical requirements and includes non-technical requirements that vendors must first self-attest to and later provide evidence to a Kantara-accredited, independent, third-party assessor. They confirm that the service can actually do what the vendor claims. Some examples include:</p>
 
 Is the vendor financially solvent? 
 How long do they retain personally identifiable information (PII)? Where is it stored and how is it secured? 
 How do they obtain user consent? 
 Do they have a privacy policy in place? When was it last revised? 
 Does the vendor have a Security Awareness and Training Policy applicable to all employees? 
 Do they have an Information Security Management Plan? When was it last revised? 
 
<p>While many RON vendors may qualify for Kantara Trustmark, as of today, none have been approved directly. Some may, however, be partnered with credential service providers that have been certified.&nbsp; One exception is Proof (formerly Notarize) which was recently awarded a Trustmark and is listed on Kantara’s <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-status-list/">Trust Status List. </a>To thwart the ambiguity in identity and authentication regulations, I recommend that procurement officers in New York (and the other 49 states) require a Kantara Trustmark to meet the intent of the regulation.</p>

 Specifications 

<p></p>

<p>Creating specifications is one of the most important things we do at Blockchain Commons, because it allows developers to work together in interoperable ways, and thus creates a more resilient ecosystem for all of our digital assets.</p>

<p>IETF. In July we attended IETF 117 with the goal of advancing some of our specifications into standards that will allow their wider use.
We had a meeting on Gordian Envelope as well as a slot for talking about dCBOR as part of the CBOR meeting, and both allowed for notable advancement of those specs.</p>

<p>dCBOR. Our Internet-Draft for dCBOR has been changed from being “implementation details” to being an “application profile”, which makes it a description of how an application might implement a subset of CBOR —&nbsp;in this case to produce deterministic results. With this understanding in place we have released <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/05/">v05 of our dCBOR draft</a> and feel confident that we are zeroing in on a spec that will be accepted by the CBOR community.</p>

<p>More recently we also wrote a very short research paper on our preferred encoding of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-008-dcbor-date.md">dates in dCBOR</a>.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our discussions at IETF 117 also allowed us to finalize negotations for which CBOR tags we can receive from IANA. As a result, we’ve been able to tighten up the Envelope spec in a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/">new draft</a> by simplifying the core of Envelope and minimizing the tags we used. Simultaneously, we received the registration of <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml">CBOR Tag #200</a> for Gordian Envelope. Note this was a breaking change, but because of the official IANA recognition and the IETF guidance and support, we feel quite comfortable with the newest iteration of Gordian Envelope going forward.</p>

<p>The updated spec also trimmed a lot of features from Gordian Envelope, to allow for its more general use. However, we’re reintroducing those features through new research papers, which cover <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-003-envelope-known-value.md">known values</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-004-envelope-symmetric-encryption.md">symmetric encryption</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-005-envelope-compression.md">compression</a>.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope Attachments. We’ve also developed a major new feature for Gordian Envelope: <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-006-envelope-attachment.md">attachments</a>. These encode vendor-specified data, allowing for the inclusion of specific, typed data, either in an open and interoperable way or in a private way, as an individual vendor prefers.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope Keys &amp; Seeds. Finally, we published two more research papers, covering the storage of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-007-envelope-output-desc.md">Bitcoin output descriptors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-009-envelope-seed.md">seeds</a> in Gordian Envelopes. We think these will again improve interoperability, and as a result Envelopes are now the preferred method for exchanging keys, seeds, and output descriptors in our reference apps.</p>

<p>If it’s not obvious, nailing down the fundamentals of Gordian Envelope allowed for a very creative period of expansion and extension for the format. We’re very grateful to IETF for working with us to reach this spot and are thrilled to have extended the community of Gordian developers to this larger organization.</p>

 Code &amp; Libraries 

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyICk0lwL0#t=3143s"></a></p>

<p>Our specifications become reality through reference libraries and reference apps that we make available to developers interested in implementing our protocols. In addition to all our work on dCBOR and Gordian Envelope, we were able to make notable expansions here as well.</p>

<p>Rust Libraries. We have been developing new versions of all of our core cryptography libraries (including Envelope and SSKR) for Rust. Besides performance and type safety advantages, this also allows for easy usage on Android. The libraries are now in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions/116">community review</a>. We’re looking to see if they meet your needs, so please let us know!</p>

<p>Rust Envelope CLI Tool. Using our Rust libraries, we are also working on a new version of our Envelope CLI written in Rust. It’s a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-envelope-cli-rust">Rust crate called <code>envelope</code></a>. It’s very similar to our existing Swift CLI, but without default commands, requiring more precise usage. We’ll be continuing to work on this for full release next quarter.</p>

<p>GST 1.6. We also have done some continued work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS">Gordian Seed Tool</a> to support both the changes in the Envelope spec and the ability to exchange Envelopes containing metadata with our <code>envelope-cli</code> as a proof of concept for how third-party developers can interchange data. An example of the functionality can be found in the video of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fyICk0lwL0#t=3143s">July Developers Meeting</a>. Participants in our public Testflight for GST should also be able to download GST 1.6 at this time.</p>

 Articles &amp; Discussions 

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/"></a></p>

<p>We supplement our specs and apps with a variety of documents and articles, explaining our philosophies and documenting ways to support them.</p>

<p>Return to SSI. Self-sovereign identity was one of our first pushes, even prior to the incorporation of Blockchain Commons. Its ideals of independence and privacy remain some of our most important goals. This quarter Christopher followed up on his foundational <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” article</a> with a new look at <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">“The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>. Seven years on, self-sovereign identity has prospered and spread, but in some cases it’s moved away from its original intents, which the new article discusses. Christopher also penned a piece on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/self-sovereign-computing/">“Self-Sovereign Computing”</a> which talks about self-sovereignty in the larger computing ecosystem, and how we can be the captains of our own vessels on the digital seas.</p>

<p>The concepts of self-sovereign identity aren’t just philosophical musings. They’re very important ideals that affects the safety of their users. In the past, incorrectly used identity has literally led to genocide. Working to prevent this sort of misusage is another of the origins of self-sovereign identity, which Christopher wrote about in an advance reading for Rebooting the Web of Trust 12, called <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot12-cologne/blob/main/advance-readings/ssi-echoes-from-history.md">“Echoes from History: Designing Self-Sovereign Identity with Care”</a>.</p>

<p>Return to Musings. The article on “The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity” was part of Christopher’s “Musings of a Trust Architect” column, where he writes about many of the architectural, security, and privacy decisions underlying our work at Blockchain Commons. This quarter also saw the publication of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Least-Necessary/">“Least &amp; Necessary Design Patterns”</a>, where he discussed a few different ways to look at the protection of data through minimization. Varying viewpoints in this way is important because it can give us new insights into tough security problems.</p>

<p>Return to #SmartCustody. #SmartCustody is a cornerstone of self-sovereign identity because it supports the resilient control of self-sovereign assets. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">multisig scenario</a>, which describes how to use simple tools to maintain digital assets using a multisignature, received an update this quarter to integrate it with the newest versions of <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/passport/">the Passport wallet</a> and <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">the Sparrow coordinator</a>.</p>

 Web Site Revisions 

<p></p>

<p>Websites help us to organize our documentation and make it easily available. They saw two major expansions in Q3.</p>

<p>Developer Website. We have created a new website at <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/">developer.blockchaincommons.com</a> that collects together all of our info on eleven different specifications and other projects, plus our architectural overviews — all of which was previously scattered across several different repos. The overviews of the specs are supplemented by FAQs, test vectors, use cases, and developer documentation. Take a look! And, if there’s a category of documentation that you want for a specific page, and it’s not there <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/issues">let us know!</a>.</p>

<p>As part of this work, we also created new pages for some of our specifications that had previously received less description. This includes pages on <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/dcbor/">dCBOR</a>, <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/lifehash/">LifeHash</a>, and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/oib/">Object Identity Blocks (OIBs)</a>.</p>

<p>Life with Alacrity. Some of the foundational concepts behind Blockchain Commons were originally written for Christopher Allen’s <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Life with Alacrity blog</a>. That’s where “The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity” was originally published as well as articles on Dunbar’s Number, community sizes, collective choice, and more. This last quarter we converted the old site over to a GitHub Page using Minimal Mistakes, to make sure it remains a great resource for the future. (There’s still some clean-up of tags to do, and we want to make it look a little nicer!)</p>

 Coming Next 

<p>For the coming quarter we’re going to by trying out a new salon style similar to our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salons</a> and <a href="http://www.tokenethics.com/">#TokenEthics</a> meeting: Expert Round Tables. These round tables will allow experts to both answer and ask questions about a specific area of expertise, to improve our joint understanding of the topic.</p>

<p>Our first Expert Round Table will be on Schnorr. We’ve already got a few experts lined up, but if you are currently studying or implementing Schnorr, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us</a> to apply to participate. (The whole Round Table will of course be open for viewing too, just be sure you’re signed up to our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/">Signal channels or mailing lists</a> to receive notice when we lock down the date and guest list.)</p>

<p>For the fourth quarter we also plan to finalize the Rust envelope-cli, move GST 1.6 to release (mainly pending an update to restore PSBT compatibility with Sparrow), and continue work on our reference tools for Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR).</p>
