 OpenID Foundation returns to Gartner IAM Summit to showcase Shared Signals interoperability in action 
 
 OpenID Foundation invites attendees to come along and find out how it is laying the groundwork for safer digital ecosystems leveraging shared signals. 
 
 
 December event will demonstrate the game-changing role the OpenID Foundation’s Shared Signals Framework is playing in advancing zero trust and ITDR. 
 
<p>San Ramon, CA, 06 December 2024 – The OpenID Foundation is proud to announce its return to the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/identity-access-management-us/speakers/featured-speakers/atul-tulshibagwale">Gartner Identity and Access Management Summit</a>, to be held in Grapevine, Texas, from December 9th to 11th, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on the significant success of its interoperability sessions at the <a href="https://openid.net/shared-signals-enhanced-security-for-all/">previous Gartner Summit</a> earlier this year in London, the OpenID Foundation will once again demonstrate the power and potential of its <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals Framework (SSF)</a> in securing digital identities and enabling real-time Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SSF is a game-changing open standard developed in the OpenID Foundation’s Shared Signals Working Group (SSWG). It is an open API across which different risk signals can be sent, including the Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP) and Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC). These enable applications and service providers to communicate and make dynamic access and authorization decisions.&nbsp; These protocols are providing the foundation for dynamic access control, improving response times to emerging threats. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tulshi/">Atul Tulshibagwale, Co-Chair of the OpenID Foundation’s Shared Signals Working Group</a> and CTO of SGNL, expressed enthusiasm for the upcoming event: “There is a real industry shift towards collaborative security enabled by open standards, and since it was demonstrated at the last Gartner event, the Shared Signals Framework has rapidly gained traction. Many leading companies have now announced their support for this set of standards, and are in the process of implementing them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s why we are delighted to have been invited back by Gartner to run these interoperability sessions with implementers who will demonstrate how these protocols are enabling robust Zero Trust architectures and enhanced security through seamless, real-time collaboration.”</p>
<p>Gail Hodges, the Executive Director of the OpenID Foundation said, “Shared Signals is a critical new open standard to address the current threat environment, as&nbsp; recognized by a recent report from the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf">CISA Cybersafety Review Board</a>. Gartner’s invitation to the OpenID Foundation to demonstrate interoperability of Shared Signals is a fantastic step on the journey to global scale and interoperability, by engaging industry leaders at this Gartner IAM Summit.”</p>
<p>Attendees of Gartner IAM Summit are invited to participate in two key sessions:</p>
 
  Building a Trust Fabric with the OpenID Shared Signals Framework&nbsp; 
 
 
 Monday, December 9th, 2:30 PM – 3:00 PM (CST).&nbsp; 
 
<p>Led by the OpenID Foundation’s Atul, together with Garner VP Analysts Felix Gaehtgens and Erik Wahlstrom, this session will explore the role of SSF in building a secure trust fabric, demonstrating how organizations can leverage open standards to streamline security event communication.</p>
 
  Shared Signals Interop Demos: CAEP and RISC in Action 
 
 
 Tuesday, December 10th, 12:00 PM – 12:30 PM, 2.00 PM – 2.30 PM, 3.45 PM – 4.15 PM (CST).&nbsp; 
 Wednesday, December 11th, 12 PM – 12.30 PM, 1 PM – 1.30 PM, 2.45 PM – 3.15 PM (CST).&nbsp; 
 
<p>Led by Atul and Elizabeth Garber of the OpenID Foundation, this interactive session will feature live demonstrations from leading implementers, showcasing how SSF, CAEP, and RISC work together to enable real-time ITDR.</p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation encourages all attendees to book time with interoperability participants, including industry leaders like AppOmni, caep.dev, Cisco, Delinea, Google, IBM, Jamf, Okta, Omnissa, SailPoint, Saviynt, SGNL, Thales, WinMagic.&nbsp; These one-on-one sessions will offer an in-depth look at how SSF is addressing real-world security challenges and laying the groundwork for a safer digital ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1944, amid the devastation of World War II, representatives from 44 Allied nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to design a new global financial system. They aimed to prevent the economic turmoil that had contributed to the Great Depression and the war. The result was a system where currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar, which was convertible to gold—a framework intended to foster stability and growth.</p>
<p>By 1971, the Bretton Woods system collapsed. The U.S., facing mounting debts and dwindling gold reserves, ended the dollar’s convertibility to gold. This shift ushered in the era of fiat currencies—money backed by government decree rather than physical commodities. While offering monetary policy flexibility, fiat currencies led to inflation, currency devaluation, and financial crises. Today, the world grapples with over $300 trillion in debt and increasing economic instability.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2009, Bitcoin emerged as a decentralized electronic cash system introduced by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto. Conceived as “digital gold,” Bitcoin is a scarce asset with a capped supply of 21 million coins. It operates independently of central banks, using blockchain technology to ensure transparency and security. Bitcoin’s design prevents arbitrary currency creation, aligning with the principles of a free and fair market.</p>
<p>Imagine earning a salary in Bitcoin. Each year, the amount might be smaller, but its purchasing power increases over time. This deflationary system complements technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) that grow more efficient over time. We cannot sustain a system where technology displaces jobs while money loses value. Bitcoin lays the foundation for a new financial paradigm—a stable, decentralized monetary system.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite its potential, Bitcoin faces challenges in scalability and programmability. Its security leads to slower transactions and limits complex financial operations like smart contracts. Solutions like Wrapped Bitcoin introduce centralization risks, undermining Bitcoin’s ethos. Enter <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/elastos-bel2-bitcoin-layer-2-solution/">BeL2 on Elastos</a>—a Layer 2 solution that enhances Bitcoin’s functionality without compromising its principles. By transmitting information instead of transferring assets across chains, BeL2 allows native Bitcoin to talk with smart contracts and participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like loans and stablecoins while maintaining security. It employs non-custodial BTC main-net locking scripts for decentralized collateral, zero-knowledge proofs for verification and decentralized arbiters backed in <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a>‘ ELA, the <a href="http://teamela.org">Bitcoin-secured reserve asset</a> for trustless dispute resolution.</p>
<p>In 2024, Harvard students and alumni launched the <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/launch-new-bretton-woods-project-harvard-bitcoin-stablecoin/">New Bretton Woods (NBW) project</a> to address the global debt crisis through decentralized solutions. Incubated at Harvard Innovation Labs, NBW aims to create a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin via BeL2, offering stability while preserving decentralization. This stablecoin lets users avoid Bitcoin’s price volatility while retaining long-term gains, making it practical for daily use. NBW reimagines Bitcoin not just as a store of value but as the foundation of a decentralized financial system. By integrating Bitcoin with smart contracts through BeL2, NBW supports new financial products, providing liquidity and stability to the global economy.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to create a ‘New Bretton Woods’ system anchored in Bitcoin,” said Jacob, Lead Member of NBW. “This initiative offers a decentralized and stable currency to help individuals and communities navigate the challenges of the global debt crisis.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Building on these innovations, Elastos Founder and thought-leader <a href="https://x.com/SunnyFengHan">Feng Han</a> has proposed AI Kallipolis—a fully autonomous economic management AI inspired by Plato’s ideal city-state. AI Kallipolis operates without human intervention, capable of on-chain asset issuance and decentralized key management. It integrates artificial intelligence and blockchain to create a self-regulating economic order.</p>
<p>“AI Kallipolis functions as an impartial executor of market rules, free from external interests,” Feng Han explains. “It promises a more transparent marketplace where interactions between humans and AI are secured.”</p>
<p>This vision aligns with an AI Utopia where AI and human society coexist harmoniously through the Elastos SmartWeb, and powered on ELA via Arbiters and universal gas. The aim is for AI to advance technology while safeguarding human freedom and privacy. By leveraging Bitcoin’s decentralized properties as the base layer, it seeks to build an automatically managed economic system without intermediaries. Integrating AI and blockchain offers solutions to complex issues like the debt crisis. By optimizing resource allocation and enhancing transparency, these technologies can alleviate economic pressures without central banks. AI Kallipolis and NBW aim to foster a more sustainable and equitable economic model by combining these technologies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Looking ahead, the convergence of AI and blockchain could bridge human and AI civilizations. Elon Musk’s vision of an interstellar society gains new meaning when considering a future where AI agents and humans operate within a unified digital economy. In this scenario, AI Kallipolis, underpinned by Bitcoin, serves as the bridge between carbon-based and silicon-based life. As this economy grows, Bitcoin may function as Ray Dalio predicts—addressing global debt challenges and fostering unprecedented economic resilience. We stand on the brink of a paradigm shift. The convergence of Bitcoin, advanced protocols like BeL2, and AI represents a transformative change in how we conduct finance and manage resources. This future offers independence and abundance.</p>
<p>As Feng Han notes, “Viewing all systems—biological, social, or economic—as computational processes, the development of advanced AI is not an anomaly but an inevitable outcome.” The question is not whether we’ll embrace this new narrative but how quickly we can realize its potential. The groundwork is laid. The technology is advancing. The narrative is spreading. Next week, we will share some developments on initial Kallipolis AI Agent solutions being worked on for Elastos and our smart chain. Stay tuned!</p>

 Every purchase you’ve made until now — whether it’s a pair of shoes, a mobile phone, a laptop, or even exotic fruits — was most likely transported by sea. Globally, the maritime industry is responsible for approximately 2% of overall carbon emissions while serving as a critical component of nearly all industrial companies’ supply chains and transportation systems.  Why Katalist? <p>Decarbonizing the maritime industry is a challenging task due to the long lifespan of ships (around 35 years), which limits the speed of fleet replacement. This is why the focus has shifted to the use of low-emission fuels, enabled by a Chain of Custody model called “Book and&nbsp;Claim.”</p><p>The system allows for the decoupling of the physical low-emission fuel from its associated low-emission attribute, which can be traded separately. This approach makes low-emission fuels more accessible.</p><p>This model serves as an interim mechanism, buying time until global infrastructure is fully in place to support widespread physical use of low-emission fuels without needing to decouple the sustainability attributes of maritime fuel from its actual&nbsp;usage.</p> How? <p>To build trust among participants, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping and RMI have co-developed and continuously refined a robust methodology that all actors can rely&nbsp;on.</p><p>The role of Energy Web Foundation was to provide the technology platform in a way that shortened implementation timelines, enabled hypothesis testing, and allowed for necessary adjustments in a relatively short time compared to building everything from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Thanks to our Generic Green Proofs approach, we successfully developed two proof-of-concepts, gathering valuable insights that enabled the team to refine the solution into a full production platform — ready to launch in November at COP29 (link to the press release).</p><p>What might have taken years to build, we accomplished in months, delivering critical insights that shaped the final platform.</p> What Companies Can Do on the&nbsp;Platform   Issuance<br>The creation of certificates on Katalist follows a well-thought-out methodology. This ensures that the most relevant data is collected from ships and voyages, along with the appropriate documentation to attest to fuel attributes and&nbsp;usage.  Transfer<br>Participants on the platform can transfer certificates based on predetermined rules and restrictions.  Retirements and Export (Claims)<br>The ultimate goal for companies using the platform is to claim emission savings from alternative fuel usage in their sustainability reports.  Public Retirement Table<br>Depending on the type of company, industry actors can view varying levels of information about actual fuel usage. Once the final actor (Cargo Owner) has claimed the certificate, the data becomes publicly available through the “Public Retirement Table.”   Who? <p>The platform is designed for key maritime industry&nbsp;actors:</p>  Shipping Companies: Operators or owners of ships are responsible for purchasing fuel and uploading relevant data to the platform.  Freight Forwarders: Intermediaries in the maritime transportation cycle and vital parts of the supply&nbsp;chain.  Cargo Owners: Responsible for the contents of shipments.   What Will 2025&nbsp;Bring? <p>By the end of the year, we anticipate onboarding several companies to the platform. By early 2025, the first certificates will be issued using Katalist. Additional features will be developed, with updates shared as plans progress.</p> Conclusion <p>Energy Web contributes to decarbonization efforts by serving as a climate-tech partner, significantly accelerating the journey from ideas to proof-of-concepts and minimum viable products.</p><p>Our expertise lies in creating generic frameworks that enable faster deployments, adaptable to decarbonization plans that drive impactful climate change solutions.</p><p>If you’re interested in bringing your ideas to life faster and more efficiently using proven methodologies and connections with relevant industry actors, let’s discuss how Green Proofs can be applied to your use case.<a href="http://www.energyweb.org/"> contact&nbsp;us!</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/generic-green-proofs-use-case-applied-to-the-maritime-industry-katalist-dedf9f9ef9cf">Generic Green Proofs Use Case (Applied to the Maritime Industry): Katalist</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ensuring fairness for smaller organisations and marginalised communities Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO<p>The non-profit sector loves to talk about equity and inclusion, but when it comes to Requests for Proposals (RFPs), it’s often a different story. We’ve found too many RFPs demand hours or even days of unpaid work from agencies in a competitive process that drains time and energy. For smaller agencies, worker-owned cooperatives like <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a> and those working with marginalised communities, we see this as not merely unfair — it’s a gatekeeping tactic that shuts out new voices and reinforces the status&nbsp;quo.</p> What’s wrong with the traditional RFP&nbsp;process? <p>Larger agencies and multinational corporations employ people specifically to win new work, meaning that RFPs have become a rigged game. Smaller agencies are expected to donate hours of unpaid labour just for the chance to land a project. It’s a raw deal. While we’re happy to spend time meeting the client and gathering some context, the time and resources we pour into project plans, timelines, budgets and the rest of the proposal requirements often end up as free idea banks for the organisation issuing the tender. For smaller organisations like ours&nbsp;, this means not being able to compete. In our opinion, the process stifles innovation and limits diversity by shutting out those who can’t afford to&nbsp;play.</p> Paid discovery phases: a better way&nbsp;forward <p>One of the few organisations we’ve come across who have thought differently is <a href="https://global-dialogue.org/programmes/migration-exchange/">Migration Exchange</a>. They pay organisations and freelancers for their work as part of the RFP process, which if you think about it is a short discovery phase.</p><p>This approach is a simple, effective fix for an outdated process. Here’s how it works: organisations pay agencies to research, plan, and strategise at the outset. No free labour, no exploitation. This not only levels the playing field but creates stronger partnerships and better outcomes for everyone. Even a symbolic dayrate would encourage many smaller organisations to&nbsp;apply.</p> Why It&nbsp;Works   Collaboration rather than exploitation — Paid discovery phases give agencies the breathing room to focus on delivering their best work, knowing they’re being fairly compensated. This creates space for honest, creative problem-solving rather than rushed, underfunded guesses.  Fair play — Smaller agencies, often representing underrepresented voices, get to compete without worrying about unpaid work eating into their already tight budgets. This means more diverse ideas and solutions, which benefit everyone involved.  Better, faster results — When agencies can afford to commit proper resources upfront, organisations get thoughtful, well-researched proposals instead of rushed pitches cobbled together at midnight. Paid discovery saves time and money down the&nbsp;road.   Walking the&nbsp;talk <p>Remember that this isn’t just about fairness for agencies, it’s also about equity for the communities they serve. Smaller agencies and cooperatives often have the deepest ties to marginalised groups, but they’re the ones most likely to be shut out by unpaid RFPs. By compensating discovery work, organisations ensure these voices aren’t drowned out by big-budget players with little connection to the people at the heart of the&nbsp;issue.</p> Examples   <a href="https://madebykind.com/blog/start-your-next-digital-project-with-a-paid-discovery-phase/">Made by Kind</a> swears by the paid discovery approach as a way to transform the way tech projects are handled, aligning expectations and improving outcomes. It reduces risks and helps deliver solutions that are actually fit for&nbsp;purpose.  <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/">Open Contracting Partnership</a> focuses on fairness and transparency in procurement to level the playing field for smaller organisations. Their work demonstrates how equitable practices can help ensure that even underfunded or smaller agencies have a fair shot at participating in the tendering process.  <a href="https://matchstick.legal/blog/paid-discovery-benefits-creative-agency">Matchstick Legal</a> advocates for paid discovery as standard practice to prevent exploitation and promote fairness. Their approach ensures agencies are compensated for initial work, creating a more equitable and sustainable RFP&nbsp;process.   Change your&nbsp;approach <p>It’s time to call out the exploitation that has plagued RFPs for too long. If you’re issuing a tender, don’t ask for free labour — invest in the process. Paid discovery phases aren’t just a fairer way to work; they lead to smarter solutions and stronger partnerships.

 <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/dgna-56242-stand-der-entwicklung-der-sta#t=41">Watch: A Panel Discussion on the Development of Switzerland’s State E-ID</a> 
<p>On November 30, 2024, a groundbreaking discussion took place on the progress of Switzerland’s state electronic identity (E-ID). Organized by the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), the event shed light on the challenges and opportunities of a project poised to shape the country’s digital future. Speakers included Annett Laube, Professor of Computer Science at Bern University of Applied Sciences, Rolf Rauschenbach, Information Officer for E-ID at the Federal Office of Justice, and Daniel Säuberli, President of the Digital Identity and Data Sovereignty Association (DIDAS).</p>
 The Vision for a State E-ID 
<p><a href="https://magazin.abraxas.ch/e-government/infografik-der-nutzen-der-e-id"></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://magazin.abraxas.ch/e-government/infografik-der-nutzen-der-e-id">Der Nutzen der E-ID</a></p>
<p>The state-operated E-ID is more than a technological tool; it is envisioned as a foundation for trust and efficiency in the digital space. Following the rejection of the privately run E-ID proposal in 2021, a state-led solution focusing on privacy, data sovereignty, and user-friendliness has taken center stage. The goal is to create a digital identity that meets citizens’ needs while establishing the technological and legal groundwork for innovative digital services.</p>
 Contributions from the Experts 
<p>Prof. Annett Laube provided insights into the technological and scientific standards required for the development of the E-ID. She emphasized the importance of ensuring privacy and security through principles like privacy by design and highlighted the critical role of transparency enabled by open-source solutions. User binding is the secure process of linking a digital identity to its rightful owner, ensuring only authorized individuals can access and use the E-ID while maintaining privacy and trust.</p>
<p>Rolf Rauschenbach outlined the strategic and political considerations underpinning the project. He discussed the challenges of implementing a solution that is both technically robust and user-friendly and stressed the need for a clear legal framework.</p>
<p>Daniel Säuberli, representing DIDAS, drew attention to the essential role of trust in digital infrastructures. He emphasized three fundamental principles necessary for the success of the E-ID:</p>
 
 Strengthening Data Sovereignty: Citizens must have full control over their personal data, without unnecessary interference by third parties. 
 Promoting Interoperability: The E-ID must function on both a national and international level to enable seamless cross-border digital interactions. 
 Building Trust Through Transparency: Open communication and active collaboration with the public, private sector, and academia are critical to gaining widespread acceptance for the E-ID. 
 
 Ambition Levels for the E-ID 
<p><a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/zielbild-e-id.html"></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/zielbild-e-id.html">Zielbild E-ID</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of the state E-ID is structured around three ambition levels, each reflecting its growing capabilities and societal value:</p>
 
 Basic Functionality: At this level, the E-ID serves as a secure and user-friendly tool for digital identification. It is used primarily for core applications, such as accessing federal online services like tax filings or registry extracts, and ensures reliable authentication for administrative processes. 
 Integration into Cantonal and Municipal Services: The second level expands the E-ID’s use to services provided by cantons and municipalities. The goal is to offer citizens seamless digital access to public services across all administrative levels. Examples include registering address changes, participating in electronic voting, or applying for local permits. This integration transforms the E-ID into a vital part of Switzerland’s public administration. 
 Adoption by the Private Sector: The highest ambition level envisions the E-ID as a universal identification tool for private-sector services. This includes applications in areas such as online banking, e-commerce, and healthcare. By creating a digital ecosystem where the E-ID is widely accepted, it becomes a driver of innovation and digitization across various industries. 
 
 Connecting Principles to Ambition Levels 
<p>The ambition levels of the state E-ID are intrinsically linked to the principles outlined by Daniel Säuberli:</p>
 
 Data Sovereignty forms the foundation of the basic functionality, ensuring citizens retain control over their data. 
 Interoperability becomes essential as the E-ID is integrated into cantonal and municipal services, enabling seamless operation across different platforms. 
 Transparency is vital for the third level, fostering trust and accountability as the E-ID expands into the private sector. 
 
 Challenges and Outlook 
<p>Despite significant progress, critical questions remain: How can the E-ID be effectively integrated into existing systems? How can transparency and privacy be guaranteed? And how can public trust be secured? Addressing these challenges will require collaboration, clear communication, and an unwavering commitment to the outlined principles.</p>
 DIDAS: A Driving Force for Digital Trust 
<p>For DIDAS, the state E-ID represents a cornerstone for promoting digital trust and innovation. As a platform for digital trust infrastructures, DIDAS is committed to advancing the development of the E-ID and creating the conditions for a sovereign digital society.</p>
<p>With its state-operated E-ID, Switzerland has the opportunity to become a leader in digital identities—rooted in the values of trust, security, and innovation.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The state E-ID offers Switzerland the chance to establish a modern and trustworthy digital ecosystem centered on the needs of its citizens. By strengthening data sovereignty, ensuring interoperability, and fostering transparency, the E-ID is a crucial step forward in the country’s digital transformation.</p>
<p>However, its success depends on transparency, collaboration, and clear communication to build trust and public acceptance. DIDAS plays a pivotal role by bridging stakeholders and promoting the principles of digital trust and data sovereignty. Through a clear vision and open dialogue, Switzerland can set a global example for a digital future built on trust, innovation, and user empowerment.</p>

 Today we will take a step back from our discussions of Green Proofs-powered platforms to take a deeper dive into Green Proofs itself — why it exists, the problems it solves, and how it&nbsp;works  Why Green&nbsp;Proofs? <p>In today’s world, corporations are under immense pressure to reduce their carbon footprints, meet regulatory standards, and fulfill consumer demand for greener products. In doing so, they must balance the challenge of providing good and verifiable data that stands up to external scrutiny with protecting their proprietary information and processes.</p><p>Corporations are pursuing a variety of sustainability solutions to achieve these goals, which vary in terms of flexibility, cost and compliance with the standards of large-scale enterprises and regulators.</p><p>To address these complex sustainability needs, Energy Web developed Green Proofs — a powerfully comprehensive and configurable software solution — to bring<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/what-we-do-clean-energy/"> deep levels of transparency and verifiability to emerging green products and&nbsp;markets</a>.</p> Green Proofs technology is built to enable the following: <p>1. Buy and sell low carbon services and commodities: Whether your company deals in biofuels, green energy, or climate-conscious services, Green Proofs helps you sell and source products that can be verifiably marketed as sustainable.</p><p>2. Launch green product registries: Create transparent, scalable, and credible market access in “hard to abate” sectors that can benefit from attribute tracking and support broader decarbonization.</p><p>3. Prove your company and products are sustainable: Green Proofs provides tools for tracking and reporting progress toward environmental goals. It integrates granular data, helping you measure Scope 3 emissions and evaluate supplier impact while protecting sensitive information.</p> Green Proofs technology <p>Green Proofs is a suite of modular technology solutions that come in the form of turn-key applications or highly customized software built in close partnership with Energy&nbsp;Web.</p><p>A core technology underpinning Green Proofs software is the <a href="https://energy-web-foundation.gitbook.io/energy-web/ew-dos-technology-components-2023/worker-nodes">Energy Web Worker node network</a>. Energy Web developed worker nodes to solve a longstanding problem that hindered the advancement of energy tracking solutions: solution logic varied widely according to use case and relied on commercially sensitive data that oftentimes needed to remain private, but the results needed to be transparent and publicly verifiable.</p><p>Worker nodes address this problem by allowing enterprises to configure their own computing networks&nbsp;that:</p>  Ingest data from external&nbsp;sources  Execute custom logic workflows  Vote on results in order to establish consensus without revealing or modifying the underlying data.  Publish the consensus to a trusted, public&nbsp;ledger  <p>Worker nodes put enterprises in the driver’s seat of their application, giving them granular control over workflow logic and data inputs. The end result is an enterprise-friendly architecture that provides cryptographic proof that pre-defined rules and processes are being followed correctly, while preserving data privacy and integrity.</p><p>It is important to note that while Energy Web has historically been known for its use of blockchain, worker nodes do not exist to store or tokenize certificates and data on the blockchain. The primary use of blockchain in Green Proofs is to serve as a ledger for the worker nodes’ validation results of logic workflows.</p> Green Proofs Business Applications <p>Green Proofs helps companies demonstrate that their operations, products, and services are sustainable. It achieves this in three&nbsp;ways:</p> Helping Companies Buy and Sell Low-Carbon Services and Commodities <p>Green Proofs streamlines access to low-carbon services and commodities, empowering companies to source materials and services that both support their sustainability goals and enable the marketing/sale of verifiably green products. Currently, Green Proofs is streamlining market access to <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">sustainable aviation fuel</a>, <a href="http://autogreencharge.com">green EV charging</a>, <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/maritime">low-carbon shipping services</a>, and <a href="http://gp4btc.org">climate-aligned Bitcoin mining</a>, making it easier for companies to find the right solutions to reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.</p><p>The recently-announced <a href="https://katalist.eco/">Katalist platform</a> is an excellent example of this business application — using Katalist, maritime freight customers can lower their emissions using a robust book-and-claim system, supporting corporate sustainability claims about themselves and their products.</p> Launch Green Product Registries <p>For companies or consortia looking to establish or expand markets for emerging green commodities, Green Proofs offers the ability to launch next-generation Green Product Registries. These registries support transparent, scalable tracking of sustainable goods and services, enabling participants to securely book, trade, and retire digital certificates that represent specific environmental attributes.</p><p>By deploying these customized registries, companies can support sustainable product verification, drive growth in emerging green markets, and contribute to decarbonization efforts on a larger scale. With the flexibility and transparency offered by Green Proofs, businesses can lead the way in expanding sustainable options for their industry while building trust with customers and stakeholders.</p><p>To learn more about this business application, we invite you to explore the <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a>, where users can obtain certificates representing the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which are then used to credibly claim Scope 3 emissions reductions.</p> Track and Report Emissions <p>To truly demonstrate sustainability, companies need more than metrics; they need verifiable data that tracks the environmental impact of their products, operations, and supply chains (scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions). Green Proofs can help companies better collect, track, and report this data in detail, offering insights on both corporate-level and product-specific emissions. We are currently working with industry partners to gather requirements for this business application&nbsp;.</p> Who can use Green&nbsp;Proofs? <p>Energy Web built Green Proofs for any corporation or organization that wants to market itself or its products as green. We help customers access Green Proofs in a variety of ways — from no-code and low-code solutions that enable quick, independent launches to providing ongoing design, development, and hosting services for bespoke platforms.

<p><a href="https://www.victuscapital.io/#capabilities">Victus Capital</a>, a leading Web3.0 venture capital firm fueling the growth of companies through investment partnerships by providing not only capital but also strategic and marketing support through a vast network, has officially partnered with <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/">Cyber Republic DAO</a> LLC following a successful <a href="https://www.cyberrepublic.org/proposals/6729871a4032a1007894554d">proposal</a> to strengthen the <a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos</a> ecosystem. This collaboration is unique—it marks one of the first significant deals with a Venture Firm involving a legally registered DAO, the Cyber Republic, utilizing Elastos’ <a href="http://teamela.org">Bitcoin-merged mined coin (ELA)</a> for network governance. Elastos employs a unique governance model where ELA holders vote for delegates representing the community for a year. Community suggestions transform into seven-day countdown proposals requiring consensus—a process epitomizing decentralized decision-making and aligning with fundamental democratic principles.</p>
<p>Through phased capital contributions and a managed market-making approach, Victus Capital will help stabilize the ELA token while facilitating the acquisition of USDT stablecoins. This strategy mitigates downward sell pressure on ELA, supporting its value and boosting investor confidence. The USDT reserves will fund vital initiatives, including ecosystem development, developer incentives, and comprehensive marketing efforts designed to promote Elastos’ market presence.&nbsp; Leveraging Victus Capital’s growth team and expansive network addresses the essential needs of resource acquisition and strategic expansion. This partnership positions Elastos to make significant strides toward its mission of creating a secure, decentralized, and user-owned internet.</p>
 A Unique Alliance to Accelerate Elastos’ Mission 
<p>The internet serves as a global platform for information exchange, but centralized control over data undermines user privacy and autonomy—essential rights in the digital age. <a href="http://elastos.info">Elastos</a> envisions a decentralized internet where users regain control over their data, secured by the reliability of <a href="http://teamela.org">Bitcoin miners</a>. Achieving this vision requires overcoming foundational challenges like limited resources, market volatility, and the critical need for widespread adoption. Partnering with entities committed to decentralization and innovation is crucial. The alliance with Victus Capital is not just strategic but essential for transforming the internet’s core structure and making people aware of the technology they can use.</p>
 Building a Decentralized Future Through Strategic Investment 
<p>Traditional funding methods, like liquidating native tokens such as ELA for operational funding, exert downward pressure on the token’s value and hinder growth efforts. To preserve ELA’s intrinsic value and ensure market stability, Cyber Republic DAO and Victus Capital have devised a strategy to support the acquisition of stablecoin reserves (USDT).</p>
<p>This approach addresses the need for sustainable funding without devaluing existing assets. It provides liquidity to invest in essential areas: ecosystem development, developer incentives, and targeted marketing—all fundamental for expanding Elastos’ reach. Victus Capital’s extensive network of key opinion leaders, exchange partnerships, and development expertise fulfills the fundamental requirement of increasing visibility and adoption in a competitive landscape. By focusing on these core elements, the partnership establishes a robust framework for organic and sustainable growth, ensuring every step aligns with basic economic principles and technological innovation.

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealand-lawyer-not-surprised-if-australian-laws-change-for-retail-biometrics-use">Biometric Update Website</a></p>



<p>Digital Identity New Zealand (<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/">DINZ</a>) hosted a discussion led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/nec-new-zealand">NEC New Zealand</a>&nbsp;on “Facial Recognition and CCTV Integration in Retail Security” this week, with a panel including data privacy, government and legal experts.</p>



<p>It comes amidst industry anticipation of the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner’s conclusions on supermarket chain Foodstuff’s results from its trial of facial recognition. The company considers the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202409/early-results-positive-in-new-zealand-trial-of-facial-recognition-at-grocery-stores">preliminary findings</a>&nbsp;of the trial encouraging.</p>



<p>In Australia, retail chain Bunnings made headlines after it was found to have breached the country’s privacy laws by using facial recognition. However, the company received some unexpected support when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/retail-facial-recognition-for-crime-prevention-finds-support-in-australia-uk">78 percent of nearly 11,000 respondents</a>&nbsp;supported the company’s use of the technology.</p>



<p>In the discussion, Campbell Featherston, a partner at law firm Dentons New Zealand, mentioned that it is easier to deploy facial recognition technology (FRT) in New Zealand rather than Australia due to differences in law.</p>



<p>Commenting on the Bunnings case, Featherston remarked that the Australian retailer must obtain consent when collecting biometric data such as from FRT.&nbsp; “The absence of consent under Australian law means that it is very difficult for Bunnings to roll out facial recognition technology,” he said.</p>



<p>“The need for consent doesn’t apply [in New Zealand],” Campbell said, who commented that it wouldn’t surprise him if the privacy law had to change in Australia, such as removing the need for consent in order to accommodate the use of FRT.</p>



<p>Ross Hughson, managing director of Personal Information Management, was asked what was driving the use of FRT amongst retailers. “The key driver is health and safety of staff,” he replied, pointing to managers’ responsibility over their employees’ health and safety.</p>



<p>Featherston elaborated on how best to comply with New Zealand’s Privacy Act 2020, mentioning privacy impact assessments (PIA), having a good understanding of privacy safeguards, having human oversight of the technology, and properly trained staff. He suggested that users of the technology should be sure of the purpose of what they’re trying to achieve through its use, and to avoid “purpose creep.” Transparency is also important and retailers should have notices at the entrance of stores, and “customer-facing documentation,” he said.</p>



<p>The senior lawyer made the point that issues can arise even in the absence of technology. He brought up the example of security guards trying to identify people based on grainy CCTV footage, which could lead to misidentification.</p>



<p>Dr. Vica Papp, principal data scientist at MBIE, was invited to talk about racial biases. This is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/new-zealands-foodstuff-defends-its-use-of-facial-recognition">a chief concern of New Zealand Privacy Commissioner</a>&nbsp;Michael Webster as the accuracy of FRT for minority populations with darker skin is an issue.</p>



<p>Papp recognized that biases exist and the importance of training for staff on unconscious biases. She said that with FRT it can be a physics-based issue rather than that of “race” as people with darker skin tend to reflect less light, picking up on “light receptivity” and how this may impact FRT. But she advised that retailers should find a product that doesn’t show discrimination, that it can handle the specific local population, and to train and test the system on “well-curated data sets.”</p>

 Greening AI: A Roundtable Reflection <p>Together with <a href="https://experiments.friendsoftheearth.uk/blog/harnessing-ai-environmental-justice">Friends of the Earth (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)</a> or EWNI, we recently brought together climate and environmental justice campaigners, digital rights advocates, and other engaged activists. We discussed a set of shared principles for how we, as a collective, can think about how we apply AI technology, and how we think about AI in alignment with our values. The event, <a href="https://lu.ma/8zxfrqro">a Greening AI Roundtable</a>, was fantastic.</p>our intro&nbsp;slide<p>We were pleased to have four amazing folks come and lead the discussion:</p>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcusbernard/">Marcus Berdaut</a>, Creative Producer at the Upsetters  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marie-therese-png/">Marie-Therese Png</a>, AI Ethics PhD Candidate at&nbsp;Oxford  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-ndiwalana-62405a55/">Samantha Ndiwalana</a>, Ranking Digital Rights Research Lead at the World Benchmarking Alliance  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawna-f-663bb130/">shawna finnegan</a>, Environmental justice lead at the Association for Progressive Communications  <p>And the audience was just as amazing with people from a variety of campaigning and justice organisations, universities and non-profits. Everyone was eager to understand where the conversation of AI + Sustainability currently is and where it might be&nbsp;going.</p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/1033038783/0ca7f86a6b">Check out the recording here!</a></p> A First&nbsp;Draft overview slide of the&nbsp;project<p>In the lead up to our Greening AI Roundtable, WAO carried out desk research and engaged in user research interviews to build a set of draft principles. The draft was informed by reports, articles, and papers from organisations who have carried out deep work in this area, including Friends of the Earth, the Joseph Roundtree Foundation, the Association for Progressive Communication and many&nbsp;more.</p><p>Our shared principles aim to guide activists and campaigners in making informed decisions about their work. These seven key considerations provide a foundation when it comes to AI development, deployment and use in activist spaces, and hopefully, everywhere else. A couple weeks before the Roundtable, we sent these draft principles to our invited experts, hoping to provoke statements that would provide constructive criticism on the principles, as well as help the audience understand the complexities of the topic and the pathways&nbsp;forward.</p><p>We were not disappointed. We have some work to do to improve the first draft, and we were ecstatic for the thoughtful, articulate criticisms and praise the principles received.</p><p>Here are the DRAFT 7 Principles and brief descriptions we asked our panelists to comment&nbsp;on:</p> The Appetite for Community cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>What was striking during the Roundtable was not only the willingness of participants to dive into the topic but also the eagerness to have this space for the conversation. Though the Roundtable was a full 90 minutes long, it felt too short. It was clear that this was the beginning of something important.</p><p>There’s an opportunity for us as climate and digital rights advocates to co-create new strategies and campaigns, share knowledge, and support one another in navigating this rapidly evolving landscape. Together we can think about what a better future looks like and fight the behemoth of Big Tech and Big Business to have a say in how our world is designed. Indeed, it’s what activists have always done — present a different future, find a way to resist, suggest alternatives.</p><p>We need one another, and we need a community of practice where organisations can come together&nbsp;to:</p>  Share best practices and lessons learned from AI use and implementation  Collaborate on research projects exploring the intersection of AI and environmental justice  Develop educational resources and workshops for capacity&nbsp;building  Engage with policymakers, industry leaders, and other stakeholders to advocate for responsible AI development  <p>We believe that such a community has the potential to drive meaningful change. We’re currently exploring ways that we might bring together and support such a community. Perhaps with <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/expertise/community-calls/">a community call</a>? Such an initiative requires support, so if you have ideas about funding such an initiative, we’d be all&nbsp;ears!</p> Coming Soon <p>As organisations working to protect the planet and promote human rights, it’s essential that we have an open conversation about AI in our societies. We are now working on an article for the <a href="https://experiments.friendsoftheearth.uk/blog/harnessing-ai-environmental-justice">Friends of the Earth (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)</a> website in which we will unpack the complexities around “ethical” or “responsible” AI. We’re aiming for publication in&nbsp;January.</p><p>We’ll continue to update you on our progress!

For the past several years, Block has been developing a number of open source components to push decentralized identity forward and return ownership of data and identity to individuals.</p><p>This contribution includes open source repositories for Decentralized Identity (including the did:dht DID method), Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs):&nbsp;</p>  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): An open standard created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), DIDs are self-generated and self-owned identifiers that enable identity authentication in a decentralized world. They are comparable to an email address or username, yet are not owned and controlled by a company or stored on centralized servers. They cannot be deleted or altered by anyone except for the individual who owns them.  Verified Credentials (VCs): Verified credentials (VCs) are digital certificates of claims that are easily shared in a private and secure way. They can prove your legal name, age, ownership of an asset, or anything, really. These can convey the same information as physical credentials like a driver’s license or membership card, but in a more tamper-resistant, digital format.&nbsp;  Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs/ DWeb Nodes): With DWeb Nodes, the world now has access to an emerging standard for decentralized storage of app and personal data. This technology was developed by TBD and other contributors in open source organizations. DWeb Nodes enable developers to build decentralized apps and protocols where individuals truly own and control their data.  <p>These components will now reside in DIF’s ecosystem, where they can be further developed and supported by the open source community of decentralized identity experts. DIF, a leading organization developing decentralized identity standards and technologies, will foster these innovations and enable broader adoption by the identity community.</p><p>“We are honored to provide a home for these technologies, which are rapidly becoming the backbone of new decentralized applications. As a non-profit foundation committed to decentralized identity, DIF can ensure longevity of these components in a transparent, community-led environment,” said Kim Hamilton Duffy, Executive Director of DIF</p><p>“DIF has the right balance of builders and standards creators, commitment to decentralized identity and open source, and ability to incubate the Web5 SDK and components like DWNs and the did:dht method - where the community can continue to help shape and benefit from these technologies. We look forward to seeing the community’s innovations with these foundational tools and to making decentralized identity accessible to all,” said Manik Surtani, Block Open Source Program Office lead.</p><p>As one of the most mature, full-featured decentralized DID methods, did:dht is already advancing toward formal standardization. With support from DIF, W3C, Trust Over IP Foundation, and other leading organizations, this collaboration will bring Web5 innovations closer to reality and promote a robust, privacy-centric digital ecosystem.</p><p>Block and DIF are committed to empowering developers, organizations, and communities through open source and open standards.</p>

<p>Cambridge, MA — Tuesday November 26th 2024. As Bitcoin soars past its all-time highs, capturing global attention and sparking renewed interest in decentralized finance, a team of Harvard students and alumni called the New Bretton Woods (NBW) Labs has released a whitepaper detailing the development of a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin using the Bitcoin Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2) protocol.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos</a>, a SmartWeb ecosystem provider, BeL2 is presented in the NBW whitepaper as central to a Bitcoin-powered SmartWeb, which will redefine global finance, echoing the impact of the original Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944. Leveraging the resources available through a Harvard Innovation Labs student membership, the NBW whitepaper explains how NBW aims to replace inflation-prone fiat currencies with a stable, Bitcoin-backed currency and provides accessible, transparent, and programmable financial tools for everyone.</p>
<p>At the core of this project is the Native Bitcoin Stablecoin (NBS), a Bitcoin-collateralized asset pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. This stablecoin allows Bitcoin holders to collateralize and unlock stablecoin liquidity without selling their BTC or entrusting it to a third-party custodian, preserving wealth and providing a hedge against inflation. The NBW Bitcoin-backed stablecoin on Bitcoin-Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2) aims to provide global stability and accessibility by creating an open financial platform available to anyone with internet access, granting individuals financial sovereignty in multiple ways.</p>
<p>“We believe that a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin is not only possible but necessary,” said Jacob Li, Head of Operations at NBW. “By using Bitcoin as collateral, we can offer a stable and secure financial instrument that empowers users without compromising the fundamental principles of decentralization.”</p>
<p>Built on the <a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/elastos-bel2-bitcoin-layer-2-solution/">Bitcoin-Elastos Layer 2 (BeL2)</a> protocol, the system combines Bitcoin’s unparalleled security and decentralization with Elastos’ scalable and interoperable Bitcoin-backed SmartWeb innovation. Elastos’ BeL2 protocol enables Bitcoin to communicate with other EVM-compatible blockchains without wrapping or bridging assets or using third-party custodians. This technology enables non-custodial Bitcoin collateralization via mainnet locking scripts, verified with Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy. Oracles bridge proofs to EVM-compatible smart contracts for a service, while decentralized, collateralized Arbitrator nodes manage time-based operations and dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Advantages of NBW Approach</p>
 
 Liquidity without selling BTC: Bitcoin holders can mint NBS using their BTC as collateral, accessing liquidity while retaining ownership. This approach is ideal for those looking to preserve long-term exposure to Bitcoin’s appreciation without selling. 
 Hedge against inflation: NBS serves as an accessible, decentralized store of value, hedging against inflation without the need to convert to fiat currency. 
 Access to Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Once minted, NBS can be utilized across DeFi platforms and smart contracts for lending, borrowing, rights trading, and liquidity provision. 
 
<p>The NBW system not only anchors its stablecoin on Bitcoin’s security but also supports Satoshi Nakamoto’s <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/539/">2010 vision of merge-mining</a>&nbsp;through Elastos’ technology. This consensus mechanism allows Bitcoin miners to simultaneously secure the Elastos network without extra computational effort. With 44.58% of Bitcoin’s global hashrate merge-mining Elastos—including major pools such as Antpool, ViaBTC, F2Pool, and Binance—it achieves exceptional security, making its cryptocurrency, ELA, one of the most secure Bitcoin derivative assets worldwide. ELA additionally serves as collateral for Arbitrator nodes, enabling them to earn BTC rewards by supporting BeL2 transactions, such as dispute resolution for loans, and by facilitating stablecoin operations like NBW, which help maintain the peg and manage liquidations.</p>
<p>“People are seeking more ways to utilize their Bitcoin,” said Sasha Mitchell, Head of Operations at Bitcoin Elastos Layer 2. “Unlocking its dormant value with a stablecoin through Elastos’ solutions opens new possibilities for users to engage with decentralized finance without compromising security.”</p>
<p>Use Case for Native Bitcoin Stablecoin</p>
<p>This symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin establishes a new decentralized finance (BTCFi) model, where Bitcoin’s trust and security power scalable tools like NBW stablecoins and loans. NBS’s stability and programmability enable its use as a medium of exchange for everyday transactions, expanding decentralized finance’s accessibility. Institutions and governments can leverage NBS as a reserve asset, liquidity management tool, or framework for their own stablecoin solutions, benefiting from its transparency, decentralization, and ability to strengthen financial resilience while supporting strategic reserves.</p>
<p>By combining Bitcoin’s strengths with decentralized finance, the NBW system aims to restore financial stability, promote economic inclusion, and unlock the multi-trillion-dollar value dormant in Bitcoin today. The Native Bitcoin Stablecoin is a stepping stone toward a fairer and more resilient financial future.</p>

<p>About New Bretton Woods (NBW)</p>
<p>The New Bretton Woods project is an independent initiative led by several Harvard students and alumni, currently being developed through a student membership of the Harvard Innovation Labs during the Fall 2024 semester. By merging Bitcoin’s security with Elastos’ innovative technology, NBW aims to redefine the global financial system and introduce a stablecoin designed for the digital age.</p>

     <p>The Digital Identity unConference Europe (DICE) 2024 took place this June in Zürich, welcoming global experts to discuss not just secure digital identities but the creation of an integrated ecosystem of trust. Over three sunny days at Trust Square, attendees worked to connect digital trust to real-world economic advantages by focusing on authentic data, verifiable proofs, and practical applications that go beyond mere identification. This was made possible through the collaboration of <a href="https://www.trustsquare.com/">Trust Square</a>, <a href="https://www.didas.swiss/">DIDAS</a>, and <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a>, emphasizing the power of partnerships in advancing digital trust.</p>
 A New Direction for Swiss Digital Identity 
<p></p>
<p>Bundesrat Beat Jans, head of the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the leading figure behind Switzerland’s e-ID project, opened the conference with updates on the nation’s progress. Switzerland is advancing its secure digital identity framework while maintaining technology-neutral principles, ensuring future adaptability.</p>
<p>The new e-ID law, under parliamentary review, defines the required trust infrastructure without mandating specific technologies, providing issuers with the flexibility to choose tailored solutions. This approach strengthens market responsiveness, protects investments, and ensures seamless integration with emerging innovations.</p>
<p>However, balancing security and accessibility remains a challenge. By limiting the initial rollout of the e-ID to a government-developed open-source wallet, Switzerland aims to provide robust security while ensuring transparency. Plans to engage with the OpenWallet Foundation and promote open hardware crypto processors reflect Switzerland’s commitment to digital sovereignty and international standardization.</p>
 Beyond Identity: Building a Trust Ecosystem 
<p>DICE 2024 highlighted that the economic value of digital trust lies in creating a broader ecosystem—not just digital identities. Verifiable credentials, authentic data, and secure proofs were discussed as enablers of trust in industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics.</p>
<p>By emphasizing data integrity, industries can streamline processes, reduce fraud, and build consumer trust. For example, verifiable credentials can authenticate professional qualifications or certifications in real-time, while trusted data channels improve supply chain transparency. DICE underscored the need for governance models to maintain consistency and reliability in such ecosystems, paving the way for more secure, efficient, and scalable solutions.</p>
 Economic Implications of Trust Ecosystems

 One year ago, during COP, we proudly unveiled the <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a>. Soon after, we <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/not-for-profit-registry-launches-to-spur-sustainable-aviation-fuel-market-through-transparent-digital-tool/">launched it into production</a> alongside our visionary partners <a href="https://rmi.org/">RMI</a>, <a href="https://www.edf.org/">EDF</a>, and <a href="http://v">SABA</a>. It’s been an incredible journey, and as we mark this milestone, I wanted to reflect on where we started, how far we’ve come, and where we’re heading in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) book and claim&nbsp;industry <p>The SAFc Registry represents more than just a technical solution that Energy Web developed — it’s a mission-driven effort to decarbonize aviation. As a non-profit-driven <a href="https://rmi.org/clean-energy-101-book-and-claim/">book and claim</a> registry, it’s designed to ensure transparency, accountability, and scalability in the deployment of SAF. From the outset, our goal has been to create a trusted system for tracking and verifying SAF certificates, enabling the whole aviation supply chain to credibly participate in the energy transition.</p><p>A Groundbreaking Beginning</p><p>When we launched the SAFc Registry, it was a first in many ways for Energy Web. It was the inaugural implementation of a <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/green-proofs">Green Proofs</a> registry, setting the stage for the recent launch of <a href="https://katalist.eco/">Katalist</a>, the Green Proofs registry we built for sustainable maritime shipping. The SAFc Registry also broke new ground with the innovative use of worker node technology for data validation — a distributed, multi-party approach that ensures reliability and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Energy Web’s role initially focused on providing the technology behind the registry, but as the platform matured, so did our involvement. We’ve since stepped into the role of SAFc Registry Administrator, cementing our commitment to driving this critical initiative forward day-to-day.</p> Building Momentum <p>While the launch in Q4 2023 was exciting, the real momentum picked up in Q1 2024, and the past year has been a whirlwind of activity and&nbsp;growth:</p>  Engagement and Education: We held countless introduction calls and demos, spreading awareness about the registry and its potential impact across the aviation and energy industries.  Global Adoption: Hard work paid off as we onboarded 50 companies from across the globe and a diverse range of industries.  Onboarding and Operations: We refined our onboarding pipeline and operational processes, ensuring a smooth experience for&nbsp;users.  Impact in Numbers: To date, the SAFc Registry has facilitated over 50 SAFc issuances, representing over 3,000 tonnes of SAF that has been produced and is at work displacing the use of conventional jet&nbsp;fuel.  Continuous Improvement: We’ve listened closely to user feedback, rolled out new features (including an API for registry power users), resolved bugs, and refined our terms and conditions to better meet user&nbsp;needs.  Governance: Convening our <a href="https://docs.safcregistry.org/registry-governance">governing board</a> for the first time was a key step in formalizing the policies and processes that will guide the registry’s growth into the&nbsp;future.   Lessons Learned <p>Like any pioneering effort, launching the SAFc Registry came with its share of challenges and learning opportunities. The v1 version of the registry taught us what worked — and what didn’t. These lessons have been invaluable as we’ve evolved the platform to better serve our users. The enhancements we’ve deployed reflect our commitment to listening, learning, and adapting.</p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>Our work is far from over. Just this week, we’ve rolled out a new statistics <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">section to the homepage</a> providing users and the broader public with a clearer view of registry activity. It’s just one of many features in development as we work through a robust backlog of user-requested improvements and policy updates from our governing board.</p><p>The future of SAF is bright. Announced SAF projects are expected to increase the global supply by more than <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/how-the-aviation-industry-could-help-scale-sustainable-fuel-production">10x by 2030</a>. The SAFc Registry is poised to play a central role in supporting this growth, ensuring the scalability and credibility of SAF adoption on a global&nbsp;scale.</p> A Heartfelt Thank&nbsp;You <p>None of this would be possible without the incredible support of our partners, users, and team. As we celebrate this milestone, we’re filled with gratitude and optimism for what lies ahead. Here’s to the continued success of the SAFc Registry and the advancement of sustainable aviation.</p><p>Let’s keep flying higher — together.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global technology company driving the energy transition by developing and deploying open-source decentralized technologies.

<p>This content was originally posted on <a href="https://algorand.co/blog/algorand-foundation-joins-decentralized-identity-foundation-to-advance-digital-identity-standards?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Algorand's blog</a>.</p><p>The Algorand Foundation has joined the <a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF), strengthening its commitment to open standards in digital identity. This move follows the development of <a href="https://github.com/algorandfoundation/did-algo/blob/main/SPEC.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">did:algo</a>, a decentralized identifier (DID) built on Algorand.</p><p>Algorand’s DID method exemplifies the Foundation's commitment to standardized identity solutions, as did:algo was built to the DID Spec <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">from W3C</a> (the World Wide Web Consortium). The implementation of did:algo enables individuals and organizations to generate their identifiers using the Algorand blockchain, providing a secure and permissionless system for identity management. The method supports both direct identity creation and third-party verification, adding flexibility to identity management approaches.&nbsp;</p><p>did:algo is already being used in <a href="https://www.aid.technology/kare?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Kare Wallet</a>, enabling survivors of natural disasters to quickly confirm their digital identities and get efficient access to the aid and recovery resources they need, across multiple organizations and entities.&nbsp;</p><p>DIF leads the development of decentralized identity infrastructure through technical specifications and open standards. The organization coordinates engineers and technical teams worldwide to create specifications for digital identity systems that work across different platforms and technologies. DIF is building an ecosystem where individuals and entities control their digital identifiers without relying on centralized systems.</p><p>Bruno Martins, Principal Architect at Algorand Foundation, explains the strategic importance of this collaboration: "Contributing and aligning to open standards defined by bodies such as DIF enables us to ensure interoperability with the rest of the digital world, influence industry direction, foster innovation, and build trust. All the while reducing costs, aligning with regulatory standards, and avoiding creating unnecessary custom solutions that keep us in an ecosystem bubble."</p><p>Kim Hamilton Duffy, Executive Director of DIF, notes that Algorand’s involvement will advance core technical efforts: “At DIF, our mission is to build digital identity solutions that prioritize individual control, privacy, and security. Algorand’s technical expertise and commitment to decentralized identity accelerate our progress, strengthening our joint vision for decentralized infrastructure that empowers users with secure and trusted identity systems through open standards.”</p><p>The Foundation will continue to share updates on decentralized identity developments, particularly focusing on implementations that leverage Algorand's infrastructure for secure, scalable identity solutions.</p>

<p>How dow we get from this—</p>
<p></p>
<p>To this—</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/"></a></p>
<p>?</p>
<p>By making customers independent.</p>
<p>Hmm… maybe The Independent Customer should be the title of my follow-up to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy</a>.</p>
<p>Because, to have an Intention Economy, one needs independent customers: ones who are in charge of their own lives in the digital world:</p>
 
 Who they are—to themselves, and to all the entities they know, including other people, and organizations of all kinds, including companies. 
 What they know about their lives (property, health, relationships, plans, histories)—and the lives of others with whom they have relationships. 
 Their plans—for everything.: what they will do, what they will buy, where they will go, what tickets they hold, you name it. 
 
<p>Add whatever you want to that list. It can be anything. Eventually it will be everything that has a digital form.</p>
<p>What will hold all that information, and what will make that information safely engageable with other people and entities?</p>
<p>A wallet.</p>
<p>Not a digital version of the container for cash and cards we carry in our purses and pockets. <a href="https://www.apple.com/wallet/">Apple</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wallet.google/">Google</a> think they own that space already, which is fine, because that space is confined by the mobile app model. Wallets will be bigger and deeper than that.</p>
<p>Wallets will embody two A’s: archives and&nbsp;abilities. Among those abilities is AI: your AI. <a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">Personal AI</a>.&nbsp;One that is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=agentic">agentic</a> for you, and not just for the sellers of the world.</p>
<p>Interesting harbinger: <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/">Inrupt</a>&nbsp;now calls&nbsp;<a href="https://solidproject.org/for-users">Solid pods</a> “<a href="https://www.inrupt.com/blog/open-source-data-wallet">wallets</a>.” (<a href="https://forum.solidproject.org/t/inrupts-data-wallet/7836">Discussion</a>.)</p>
<p>Wallets are how we move e-commerce from a world of accounts to a world of independent customers with personal agency. With AI agents working for them and not just for sellers.</p>
<p>In his latest newsletter, titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.customerfutures.com/p/a-commerce-will-be-the-biggest-disruption">‘A-Commerce’ will be the biggest disruption since the web, and Digital Wallets are the new accounts</a>, Jamie Smith says this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Web3 crowd say digital wallets are about transferrable digital assets and ownership without a central authority. And they are right.</p>
<p>But there’s more.</p>
<p>Many payments and identity experts will say that digital wallets are really about identity. Proving who you are and what you are entitled to do (tickets, access). Maybe even with fancy selective disclosure features.</p>
<p>They are also right. But that’s not the whole picture.</p>
<p>A pioneering group of others believe that digital wallets are really about the portability of any verifiable information, and digital authenticity.</p>
<p>And they too are right. We’re now getting much, much closer to what I’m talking about. But there’s still more.</p>
<p>Once individuals can show up independently, with their own digital tools – digital wallets with verifiable, data, identity and digital assets – then we have something new, something special.</p>
<p>It’s a New. Customer. Channel. </p>
<p>Once a business asks for some data from a customer’s digital wallet, they have the opportunity to form a new digital connection with that customer.</p>
<p>A persistent one.</p>
<p>A verifiable one.</p>
<p>A private one.</p>
<p>An auditable, secure and intelligent one.</p>
<p>My goodness, what business wouldn’t want that? Imagine plugging that customer connection directly into business systems and processes, like CRM.</p>
<p>Yes, digital wallets can hold and manage assets. And identity. And portable, verifiable, authentic data.</p>
<p>But with the narrower ‘data and assets’ framing, we risk missing the larger market opportunity.</p>
<p>Digital wallets become the new account.</p>
<p>For everything.</p>
<p>OK so what is an account?</p>
<p>With money, it’s a shared and trusted record of all your transactions. Who did what, who paid what, and who owes who.</p>
<p>With business, it’s a shared record of all your products and interactions. It’s a critical customer channel and interface. The place people come to check things. To ask things. To ‘do business’.</p>
<p>Each customer account has a number. A unique identifier. It has a way to message customers. A way to record what’s been sent to, and received from, the customer.</p>
<p>Ring a bell?</p>
<p>Digital wallets will be able to do all this and much more.</p>
<p>They will also be more secure. More private. More flexible. And more portable.</p>
<p>So it’s possible – I’d even argue more likely – that digital wallets may be more disruptive than browsers were in the 1990s.</p>
<p>But like browsers, they will first be misunderstood.</p>
<p>Digital wallets will become the new account.</p>
<p>For business? For government? For banking? For health? For travel?</p>
<p>For life.</p>
<p>I have said for over a decade that the only 360° view of the customer, is the customer.</p>
<p>Just imagine, once a customer can bring their own wallet – their own account – to each business:</p>
 
 The economics change. Why would a business maintain a complex and proprietary account platform when digital interactions can be handled – indeed automated – via a verifiable digital wallet that’s available on every smart device? 
 The data flows change.&nbsp;Why would a business store unnecessary customer data when they can just ask for it on demand, with consent, from the customer’s digital wallet? Then delete it again once used? 
 The risks change. What if we could reduce fraud and account takeover to near zero, when every customer interaction has to be authenticated via the customer’s digital wallet (likely with biometrics)? 
 
<p>The very fabric of the customer relationship changes.</p>
<p>This is just a glimpse of what‘s possible, and what’s coming. Especially when you tie it to digital AI agents….</p>
<p>When you look closely, you’ll see that digital wallets aren’t even The Thing. They are ‘below the surface’ of the customer channel.</p>
<p>Lots to be written about that. Coming soon.</p>
<p>For now, it’s a simple switch: when you hear ‘account’, just think ‘wallet’.</p></blockquote>
 
<p>Here is the challenge: making wallets a must-have: an invention that mothers necessity.</p>
<p>We’ve had those before, with—</p>
 
 
 PCs 
 word processors and spreadsheets 
 the Net and the Web, 
 graphical browsers 
 personal publishing and syndication 
 smartphones and apps 
 streams and podcasts. 
 
 
<p>Wallets need to be like all of those: must-haves that transform and not just disrupt.</p>
<p>It’s a tall order, but—given the vast possibilities—one that is bound to be filled.<br>
As for why this won’t be something one of the bigs (e.g. Apple and Google) do for themselves, consider these five words you hear often online:</p>
<p>“Wherever you get your podcasts.”</p>
<p>Those five words<a href="https://www.cioinsight.com/innovation/pioneer-of-rss-blogs-podcasts-looks-at-whats-next/"> were made possible by RSS</a>.</p>
<p>It’s why all of the things in the bullet list above are NEA:</p>
 
 Nobody owns them 
 Everybody can use them 
 Anyone can improve them 
 
<p>When we have wallets with those required features, and they become inventions that mother necessity, we will have truly independent customers.</p>
<p>And we will finally prove ProjectVRM’s <a href="https://projectvrm.org/about/">prime thesis</a>: that free customers are more valuable than captive ones—to themselves and to the marketplace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Addressing Bias in Biometrics<br><br>Recent media coverage regarding claims of racial bias in facial biometrics has prompted the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/biometrics-special-interest-group-sig/">DINZ Biometrics Special Interest Group</a>&nbsp;to look into the feasibility of a consented dataset of Kiwi faces using its independence to take the role of custodian, facilitating subsequent software testing to address bias and accuracy.</p>



<p>Modest funding&nbsp;will be required so please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:colin.wallis@digitalidentity.nz?subject=Enquiry%3A%20supporting%20NZ%20Biometrics%20dataset">get in touch</a>&nbsp;if you would like to support&nbsp;this critical work.&nbsp;It’s essential for all public and private sector organisations deploying biometrics. On that note, we’re looking forward to&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/facial-recognition-and-cctv-integration-in-retail-security/">NEC’s webinar</a>&nbsp;next Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Reflecting on 2024 and Looking Ahead<br><br>This is the last newsletter for 2024—published during&nbsp;<a href="https://sfo.govt.nz/counterfraud/faw2024">International Fraud Awareness Week</a>—where progress on Digital Identity is essential for reducing the impact of scams in Aotearoa, as it plays a crucial role in enabling broader participation in the digital economy.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, malicious actors don’t break in—they log in. There’s a significant truth in that statement. Today, many organizations struggle to protect their staff from credential phishing, a challenge that’s only grown as attackers increasingly execute “MFA bypass” attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an MFA bypass attack, threat actors use social engineering techniques to trick victims into providing their username and password on a fake website. If victims are using “legacy MFA” (such as SMS, authenticator apps, or push notifications), the attackers simply request the MFA code or trigger the push notification. If they can convince someone to reveal two pieces of information (username and password), they can likely manipulate them into sharing three (username, password, and MFA code or action).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make no mistake—any form of MFA is better than no MFA. But recent attacks make it clear: legacy MFA is no match for modern threats. So, what can organizations do? Sometimes a case study can answer that question.</p>



<p>Today, CISA and the USDA are releasing a&nbsp;<a href="https://cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/phishing-resistant-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-success-story-usdas-fast-identity-online-fido">case study</a>&nbsp;that details the USDA’s deployment of FIDO capabilities to approximately 40,000 staff. While most of their staff have been issued government-standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) smartcards, this technology is not suitable for all employees, such as seasonal staff or those working in specialized lab environments where decontamination procedures could damage standard PIV cards. This case study outlines the challenges the USDA faced, how they built their identity system, and their recommendations to other enterprises. Our personal favorite recommendation: “Always be piloting”.</p>



<p>FIDO authentication addresses MFA-bypass attacks by using modern cryptographic techniques built into the operating systems, phones, and browsers we already use. Single sign-on (SSO) providers and popular websites also support FIDO authentication.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> allow users to log in to their secure accounts without passwords. Ecommerce businesses were first in line when the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>&nbsp;introduced passkeys in 2022. The trade association, which stands for Fast ID Online, launched in 2012 with a mission to reduce the world’s password reliance.</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director of FIDO, said the past two years have been momentous for members and ecommerce businesses. “You want to attract customers to your site and protect them from account takeover, credential stuffing, and phishing attacks,” he said. “That’s why PayPal, eBay, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and other ecommerce companies were the earliest adopters of passkey payments.”</p>



<p>Shikiar noted that passkey awareness has risen from 39% in 2022 to 57% in 2024, according to a FIDO survey of 10,000 consumers in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India, and China.</p>

<p>What is a passkey? A passkey is a FIDO authentication credential based on FIDO standards, that allows a user to sign in to apps and websites with the same process that they use to unlock their device (biometrics, PIN, or pattern). Passkeys are FIDO cryptographic credentials that are tied to a user’s account on a website or application. With passkeys, users no longer need to enter usernames and passwords or additional factors. Instead, a user approves a sign-in with the same process they use to unlock their device (for example, biometrics, PIN, pattern). </p>

<p>We all know passwords are frustrating to use, and not safe. Passkeys are the replacement for passwords. Strong cryptographic security behind passkeys prevents phishing attacks, reduces security breaches and account takeovers. Passkeys make sign-ins fast, simple, and secure. Passkeys also sync easily across all user devices, including new ones. Passkeys for businesses reduce IT time, avoid desktop hassles, and there’s no more costly password resets. </p>

<p>Greetings Elanauts! As we approach the close of 2024, we are thrilled to share progress and updates on Elastos’ BeL2 Arbiter Protocol—a key element of BeL2’s mission to provide a trustless, decentralised financial infrastructure for native Bitcoin (NB) DeFi. While development is ongoing, here’s an update on the anticipated features and the roadmap toward delivery.</p>
 
 Key Features of the Arbiter Protocol 
 
 Asset Versatility for Arbiter Registration: The upcoming protocol will support Elastos (ELA) and <a href="https://elastos.info/tutorial/elastos-bpos-nfts-faq/">BPoS NFTs</a> as acceptable assets for staking as margin. This focused asset support strengthens the connection to the Elastos ecosystem while incorporating BPoS NFTs to support additional mainchain staking and mainchain ELA rewards. 
 Governance for DApp Integration: DApps will need to register and receive approval to use the protocol. This process will either be overseen by a designated administrator or structured through a DAO protocol, ensuring fairness and collective decision-making. Further details regarding governance will be refined collaboratively with the community. 
 Transaction Management and Fees: Each DApp transaction using the protocol will designate an arbiter and incur a handling fee. The fee will depend on the arbiter’s pledged assets and the transaction duration. For instance, at a 10% annualised rate, a 6-month transaction requiring 10,000 ELA pledged would generate a handling fee of 500 ELA. 
 Future Incentive Mechanisms: At present, the protocol does not include a token issuance mechanism for arbiters. This element, part of the broader incentive system, will be evaluated during future development. 
 
 
 Development and Rollout Roadmap 
 
 Finalising Product Features (3–4 weeks remaining): The development team is focused on completing the functional components of the Arbiter Protocol. 
 Internal Testing and Refinements (~2 weeks): Comprehensive testing will follow, ensuring functionality and addressing any issues identified. 
 Alpha Release (Internal Testing &amp; Feedback): A limited release will enable stakeholders to provide feedback on the protocol’s design and performance. 
 Beta Release (Community Testing &amp; Feedback): The protocol will then be opened to the community for further testing and input to fine-tune its operation. 
 
 
 Looking Ahead 
<p>The Arbiter Protocol delivers the final piece of BeL2’s decentralised clearing service. By introducing execution through dispute resolution and time-based transaction handling, it completes the system’s foundation. This capability adds to the already established components of collateralisation, verification, and cross-chain communication, offering a fully operational framework for NB DeFi.</p>
 The Role of the Arbiter System in Decentralized Clearing 
 
 Collateralisation via Locking Scripts<br>
Bitcoin transactions are safeguarded by locking scripts, allowing users to secure assets like BTC, ELA, or NFTs within a trustless structure. 
 Verification through Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)<br>
Transaction validity is confirmed using ZKPs, ensuring data integrity and privacy without exposing sensitive details. 
 Cross-Chain Communication via ZKP<br>
The system passes ZKPs into EVM-compatible smart contracts, enabling Bitcoin to engage with external smart contract ecosystems without leaving its native network. 
 Execution and Dispute Resolution<br>
Arbiter nodes manage time-sensitive transactions and resolve disputes in a decentralised manner, eliminating reliance on centralised systems. 
 
 
 Next Steps: Expanding the Ecosystem 
<p>With Version 1 nearing completion, our focus will turn to refinement and ecosystem growth:</p>
 
 Reducing ZKP Generation and Verification Times<br>
Integrating recent optimisation of the time for ZKP processes into loan dApp to showcase <a href="https://elastos.info/news/bel2-sdk-portal-bitcoin-defi-release/">improved transaction flow</a> and user experience. 
 zkBTC Full Nodes on Mobile<br>
Enabling mobile devices to operate zkBTC full nodes will increase accessibility and decentralisation. 
 Launch of the NBW Stablecoin<br>
The <a href="https://www.nbwlabs.org/">Native Bitcoin World (NBW) stablecoin</a> will be the first major DApp on BeL2. This BTC-backed stablecoin will provide new opportunities for payments and lending while upholding Bitcoin’s foundational principles.

 Pushing Forward Interoperability in Decentralized Communication <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a> is thrilled to invite organizations, developers, and community members to participate in an exciting event centered around fostering interoperability within the <a href="https://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> ecosystem.</p> What is DIDComm? <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm (Decentralized Identifier Communication)</a> is an open standard designed for secure, private peer-to-peer communication, powered by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. Unlike traditional communication protocols that depend on centralized entities, DIDComm offers a self-sovereign approach that supports verifiable identities and ensures the highest level of privacy and security.</p><p>With the growth of <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/the-rise-of-didcomm-and-its-impact-on-key-industries-preparing-for-eidas/">DIDComm implementations across the ecosystem</a>, this event presents an opportunity to come together, test integrations, and enhance interoperability in a collaborative environment.</p> Event Details <p>Date: December 12, 2024&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Time: 7:00 am PT / 3:00 pm GMT&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Format: Each testing session will be 30 minutes long. Participants can choose to test with as many or as few others as desired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This Interop-a-thon will focus on testing <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm V2</a> features. The goal is to facilitate scenarios such as sending a message from one app to another, with the receiving app decrypting and understanding the content. While different agents may have different functional focuses (e.g., mediators understanding forward messages but not needing to send them), participation helps ensure comprehensive compatibility across various implementations.</p> Preparation and Resources <p>To make the most of your experience at the Interop-a-thon, we encourage participants to prepare in advance by using the reference implementation for preliminary testing. The <a href="https://demo.didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation#!/Bob">DIDComm Demo</a> supports all core features relevant to the event, with the exception of Out of Band messages. For those needing to create out-of-band invitations, a helpful webpage can be found <a href="https://colton.wolkins.net/tools/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a> to generate invitation URLs and QR codes for testing purposes.</p><p>If you have any questions or need assistance before the event, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-usergroup/blob/main/schedule.md?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm User’s Group</a> is an excellent resource, offering support and guidance as you get ready for a successful event.</p> Volunteer Opportunities &nbsp; <p>We’re looking for room facilitators to help coordinate and ensure smooth sessions. If you’re interested, please sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11hsfq1KTj2TBxFItPGiIW0uHTBR69mDAxMFNWXiplXk/edit?ref=blog.identity.foundation">here</a>.</p> How to Join&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Complete <a href="https://forms.gle/dF6P4NYzuUXUpUAq6?ref=blog.identity.foundation">this form</a> and submit it by close of business on December 9, 2024, to confirm your participation.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you’re developing, deploying, or experimenting with DIDComm, this event is an invaluable opportunity to engage with peers and push the boundaries of decentralized communication.</p><p>Let’s advance interoperability, together!</p>

 Some things we’ve talked about in our cooperative <p>I thought it might be a good idea to try to describe the Tao, or the natural way, of&nbsp;WAO.</p><blockquote>“In the Tao Te Ching, Laozi explains that the Tao is not a name for a thing, but the underlying natural order of the universe whose ultimate essence is difficult to circumscribe because it is non-conceptual yet evident in one’s being of aliveness.” (Wikipedia)</blockquote><p>Doug and I, both founding members of <a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a>, have a podcast we called the <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/expertise/podcast/">Tao of WAO</a>. The podcast is “A podcast about the intersection of technology, society, and internet culture — with a dash of philosophy and art for good measure.” We’re on hiatus right now, but there are 9 seasons you can&nbsp;enjoy!</p><p>WAO is a collective of individuals who broadly agree on many things. Like any group of people, there are nuanced differences in our positions on the issues of the day, so instead of corporate pronouncements, we write things like this Tao or stuff we’ve written on <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/spirit-of-wao">our spirit wiki&nbsp;page</a>.</p><p>Using the taxonomy of our podcast tagline, I’ve developed 15 short statements that summarise some of our&nbsp;beliefs:</p> Technology in the Tao of&nbsp;WAO cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO Open source is preferred, practicality is required. <p>We advise our clients and friends on all kinds of technical matters. We have varying beliefs on when to use what kinds of platforms and this statement sums up our approach. We try to find Open Source solutions, but we know that there are a variety of factors — like staff technical skills, developer resources or feature requirements — that need to be taken into account. Sometimes the practical recommendation is the right&nbsp;one.</p> Open standards lead to a better&nbsp;world. <p>We are proponents, however, of open source technology and we understand how important it is that our technical infrastructure remains open. There are open standards that underpin much of what we use on a regular basis. The World Wide Web is built on an open standard and so is e-mail. If we want a better world, we need interoperability and cohesion within the tech landscape.</p> The wild and open Internet is the platform. <p>It doesn’t make sense to use the same structures, policies and platforms for different people, communities and organisations. There is nuance in every project, so we don’t limit ourselves by recommending the same tools all the time. Instead, we are constantly learning new ways to use the Internet to solve real-world problems. We start with the communities involved, then we figure out how to use the Internet to solve the problems the people within those communities are trying to&nbsp;solve.</p> Society cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO Worker owned cooperatives work. <p>We’re pretty invested in the idea of cooperation. It’s worth noting that cooperatives are not a small ‘subculture’ of the business world. The world’s top 300 cooperative businesses have a turnover of over <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/facts-and-figures">two trillion dollars</a> a year. <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/media/news/co-ops-employ-10-global-employed-population">10% of all jobs</a> on the planet are co-op jobs. This economic system is hiding in plain sight and the powers that be don’t want us to know that there is a different way.</p> Participation matters, so model the behaviours. <p>Cynics would say that in the grand scheme of things it doesn’t matter what a single person does. We would make a quip about a mosquito having big impact or steal a quote from Margaret Mead (“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.”) We all have influence and impact on other people, so model the behaviours you want to see in the world and know that your participation matters.</p> Communities move mountains. <p>We could steal that Margaret Mead quote a second time, actually. Or, we can simply underline our belief that it is the collective, made up of individuals, that makes the world a better place. There is a more prevalent narrative embedded in (especially) western societies, and it’s one we need to actively disagree with. When we form communities, big or small, we can create more opportunities for everyone.</p> Internet Culture cc-by-nd Bryan&nbsp;Mathers Digital literacies live on a never-ending continuum. <p><a href="https://dougbelshaw.com">Dr Belshaw</a> wrote his doctoral thesis on the <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/essential-elements-book.pdf">8 Essential Elements of Digital Literacies</a>. In it, he writes about ambiguity, defining terms, problems with binary concepts and so, so much more. We at the co-op are keen to help others understand that there is no such thing as being “literate”, digitally or otherwise. Instead, we appreciate acceptance and enthusiasm around the idea that humans are always learning and there is always more to&nbsp;learn.</p> Structured participation leads to more participants. <p>Structure helps people find their way into a group. We live in a world of diversity, and yet we tend to hear only the loudest voices. Finding intentional ways to invite participation from more diverse groups of people helps build healthy communities.</p> Experiment and fail often and&nbsp;loudly. <p>We are a group of people that likes to try new things. We try to encourage one another to do so, both personally and professionally. We try to be reflective and vocal about our failures, since failing is such a great way to&nbsp;learn.</p> Philosophy cc-by-nd <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;WAO Learning happens everywhere. <p>Our brains are constantly changing their very structures. Every day new inputs and impulses work to change the neural pathways that run our whole bodies. We are always learning, even if we’re not trying to. This learning happens at work, in classrooms, at the neighbour’s house, and all forms of learning deserve to be recognised.</p> Consent-based governance is empowering. <p>At the co-op we solve prickly problems with a sociocratic approach to decision making. We discuss a proposal and rework it until all members can consent to a decision being made. Governing our cooperative this way means that every member has an invitation to unpick how they’re feeling about something so that everyone can be comfortable in our collective efforts.</p> We bring our full selves to&nbsp;work. <p>We have, together, taken courses on conflict resolution and alternative governance structures so that we can bring our full selves to work. We talk to each other about things that are going on inside our minds and do our best to figure out the difference between a perception and an intention. We are human, it’s ok to feel, talking about that helps us work better together.</p> Art Bad Poetry for the Keep Badges Weird community (now called Open Recognition is for Everybody) Remix is a compliment. <p>We’re big believers in open licensing, partially because we love to expand and remix ideas, graphics and artwork. Open licensing gives us, as creative folks, the ability to make a thing and credit where the original idea came from. Because Doug published his AI generated photographs “Time’s Solitary Dance” under an open license, I could take them and write a kind of story to them without asking. <a href="https://www.laurahilliger.com/writing/times-solitary-dance/">It became a collaborative art&nbsp;piece</a>.</p> Bad poetry is just poetry that is bad, and that’s&nbsp;ok. <p>Bad poetry written by humans is ok, bad poetry written by AI is just bad. We’re honest enough with ourselves to admit when something we’ve done is kind of terrible, like these last few entries into the Tao of&nbsp;WAO.</p> The Tao of WAO isn’t a thing, it is ephemeral. <p>If you ask us in a year what we think of this post, we’ll probably say “Heh? What Tao of WAO post, that’s a podcast!” Then you’ll bring this up and it will have my name on it and I’ll feel embarrassed. Looking forward to&nbsp;it!</p> What’s your&nbsp;Tao? <p>Need help figuring it out? We need more weird and wonderful projects, so <a href="https://weareopen.coop">get in&nbsp;touch</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-tao-of-wao-55ffe5f80395">The Tao of WAO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It’s been a couple of years since Apple, Google, and Microsoft started trying to kill the password, and its demise seems more likely than ever.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance, the industry group spearheading the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkey</a> push, is putting out some much-needed guidelines to make passkeys usage feel more consistent from one site to the next, and the big tech platforms are getting better at letting you store passkeys in your preferred password manager. Work is also underway on a protocol to let people securely switch between password managers and take all their passkeys with them.</p>



<p>All this is contributing to an air of inevitability for passkeys, especially as major e-commerce players such as Amazon and Shopify get on board. Even if you’re not fully attuned to the passkey movement, you’ll soon have to go out of your way to avoid it.</p>



<p>“Within the next three to five years, virtually every major service will offer consumers a passwordless option,” says Andrew Shikiar, the FIDO Alliance’s CEO and executive director.</p>

 <a href="https://events.iu.edu/ostromworkshop/event/1624058-ostrom-workshop-hls-beyond-the-web-shwetha-rao"></a><p>This is important. Be there.</p> 
<p>If we want <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_relationship_management">VRM</a> to prove out globally, we have to start locally. That’s what’s happening right now in India, using <a href="https://www.ondc.org/">ONDC (the Open Network for Digital Commerce)</a>, which runs on the <a href="https://dev.to/kaustubhyerkade/beckn-protocol-6bd">Beckn protocol</a>.</p>
<p>ONDC is a <a href="https://opendata.ondc.org/">happening thing</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://opendata.ondc.org/"></a></p>
<p>One big (and essential) goal for VRM is <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2015/02/15/a-master-app-to-give-customers-scale/">individual customer scale across many vendors</a>.&nbsp; ONDC and Beckn are for exactly that. Here is how <a href="https://dev.to/kaustubhyerkade">kaustubh yerkade</a> explains it in <a href="https://dev.to/kaustubhyerkade/beckn-protocol-6bd">Understanding Beckn Protocol: Revolutionizing Open Networks in E-commerce</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Beckn protocol in the Real World<br>
The Beckn Protocol is part of a larger movement toward creating open digital ecosystems, particularly in India. For example, the ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) initiative in India is built using the Beckn protocol, aiming to democratize e-commerce and bring small retailers into the digital economy.&nbsp;The Indian government supports ONDC for making digital commerce more accessible and competitive.</p>
<p>Here are some practical examples of how the Beckn Protocol can be used in different industries:</p>
<p>1. Ride-Hailing and Mobility Services<br>
Example: Imagine a city with multiple ride-hailing services (e.g., Uber, Ola, Rapido). Instead of using individual apps for each service, a user can use one app powered by the Beckn Protocol. This app aggregates all available ride-hailing services, showing nearby cars, prices, and estimated arrival times from multiple providers. The user can choose the best option, book the ride, and pay directly through the unified app.</p>
<p>Benefit: Service providers gain broader visibility, and users can easily compare services in one place without switching between apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://becknprotocol.io/imagining-mobility-with-beckn/">https://becknprotocol.io/imagining-mobility-with-beckn/</a></p>
<p>2. Food Delivery Services<br>
Example: A consumer uses a food delivery app that leverages Beckn to show restaurants from multiple food delivery services (like Zomato, Swiggy, and local food delivery providers). Instead of sticking to just one platform, the user sees menus from different services and can order based on price, availability, or delivery time.</p>
<p>Benefit: Restaurants get listed on more platforms, increasing their exposure, and users can find more options without hopping between different apps.</p>
<p>3. E-Commerce and Local Retail<br>
Example: A shopper is looking for a product (like a phone charger) and uses an app built on the Beckn Protocol. The app aggregates inventory from big e-commerce players (like Amazon or Flipkart) as well as small local retailers. The user can compare prices and delivery times from both big platforms and nearby local stores, then make a purchase from the most convenient provider.</p>
<p>Benefit: Small businesses and local stores can compete with larger e-commerce platforms and reach a wider audience without needing their own app or website.</p>
<p>4. Healthcare Services<br>
Example: A patient needs to book a doctor’s appointment but doesn’t want to manually search through different healthcare platforms. A healthcare app using Beckn shows available doctors and clinics across multiple platforms (like Practo, 1mg, or even independent clinics). The patient can choose a doctor based on location, specialization, and availability, all in one place.</p>
<p>Benefit: Patients get access to a larger pool of healthcare providers, and doctors can offer their services on multiple platforms through a single integration.</p>
<p>5. Logistics and Courier Services<br>
Example: An online seller wants to ship products to customers but doesn’t want to manage multiple courier services. With an app built on Beckn, they can see delivery options from multiple logistics providers (like FedEx, Blue Dart, and local couriers) and choose the best one based on cost, speed, or reliability.</p>
<p>Benefit: Businesses can streamline shipping operations by comparing various logistics providers through one interface, optimizing for cost and delivery time.</p>
<p>6. Public Transportation<br>
Example: A commuter is planning a trip using public transit in a city. Using a Beckn-powered app, they can view transportation options from multiple transit services (like metro, bus, bike-sharing services, or even ride-hailing). The app provides real-time schedules, available options, and payment methods across different transport networks.</p>
<p>Benefit: The commuter has a unified experience with multiple transportation modes, improving convenience and access to more options.</p>
<p>7. Local Services (Home Services, Repair, Cleaning)<br>
Example: A user needs a home repair service (e.g., a plumber or electrician). Instead of browsing different service provider platforms (like UrbanClap or Housejoy), a Beckn-enabled app aggregates professionals from multiple service providers. The user can compare prices, reviews, and availability and book a service directly from the app.</p>
<p>Benefit: Service providers get access to more customers, and consumers can quickly find professionals based on location, reviews, and price.</p>
<p>8. Travel and Hospitality<br>
Example: A traveler uses a travel booking app based on Beckn to find accommodations. The app aggregates listings from various hotel chains, Airbnb, and local guesthouses. The traveler can filter by price, location, and amenities, then book the best option without switching between platforms.</p>
<p>Benefit: Smaller accommodation providers can compete with big brands, and travelers get access to more choices across different platforms in one app.</p>
<p>9. Government Services and Civic Engagement<br>
Example: A citizen uses a Beckn-enabled app to access multiple government services. They can apply for a driver’s license, pay taxes, and book a health checkup at a government hospital—all from one platform that integrates services from different government departments and third-party providers.</p>
<p>Benefit: Governments can offer a unified experience across various services, and citizens get easier access to public services without visiting multiple websites or offices.</p></blockquote>
<p>He adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>The ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) initiative in India is built using the Beckn protocol, aiming to democratize e-commerce and bring small retailers into the digital economy. The Indian government supports ONDC for making digital commerce more accessible and competitive.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is nice to have government support, anyone anywhere can deploy open and decentralized tech, or integrate it into their apps and services.</p>
<p>On Tuesday we’ll have a chance to talk about all this at <a href="https://events.iu.edu/ostromworkshop/event/1624058-ostrom-workshop-hls-beyond-the-web-shwetha-rao">our latest salon</a> at Indiana University and live on Zoom. Our speaker, <a href="https://shwetharao.tech/">Shwetha Rao</a>, will be here in person, which always makes for a good event—even for those zooming in.</p>

<p>Experts discovered the top 10 overused passwords in the US that could put you at risk of being easily hacked.</p>



<p>NordPass and NordSteller recently released its sixth annual&nbsp;<a href="https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/">analysis of personal password habits</a>.</p>



<p>Based on NordPass and NordStellar’s data they crunched, ‘secret’ was the most common password in the US.</p>



<p>The management platforms found that the password was used 328,831 times, and it would take less than one second for someone to crack it.</p>



<p>‘Secret’ is also ranked in the top 10 most common passwords in the world.</p>



<p>Andrew Shikiar, executive director of FIDO Alliance, mentioned hackers could guess the password if it’s even spelled using numbers or with other substitutions while speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/26/everything-you-know-about-passwords-could-be-wrong.html">CNBC</a>.</p>



<p>‘For example, they might believe that “secret” is a weak password but “s3cr3t” will be hard to guess,’ Shikiar said in 2019.&nbsp;</p>

 The <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) is committed to a world in which everyone can assert their identity wherever they choose. We do this by defining identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy-preserving. 
 OIDF’s <a href="https://openid.net/wg/">Working Groups</a>, through which much of this work is delivered, are underpinned by trust. They provide a safe space for competing organizations to come together and agree on common rules and practices that will solve mutual challenges.&nbsp; 
 The outcomes of these groups are <a href="https://openid.net/developers/specs/">OIDF Standards</a> – a culmination of the valuable feedback of all the OIDF members in those groups – which go on to become trusted by millions of organizations across the globe.&nbsp; 
 All the organizations and individual contributors involved in OIDF’s Working Groups are respected thought leaders in their fields and OIDF is proud to be able to bring together their valuable contributions. 
 
 Introducing IPSIE 
<p>Last month, seven members of the OpenID Foundation proposed the IPSIE Working Group under a new proposal and charter to the OpenID Foundation Specifications Committee. That proposal was then supported by the Specifications Council, which means that the new IPSIE Work Group would address a new and relevant area of specification development aligned to the OpenID Foundation’s Mission and Vision.</p>
<p>There are many specifications underlying the Identity and Access Management (IAM) functions in enterprise operations. Achieving interoperability between them and optimizing for security is the challenge at the heart of the IPSIE Working Group charter.</p>
<p>The IPSIE Working Group will develop secure-by-design profiles of these existing specifications with a primary goal of achieving interoperability and security-by-design by minimizing optionality in multiple specifications that are used in enterprise implementations.</p>
 Key clarifications:&nbsp; 
 
 No one entity or member can create an OpenID Foundation Working Group on their own. A minimum of five active members in the OpenID Foundation are required to propose a new Working Group. In the case of the IPSIE Work Group, there were seven proposers, thus conforming to the usual due process.&nbsp; 
 No single entity or individual controls the substance of the work conducted within a Working Group. The IPSIE Working Group is a collaboration hosted by the OIDF and made up of many member organizations and individuals, including leading global tech firms and startups, who have committed to working together to address this key industry challenge.&nbsp; 
 The IPSIE Working Group is in its early days, so there is no new security standard yet. This is work in progress and any proposed standards will follow a rigorous process of community contributions, community feedback, and refining as per the OpenID Foundation Process document.&nbsp; 
 Since there are no IPSIE Specifications yet, there are no products or services on the market that are based on IPSIE specifications or that can be considered conformant to an IPSIE specification.&nbsp; 
 Proposers are not Contributors or Adopters. Proposers agree to a problem statement and express willingness to collaborate. At the stage of proposing a WG and until Contribution Agreements are signed, no intellectual property has been contributed to the WG. 
 Consensus is a core value of how the OpenID Foundation conducts the development of standards, and the OpenID Foundation follows the World Trade Organization guidelines for standards bodies. No single entity or individual can make a decision for the group. 
 
<p>These distinctions are important. The work of Standards organizations, like the OIDF, the IETF, the W3C, ISO, and others, are all underpinned by trust. Standards organizations provide safe spaces for government, individuals, and private entities – many of whom often compete – to agree upon common rules and practices. This ensures a level playing field and protects businesses and consumers by promoting security and portability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the inquiry into the misunderstanding, the OpenID Foundation Board did recognize that we lack a clear policy on how OpenID Foundation members, contributors, and implementers should refer to OIDF processes and work groups in media and marketing channels. We are working actively to close this policy gap to offer the OpenID Foundation community better clarity and avert future misunderstandings. As always, the Foundation values the trust the community places in OIDF processes and specifications and appreciates the lengths our community goes to sustain the trust that helps deliver on our Mission and Vision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Corporate Overview</p>



<p>Branch® is a cloud-native home and auto insurance company founded in 2020. Operating on a serverless architecture, Branch’s mission is to simplify the insurance purchasing experience for consumers and independent insurance agents.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“One of our key superpowers is making the insurance buying experience as easy as possible,” explained Arkadiy Goykhberg, Chief Information Security Officer at Branch.</p>
</blockquote>



 Branch Authentication Challenges  



<p>Due to the sensitive nature of their market and the variety of stakeholders they served, Branch faced multiple authentication challenges:</p>



 
 Legacy two-factor authentication. Branch has been relying on SMS-based two-factor authentication, which has multiple issues. Telco issues would prevent users from logging in. It’s also not phishing resistant and subject to risk associated with SIM swapping attacks. 



 Customer support volume. There was a high volume of support tickets related to password resets and login issues. 



 User-friendly approach. Branch needed a more secure and user-friendly authentication process to serve their 12,000+ independent insurance agents. 



 Compliance. Another core challenge was the need to meet strict compliance requirements in the highly regulated insurance industry. 
 



 How Passkeys Addressed Branch’s Challenges 



<p>Branch identified passkeys as the solution to their authentication problems for several reasons.</p>



<p>Enhanced Security: Passkeys are inherently phishing-resistant, addressing the vulnerabilities associated with SMS-based authentication.</p>



<p>Improved User Experience: Passkeys eliminate the need for passwords, reducing friction during login and preventing issues related to forgotten passwords or typing errors.</p>



<p>Reduced Support Burden: By implementing passkeys, Branch saw a significant reduction in support tickets. John MaGee, Software Product Manager at Branch, noted, “We did see our support ticket volume drop by about half, which was the key business goal, outside of some of the user experience and security goals of the project.”</p>



<p>Regulatory Compliance: Passkeys provided a strong foundation for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in the insurance industry.</p>



<p>Compatibility with Existing Infrastructure: Passkeys integrated well with Branch’s cloud-native architecture, allowing for a smoother implementation process.</p>



 Implementation process and results 



 Branch adopted a phased approach to implementing passkeys. 



<p>The first phase involved internal testing. Branch first implemented passkeys for internal use, which helped build confidence and user acceptance. Branch then went through a vendor selection and development phase, contracting with Descope. Branch decided that it was a more efficient approach to engage with a service provider to help with passkey implementation.</p>



<p>The project roadmap included a two month vendor selection process, followed by a three-month development phase and a six-week end-user migration phase.</p>



<p>The final step was a phased user migration. Branch rolled out passkeys to its agents in waves, starting with a small group and gradually scaling up. The onboarding process involved multiple communication campaigns to prepare users for the new authentication experience. The user journey included prompting users to set up passkeys and providing a fallback option of email and OTP. The goal was to ensure a seamless transition and reduce support ticket volume by eliminating password resets. This approach allowed the company to refine the process based on feedback and minimize risks.</p>



<p>The results of the passkey implementation were impressive:</p>



 
 25% passkey adoption rate across the organization, exceeding internal goals. 



 50% reduction in support ticket volume related to authentication issues. 



 Maintained steady login failure rates at 5%, despite the transition. 



 Improved user experience, with fewer frustrations related to authentication. 
 



<p>One surprising benefit was the high compatibility of passkeys with existing hardware and software. Goykhberg said that he had initially expected that only approximately 60% of systems would support passkeys.</p>



<p>“That hypothesis was wrong. To my surprise, only a few devices across thousands of logins could not support passkeys,” he said.</p>



 Branch’s passkey success and future roadmap 



<p>Branch’s successful implementation of passkeys has not only addressed their current authentication challenges but also laid the groundwork for future improvements and expansions.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Goykhberg said:<br>“Descope’s flexible workflow made implementing passkeys and taking care of edge cases relatively straightforward. With conditional steps, we routed users to passkeys when their hardware or software were compatible, and routed them to fallback MFA options when passkeys couldn’t be supported. Visualizing the user journey as a workflow helps us audit and modify the registration<br>and authentication journey without making significant code changes, which sets us up well for the future.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company’s successful phased rollout approach, starting with internal adoption and then gradually expanding to their agent base, highlights the importance of incremental implementation and learning. This strategy will continue to inform their future authentication initiatives. Building on the initial success of 25% passkey adoption, Branch aims to increase this number through targeted experimentation and user education.</p>



<p>Branch’s successful implementation of passkeys demonstrates how this modern authentication method can significantly improve both security and user experience in the insurance industry. By addressing the vulnerabilities of traditional authentication methods,<br>reducing support burden and providing a seamless user experience, passkeys have proven to be a valuable solution for Branch’s authentication needs.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that many online services are now offering the option of using <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, a digital authentication method touted as an easier and more secure way to log in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some 20% of the world’s top 100 websites now accept passkeys, said Andrew Shikiar, CEO of the FIDO Alliance, an industry group that developed the core authentication technology behind passkeys.</p>



<p>Passkeys first came to the public’s attention when Apple added the technology to iOS in 2022. They got more traction after&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-passkeys-replace-passwords-b2f2fb640ae5e92a933cba66ed63e29b">Google started</a>&nbsp;using them in 2023. Now, many other companies including PayPal, Amazon, Microsoft and eBay work with passkeys. There’s a&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys-directory/">list</a>&nbsp;on the FIDO Alliance website.</p>



<p>Still, some popular sites like Facebook and Netflix haven’t started using them yet.</p>



<p>Passkey technology is still in the “early adoption” phase but “it’s just a matter of time for more and more sites to start offering this,” Shikiar said.</p>

<p>Progressive Trust—it sounds a bit like something from a relationship advice column, right? But in the world of digital interactions, it’s actually a revolutionary model, one that moves us away from “all-or-nothing” choices into a more human, flexible way of establishing trust. Progressive Trust is about mirroring the natural ways we build trust in real life, adding depth and resilience to our digital interactions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The basic idea behind progressive trust is to model how trust works in the real world”<br>
—Christopher Allen, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-progressive-trust/">Musings of a Trust Architect: Progressive Trust</a> (December 2022)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In real life, trust doesn’t happen at the click of a button. It’s a process. You don’t start a friendship, a business deal, or a marriage with complete openness or blind trust. Instead, <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-data-minimization/">what you reveal is initially minimized</a>, and then trust builds up gradually. As we share experiences, we reveal more, bit by bit, learning through consistent responses from the other person. When it comes to digital relationships, whether they’re between people, devices, or other entities, why should things be any different?</p>

 Why Progressive Trust Matters Today 

<p>The internet didn’t start off so polarized. Back in the early days, you could slowly get to know people online, like on message boards or MUDs, where interaction was incremental and organic. But as commercialization took over, new online communities popped up with restricted, binary models of trust. Tech giants started telling us who to trust based on certificates or institutional endorsements, pushing people into a “trust or don’t trust” mindset. But this one-size-fits-all approach isn’t just impersonal. It’s risky. Without the gray area, we’re left with blind trust or total skepticism, with few options inbetween.</p>

<p>Enter Progressive Trust, which seeks to change that by returning choice to the user, letting individuals decide whom to trust and how much of themselves to reveal over time. It’s an effective way to enhance security and protect user agency, fitting seamlessly into decentralized systems like blockchain, where openness and security go hand in hand. Progressive Trust takes the online world back to a more natural process of gradual trust-building, transforming digital trust from a binary affair into something more organic.</p>

 The Progressive Trust Life Cycle 

<p>Let’s break down the Progressive Trust Life Cycle into its key phases, each step building on the last and adding layers of trust over time. Think of it as a journey from cautious introduction to informed engagement, with each phase providing the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient trust model. These are the steps of progressive trust that are simultaneously automatic in the real world and often ignored in the digital world.</p>

 0. Context – Interaction Considered 
<p>The foundation of Progressive Trust begins with understanding the Context of an interaction. This  sets the stage by establishing the purpose and parameters of the interaction, helping each party assess risk and feasibility. Before any data is exchanged or any commitments are made, each party considers the interaction’s purpose, its goals, its potential benefits, and the risks involved. They also examine the setting in which the interaction takes place, ensuring that they understand the overall environment and any particular conditions that might impact their decision.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: A homeowner, Hank, evaluates hiring a contractor for a kitchen remodel. He considers the financial costs, the importance of quality work, and the potential risks of inviting someone into his home for an extended period. The stakes of the scenario are sufficient to prompt Hank to engage in a Progressive Trust model, as opposed to a quick, one-off transaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This initial phase helps each side assess whether the potential stakes, such as financial or reputational risk, warrant a full, Progressive Trust approach or if simpler, lower-risk models could suffice.</p>

 1. Introduction – Assertions Declared 
<p>With the interaction context defined, both parties proceed with Introduction, where they each make initial declarations and claims. By sharing basic information, the parties set the groundwork for further scrutiny, while keeping sensitive details private or hidden (for now).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank meets Carla, the cabinet maker, at a social gathering and discusses his interest in remodeling his kitchen. Carla offers her business card and highlights her experience, expressing interest in working with him. This initial interaction is informal yet purposeful, establishing the first connection and introducing each party’s intentions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase is an essential starting point for trust-building, as it allows each party to signal their intentions clearly and publicly, establishing a mutual understanding of what they aim to accomplish.
It does not involve extensive trust verification but instead creates a framework of transparency and expectation between the participants.</p>

 2. Wholeness – Integrity Assessed 
<p>Once an introduction has been established, both parties assess the Wholeness of the information shared. This phase involves evaluating the structural integrity of the data, ensuring that all critical pieces are complete and correctly formatted. Think of this as a quality check: verifying that foundational information is present, well-formed, and free from any immediate signs of corruption or tampering.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank checks Carla’s business card, noting that it includes her contractor license number and contact details. Carla, meanwhile, considers whether Hank’s job aligns with her skillset. Both use this phase to make sure the information they have about each other is coherent and free of red flags.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase creates the foundation for deeper verification by ensuring that each party’s data contributions are reliable at a surface level. Without verifying structural integrity, any future steps could rest on flawed or incomplete data, leading to potential misunderstandings or risks.</p>

 3. Proofs – Secrets Verified 
<p>With data integrity confirmed, the next step is Proofs, where parties delve into verifying the sources of the data. It’s a deeper level of validation, establishing the authenticity of the sources for each party’s assertions. That validation leverages modern technology such as digital signatures where possible, to minimize the risk of misrepresentation or fraud.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank calls a few of Carla’s previous clients, confirming that they exist, and the testimonials given to him are real. Similarly, Carla may ask for proof of Hank’s readiness to pay by confirming his budget or financial standing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase confirms that both parties’ assertions are backed by a proof, to establish a more secure foundation for the interaction.</p>

 4. References – Trust Aggregated 
<p>Building on the established proofs, the References phase broadens trust by gathering endorsements, certificates, or additional validation from external sources. This step goes beyond just authenticating the source of any assertions. It’s about gathering the good word from others, including testimonials, reviews, licenses, or certificates. Cryptographic methods may also be used to assure the validity of the references. Parties don’t necessarily gather every reference: they collect until they feel they have enough corroborating information to proceed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank checks Carla’s contractor license in a state registry and reads online reviews. Carla, in turn, verifies Hank’s reputation or credibility within her professional network, gaining confidence that his project is legitimate and that he can be trusted to honor financial commitments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase provides a composite view of the other party’s trustworthiness based on diverse sources, making trust more holistic. It creates a comprehensive picture without oversimplifying the credibility of each party into a binary “yes” or “no.”</p>

 5. Requirements – Community Compliance 
<p>After personal and third-party validation, the parties consider whether the interaction meets broader Community Standards and Requirements. Here, each party assesses if the interaction complies with external guidelines, legal standards, or industry norms, which may vary by context. Compliance might involve revealing additional data, following guidelines for quality or safety, or meeting regulatory requirements, which helps each party feel confident that their involvement is appropriate and sanctioned.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank ensures that Carla’s contractor license and project quote meet legal requirements and industry standards, such as fair pricing and warranty expectations. Carla might consult her network or a local building authority to verify that Hank’s project is feasible and professionally compliant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase adds another layer of credibility through its confirmation that the interaction aligns with expected practices and requirements.</p>

 6. Approval – Risk Calculated 
<p>With community compliance confirmed, each party calculates the risk of proceeding and provides a tentative Approval. This step involves a personal assessment, comparing the accumulated trust to any potential risks or liabilities. It’s a decision point where each party considers their own risk model and goals, assessing whether the interaction is likely to fulfill their needs without exposing them to undue harm. Approval may involve internal checks or may require formal documentation of agreed-upon terms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Hank and Carla both review the project’s terms and risk factors, ensuring they feel comfortable with potential liabilities. When ready, they formalize their commitment by signing a contract, each confident that the project aligns with their risk model and is mutually beneficial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase emphasizes that trust isn’t an all-or-nothing concept. It exists on a spectrum, and each party must decide if their level of trust is sufficient to continue.</p>

 7. Agreement – Threshold Endorsed (Optional) 
<p>In situations of higher stakes or complexity, the Agreement phase may require additional endorsements before proceeding. An Agreement phase is optional but valuable when external input can add layers of confidence, often through the endorsement of peers, family members, or other trusted figures. Threshold endorsements are vital in larger or more sensitive projects, ensuring that all necessary parties or authorities approve before moving forward.</p>

<p>Example: Hank might discuss the project with his family for added assurance, while Carla secures necessary permits from the city. Both parties use these endorsements to reinforce</p>

<p>This phase provides an extra level of validation, helping each party feel more secure in their decision to proceed.</p>

 8. Fulfillment – Interaction Finalized 
<p>Fulfillment is the phase where each party finally executes their commitments, bringing the project to life based on the trust established through previous steps. Fulfillment requires each party to act according to the rules they’ve set, adhering to any terms, standards, or expectations agreed upon earlier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: Carla completes the kitchen remodel, delivering quality work as per the contract. Hank, in turn, fulfills his financial commitment by making the payment. The project reaches its conclusion, satisfying both parties’ expectations based on their prior trust-building efforts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase represents the culmination of the trust-building process, where both sides honor their agreements and responsibilities. It’s a phase of action rather than evaluation, marking a key transition from planning to execution, after which the interaction is officially complete.</p>

 9. Escalation – Independently Inspected (Optional) 
<p>In high-stakes or sensitive interactions, the Escalation phase optionally introduces an independent, third-party inspection. This step allows an impartial reviewer to verify that each party’s work or commitments were met, ensuring that the final product aligns with the agreed-upon standards. An inspector may re-evaluate certain phases, especially compliance and fulfillment, confirming that all requirements were followed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: A city inspector reviews Carla’s remodel to ensure it complies with local building codes, giving Hank and Carla final confirmation that the project meets regulatory standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase helps protect each party, providing an additional level of assurance when risk is high or when the interaction has lasting implications.</p>

 10. Dispute – Independently Arbitrated (Optional) 
<p>If issues arise, the final, optional phase of Dispute involves resolving conflicts through independent arbitration. In cases where fulfillment does not meet expectations, each party may bring forth additional data or reveal previously concealed information to support their case. An arbitrator then assesses the evidence, reviewing both parties’ original commitments, agreements, and standards, to determine a fair resolution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: If a cabinet installed by Carla collapses, Hank may initiate a dispute to assess liability. An independent arbitrator reviews the contract, Carla’s compliance with installation standards, and any relevant inspection reports, ultimately deciding if Carla is responsible for repairs or damages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phase safeguards both parties, providing a structured way to resolve disagreements that may impact future interactions or reputations.</p>

 The Progressive Trust Life Cycle 

<p></p>

<p>Interactions are actually mirrored by both parties, but this diagram simplifies things in most places by focusing on party two.</p>

 Beyond Binary Trust: How Progressive Trust Can Transform the Internet 

<p>Progressive Trust offers a way to return agency to individuals in a world increasingly dominated by centralized systems. Instead of clicking “OK” on trust agreements handed down by big corporations, users regain control over who they trust and to what degree, over time. Imagine a digital ecosystem where browsers, websites, or social media platforms gradually allowed users to choose what information they revealed and what they kept private, based on their own evolving trust models.</p>

 From Gradients to Greatness 

<p>The vision for Progressive Trust goes beyond making interactions safer; it’s about bringing digital trust closer to real-world norms. With Progressive Trust, we’re not just building secure systems—we’re creating environments where people can interact meaningfully and sustainably, with digital relationships that grow stronger over time, just like in real life. Whether it’s in journalism, finance, wellness, or personal data sharing, the possibilities are endless when trust is no longer binary.</p>

<p>Progressive Trust is hard, but it’s worth it. It’s a mature model, one that can elevate our digital interactions by letting trust grow naturally. We’ve evolved this process over thousands of years in the physical world; now it’s time to bring the same wisdom to the online world. By embracing Progressive Trust, we’re not just keeping data safe; we’re building a digital space where people can authentically connect and collaborate, one step at a time.</p>

<p>Corporate Overview<br><br>JCOM Co., Ltd. (J:COM) provides a wide range of services to 5.72 million households nationwide, including cable TV (specialty channels, BS, terrestrial digital), high-speed internet connection, smartphones, fixed-line phones, electricity, video entertainment, and home IoT.<br><br>Under the brand message “Making the new normal,” J:COM actively incorporates digital technology to offer new services that make customers’ lives more comfortable and enriched.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>To ensure the safe and comfortable use of the various services provided by J:COM, customers need to register a J:COM Personal ID (phone number or email address), which is linked to multiple services and apps offered by the company. Since August 2019, J:COM has been considering a new J:COM Personal ID, aiming to follow the latest security measures while continuously and swiftly pursuing the convenience of easy ID registration and login, which are often contradictory goals.</p>



 Deployment of FIDO2 



<p>Previously, in addition to ID/password authentication, J:COM adopted multi-factor authentication by sending one-time passwords to phone numbers.</p>



<p>However, aiming for further convenience, J:COM decided to introduce passwordless authentication using biometric authentication available on customers’ everyday devices (smartphones, tablets).</p>



<p>For the implementation, J:COM used the FIDO-compliant authentication platform “Uni-ID Libra” provided by NRI Secure Technologies, Ltd. (NRI Secure).</p>



<p>Initially, there were challenges in guiding users through the initial setup of FIDO authentication due to differences in operation depending on the OS and browser specifications used by the users, such as fingerprint and facial recognition. However, these issues were resolved by improving screen displays and support site descriptions.</p>







 Effects of Implementation 



<p>As of August 29, 2024, the number of passkey (FIDO credentials) registrations has reached 16% of the total IDs, and the number of services that can use biometric authentication has reached 25. This implementation has not only improved convenience but also resulted in cost savings on SMS transmission fees, as the cost remained flat despite the increase in the number of users and authentications for the services provided by J:COM.</p>



 Passkey (FIDO credentials) registrations has reached 16% of the total IDs 



<p>Shiori Takagi from the Agile Development Department, IT Planning Promotion Division, Information Systems Department of JCOM Co., Ltd., commented on this case study:</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“With the introduction of FIDO authentication, we believe we have made significant progress towards our goal of enabling customers to log in and use services more securely and easily. We believe that registration will expand further and service usage will be promoted in the future.”</p>
</blockquote>

Diane Mueller, Head of Open Source Development at Hedera, opened the meeting by providing context on Hiero’s journey and its recent contribution to the Linux Decentralized Trust Fund Foundation. Originally scheduled, Hendrik Ebbers, Chair of the Hiero Technical Steering Committee (TSC), was set to present, but he had to bow out due to illness. Stepping up on short notice was Richard Bair, Hashgraph’s Director of Engineering, another member of the TSC, showcasing the community’s ability to adjust seamlessly.</p>

This year, we signed the <a href="https://paris.openrecognition.org/">Paris Declaration on the Equality of Recognition</a>.</p><p>Many thanks to the organisers of the event, who manage to ensure that it runs smoothly every year and invite a wide range of people to participate within the ‘big tent’ that is Open Recognition!</p> Open Recognition vs Microcredentials CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual&nbsp;Thinkery</a><p>There has been a lot of muddy thinking in the badges and credentials world since Mozilla handed over stewardship of the Open Badges standard. One of the major issues, which we discussed in an impromptu ‘group therapy session’ at ePIC, is the paucity of microcredentials as a term of&nbsp;art.</p><p>Microcredentialing, as we shall discuss in an upcoming NDLN Horizon Report, is a supply-side reinvention of Open Badges. Unfortunately, it has at its core neither an agreed-upon definition, nor a technical standard. As such, ‘microcredential’ is what I would call an <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/on-the-strategic-uses-of-ambiguity-c403bff44029">unproductively ambiguous</a> term; it doesn’t mean or signify&nbsp;much.</p><p>The reason that Open Recognition is an increasingly attractive approach to badging is that it is holistic. It builds upon the original, revolutionary <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">Mozilla Open Badges white paper</a> by putting the individual at the centre and decentralising recognition practices. Not all Open Recognition needs to be badged, credentialed, or endorsed, but the important thing is that it can be — and by&nbsp;anyone.</p> WAO x&nbsp;ePIC <p>Last year, in Vienna, WAO was represented by Laura, Anne, and me. This year, I went by myself, despite the slide below with Laura’s name on&nbsp;it!</p><p>I ran a 45-minute workshop on using AI tools for identifying and mapping skills against various frameworks using a custom GPT that I called <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-69ioJrZ11-epic-skills-mapper">ePIC Skills Mapper</a>. I also showed the functionality in one particular badge platform on how AI can help generate badge metadata.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-keane-phd-2b27778/">Julie Keane</a> from <a href="https://participate.com">Participate</a> kindly helped me present in a 20-minute slot for sharing our findings from a recent project in which we were both involved.</p> Open Recognition is for Everybody (ORE) CC BY-NC <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual&nbsp;Thinkery</a><p>WAO would like to reinvigorate the <a href="https://badges.community/">ORE community</a> in 2025. While we’re currently still meeting on the last Tuesday of every month, we can do more in terms of spreading Open Recognition practices within the various communities and networks which we&nbsp;operate.</p><p>Why not join us on November 26th to reflect on ePIC and plan for next year?

 “Show me the incentives and I’ll show you the outcome.” <p>Authors: OriginTrail Core Developers</p><p>Date: November 8th&nbsp;2024</p><p>Since the inception of AI in the 1960s, two main approaches have emerged: neural network-based AI and symbolic AI. Neural networks are statistical systems that generate outputs by detecting patterns in training data, while symbolic AI employs deterministic models with explicit knowledge representations and logical connections. Today, transformers within the Large Language Model (LLM) group dominate neural networks, while knowledge graphs are the leading technology in symbolic AI for representing structured knowledge.</p><p>Used alone, each approach has limitations. Neural networks are probabilistic and can produce unwanted outputs (hallucinations), risk intellectual property issues, exhibit biases, and face model collapse with a growing amount of AI-generated (training) data online. Symbolic AI, meanwhile, is constrained by its rule-based reasoning, limiting creativity and user experience. Hybrid neuro-symbolic systems combine the strengths of both, leveraging neural networks’ usability and creativity while grounding them in knowledge graphs. This approach can enhance reliability, mitigate biases, ensure information provenance, and promote data ownership over IP&nbsp;risks.</p><p>OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), together with <a href="https://neuroweb.ai">NeuroWeb (the AI — tailored blockchain</a>) is surfacing as one of the key components of the symbolic AI branch, enhancing knowledge graph capabilities with the trust of blockchain technology, and powering, Collective Neuro-Symbolic AI.</p><p>This RFC addresses the following key development milestones to further enhance the Collective Neuro-Symbolic AI and will serve as a basis for one of the most extensive roadmap updates to&nbsp;date:</p>  DKG V8 Testnet results and learnings,  DKG Core and Edge Nodes Economics,  Collective Programmatic Treasury&nbsp;(CPT),  DKG V8 Mainnet launch in&nbsp;December  <p>After reading the following OT-RFC-21, you may leave your comment here: <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/47">https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/47</a></p> “Show me the incentives, and I’ll show you the outcome.” <p>The quote by Charlie Munger speaks to the importance of setting the right incentives in any system. As the DKG network matures in scalability and adoption, the incentives can become more refined in their implementations and more aligned with supporting the key metric — growth of usage of the DKG&nbsp;network.</p><p>There are multiple roles in the OriginTrail ecosystem that are incentivized with both TRAC and NEURO. TRAC is incentivizing Core node operators and TRAC delegators while NEURO incentivizes Neuroweb blockchain (Collator) node operators, NEURO delegators, and knowledge publishers (henceforth best represented by DKG EDGE node operators) for incentivized paranets.</p><p>The establishment of Collective Programmatic Treasury (detailed in a dedicated section below) will give the most active DKG paranets, by volume of new knowledge assets published to the DKG, an opportunity to take part in building the future of the technology.</p><p>The incentives updates and novelties will be released as a part of the DKG V8 mainnet&nbsp;release.</p> DKG V8 testnet results and learnings <p>In the first 5 weeks since the DKG V8 Testnet launch, the community has deployed over 500 V8 core nodes, which as part of the incentive program submitted over 3.7 terabytes and 13.7B lines of core node operational logs, and over 8 million Knowledge Assets published. These have proven very valuable inputs for the core developers who have introduced several optimizations to the DKG based on the submitted telemetry, including performance boosts on the new paranet syncing features, testing curated paranets, and other performance updates.</p>Chart of log lines submitted by V8 Core Nodes telemetry<p>The number of nodes on the V8 testnet highlights another key insight: even with a fixed reward budget of 100k TRAC, which was allocated to test the behavior of V8 Testnet Core Nodes, achieving an economically viable node count requires the full implementation of the DKG delegated staking feature. Delegated TRAC acts as a market mechanism to balance the node count according to the rewards available in the network at any time. This underscores the critical role TRAC delegators will play in maintaining stability and economic balance within the V8 DKG ecosystem.</p><p>As the initial phase of the V8 testnet wraps up, advancing V8 features and validating them requires an environment where all economic incentives are active to support the full deployment of the DKG V8. Key V8 components, such as the Edge Node and Core Node, will now continue to be deployed and optimized on the V6 mainnet, with the V8.0 mainnet launch set for December this year. This launch will initiate the Tuning Period, during which V8 will gain enhanced performance with features like Batch Minting, Random Sampling, and a new staking interface, all backed by real economic incentives.</p><p>In addition, synergistic effects between publishers (represented by DKG Edge Nodes, once the V8 network is deployed) and Core DKG Nodes will be fostered through horizontal scaling. This approach aims to refine network signaling, enabling an optimal network size by aligning the number of nodes more precisely with network&nbsp;demands.</p><p>The details in the following chapters of this RFC create a level playing field to prepare for updates on existing incentives on the DKG Core node and access to Collective Programmatic Treasury&nbsp;(CPT).</p> DKG Core and Edge Nodes Economics <p>The DKG V8 has been designed with major scalability improvements at multiple levels, with a prototyped implementation tested in collaboration with OriginTrail ecosystem partners from data-intensive sectors.</p><p>The major advancement that DKG V8 is making is in expanding the OriginTrail ecosystem’s product suite to two key products:</p>  DKG Core Node V8 — highly scalable network nodes forming the network core, persisting the public replicated DKG  DKG Edge Node V8 — user-friendly node applications tailored to edge devices (phones, laptops, cloud,&nbsp;etc)*  <p>*The expansion to more devices is intended to be based on ecosystem builders’ capacity and market&nbsp;needs.</p> Internet scale with DKG Edge&nbsp;nodes <p>Edge nodes enable the DKG to reach every part of the internet we know today — <a href="https://origintrail.io/blog/dkg-v8-scaling-verifiable-internet-for-ai-to-any-device-for-anyone-on-any-chain">any device, any user, any chain</a>. Being a light-weight version of the DKG node, Edge nodes can support both accessing the private and public knowledge on the DKG as well as publishing new knowledge.</p><p>Having this capability, DKG Edge node is a very useful&nbsp;tool:</p>  for paranet operators to enable knowledge miners to publish new knowledge onto their paranets;  for solution builders as a flexible interface for their neuro-symbolic AI products that can access both private and public parts of the&nbsp;DKG;  for DKG Edge node operators that want to start publishing to the DKG so they could transform their DKG Edge node into a DKG Core&nbsp;node.  <p>The continuation of V8 development focuses on teams looking to deploy their paranets &amp; Edge nodes on DKG Mainnet to generate substantial usage. Therefore, the DKG Edge Node Inception Program budget of 750k TRAC is dedicated to builders launching paranets on both the V6 and V8 mainnet, with up to 100k TRAC per builder available as reimbursement for TRAC used for publishing to a particular paranet.</p><p>More details on how you can apply for the DKG Edge Node Inception Program can be <a href="https://docs.origintrail.io/dkg-v8-upcoming-version/v8-dkg-edge-node/dkg-edge-node-inception-program">found&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Horizontal scaling with DKG Core&nbsp;nodes <p>The backbone of the DKG network in V8 is formed of DKG Core nodes, whose purpose is to ensure secure hosting of the public DKG and facilitate network communication in a decentralized fashion. DKG Core nodes are incentivized through competing for DKG publishing fees in TRAC tokens, which are distributed among the best performing nodes in the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The success of a Core node in capturing fees in DKG V6 is currently a function of 3 factors: (1) node uptime and availability, (2) total TRAC stake delegated to a node, and (3) network hash distance (enabling efficient knowledge content addressing). <br>Several learnings have been acquired in V6 through the period of the system running in production, most notably on how to improve scalability and further fine-tune the incentive system for DKG growth, by updating the relevant parameters in the tokenomics formula.</p><p>Particularly, the community of node operators has been indicating the hash distance factor as the most problematic one, causing randomization and impacting the system in an unpredictable and asymmetric way (the nodes with the same amount of stake and uptime could perform differently in terms of rewards due to a different hash ring network position).</p><p>On the other hand, the builders’ feedback is that the friction to contributing to the DKG needs to be significantly lower, specifically in terms of publishing price per knowledge asset (addressed with scalability) and accessibility to publishing through available nodes, expressing the need for an approach similar to blockchain RPC services, which allow sending transactions to the blockchain without running a blockchain node.</p><p>Therefore V8 introduces an updated Core node incentive system with the following factors:</p>  Node uptime &amp; availability, in positive correlation, as nodes need to prove their commitment of hosting the DKG by submitting proofs to the blockchain (through the new V8 random sampling proof&nbsp;system),  TRAC Stake security factor, in positive correlation — the more stake a node attracts, the higher the security guarantees and therefore the higher chance of rewards (same as in&nbsp;V6),  Publishing factor, in positive correlation — the more new knowledge has been published via a specific core node (measured in TRAC tokens), the higher the chance of&nbsp;rewards,  Node fee (formerly “ask”), in negative correlation — the nodes with lower fees are positively impacting the system scalability, and therefore have a higher chance of&nbsp;rewards.  <p>The illustrative incentive formula is therefore:</p><p>where the specific functions are to be validated on both the testnet (for technical functionality) and mainnet (for market functionality) during the V8 Tuning&nbsp;period.</p><p>This addition creates further alignment of Core nodes with the ecosystem growth as Core nodes that take up roles of driving adoption will become more successful. Importantly, it also creates an aligned horizontal scaling approach, since additional Core nodes in the DKG become required with growing adoption. This creates a positive self-reinforcing feedback loop: new adoption leads to new nodes, which leads to increased scale, which unlocks further adoption. We can imagine core nodes almost acting as a “solar panel” that allows publishers to capture TRAC fees from the network so they could use it for their publishing needs.</p> Network security via&nbsp;staking <p>TRAC delegators are using their TRAC to secure the DKG network by delegating it to selected Core nodes. In exchange for a delegation (and increasing the core node’s chance of capturing rewards), the node operator splits a part of the captured rewards with the delegators. When selecting the core node to support, the delegators take all the key elements of a successful Core node into account which will, from DKG V8 onwards, include the amount of knowledge added to the&nbsp;DKG.</p> NEW: Those who use it, will build it: 60MM TRAC Collective Programmatic Treasury&nbsp;(CPT) <p>To achieve that those who use the network have incentives to build it in the future, the future development fund will be deployed as a 60MM TRAC Collective Programmatic Treasury (CPT). The Collective Programmatic Treasury will be implemented with a programmatic release schedule emitting TRAC to eligible builders. The release schedule will follow the most famous example of emissions in the cryptocurrency space, that of the Bitcoin halving with minor alterations. The TRAC released from Collective Programmatic Treasury will be dedicated to (both conditions should be fulfilled) those&nbsp;who:</p>  use TRAC tokens for publishing knowledge (paranets spending the most TRAC for publishing knowledge), AND  have been confirmed eligible for incentives by the community (paranets who have completed successful IPOs and are deployed on NeuroWeb).   The schedule <p>As mentioned above, the schedule draws inspiration from likely the most influential schedule process in Crypto, Bitcoin halvings. The halvings principle dictates that half of the outstanding amount is to be distributed in each following period in equal amounts throughout that period. While BTC halvings are set at 4 years, our schedule proposal is to set this period for 2 years in the case of TRAC. That said, the emissions schedule would be as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>The Collective Programmatic Treasury will be deployed on the NeuroWebAI blockchain and will allow paranet operators to trigger Collect reward transactions which will calculate the amount of rewards they are eligible for and pay it out accordingly.</p> The distribution <p>The distribution amounts will be tied to the core principle of “Those who use it, will build it”. The metric which will, therefore, define the amount of TRAC that a builder (represented by their paranet) will receive, is tied to their TRAC spending for creating knowledge on the DKG. A simple example would be as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Paranet A spent 1,000&nbsp;TRAC  Paranet B spent 2,000&nbsp;TRAC  Paranet C spent 3,000&nbsp;TRAC  <p>Collective Programmatic Treasury amount for the period: 600&nbsp;TRAC</p>  Paranet A: 100 TRAC&nbsp;reward  Paranet B: 200 TRAC&nbsp;reward  Paranet C: 300 TRAC&nbsp;reward  <p>*all numbers are placeholders, just exemplifying the relationship between the spent and received amounts..</p><p>The Collective Programmatic Treasury will be observing DKG network usage on the innovation hub of OriginTrail ecosystem, the NeuroWebAI blockchain, thus applying only to NeuroWebAI hosted paranets.</p> The eligibility &amp; humans in the&nbsp;loop <p>Not every paranet on NeuroWebAI is by default eligible for the TRAC dev fund emissions. In order to achieve that status, a paranet must have been voted in via the IPO process, gaining support by the NeuroWebAI community through a NEURO on-chain governance vote. In this way, the community collectively decides on the dev fund &amp; NEURO incentive emissions, transparently implementing the “humans in the loop” system via on-chain governance.</p><p>The Collective Programmatic Treasury (CPT) is expected to be implemented in March&nbsp;2025.</p> DKG V8 release&nbsp;timeline <p>November</p>  DKG V8 testnet layer 1 completed  OT-RFC-21 release  DKG V8 Edge node Inception program&nbsp;start  <p>December</p>  DKG V8.0 Mainnet and Tuning period&nbsp;launch  Neuroweb collator&nbsp;staking  <p>January 2025</p>  DKG V8.1, Tuning period&nbsp;ends  <p>February 2025</p>  Neuroweb TRAC Bridge made available  <p>March 2025</p>  DKG V8.2 release — Collective Programmatic Treasury   <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-21-collective-neuro-symbolic-ai-cc71cf03ee6a">OT-RFC-21 Collective Neuro-Symbolic AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Younger generations see passwords as outdated and are opting for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, a FIDO-backed technology offering more secure, passwordless authentication. With increasing support from popular apps and services, young users are helping to drive this transition towards safer, FIDO-endorsed security solutions.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Consumer expectations are changing, and this data should serve as a clear call to action for brands and organizations still relying on outdated password systems,” noted Andrew Shikiar, CEO at FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>“Consumers are actively seeking out and prefer passwordless alternatives when available, and brands that fail to adapt are losing patience, money, and loyalty – especially among younger generations.”</p>



<p>“When consumers know about passkeys, they use them. Excitingly, 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and services already support passkeys. As the industry accelerates its efforts toward education and making deployment as simple as possible, we urge more brands to work with us to make passkeys available for consumers. The pace of passkey deployment and usage is set to accelerate even more in the next twelve months, and we are eager to help brands and consumers alike make the shift,” Shikiar concluded.</p>

<p>How key industries are preparing for eIDAS with DIDComm</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1361.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">successful formal verification of DIDComm</a> paves the way for tremendous DIDComm adoption. To help provide an understanding of this important technology, we’ve outlined some of the industries where DIDComm can play an important role.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about DIDComm, visit <a href="http://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm.org</a> or join us for a meeting of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-usergroup?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm users group</a>. All are welcome!&nbsp;</p><p>In the evolving landscape of digital communication, the need for secure, private, and efficient data exchange has never been more critical. This is especially true for the businesses, governments, and individuals who will be affected by eIDAS regulation in the European Union as they seek to protect their information while also enhancing user experiences. This blog explores the concept of DIDComm, its relationship with eIDAS, and how it stands to revolutionize five key industries.</p> What is DIDComm? <p><a href="https://didcomm.org/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">DIDComm</a> (Decentralized Identifier Communication) is an open standard for secure and private communication using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs are a type of digital identifier that allow for verifiable, self-sovereign identities. Unlike traditional communication protocols, DIDComm enables peer-to-peer communication without relying on centralized authorities, tools, or platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Key technical aspects of DIDComm include:</p>  Use of DIDs for addressing and authentication  End-to-end encryption for message confidentiality  Decentralized architecture, allowing direct communication between parties, including the devices humans use such as phones, laptops, and tablets.  Support for various transport protocols (HTTP, Bluetooth, NFC, etc.)  <p>This technology leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure data integrity, privacy, and security. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where trust and security are paramount, such as in financial transactions, healthcare data sharing, and cross-border communications.</p> Understanding eIDAS <p><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation?ref=blog.identity.foundation">eIDAS</a> (Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services) is a regulation by the European Union aimed at creating a single, standardized digital identity framework across member states. eIDAS enables secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens, and public authorities. It also ensures that electronic signatures, seals, and other trust services are recognized across all EU member states. By fostering trust and security in the digital economy, eIDAS is a key enabler of cross-border digital services and is central to the EU’s Digital Single Market strategy.</p> DIDComm and eIDAS: A Powerful Combination <p>The combination of DIDComm's decentralized, secure communication with eIDAS's standardized, legally recognized digital identity framework opens up new possibilities across various industries. Like OID4VC, the communication protocol that is expressly mentioned in eIDAS, DIDComm can be used for exchanging verifiable credentials and initial login. However, DIDComm goes beyond that. Using DIDComm, organizations can leverage eIDAS-compliant identities for ongoing secure, private communication, while also providing a flexible infrastructure that can adapt to future changes in regulatory requirements.</p><p>In addition to the standards and specifications explicitly required by legislation, it is important to enable collaboration and communication using adjacent technologies. The best results will be obtained by using the right combination of technologies integrated seamlessly together.</p> 1. Finance: Secure Cross-Border Transactions <p>In the finance sector, the need for secure, efficient, cross-border transactions is a constant challenge. Traditional methods involve multiple intermediaries, each adding cost, delay, and potential points of failure or vulnerability. With DIDComm, financial institutions can dramatically streamline cross-border transactions by engaging in direct, encrypted communication to verify identities and transaction details, bypassing the need for intermediaries.&nbsp;</p><p>The reduction in intermediaries not only cuts down on transaction times and associated fees, it minimizes the potential points of failure and security vulnerabilities. This approach ensures that sensitive financial data is handled with the utmost privacy, meeting the rigorous security standards expected in the finance industry while enhancing the user experience and making it easier to do business. Furthermore, customers benefit from a more efficient, transparent process, enhancing trust and satisfaction with financial services across the EU.</p><p>Example: A European bank conducting a transaction with a bank in another EU country could use DIDComm to securely exchange verified credentials for the transaction. By integrating eIDAS-compliant digital identities and DIDComm, the banks can communicate with the relevant stakeholders on trusted channels to ensure that the parties involved are authenticated and that the transaction is legally binding across borders. This not only reduces transaction times and costs but also enhances security and privacy by limiting data exposure to unnecessary parties.</p> 2. Industrial Machinery: Automated Event Notifications <p>In industrial settings, the efficient operation of machinery is crucial to maintaining productivity. Timely notifications about the status or needs of machinery, such as maintenance requirements or operational events, can significantly reduce downtime and improve overall efficiency and security.</p><p>By leveraging DIDComm combined with eIDAS-compliant digital identities, the system ensures that only authorized personnel receive and can act on this information. This approach not only improves efficiency by ensuring that the right people are notified in real-time, but also enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive operational data. The use of DIDComm in this scenario ensures that communication is encrypted and tamper-proof, providing a trustworthy and streamlined method for managing industrial operations across large and complex environments.</p><p>Use Case: Imagine a large warehouse in Germany where various pieces of industrial machinery are operating. When a specific mechanical event occurs, such as a temperature spike in a critical component, the machinery can automatically trigger a notification. Using DIDComm, this notification can be securely communicated to interested parties, such as the maintenance team, the machinery manufacturer, and the warehouse management system.</p><p>Read More: <a href="https://gaia-x.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SSI_White_Paper_Design_Final_EN.pdf?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Gaia-X Secure and Trustworthy Ecosystems with Self Sovereign Identity</a> (Gaia-X)</p> 3. Travel: Seamless and Secure Traveler Verification <p>The travel industry relies heavily on the secure verification of travelers' identities, whether for boarding flights, crossing borders, or checking into hotels. The challenge is to ensure that this verification process is both secure and efficient, enhancing the overall travel experience while protecting personal data.</p><p>Using DIDComm, the traveler can securely share their eIDAS-compliant digital identity with the airline, airport authorities, and border control via their mobile device. This digital identity is verified in real-time, and the traveler is seamlessly cleared through each checkpoint without the need to repeatedly present physical documents.</p><p>DIDComm ensures that the traveler’s data is encrypted and only accessible by the intended parties, reducing the risk of identity theft or unauthorized access. Additionally, this process improves the user experience by speeding up the verification process and reducing wait times. The use of secure, decentralized communication also allows for more flexible travel arrangements, such as automated hotel check-ins or renting a car, where the traveler’s verified digital identity can be securely communicated directly to service providers.</p><p>Use Case: Consider a scenario where a traveler from France is flying to another EU country. Upon arrival at the airport, they need to go through multiple identity verification steps—at the airline check-in counter, security checkpoints, and immigration control. Traditionally, this involves presenting physical documents like a passport, which can be cumbersome and slow.</p><p>Read More:</p>  <a href="https://www.goodeintelligence.com/report/travel-digital-identity-seamless-powered-by-digital-identity/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Travel Digital Identity – Seamless Travel Powered by Digital Identity</a> (Goode Intelligence)  <a href="https://www.the-prism-project.com/th-prism-download?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Biometric Digital Identity Travel and Hospitality</a> (Prism)  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-301989815.html?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Aruba Makes Steady Progress In Launching New Digital Travel Credential</a>   4. Supply Chain Management: Secure and Transparent Tracking <p>Supply chain management involves coordinating numerous stakeholders, often across different countries and regulatory environments. Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of goods and documents as they move through the supply chain is critical.</p><p>Integrating DIDComm into supply chain management enhances transparency, security, and efficiency across all stages of the supply chain. By enabling secure, encrypted communication between manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers, DIDComm ensures that all parties have access to accurate and verified information in real time. This is particularly valuable when supply chains are not running smoothly. Communicating about part acceptance, quality measurement, and delivery schedules can benefit from standards based secure communication.&nbsp;</p><p>The use of eIDAS-compliant digital identities further strengthens trust, as each stakeholder's identity and credentials are authenticated and legally recognized across borders. This reduces the risk of fraud, errors, and delays, leading to a more reliable and efficient supply chain. Ultimately, businesses benefit from improved operational efficiency and reduced costs, while customers receive products that are securely tracked and delivered with greater transparency.</p><p>Use Case: A manufacturer in France could use DIDComm to securely communicate with suppliers and logistics providers across the EU, using eIDAS-compliant digital identities to verify the credentials of each party involved. This secure communication can include encrypted data about the origin, handling, and delivery and acceptance of goods, ensuring transparency and trust throughout the supply chain. By using DIDComm, supply chain managers can reduce the risk of fraud, improve efficiency, and ensure compliance with various regulatory requirements.</p><p>Read More:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/implementing-digital-product-passports-using-decentralized-identity-standards-f1102c452020?ref=blog.identity.foundation#id_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6ImIyZjgwYzYzNDYwMGVkMTMwNzIxMDFhOGI0MjIwNDQzNDMzZGIyODIiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FjY291bnRzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20iLCJhenAiOiIyMTYyOTYwMzU4MzQtazFrNnFlMDYwczJ0cDJhMmphbTRsamRjbXMwMHN0dGcuYXBwcy5nb29nbGV1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20iLCJhdWQiOiIyMTYyOTYwMzU4MzQtazFrNnFlMDYwczJ0cDJhMmphbTRsamRjbXMwMHN0dGcuYXBwcy5nb29nbGV1c2VyY29udGVudC5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiIxMTIxMDY4NjE3MDY4NjYwNTYwMTIiLCJlbWFpbCI6ImtpbWRoYW1pbHRvbkBnbWFpbC5jb20iLCJlbWFpbF92ZXJpZmllZCI6dHJ1ZSwibmJmIjoxNzI1MjIzMzg0LCJuYW1lIjoiS2ltIEhhbWlsdG9uIiwicGljdHVyZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbGgzLmdvb2dsZXVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbS9hL0FDZzhvY0psOTVfQjI4VnZ0bWZ5SURndXBxWlJ4U2huRGRxbzJ1d2wteGlBVEtzeHI4QzVSZF9MPXM5Ni1jIiwiZ2l2ZW5fbmFtZSI6IktpbSIsImZhbWlseV9uYW1lIjoiSGFtaWx0b24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MjUyMjM2ODQsImV4cCI6MTcyNTIyNzI4NCwianRpIjoiMDkyMjg3ZDBjNjFkZTUxOTRhMWU5YTQzYzZlMzk1NDExMzU3OGMwNyJ9.bm7Jvv1wmsXegIryD6DKQTTfFQuv95yj4yIQBTXodoMY-Odo1ADwkYW03Q9kdzfLcnV274AHDCHP7iNvSsknkN8YxI6fruqy4sYNcHm3XEb_0PNNZHD6IV7rkKQXfhz6ZbdEkDONErEgL_5mni2uw1CVuGhIfUSlt_32jSdmCfHw5kFNjGX2vL2cE1CGEb5uM7DvyIy5yghOi9ef3dbMUlMdAETwLQR6fQ8dDAS6cQVO4m7XRiolaoo9S5j5807vs5MNYoUROLjhkP8b0aYwRe1ZTYvay9QCMa-W20d3ORS23NwCmAUNOjM9KgC0h_otHlz-z6jWGzax6IkbflBjfg">Implementing Digital Product Passports using Decentralized Identity Standards</a> (Spherity Blog)  <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/digital-product-passports-and-supply-chain-compliance/">EU Digital Product Passports and Enabling Compliance in the US Pharmaceutical Supply Chain</a> (DIF Blog)  <a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralized-identity-use-case-spotlight-supply-chains/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Identity Use Case Spotlight Supply Chains</a> (Indicio Blog)   5. Government Services: Secure Citizen-to-Government Interactions <p>Governments are increasingly moving towards digital services to improve efficiency and accessibility. However, ensuring that these services are secure and that citizens’ data is protected is a significant challenge.</p><p>Implementing DIDComm for citizen-to-government interactions revolutionizes how public services are accessed and utilized. It becomes more convenient for citizens to share information and their communications with government entities are encrypted and protected from unauthorized access. The integration of eIDAS-compliant digital identities ensures that these interactions are not only secure but also legally recognized across EU member states. This results in a more efficient public service system, where processes such as applying for permits or accessing social services are streamlined, reducing administrative burdens and enhancing the overall user experience for citizens.</p><p>Use Case: A citizen in Italy could use their eIDAS-compliant digital identity to securely communicate with government agencies via DIDComm. This could include applying for permits, submitting tax information, or accessing public services. DIDComm ensures that all communications are encrypted and that the citizen’s data is only accessible by the intended government agencies. This use case demonstrates how DIDComm can enhance the security and privacy of digital government services while providing a better user experience by simplifying and streamlining interactions with public authorities.</p><p>Read more:&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3543434.3543638?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Enhancing European Interoperability Frameworks to Leverage Mobile Cross-Border Services in Europe</a> (Association for Computing Machinery)   Preparing for eIDAS and beyond <p>DIDComm represents a powerful tool for enhancing security, privacy, and efficiency across various industries that are preparing for an eIDAS future. By enabling secure, decentralized communication and integrating legally recognized digital identities, these technologies are set to revolutionize how businesses, governments, and individuals interact in the digital world.&nbsp;</p><p>As these technologies continue to develop and gain adoption, we can expect to see significant improvements in the way sensitive data is handled, trust is established, and user experiences are delivered across borders.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID AB/Connect Working Group</a>&nbsp;recommends approval of the following specification as an OpenID Implementer’s Draft:</p>
 
 OpenID4VP: <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-22.html">https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-22.html</a> 
 
<p>This would be the third Implementer’s Draft of this specification.</p>
 This version has 3 major changes: 
 
 
 Introduces the Digital Credentials Query Language; this is an alternative to Presentation Exchange 
 Introduces the transaction data mechanism that enables a binding between the user’s identification/authentication and the user’s authorization, for example to complete a payment transaction, or to sign specific document(s) using QES (Qualified Electronic Signatures). 
 Removes the client_id_scheme parameter and instead makes the client id scheme a prefix on the client_id; this addresses a security issue with the previous solution. 
 
<p>The editors &amp; chairs would greatly appreciate implementor feedback on the new Digital Credentials Query Language and we expect to further evolve the language based on feedback received.</p>
 
 An Implementer’s Draft is a stable version of a specification providing intellectual property protections to implementers of the specification. This note starts the 45-day public review period for the specification draft in accordance with the OpenID Foundation IPR policies and procedures. Unless issues are identified during the review that the working group believes must be addressed by revising the draft, this review period will be followed by a seven-day voting period during which OpenID Foundation members will vote on whether to approve this draft as an OpenID Implementer’s Draft. For the convenience of members, voting will actually begin a week before the start of the official voting period, for members who have completed their reviews by then. The relevant dates are: 
 
 Implementer’s Draft public review period: Friday, November 1, 2024 to Sunday, December 16, 2024 (45 days) 
 Implementer’s Draft vote announcement: Tuesday, December 3, 2024 
 Implementer’s Draft early voting opens: Tuesday, December 10, 2024 * 
 Implementer’s Draft official voting period: Tuesday, December 17 to Tuesday, December 24, 2024 * 
 
<p>* Note: Early voting before the start of the formal voting period will be allowed. </p>

<p>Since launching AutoGreenCharge, an app aimed at reducing carbon emissions from electric vehicles (EVs), many early users and corporate partners have asked us to explain how it works — especially how it uses Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Today, we’ll break down what AutoGreenCharge does and how it helps EV drivers, fleet owners, and anyone interested in decarbonizing EV charging and the grid as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Understanding Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs)</p><p>First, let’s talk about electricity markets and EACs. These certificates are used to track and trade the environmental benefits of renewable energy. EACs represent the “green” qualities of renewable electricity, such as how it was produced (wind, solar, etc.), where it was generated, and when it was created. For every 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable electricity, one EAC is issued. These certificates can be sold separately from the actual electricity, so people or businesses can support renewable energy without being directly connected to a renewable power&nbsp;plant.</p><p>​​When someone wants to claim they’ve used renewable electricity, they “retire” the certificate in a registry, ensuring that only one person or business can take credit for that specific green energy. Governments and companies worldwide have been using EACs for years to help make their energy use&nbsp;cleaner.</p><p>Different regions have their own versions of&nbsp;EACs:</p>  Europe uses Guarantees of Origin (GOs), which prove electricity came from renewable sources.  North America uses Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), similar to GOs, but often certified by a trusted third&nbsp;party.  Other countries, like Australia and Japan, have their own systems that work in a similar&nbsp;way.  International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-RECs) are used in many emerging economies and track renewable energy across&nbsp;borders.  <p>EACs can be bought and sold on various platforms, and once purchased, they can be retired to claim a decrease in emissions.</p><p>How AutoGreenCharge Works</p><p>AutoGreenCharge simplifies the process of matching EACs to EV charging sessions. It takes into account where and when you charge your car, how much electricity you use, and then automatically selects and purchases EACs to offset any non-renewable energy in that session. Since most EV charging sessions use less electricity than a full MWh (the standard size of an EAC), AutoGreenCharge splits the certificates into smaller pieces to match your charge. This process is verified by Energy Web’s Worker Node network, which ensures everything is tracked accurately.</p><p>AutoGreenCharge also has a new feature for enterprise: “Bring Your Own EAC.” This allows companies to use EACs they’ve already purchased. If they don’t want to handle it themselves, the app can take care of buying and matching the right certificates for them. For example, the first certificates purchased by Energy Web for the app were high-quality wind RECs from the&nbsp;U.S.</p><p>Addressing Common Questions</p><p>One AutoGreenCharge tester asked the following: “How do you know I am not charging my vehicle using a diesel generator?”</p><p>First, we should note that while it is possible to run a diesel generator to charge a vehicle, it’s a fairly rare occurrence as it doesn’t make economic sense. Charging an EV with a diesel generator is expensive, and buying EACs to greenwash it would be even more costly. However, we can consider this scenario as an example to demonstrate how AutoGreenCharge works. If the app doesn’t have any further information about the physical grid connection of the charging station in use, it will assume that none of the electricity used was renewable. So in this scenario, an EAC would be matched to the full charging session volume to make sure it’s covered by 100% renewables.</p><p>EACs give control to each individual and organization to contribute to the success of renewable facilities by attracting more investments into a greener grid which will replace emitting electricity generators over time. AutoGreenCharge makes every charge event supportive of renewable energy — at least somewhere in your EAC&nbsp;region.</p> Limitations of EACs&nbsp;Today <p>While EACs are great for individual action supporting renewables, they have some limitations. For example, they usually don’t specify the exact time of electricity generation — just the year. They also don’t always account for physical grid limitations, meaning you could buy an EAC from another region even if it doesn’t match the electricity connection where you’re&nbsp;located.</p><p>Still, EACs are currently the most widely used system for tracking renewable energy. Efforts are already underway to make EACs more detailed. AutoGreenCharge supports several types of emerging protocols, like <a href="https://future-energy-lab.de/projects/dive-en/%20https://mobility.unternehmertum.de/en/trusted-green-charging-1-0">Trusted Green Charging and DIVE</a>, which provide a more accurate environmental impact for specific charging&nbsp;events.</p><p>We’re excited about the future of AutoGreenCharge and welcome feedback!

<p>Global FIDO Alliance study reveals latest consumer trends and attitudes towards authentication methods and their perceived online security</p>



 
 Passkey familiarity growing – Just two years after passkeys were first announced and started to be made available for consumer use, awareness has risen by 50%, from 39% familiar in 2022 to 57% in 2024 



 Password usage stagnates as consumers favor alternatives – The majority of those familiar with passkeys are enabling the technology to sign in. Meanwhile, despite passwords remaining the most common way to log in, the number of people using passwords across use cases declined as alternatives continue to rise in availability 



 Waning password patience is costing sales and loyalty, especially among younger consumers – &nbsp;42% of people have abandoned a purchase at least once in the past month because they could not remember their password.​ This increases to 50% for those aged 25-34 versus just 17% of over 65s 



 Online scams and AI alarming consumers – Over half of consumers reported an increase in the number of suspicious messages they notice and an increase in scam sophistication, driven by AI. Younger generations are even more likely to agree, while older generations remain unsure how AI impacts their online security 
 



<p>29 October 2024 – The <a href="http://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today publishes its fourth annual <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/research-findings-consumer-trends-and-attitudes-towards-authentication-methods/">Online Authentication Barometer</a>, which gathers insights into the state of online authentication and consumer perceptions of online security in ten countries across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key findings&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research revealed promising consumer momentum building around passkey adoption and clear signs people are recognizing the limitations of passwords and are choosing passwordless alternatives, like passkeys, where available. In the two years since passkeys were first announced, global awareness has jumped by 50%, rising from 39% familiar in 2022 to 57% in 2024. Awareness is driving adoption too – the majority of those familiar with passkeys (62%) are using them to secure their apps and online accounts.</p>



<p>The data also revealed the cost to organizations still relying on legacy password sign-ins – especially among younger generations. 42% abandoned a purchase in the last month due to a forgotten password, rising to over half of those under 35. Similarly, over half of consumers (56%) have given up accessing a service online because they couldn’t remember a password in the last month, rising to 66% of those under 35.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey revealed other clear signs that password usage and trust are stagnating globally as more secure and user-friendly passwordless alternatives become available. Overall, the number of consumers entering a password manually across use cases decreased again from 2023, while biometrics ranked the authentication method consumers consider the best login experience and the method they consider most secure for the second year running.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When consumers were asked about how they have improved account security in the last year, numbers continued to decline among those who increased the complexity of a password, while those choosing biometrics and using authenticator apps have steadily risen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys at two: the road to mainstream&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumer expectations are changing, and this data should serve as a clear call to action for brands and organizations still relying on outdated password systems. Consumers are actively seeking out and prefer passwordless alternatives when available, and brands that fail to adapt are losing patience, money, and loyalty – especially among younger generations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When consumers know about passkeys, they use them. Excitingly, 20% of the world’s top 100 websites and services already support passkeys. As the industry accelerates its efforts toward education and making deployment as simple as possible, we urge more brands to work with us to make passkeys available for consumers. The pace of passkey deployment and usage is set to accelerate even more in the next twelve months, and we are eager to help brands and consumers alike make the shift,” comments Andrew Shikiar, CEO at FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, passkeys have seen strong adoption in high-growth, digitally advanced markets like China and India, which ranked top globally with 80% and 73% enablement, respectively. The UK followed close behind in third place, with adoption levels at 66%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Younger consumers most attuned to online scams and AI threats&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumer concerns about online security were also revealed to be high – and again, it is younger consumers most attuned to new threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over half of consumers (53%) cited an increase in the number of suspicious messages they noticed in recent months, driven mostly by SMS (53%) and email (49%). Similarly, 51% detected an increase in the sophistication of threats and scam messages, likely driven by AI-enhanced attacks. Zooming in on demographic data suggests older generations are at greatest risk: 54% and 61% of 18-24 and 25-34-year-olds respectively noticed scams getting smarter, while just a third of 55-64-year-olds and 25% of 65+ said the same. Similarly, 20% of people over 55 said they were unsure about the impact AI has on their online security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ENDS&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notes to editors&nbsp;</p>



 
 Research for the FIDO Alliance’s Online Authentication Barometer was conducted by Sapio Research among 10,000 consumers across the UK, France, Germany, US, Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India, and China.&nbsp; 
 



<p>About FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.&nbsp;</p>

 Some practical tips to use AI with your&nbsp;team <p>The use of large language models (“LLMs”) such as ChatGPT can be a controversial topic. People have strong opinions about them for all kinds of reasons, from concerns around data privacy to the propagation of bias and inequality. The amount of energy used to train LLMs, and the amount of water used to cool data centres on which cloud-based versions run, is a particular concern. Our project with <a href="https://friendsoftheearth.uk/">Friends of the Earth</a> around <a href="https://experiments.friendsoftheearth.uk/blog/harnessing-ai-environmental-justice">Harnessing AI for environmental justice</a> starts to unpack some of the environmental complexities of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>However, LLMs can be really useful as well, so in this post, we’re going to take a nuanced look at how various types of LLMs can be used together to improve both process and outcomes. We believe this is in keeping with the <a href="https://wiki.weareopen.coop/en/spirit-of-wao">Spirit of WAO</a> and our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/practical-utopias-and-rewilding-work-27c148d95b16">five focus areas</a>, we believe in dialogue that leads to action. At WAO we’ve had a number of conversations around our personal use of AI and how we prefer to use it in our collective work.</p>WAO’s 5 focus areas, cc-by&nbsp;WAO Why use&nbsp;LLMs? <p>Having used them regularly as part of our daily work for over 18 months at this point, we can say that using LLMs is useful for us in a number of concrete&nbsp;ways:</p>  Speed — outsourcing ‘grunt’ work to LLMs means that we can spend time doing more creative work. A good example of this is using the optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities of some LLMs to recognise virtual sticky notes from project <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/pre-mortem/">pre-mortem</a> sessions we run with clients. It can then turn these into text, categorise them, and produce a spreadsheet. What would take perhaps an hour can be done in a couple of&nbsp;minutes.  Situational perspectives — Asking LLMs to perform a ‘red/amber/green’ or RAG analysis of work can also be useful. It’s easy to get carried away with personal interests or to miss an important part of a client brief. By asking LLMs to check your work using the RAG format against what has been requested, we can check that our work fits with what’s required. It can also help us think through problems: on Doug’s <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2023/08/17/house-purchases-climate-change-and-ai/">personal blog</a> he discussed how he used an LLM in the process of deciding not to go through with a house purchase. The AI helped calculate things such as cumulative risk of flooding over time, using formulae he might not have otherwise known how to&nbsp;use.  Text synthesis — LLMs are excellent at synthesising information quickly and efficiently. This is true of the recently-launched <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/">Google NotebookLM</a> which allows users to share up to 50 data sources, synthesise and then query them. One important point, however, is that we need to be thoughtful and focused in checking the accuracy of synthesis and summarisation work because LLM’s are also great at hallucinating.   Three ways to approach LLMs sustainably  Start local <p>There’s a lot to unpack around the use of AI and the environmental impacts. As a tech and environmental activist, I was hesitant about using some of the popular, browser-based LLMs for a variety of reasons. I recently wrote up <a href="https://www.laurahilliger.com/leadership/captain-planet-and-ai-earth-fire-wind-water-and-heart/">a quick, Captain Planet themed overview</a> of some of the climate crisis issues that this kind of technology contributes to. Together with WAO members, I’ve discussed and debated various privacy, bias and attribution issues that are baked into our technology choices.</p><p>Having started to use AI across a lot of contexts and looking into the impacts that the use of AI has, we made the decision to use locally installed models and tools to help reduce our climate impact whenever possible. Locally installed models might not be updated as frequently as ChatGPT, but the climate benefits are huge. The processing happens locally, as does the storage, so your queries and conversations aren’t stored in big data centres and they remain private to&nbsp;you.</p> Use multiple&nbsp;models <p>There are many generative AI models, some of which are smaller and some which are larger. A good place to see the diversity of these models is <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>, a slightly awkwardly-named AI community. Here you can find the latest versions of models, along with datasets, and implementations of AI for various purposes.</p><p>It can be complicated to use the command line to install, configure, and run LLMs locally. However, as macOS users one of the tools we’ve been playing with is <a href="https://recurse.chat/">RecurseChat</a> which simplifies the use of multiple, local AI models within an easy-to-use app. It’s straightforward to install and has a privacy policy that doesn’t keep us up at night worrying about where our data is&nbsp;going.</p> Conduct experiments <p>When AI image generation first hit the scene, we were excited about its possibilities. Together, we made art projects like <a href="https://www.laurahilliger.com/writing/times-solitary-dance/">Time’s Solitary Dance</a> or the <a href="https://www.laurahilliger.com/design/psychops-for-mental-health-awareness-month/">PsychOps for Mental Health Awareness month</a>, which I made pairing AI generated images with the fabulous <a href="https://remixer.visualthinkery.com/">Remixer&nbsp;Machine</a>.</p><p>While we certainly had fun playing with image generation, we now default to simply searching for images (or asking <a href="mailto:bryan@visualthinkery.com">Bryan Mathers</a> to draw them for us&nbsp;;) There is an incredible emission cost to image generation, so we think carefully before asking generative AI to make something for&nbsp;us.</p>This graphic, from p.156 of the <a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HAI_AI-Index-Report-2024.pdf">Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024</a> shows how ‘image generation’ has a much greater impact on CO2 emissions than, for example, ‘text classification’ or ‘question answering’/<p>Being environmentally conscious involves uncovering a great many complexities within our world. For example, when talking about the overall consumption of energy and water people tend to be quite alarmist. After a conversation with one of our gaming buddies about the annual energy use of a beer fridge, we calculated that it was the equivalent of prompting ChatGPT 4 over 2,200 times. Similarly, we calculated that you could prompt over 300 times for the same water usage as washing a car with a hose. While we recognise that using AI is an additional resource use, we try to put it in the context of wider consumption patterns.</p> Go forth and prompt&nbsp;together <p>If you are working alone and making use of LLMs, be sure and let people know what your “little robot friend” had to say. At WAO we let each other know when something we’re pasting into a chat is AI generated or if we’re about to prompt an LLM on something. Transparency is an important part of the&nbsp;process.</p>This AI Transparency statement was included in <a href="https://medium.com/we-are-cast/embrace-the-horseducks-and-other-takeaways-from-the-charity-digital-ai-summit-9842bca0f7f8">the recent CAST post</a> about the Charity Digital AI Summit and is CC-BY Kester&nbsp;Brewin<p>Part of <a href="https://ailiteracy.fyi/">AI literacy</a> is being able to spot common foibles of LLMs. For example, we’ve come to dislike the words ‘delve’ and ‘foster’ because of their overuse by ChatGPT. Once you start noticing particular models tend towards certain words or phrases, you start seeing them everywhere. This is another reason transparency is so important.</p><p>Using a local model and screen sharing while coworking with your team is a great way to learn about AI together. You can use AI prompting and team conversation to bounce ideas around and find some <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/finding-unexamined-assumptions-through-systems-thinking-and-ambiguity-17c6e98c670f">productive ambiguity</a>. Another benefit of this process is, of course, the laughter. AI responds with some pretty hilarious things sometimes, so why not improve your team dynamic by making fun of AI together.</p><p>Do you need help with this kind of thing?<a href="https://weareopen.coop"> Get in touch</a> with&nbsp;WAO!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/cooperating-through-the-use-of-ai-404809763f94">Cooperating through the use of AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This topic was presented at IIWXXXIX Fall 2024 on October 29, 2024.</p>

 

<p>My name is Christopher Allen. In 2016, in advance of the ID2020 conference at the United Nations in New York, I wrote <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">“The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity”</a>, the article that described the ten precepts of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and provided the name that defined our ecosystem. Eight and a half years later, I ask the SSI community to reflect on a difficult question, one that challenges the very foundation of SSI. Has our ecosystem strayed from our principles? Have we in the SSI community lost our moral compass?</p>

<p>I speak not only in response to the argument <a href="https://rileyparkerhughes.medium.com/why-verifiable-credentials-arent-widely-adopted-why-trinsic-pivoted-aee946379e3b">last year at IIW</a> that “SSI didn’t work” but also to underscore a graver issue: that perhaps in our pursuit of mainstream adoption we’ve sacrificed the very principles that set SSI apart.</p>

<p>In a world increasingly threatened by authoritarian encroachments, with troubling examples growing by the day, we face the urgent need to protect freedom. Russia and China flout international borders and expand their influence through intimidation and repression. This rise of authoritarianism is undermining human freedom across Europe, especially in Hungary, with worrying echoes in Italy, the Netherlands, France, and across the EU. The number of refugees and stateless people are rising every year.</p>

<p>Closer to home, we also face disconcerting overreach, such as the Texas Attorney General’s request for DMV records of people who changed their names, an alarming step towards state-enabled discrimination against trans people. If Trump is re-elected, it’s chilling to imagine what might become acceptable next.</p>

<p>These are ominous signs of an escalating trend toward pervasive surveillance and control, not only over our private lives but also over the core of human dignity itself. SSI was meant to stand as a bastion against these encroachments, defending personal autonomy and integrity. It imagined a world where people, not institutions, controlled their identities, without fear of overreach, manipulation, or coercion.</p>

<p>However, instead of holding the line on decentralization, we’ve compromised by adopting watered-down specifications such as “did:web” that diminish the resilience and independence of self-sovereign identities.</p>

<p>Instead of insisting that Legally-Enabled Self-Sovereign (LESS) Identity enforce strict data minimization for both businesses and governments, we have allowed over-identification to proliferate. Further, we have failed to effectively counter the overblown threats posed by the so-called ‘Four Horsemen of the Digital Apocalypse’ — software pirates, organized crime, child pornographers, and terrorists — while also overlooking the far greater risk of tyranny and its potential for real harm against those powerless to defend themselves.</p>

<p>These compromises have left us vulnerable, eroding SSI’s unique value proposition compared to the centralized approaches of government. As a result, centralized government approoaches such as Apple and Google’s mDL/mDoc standards and federated corporate identity efforts are now winning the market battle against our SSI ecosystem.</p>

<p>This is the real reason the SSI ecosystem may be faltering: not due to market forces, but because we have failed to unequivocally commit to upholding the core values of decentralization and privacy and to resisting compromises that undermine human dignity. By doing so, we have become indistinguishable from the very systems we set out to disrupt.</p>

<p>The question is not whether SSI has “worked” in the marketplace. It is whether we have remained true to its ethical foundation and core principles, as envisioned from the start.</p>

 1. What are BPoS NFTs? 
<p>A: BPoS NFTs are unique tokens that represent staked ELA on the main chain network. They allow users to retain asset liquidity while securing the network, offering flexible options like trading and collateralizing staked ELA.</p>
 
 
 2. How do they function within Elastos? 
<p>A: Users first stake ELA on the main Elastos Blockchain, locking it in the BPoS model for a chosen period, during which their stake contributes to network security and governance. Following this initial lock period, users can mint a BPoS NFT on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) representing their locked ELA and the corresponding locked period yet still earning continuous rewards.</p>
<p>This NFT, based on the ERC-721 standard, represents the staked ELA and can be freely traded, transferred, or collateralized on the ESC without requiring the user to un-stake. As a result, the user retains liquidity while still maintaining their staked position in the network. This innovative approach to staking on Elastos allows assets to remain in circulation within decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or marketplaces, granting users greater flexibility.</p>
 
 
 3. How secure are BPoS NFTs? 
<p>A: The BPoS NFTs on Elastos are designed with security in mind by leveraging the ERC-721 standard and OpenZeppelin’s open-source, audited code. Here’s a breakdown of key security features:</p>
 
 NFT Contract: The BPoS NFT contract, following the ERC-721 standard, is immutable and ownerless, meaning no one can alter it post-deployment. Only the NFT holder has the authority to transfer their NFT. 
 Claim Contract: The claim process requires users to sign their staked transaction ID and target ESC address, ensuring authenticity. The claim contract checks signatures before NFT creation, preventing unauthorized minting. 
 
<p>By combining these mechanisms, BPoS NFTs maintain strong security through verified code and strict transaction protocols, reducing risks of tampering and unauthorized claims.</p>
 
 
 4. Which wallet supports BPoS NFTs on Elastos? 
<p>A: Currently, Web3 Essentials is the only compatible wallet for managing BPoS NFTs on Elastos. This wallet supports the staking, trading, and transfer functions of BPoS NFTs on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC), making it essential for users wanting to maintain flexibility with their staked assets.</p>
<p>For a complete guide on setting up and using Web3 Essentials with BPoS NFTs, you can follow the step-by-step instructions <a href="https://elastos.info/tutorial/how-to-use-bpos-nfts-on-elastos-a-step-by-step-guide/">here</a>.</p>
 
 
 5. What are the different options present on the BPoS NFT tab in the Essentials wallet? 
<p>A: In the BPoS NFT tab, the Send, Receive, and Destroy functions have specific roles:</p>
 
 Send: Allows users to transfer their BPoS NFT to another wallet, maintaining the staked position but changing ownership. 
 Receive: Enables a wallet to accept the BPoS NFT, continuing the staking status in the new owner’s control. 
 Destroy: This function permanently removes (or “burns”) the NFT and converts it back into its original staking status, i.e. only voting rights on the Main Chain without a corresponding NFT representing ownership of such voting rights. Noting that the staked ELA remains locked until the lock period ends. 
 
<p>For more detailed instructions, visit the Elastos BPoS NFT guide <a href="https://elastos.info/news/unlocking-ela-introducing-elastos-bpos-nfts/">here</a>.</p>
 
 
 6. Will I get my staked ELA back after I minted an NFT and sent it to a new wallet? 
<p>A: No, when you mint a BPoS NFT and send it to a new wallet, the new owner of the NFT gains control over the staked ELA on the main chain. This means they can choose to hold, transfer, or destroy the NFT, managing the staked ELA as they see fit. Additionally, they will also receive the rewards associated with the staked ELA.</p>
 
 
 7. Will I be able to destroy a BPoS NFT even though my wallet does not have a main chain address? 
<p>A: No, the Essentials app will not allow you to destroy or claim if your wallet does not have a corresponding Elastos main chain address.</p>
 
 
 8. What is the Elastos consensus model, and how does BPoS integrate with it? 
<p>A: Elastos operates using a multi-layered consensus mechanism called Elastic Consensus, which combines Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW) and Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) to secure the network and provide utility.</p>
 
 Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW): AuxPoW leverages Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure, allowing Bitcoin miners to secure both Bitcoin and Elastos simultaneously without extra energy costs. Approximately 50% of Bitcoin’s hash rate (about 293.69 EH/s) is used to secure Elastos, providing it with substantial security and network-wide trust. 
 Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS): In BPoS, users lock ELA on the Main Chain to secure the network and validate transactions. Validators must hold 80,000 staking rights to participate in block validation and share rewards with stakers. This incentivizes participation and contributes to the network’s stability. 
 
 
 
 9. How do BPoS NFTs unlock the value of staked ELA? 
<p>A: Traditional staking locks assets, limiting liquidity. BPoS NFTs solve this problem by converting main chain staking rights into ERC-721 standard NFTs that represent ownership to claim the underlying staked ELA and its accumulating rewards.</p>
 
 Staking and Minting:
 
 Users stake ELA tokens on the Main Chain using the Essentials Wallet. 
 Once staked, they can mint BPoS NFTs on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC). The NFT represents both the staked ELA and the accumulating APY rewards. 
 
 
 Trading and Transfer:
 
 BPoS NFTs can be freely traded or transferred on the ESC, allowing users to unlock liquidity without ending their staking position or interrupting rewards. 
 
 
 Burning and Claiming Rewards:
 
 NFT holders can burn NFTs at any time to claim APY rewards. 
 The staked ELA remains locked until the lock period ends, at which point it can be withdrawn by BPoS NFT holder and their corresponding main-chain address. 
 
 
 
 
 
 10. What is the BeL2 Arbiter Network, and how will BPoS NFTs be used within it? 
<p>A: The BeL2 Arbiter Network is an upcoming layer in the Elastos ecosystem that will enable new financial applications such as BTC-based loans, stablecoin issuance, and dispute resolution services.</p>
 
 Collateralization in the BeL2 Arbiter Network:
 
 Arbiter Entry: Users can stake ELA BPoS NFTs as collateral to participate as nodes in the BeL2 network. 
 Earning BTC and dApp Rewards: BPoS NFT arbiter nodes earn percentage-based BTC and decentralized application (dApp) rewards, alongside Main Chain ELA staking rewards, for supporting time-based transactions and dispute resolution services that reflect the value of their collateral. 
 
 
 Decentralized Financial Services:
 
 The BeL2 network supports native BTC services, ensuring decentralized loans are completed, maintaining stablecoin pegs, liquidating assets based on market conditions, and providing dispute resolution services. 
 This creates a secure, decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems without moving BTC off the mainnet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 11. What are the key advantages of Elastos BPoS NFTs? 
<p>A: The key advantages include:</p>
 
 Flexible Liquidity: Users can trade or transfer staked assets and their rewards as NFT receipts without waiting for the lock period to end. 
 Bitcoin-Backed Security: With a significant portion of Bitcoin’s hash rate securing Elastos, the network benefits from high levels of trust and reliability. 
 New Financial Tools: BPoS NFTs can be used as collateral for loans and arbitration services in the BeL2 network, creating new earning opportunities. 
 Simple Wallet Management: Users can manage NFTs through the non-custodial Essentials Wallet, ensuring full control over staked assets. 
 
 
 
 12. How can I mint, claim, and manage BPoS NFTs using the Essentials Wallet? 
<p>A: To mint, claim, and manage BPoS NFTs, follow these steps:</p>
 
 Minting:
 
 Enter Your Votes: Stake ELA on the Elastos Main Chain using the Essentials Wallet and allocate your voting power. 
 Initiate the Minting Process: Confirm the minting transaction to create a BPoS NFT. 
 Wait for Confirmations: Wait for 6 block confirmations on the Main Chain. 
 Switch to Elastos Smart Chain: Move to the ESC to complete the claim process. 
 
 
 Claiming:
 
 Automatic Check for Claimable NFTs: On the ESC, Essentials will automatically search for any claimable BPoS NFTs tied to your wallet address. 
 Claim the NFT: Click “Claim” to transfer the minted BPoS NFT to your wallet. 
 
 
 Managing:
 
 Transfer the NFT:
 
 Select “Send” and enter the destination address to transfer the NFT to another wallet. 
 
 
 Destroy the NFT:
 
 Choose “Destroy” to convert the NFT back into a vote on the Main Chain, regaining its original staking status. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13. Are there future plans for BPoS NFTs within the Elastos ecosystem? 
<p>A: Yes, future plans include:</p>
 
 Integration into Marketplaces: BPoS NFTs will be incorporated into platforms like <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> for trading. 
 Use in the BeL2 Arbiter Network: They will serve as collateral within the BeL2 network for BTC-based loans and dispute resolution services. 
 Network Security Rewards: Opportunities to help secure the network in return for BTC rewards.

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, you may not need to remember a password ever again.</p>



<p>Apple thinks 249 of my passwords need attention. Some of them have been reused. Some of them have been caught up in data breaches. Some are just bad passwords.</p>



<p>That’s why, for the past 11 years, a group called the FIDO Alliance has been working to kill passwords — or at least make us less reliant on them. FIDO, short for Fast IDentity Online, wants to make signing into your accounts not only more secure but also, as the name implies, faster and easier. Since its members include Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and other architects of our online experience, the FIDO Alliance is in a position to accomplish this, too.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve realized it or not, FIDO’s efforts have already transformed the way you sign into everything online. You may have noticed a few years ago, for instance, that a lot more sites started requiring <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/MFA">something called multifactor authentication</a>, which adds an extra step to the login process, like texting a code to your phone so the site can verify you are you. That was FIDO’s doing.</p>



<p>But after years of making logging in more difficult but more secure, the alliance <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-launches-comprehensive-web-resource-to-accelerate-passkey-adoption/">recently began a major push</a> to get platforms and people alike to adopt a technology that may just kill passwords altogether: passkeys.</p>

<p>By: Joni Brennan, President of DIACC-CCIAN</p>



  
<p>The recent <a href="https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/intel/bulletins/legal-juridique-eng">FINTRAC Special Bulletin on money laundering and sanctions evasion in the legal profession </a>is a clear reminder that safeguarding our financial systems—and upholding security—requires both vigilance and innovation. At the core of these efforts lies a powerful tool: digital verification of client identification. This technology is crucial in preventing the misuse of legal services for illicit activities like money laundering and sanctions evasion.</p>
  



<p>While most legal professionals work with integrity, the bulletin underscores that a few actors may unwittingly (or intentionally) facilitate financial crime. This crime threatens the integrity of our financial system and erodes the public’s trust in our legal system, where the majority are acting in good faith. </p>



<p>So, where does DIACC fit in? How does digital verification help mitigate these risks?</p>



<p>DIACC’s Role in Strengthening Digital Verification</p>



<p>Our work—anchored in the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF)</a>—is focused on enabling secure, privacy-respecting digital trust and verification services that support consumers, businesses, and governments. These services are essential in a world where digital interactions are the norm, and ensuring information authenticity is critical to preventing fraud and criminal activities.</p>



<p>The Law Society Profile: Supporting Legal Sector Security</p>



<p>One of the most exciting initiatives DIACC has undertaken is the development of the PCTF Law Society Profile. Working closely with the Federation of Law Societies of Canada (FLSC) and essential interested parties, this project highlights how the legal sector can play a pivotal role in combating money laundering. By establishing auditable criteria to mitigate risk and build assurance for client verification, the PCTF Law Society Profile enables legal professionals to confidently select trusted services that verify their clients’ identities, providing evidence of investment in alignment with stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements.</p>



<p>This certification process helps legal professionals choose services one step ahead of fraudsters, ensuring transparency and security as they navigate high-value or high-risk transactions.</p>



  
<p>As the <a href="https://diacc.ca/certification-program/trusted-list/">trusted list of DIACC PCTF Certified Providers</a> grows, DIACC also launched its <a href="https://directory.diacc.ca/">Member Services Directory</a>, a directory of services offered by DIACC members, certified providers, and applicants. And, let’s face it, digital verification can be hard to explain, so we’ve launched a growing <a href="https://diacc.ca/digital-trust-stories/">Big Book of Digital Trust Stories</a>. Our Digital Trust Stories explain the mechanics and benefits in simple language to help people and organizations understand the benefits of digital trust and verification.  These are just some of the tools DIACC develops to help ensure legal professionals can access the digital trust tools they need.</p>
  



<p>Addressing Risks in Financial and Legal Transactions</p>



<p>The findings from FINTRAC serve as a call to action. Legal professionals—particularly those involved in high-risk sectors like real estate or corporate structuring—are in a unique position of trust. Digital verification can play a crucial role in mitigating risks by adding layers of security that protect against misuse.</p>



  
<p>By adopting robust digital client verification solutions, legal professionals can:</p>



 
 Mitigate real estate and corporate transaction risks, ensuring transparency around beneficial ownership.<br> 



 Strengthen KYC processes, ensuring that clients are who they claim to be.<br> 



 Safeguard solicitor-client privilege by securing client access to sensitive legal processes. 
 
  



<p>DIACC and the Path Forward</p>



<p>The need to protect our financial integrity has never been more apparent. DIACC’s commitment, mission, and vision align directly with the challenges identified in the FINTRAC bulletin. Our role is to ensure that digital trust and verification tools are practical, accessible, and secure across industries, particularly in high-risk areas like the legal profession.</p>



<p>We are proud to partner with industries, governments, and professionals who share our vision for a future where transparency, security, and trust are central to every transaction.</p>



<p>DIACC is an open and transparent <a href="https://diacc.ca/membership/diacc-members/">community of leaders</a> dedicated to one issue: the responsible adoption of digital trust and verification practices. </p>



<p><a>Contact DIACC</a> to collaborate and build a future where transparency, privacy, security, and trust are at the forefront of every transaction.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>October may bring Halloween, but I’m calling it “Crazy-month” with the whirlwind of activity – whether it’s the lead-up to Christmas or gearing up for the second half of the financial year ending in March. At Digital Identity NZ (DINZ), we’re delivering on the present while planning ahead for an even bigger and better&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata 2025 in August.</a></p>



<p>Thanks to the support of members&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/legal/awsnz/">AWS</a>,<a href="https://www.innovise.co.nz/">&nbsp;Innovise</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://worldline.com/en-nz/home">Worldline</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xero.com/nz/">Xero</a>&nbsp;we’ve submitted our input on the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/09/DINZ_Submission_on_CPD_Bill_Sept_2024_Final-Signed.pdf">Consumer and Product Data bill</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/10/DINZ_Submission_on_CPD_Open_banking_designation_rules_10_Oct_2024_Final-Signed.pdf">open banking designation rules</a>, ensuring our collective industry voices are heard.</p>



<p>It’s immensely satisfying to see the growing recognition of the vital role digital identity plays in eCommerce and secure online transactions across industries and government. DINZ’s involvement at the highest levels is paying off. Earlier this month, DINZ, our NZTech Group colleagues at&nbsp;<a href="https://fintechnz.org.nz/">FinTechNZ</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://fintechnz.org.nz/regtech-nz/">&nbsp;RegTechNZ</a>, along with DINZ members&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hgmlegal.com/">HGM</a>,<a href="https://www.minterellison.co.nz/">&nbsp;MERW</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paymentsnz.co.nz/">PaymentsNZ</a>&nbsp;API Centre, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sushlabs.com/">Sushlabs</a>&nbsp;joined a roundtable with Minister Bayly. This followed our meeting with Minister Collins in August and focussed on fostering innovation in financial services. Workstreams are now underway, and we’ll report back to Minister Bayly in December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the regulatory front, we’ve met with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) to reinforce our&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/08/07/dinz-supports-nztechs-biometrics-concerns/">well publicised views</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/05/DINZ-Submission-Biometrics-Code-Exposure-Draft-May-2024.pdf">proposed biometrics code of practice</a>, with&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2024/10/23/biometrics-update-dinz-and-nec-webinar-in-review/">media also showing interest</a>&nbsp;in our biometrics mahi. Keep an eye out for details of our upcoming ‘Facial recognition in retail’ webinar on Tuesday 26 November, where we will discuss the benefits, ethical considerations, and privacy issues specific to New Zealand.</p>



<p>We’ve also resumed discussions with the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA) to support the implementation of the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF). Raising community and industry awareness is key, which is why we’re pleased to support online educator&nbsp;<a href="https://www.informdi.com/">InformDI</a>&nbsp;and DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/">NEC</a>&nbsp;in offering members free online DISTF learning, which launched this month.

Productive ambiguity opens up space for new interpretations and challenges our assumptions in ways that are&nbsp;useful.</p> 🛝🌳⛲ Example: Park Revitalisation Project <p>Let’s say you’re working on a project to revitalise a local park. The initial assumption might be that only park users and local authorities are the relevant stakeholders. This is the boundary. However, by embracing productive ambiguity, you might ask: “Could nearby schools, local businesses, or community groups influence or benefit from this project in ways we haven’t considered?”</p><p>This open-ended question uncovers a wider boundary than had been included in the initial planning — such as schools using the park for outdoor learning or local businesses benefiting from increased foot traffic. The approach reveals hidden dynamics and helps develop a project that serves a broader and more diverse community.</p><p>Reflecting on boundary judgements isn’t just about defining the limits of a system. Rather, it’s about acknowledging that these limits can obscure important elements. By introducing productive ambiguity into our boundary judgements, we can challenge rigid definitions and explore what might be hidden just beyond&nbsp;them.</p><p>Productive ambiguity encourages us to ask, “What if our assumptions about this boundary are incomplete?” This approach allows us to ‘play’ with the system’s edges, revealing blind spots that a strict boundary might&nbsp;conceal.</p> Understanding Interrelationships Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>In systems thinking, understanding the interrelationships within a system is essential because these connections are complex and often hard to identify.</p><p>Productive ambiguity can help us explore these interrelationships by allowing us to entertain multiple interpretations of how components might interact. This, in turn, leads to insights that wouldn’t have emerged through a linear approach.</p> 🛝🌳⛲ Example: Park Revitalisation Project <p>Returning to our park project, imagine that a local school starts using the park for outdoor activities. Asking open-ended questions helps bring in some productive ambiguity. What kinds of facilities or services might schoolchildren like to have? Let’s say they suggest an ice cream stand. By entertaining this idea, we begin to explore the wider interrelationships: What infrastructure would support this? We might need to consider water supply, electrical outlets, waste management, and accessibility for vendors and customers. As we dig deeper, we start to see how various systems — utilities, transport, local regulations — interconnect with the park in ways that weren’t immediately obvious.</p><p>By ‘playing’ with productive ambiguity, we can imagine alternative scenarios and question established cause-and-effect relationships. This exploration can uncover hidden feedback loops and leverage points — small changes that can have significant impacts.</p><p>For instance, something as simple as adding an ice cream stand might lead to greater foot traffic, which in turn could spark local businesses’ interest in park events or influence how the park is maintained. Productive ambiguity therefore helps us see beyond the obvious and consider connections that might influence the system in unexpected ways.</p> Engaging with Multiple Perspectives Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>Bringing in diverse viewpoints is a crucial aspect of systems thinking, and productive ambiguity serves as a powerful tool for uncovering these perspectives. It opens the door to diverse interpretations, encouraging new perspectives and exposing areas where thinking may have become too&nbsp;narrow.</p> 🛝🌳⛲ Example: Park Revitalisation Project <p>For instance, in the project to revitalise a local park, productive ambiguity could be introduced by presenting different possible uses for the space — such as turning it into a sports facility, a community garden, or a children’s play area — without making a definitive decision upfront. This uncertainty encourages people to imagine how these options might affect their lives or the community, drawing out diverse perspectives. As a result, the project might reveal multiple perspectives which have been overlooked, such as local businesses seeing the park as a venue for markets or under-represented groups desiring a space for cultural events. This approach helps encourage a richer, more inclusive and diverse vision for the park’s&nbsp;future.</p><p>By introducing some ambiguity into these discussions, we encourage others to challenge their assumptions and share insights that might not otherwise come forward. This collective ‘play’ with ideas can uncover areas of the system that need further attention. It also helps us avoid the trap of thinking that any one perspective is the only valid&nbsp;one.</p> Using Feedback&nbsp;Loops Image CC BY-ND <a href="https://visualthinkery.com">Visual Thinkery</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop">WAO</a><p>An essential part of systems thinking involves <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-77eb29d510a4">feedback loops</a>: positive loops tend to reinforce certain behaviours, while negative loops work to maintain balance by counteracting them. Considering these loops alongside productive ambiguity can reveal how uncertainty either helps uncover hidden aspects of the system or, conversely, makes them more difficult to&nbsp;detect.</p> 🛝🌳⛲ Example: Park Revitalisation Project <p>Again, using the park project as an example, the more ideas community members share about the park’s potential, the more excitement builds. This creates a positive feedback loop where new ideas inspire further participation. However, if the discussions remain too vague, some community members may grow frustrated with the lack of direction, creating a negative feedback loop that stalls the project. Here, productive ambiguity ensures that ambiguity leads to curiosity and exploration rather than confusion or paralysis, guiding the feedback loop toward uncovering blind spots rather than reinforcing them.</p><p>By understanding how feedback loops interact with productive ambiguity, we can steer systems toward more insightful outcomes. The key is to maintain just enough uncertainty to encourage exploration without allowing it to drift into confusion. This helps ensure that feedback loops support the uncovering of hidden system dynamics rather than obscuring them.</p> Conclusion <p>By integrating productive ambiguity into systems thinking practices, we enhance our ability to identify and address assumptions being made. Productive ambiguity allows us to ‘play’ with systems — testing boundaries, exploring interrelationships, and engaging with diverse perspectives. This helps reveal hidden elements, uncover predominant perspectives, and gain deeper insights.</p><p>Embracing productive ambiguity doesn’t mean creating unnecessary confusion. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of systems and the value of multiple interpretations. The approach challenges fixed assumptions, encouraging us to develop more flexible, inclusive, and insightful strategies for navigating complex systems. Through productive ambiguity, we move beyond rigid boundaries and engage with the richness that systems — and the people within them — offer.</p><p>Do you need help with this kind of thing? <a href="https://weareopen.coop">Get in touch</a> with&nbsp;WAO!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/finding-unexamined-assumptions-through-systems-thinking-and-ambiguity-17c6e98c670f">Finding Unexamined Assumptions Through Systems Thinking and Ambiguity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) NFT system on Elastos allows users to mint, claim, manage, and redeem ELA-backed <a href="https://esc.elastos.io/address/0x06D49BB1F338420E1d8577829C079DCB4cb5eF25/transactions">ERC721 NFTs</a>, unlocking liquidity for Smart Chain utility whilst supporting the mainchain network’s security. Want to learn more about BPOS NFTs? <a href="https://elastos.info/news/unlocking-ela-introducing-elastos-bpos-nfts/">Learn here!</a> Today, we will walk you through the process of creating and using BPoS NFTs across the Elastos Main Chain and Smart Chain using the <a href="https://elastos.info/essentials-the-super-wallet/">Essentials Wallet.</a></p>
 
 Step 1: Minting a BPoS NFT on the Elastos Main Chain 
<p>1. Enter Your Votes: Start by logging into your Elastos wallet and accessing the staking section on the Elastos Main Chain. Choose how you want to allocate your voting power with the staked ELA. For a guide on BPOS voting, please see here.</p>
<p>2. Initiate the Minting Process: After selecting your votes, confirm the minting transaction to create a BPoS NFT.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Wait for 6 Block Confirmations: The transaction will take some time to be confirmed by the network. You must wait for 6 blocks to be produced by the Elastos Main Chain before proceeding.</p>
<p>4. Switch to Elastos Smart Chain: Once confirmed, move over to the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC) to complete the claim process.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Step 2: Claiming Your BPoS NFT on Elastos Smart Chain 
<p>1. Automatic Check for Claimable NFTs: On the Elastos Smart Chain, Essentials will automatically search for any claimable BPoS NFTs tied to your wallet address. You will receive a notification once a claimable NFT is found.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Manual Check for NFTs: If you don’t receive a notification, you can manually check by going to the NFT claim section in the wallet.</p>
<p>3. Claim the NFT: Click “Claim” to transfer the minted BPoS NFT to your wallet. After the claim is successful, the NFT will appear under the “Collectibles” section of your wallet homepage.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Step 3: Managing Your BPoS NFT 
<p>Once the BPoS NFT is in your wallet, you can perform several actions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Transfer the NFT to Another Wallet:</p>
 
 
 
 Navigate to the BPoS NFT in the “Collectibles” section. 
 Select “Send” and enter the destination address to transfer the NFT. 
 
 
 
<p>2. Destroy the NFT (Convert Back to a Vote):<br>
If you want to stop using the NFT and return to staking directly on the Elastos Main Chain:</p>
 
 
 
 Choose “Destroy” from the options. 
 When destroyed, the BPoS NFT will be converted back into a vote and returned to the Main Chain, where it will regain its original staking status. 
 
 
 
<p>3. Future Utility: Upcoming BPOS NFTs plans include incorporating into Elacity’s marketplace for trading and the BeL2s Arbiter network for collateral, as well as opening opportunities to help secure the network in return for BTC rewards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unlocking Value 
<p>This BPoS NFT system provides users with flexibility, offering the ability to mint NFTs from staked tokens, claim them, and transfer or destroy them as needed. With these NFTs acting as new assets and voting receipts, users can engage with Elastos more dynamically—staking, earning rewards, and participating in governance, all while maintaining liquidity.</p>
<p>By following this guide, you can now confidently navigate the Elastos BPoS NFT ecosystem, unlocking new ways to maximize your staking rewards and explore opportunities within the BeL2 network.

<p>VRM Days always happen the day before <a href="http://iiworkshop.org">IIW</a> starts, twice each year. Usually, we have about 50 registered and 30 showing up. (Some are online, though we’d rather have their bodies in the room.)&nbsp; For the<a href="https://vrmday2024b.eventbrite.com/"> VRM Day this coming Monday</a>, we’re expecting more than 100 people. So, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I91DJZKRxs">Sheriff Brody said in Jaws</a>, we need a bigger room.</p>
<p>And we have one. So that’s good. Logistics will be challenging, but we’re on top of them.</p>
<p>IIW is also close to sold out. Last I checked, there were just nine tickets left.</p>
<p>Here is copy from our Eventbrite page as it now stands:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Main Thing</p>
<p>At this VRM Day, Ben Moskowitz, VP Innovation and Ginny Fahs, Director of Product R&amp;D at&nbsp;<a title="https://www.consumerreports.org/" href="https://www.consumerreports.org/">Consumer Reports</a>&nbsp;will lead discussion of some of their early R&amp;D concepts around a new approach to customer service: one in which personal AI agents represent customers’ best interests.</p>
<p>This is CX (Customer Experience) re-imagined and re-implemented in ways that are no less real and human but far more intelligent, mutually informative, and useful than what all of us have experienced thus far in the Digital Age. CR is looking for feedback and collaboration as they move forward. They plan to participate in IIW as well.</p>
<p>As usual, everyone who wants to share what they’re working on in the VRM space will have time to present, discuss, and prep for IIW.</p>
<p>Schedule</p>
<p>Morning:</p>
 
 9am – Noon. Consumer Reports presentation and discussion (on the above) 
 
<p>Lunch</p>
 
 Noon – 1:30 (Sports Page or Zareen’s (diagonal across the intersection) 
 
<p>Afternoon</p>
 
 Adrian Gropper on HIE of One, Medical AI Assistant (MAIA) and personal AI in health care 
 Joe Andrieu on the Digital Fiduciary Initiative 
 Cryptid / KwaaiNet demo 
 Iain Henderson on Data Pal 
 Richard Whitt on GliaNet Alliance 
 Customer Commons on IEEE P7012 
 Paul Trevithick (Mee.Foundation) on Private Advertising 
 
</blockquote>
 
 
<blockquote><p>Discussion on any or all of the above</p></blockquote>
 
 
<blockquote><p>Listing planned IIW sessions</p></blockquote>
 
 
<p>Subject to change, of course.</p>
<p>Since we have a lot to cover, please be there at 9am sharp, and be back from lunch at 1:30.</p>
<p>Note that there are only three lunch places nearby. Cucina Venti is good but relatively expensive and service is slow. Sports Page is makes good sandwiches and has lots of picnic tables. It’s where most of us usually go. Haven’t tried Zareen’s, behind the Sports Page, where Sunny Bowl and other restaurants used to be. It has “familiar &amp; innovative halal spins on Indian &amp; Pakistani cooking.”</p>

		<p>The U.S. Department of Justice’s final rule on Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has significant implications for public universities and community colleges regarding web content and mobile app accessibility. Finalized in April 2024 and effective from June 2024, the rule adopts Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA as the new standard for digital accessibility. This means that covered entities must ensure their digital platforms, including websites and mobile apps, comply with specific requirements for captioning and audio descriptions.</p>
<p>The compliance deadlines are set for 2026 and 2027, depending on the local government population size. While there are limited exceptions for archived web content and preexisting social media posts, password-protected content must also meet these standards. All state and local government entities across the United States and their third-party contractors and software vendors must comply.

		<p>Overall, the new rule represents a significant step towards improving digital accessibility in higher education, requiring institutions to take proactive measures to accommodate all users, including those with disabilities. While this sounds daunting, the key to success with these updated guidelines are early preparation and clear understanding of them and what they mean.</p>
	 
 




			  
		 
	  

	 
		 
			 
				
			  
		 
	  
  
		       
	 
		 
			 
				
 
	 
		<p>Working with an experienced partner like Edge to facilitate the transition to full compliance is key. Edge can help you take swift action to meet these new requirements. Compliance not only mitigates legal risks but also positions institutions as leaders in inclusive digital services. The potential return on investment in accessibility beyond legal compliance is astronomical, serving a broader audience and enhancing overall user experience for all your students, current and potential.</p>

<p>Staking cryptocurrency assets typically means locking them away for months, leaving users unable to take advantage of new opportunities—a common frustration in the crypto space. But what if the Elastos ecosystem allowed users to unlock staked Mainchain ELA without unstaking? With Elastos BPoS NFTs, users can convert their staked assets and APY rewards into NFT receipts on the Elastos Sidechain’s (ESC) open market.</p>
<p>The Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) NFT system offers a novel solution by combining Bitcoin-backed ELA staking security, ELA APY rewards, and tokenized liquidity through ERC-721 standard NFTs. This system allows users to stake ELA with validators and mint BPoS NFTs, representing their staked assets and accruing Mainchain rewards. These NFTs can be traded, collateralized, or transferred using Smart Contracts. Let’s explore how BPoS NFTs work, the Elastos consensus model, and the essential role these NFTs will play in the upcoming BeL2 Arbiter network.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding Elastos’ Dual Consensus Model 
<p>Elastos operates using a multi-layered consensus called <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastic-consensus-technical-overview/">Elastic Consensus</a>, combining Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW) with Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS) to secure the network and provide utility.</p>
 1. Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW): Bitcoin-Backed Security 
 
 Bitcoin’s Security: AuxPoW leverages Bitcoin’s mining infrastructure, allowing Bitcoin miners to secure both Bitcoin and Elastos simultaneously without extra energy costs. 
 293.69 EH/s of Bitcoin’s total 580.74 EH/s hash rate reinforces Elastos, giving it nearly 50% of Bitcoin’s security. 
 Benefits of AuxPoW:
 
 Energy Efficiency: Elastos inherits Bitcoin’s security without additional energy consumption. 
 Network-Wide Trust: This shared security protects the Elastos Mainchain and sidechains, making the entire ecosystem highly reliable. 
 
 
 
 2. Bonded Proof of Stake (BPoS): Securing the Network with Validators 
 
 Long-Term Staking: Users lock ELA on the Mainchain to secure the network and validate transactions. 
 Incentivizing Participation: <a href="https://elastos.info/news/elastos-ela-bitcoin-merge-mining-economic-model/">Users earn 2-3% APR</a>, with higher rewards for longer lock periods. Validators must hold 80,000 staking rights to participate in block validation, sharing rewards with stakers. 
 
<p>This hybrid consensus model ensures that Elastos is anchored in Bitcoin’s security, while BPoS validators provide a second layer of decentralized governance and stability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Elastos BPoS NFTs Unlock the Value of Staked ELA 
<p>Traditional staking locks assets, limiting liquidity. BPoS NFTs solve this problem for Elastos and by converting its mainchain voting rights into ERC-721 standard NFTs that represent the ownership to claim the underlying staked ELA and its accumulating rewards.</p>
 How BPoS NFTs Work 
 
 Staking and Minting:
 
 Users stake ELA tokens on the Mainchain using the Essentials Wallet. 
 Once staked, they can mint BPoS NFTs on the Elastos Smart Chain (ESC). 
 The NFT represents both the staked ELA and the accumulating APY rewards. 
 
 
 Trading and Transfer:
 
 BPoS NFTs can be freely traded or transferred on the Elastos Smart Chain. 
 This allows users to unlock liquidity without ending their staking position or interrupting rewards. 
 
 
 Burning and Claiming Rewards:
 
 NFT holders can burn NFTs anytime to claim APY rewards. 
 The staked ELA remains locked until the lock period ends, at which point it can be withdrawn by the original staker. 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 BeL2 Arbiter Network: Unlocking New Financial Applications 
<p>In the upcoming <a href="http://Bel2.org">BeL2</a> arbiter network, BPoS NFTs will act as collateral for BTC-based loans, stablecoin issuance, and dispute resolution services. Arbiter nodes using these NFTs as collateral will earn BTC-based and dApp rewards, in addition to Mainchain ELA rewards.</p>
<p>This decentralized financial infrastructure will allow users to participate in Bitcoin-native dApps without moving BTC off the mainnet, creating an easy integration between Bitcoin security and BeL2 DeFi applications, such as the upcoming Harvard student-led teams “<a href="https://elastos.info/announcement/launch-new-bretton-woods-project-harvard-bitcoin-stablecoin/">New Bretton Woods (NBW)</a>” project, incubated by the Harvard Innovation Labs.</p>
 Collateralization in the BeL2 Arbiter Network 
 
 Arbiter Entry: Users can stake ELA BPoS NFTs as collateral to participate as nodes in the BeL2 network. 
 Earn BTC and dApp Rewards: BPoS NFT arbiter nodes earn percentage-based BTC and dApp rewards, alongside Mainchain ELA staking rewards, for supporting time-based transactions and dispute resolution services that reflect the value of their collateral. 
 Decentralized Financial Services: The BeL2 arbiter network supports Native BTC services, ensuring decentralized loans are completed, maintaining stablecoin pegs, liquidating assets based on market conditions, and providing dispute resolution services, offering a secure, decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 So What are the Key Advantages of Elastos BPoS NFTs? 
 
 Flexible Liquidity: Trade or transfer staked assets and their rewards as NFT receipts without waiting for the lock period to end. 
 Bitcoin-Backed Security: 293.69 EH/s of Bitcoin’s hash rate secures the Elastos Mainchain, providing trust and reliability. 
 New Financial Tools: Use BPoS NFTs as collateral for loans and arbitration services in the upcoming BeL2 network. 
 Simple Wallet Management: Manage NFTs through the non-custodial <a href="https://elastos.info/essentials-the-super-wallet/">Essentials Wallet</a>, ensuring full control over staked assets. 
 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>The Elastos BPoS NFT system offers a groundbreaking solution by combining Bitcoin’s security with NFT liquidity. Users can mint, trade, or burn NFTs anytime, claiming APY rewards without interrupting their staking period. The ability to unlock staked ELA after the lock period ensures long-term rewards while maintaining flexibility.</p>
<p>With the upcoming BeL2 Arbiter Network, BPoS NFTs will serve as collateral for BTC-based loans and dispute resolution services, creating new earning opportunities. This innovative design reflects Elastos’ commitment to decentralization, offering secure and scalable financial tools for the future of blockchain-based finance.</p>
<p>With ELA’s fixed supply of 28.22 million, Bitcoin merge-mining security, and a 4-year halving cycle, participants benefit from both scarcity and sustainability. The Elastos BPoS NFT system sets a new standard for DeFi innovation by offering liquidity, security, and long-term value for users.</p>

<p>A subgroup of OpenID Foundation board members and key staff have been working to update the “OpenID Process” document based on issues raised by some board members to ensure the document aligns with how the Foundation currently works. This update addresses those original issues and also identified a significant number of mainly editorial issues and improvements that were possible. It also highlighted inconsistencies and&nbsp;other issues that required coordinating revisions&nbsp;with the “Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy,” so that has been added to the scope and improvements proposed. Full details including material changes made can be <a href="https://openid.net/proposed-revisions-oid-process-doc-and-ipr-policy/">referenced here</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The changes were unanimously approved&nbsp;by the board at the September 12, 2024 board meeting. Approving these changes also required a 21-day review and 14-day vote of the membership with a 30% quorum requirement.</p>
 
 
<p>I am pleased to announce that the update Process Document and IPR Policy were approved by the membership this past Saturday, October 19, 2024 with 34% member participation, greater than the 30% quorum requirement for the vote.</p>
 
 
<p>The voting results were:</p>
 
<p>Approve – 106 votes</p>
<p>Object – 1 vote</p>
 
<p>Abstain – 21 votes</p>

<p>Digital Identity NZ (DINZ), through its Policy and Regulatory Subcommittee, has provided feedback to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) for the proposed open banking regulations and standards under the Customer and Product Data Bill. This collaborative submission reflects insights from DINZ members across New Zealand’s digital identity sector, representing both large and small organisations.</p>



<p>DINZ fully supports the Bill’s goal to unlock the value of customer data, fostering competition and innovation. However, our submission highlights specific areas where the proposed rules could be enhanced to better achieve these objectives.</p>



<p>Empowering Customers through Open Banking</p>



<p>DINZ appreciates the Bill’s focus on giving customers control over their data, which can drive a more competitive and dynamic marketplace. However, we raised concerns around the prioritisation of the banking and electricity sectors, believing that a broader scope of competitive third-party providers is essential for success. Additionally, affordability is crucial, as the cost of third-party services could hinder widespread adoption.</p>



<p>Data Security and Privacy</p>



<p>Maintaining data security is a key focus for DINZ. While the Bill requires transparency from data holders and accredited requesters, we recommend aligning with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 to safeguard consumers’ data without unnecessarily disclosing sensitive information. This ensures robust protection and trust.</p>



<p>Learning from Australia’s Open Banking Journey</p>



<p>Reflecting on Australia’s slow uptake of open banking, DINZ cautions against over-reliance on the Digital Identity Services Trust Framework (DISTF) as a singular solution. A more holistic approach is needed to address identity, verification, and consent challenges in the context of open banking. Colin Wallis, Executive Director of Digital Identity NZ says:</p>



<p>“DINZ supports the general direction indicated in the discussion paper, however it considers that not enough attention is being directed to the reasons behind the slow take-up in Australia. Additionally unintended consequences may arise from its seemingly over reliance on the DISTF as the magic bullet to resolve all the digital identity, verification, attribute exchange and consent – as much as we would all like that.”</p>



<p>DINZ is committed to working with MBIE to ensure a secure, efficient, and inclusive open banking framework that benefits all Kiwis.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance is aware of passkey lock-in, and it’s actively working to address that:</p>



<p>With all relevant operating systems now natively supporting <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, companies have been increasingly adopting them as an alternative to passwords. Relying on passkeys minimizes the risk of getting hacked, as users don’t have access to their cryptographic keys, and intercepting them is significantly more challenging. However, those switching between different service providers may prefer traditional passwords, as there’s currently no easy way to import or export passkeys. To minimize the friction separating distinct platforms, the FIDO Alliance is working on a solution that makes moving passkeys between them a breeze.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance has&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">published</a>&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/say-goodbye-to-passkey-lock-in-fidos-new-specs-enable-secure-transfers/">Neowin</a>) a working draft encompassing specifications that would make moving passkeys between providers possible. When implemented, users would be able to securely import and export their passkeys, making switching platforms less challenging. Read more of the article.</p>

<p>Digital communities are collections of individual entities that are connected together. They can be modeled as graphs, with the individuals being nodes and their relationships being edges.</p>

<p>Traditionally, identity models have focused on the nodes, but in <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-1/">Musings of a Trust Architect: Edge Identifiers &amp; Cliques</a>, I suggested that both private keys and public-key identifiers could be based on the relational edges, and that when you combined a complete set of edges you could create a cryptographic clique, where the group was seen as an entity of its own, with the identities of any participants hidden through the use of a Schnorr-based signature.</p>

<p>My first look at cliques focused on the technical definition, which requires that cliques be “closed”, meaning that there’s a relationship between every pair in the group and that those pairwise edges form the clique identity among them.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>However, creating closed graphs becomes increasingly difficult as the graph size grows. There are some alternatives which I discuss here: open cliques and fuzzy cliques. The entities forming a clique also don’t have to be people, as I discuss in cliques of devices.</p>

 Open Cliques 

<p>Cryptographic cliques don’t have to be fully closed. Open cliques are also possible. (In graph theory these technically are not called “cliques”, but I’m going to continue to use the term for cryptographic identifiers that are based on edges.)</p>

<p>While the concept of a fully connected clique provides clear value in graph theory, such structures can become computationally intensive, especially as the group size increases. Open cryptographic cliques, which are not completely interconnected, may then be used instead.</p>

<p>Open cliques support different sorts of modeling, for groups where not everyone is connected and where the relationships are fluid. They also allow for easier growth: a clique can organically add a new member when a single participant creates a relationship with them, without the need to define the new member’s relationship to everyone in the clique (especially as most of those relationships would not exist).</p>

<p>For example, Bob might not actually have a close or independent relationship with his mother-in-law, Anna, while Mary’s best friend from college, Beth, might join the clique when she stays with the family, despite the fact that she only has a real relationship with Mary. (However, more relationships, and thus edges, might develop over time!)</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>While open cliques may lack the complete interconnectedness of their closed counterparts, they offer a realistic representation of the evolving nature of dynamic social relationships.  One of the main questions regarding them is when and how to recognize new edges as an open clique evolves, and thus when and how to rotate the clique’s overall keys.</p>

 Fuzzy Cliques 

<p>As discussed in the appendix to this article, there are currently two major Schnorr-based MPC signature systems that could be used as the foundation of cliques: FROST and MuSig2. Each comes with its own advantages and limitations, but one of the advantages of using FROST is that it allows for the creation of fuzzy cliques, thanks to its ability to create threshold signatures (with <code>m of n</code> agreement required to sign where <code>m≤n</code>).</p>

<p>This allows group decisions or representations to be based on a subset (threshold) of members rather than requiring unanimity, as would be required when using MuSig2 in its native form. Using thresholds to define group interactions adds a degree of “fuzziness” or flexibility to the representation of those groups and their actions, at the price of higher latency and the fact that the theoretical implications are not as well studied.</p>

<p>There’s one other catch: fuzzy cliques are the one situation where the Relationship Signature Paradigm can’t be used. Though we still create the relational edges, to allow any pair of participants in the clique to make joint decisions, the clique keys are created by the individual participants, not the edges, ensuring that we have thresholds of participants making decisions, not thresholds of edges (which would quickly become confusing!).</p>

<p>Even for a triadic clique, the privacy implications of using a threshold key to represent the clique are notable.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>Imagine that the participants generated two FROST keys for the triadic clique, one that had a 2-of-3 threshold and one that had a 3-of-3 threshold. If every one agreed, they could all sign with their share fragments of the 3-of-3 private key, and anyone could compare it to the 3-of-3 public key and know that the group was in perfect consensus.</p>

<p>But what if you only required the consensus of two members of the group? After all, Joshua probably won’t be making a lot of decisions for a while. Theoretically, you could just sign with one of your relational edge keys, such as the Mary-Bob relational edge key. That demonstrates the consensus of two members of the clique and supports accountability: you know which two participants signed.</p>

<p>But, if you instead sign with the 2-of-3 threshold key for the clique you get to take advantage of the aggregatability that’s baked into Schnorr. With it, no one knows which two people signed (or indeed, if two or three people signed). They just know that at least the threshold of people within the group signed. It’s a powerful privacy enhancement that really shows off the power of fuzzy cliques.</p>

<p>Fuzzy cliques allow for real-world decision-making dynamics, where different sorts of decisions might require a single person’s agreement, a majority’s agreement, a super-majority’s agreement, and everyone’s agreement. This creates a model for fully decentralized decision-making that’s resilient and fault tolerant, all while supporting both individual privacy and group accountability (which still allowing for individual accountability using relational edges).</p>

 Cliques of Devices 

<p>Thus far, I’ve largely presumed that relational edges and cryptographic cliques are created by people. But, that doesn’t have to be the case: independent nodes in a graph can be entities of any type, including devices.</p>

<p>In my first article, I touched upon the idea that a clique could define not just a group, but also a singular person’s identity. This could be done using devices. Imagine that a person has a few devices that together form the basis of his digital identity: a hub of information that contains his credentials; a biometric ring that verifies his physical identity, primarily to unlock that hub; and a coordinator that allows a clique-identity to communication with the network. The following diagram shows how our old friend Bob could be defined as an open clique including devices:</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>Using the clique-of-cliques model, this then might be the identity that’s linked in with Mary and Joshua to form their triadic nuclear-family clique:</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>Though these examples suggest a clique where devices and real people are mixed together, that’s not the only option. Another example might be a fuzzy clique made up of three automated factcheckers, which are all devices. Together, any two can issue a finding of “TRUE” or “FALSE”:</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>Again using the clique-of-cliques model, these fact checkers could then interact with other identities, such as Dan and Ty, who write together.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>The Fact Checkers interact with the authors’ edge relationship (known by their joint pseudonym, “James”), to sign off on the validity of their work. Thanks to the aggregatability of Schnorr signatures, no one knows (or cares) that the Fact Checkers are three devices or the authors are two people!</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Cliques offer a powerful new model for identity control (and more generally, for control of many sorts of digital assets). But, using closed cliques has drawbacks.</p>

<p>Two other models offer different utility:</p>

 
   Open Cliques allow for the modeling of more realistic social situations while simultaneously reducing compuational costs, but create new questions for theoretical understanding and in figuring how to maintain public and private keys for the clique. 
   Fuzzy Cliques open up the possibilities for authorizations, agreements, and other decisions to be made by portions of a group rather than the group as whole, but they depend on either FROST or some other (theoretical) threshold signature system, and they disallow the creation of a clique using relational edges. 
 

<p>In addition, cliques don’t have to be made up only of people:</p>

 
   Cliques of Devices show how cliques could also include AIs, oracles, fact checkers, hardware wallets, biometric rings, and other computerized programs, and that they could interact either as parts of cliques or as separate entities! 
 

<p>These possibilities are just the beginning. I think that edge identifiers and cliques could be a powerful new tool for expanding the design of identies online.</p>

<p>How could you use them? How would you expand them? What would you like to see next?</p>

 Appendix: FROST &amp; MuSig 

<p>There are currently two major Schnorr-based signature systems, FROST and MuSig2, both of which support Multi-Party Computation (MPC) signing.</p>

<p>FROST is a Schnorr-based multisig system that originated in a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">2020 paper</a>. As of 2024, it’s just coming into wide use thanks to projects such as <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/frost.html">ZF FROST</a> and wallets such as <a href="https://stackwallet.com/">Stack Wallet</a>.</p>
 
   🟢 Possible efficiency improvements for larger cliques. 
   🟢 Supports thresholds (m of n).
     
       🟢 Privacy for thresholds. 
       🛑 Limited accountability for thresholds. 
       🛑 Can’t build clique from edges if using thresholds. 
     
   
   🛑 More rounds for signing. 
   🟨 Allows Distributed Key Generation or Trusted Dealer Generation. 
 

<p>MuSig2 is a Schnorr-based multisig system that dates back to 2020 (when MuSig2 was introduced) and before that 2018 (when MuSig1 was introduced). It’s been well-studied and is detailed in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0328.mediawiki">BIP 328</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0390.mediawiki">BIP 390</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0373.mediawiki">BIP 373</a>, providing strong integration with Bitcoin, especially since its recent <a href="https://x.com/n1ckler/status/1843311745860849940">merge into libsecp256k1</a>.</p>
 
   🛑 No thresholds (n of n).
     
       🟨 But can mimic thresholds with Taproot trees 
     
   
   🟢 Full accountability for signatures. 
   🟢 Fewer rounds for signing. 
   🟢 Can always build clique from edges. 
 

<p>Two of the features of Schnorr-based signature systems that best support edge identifiers and cryptographic cliques are aggregation and MPC.</p>

 
   Aggregation. Schnorr signatures are aggregatable. They’re mathematically added together, producing a final multisig that’s the same size as an individual signature would be. As a result, signatures are indistiguishable: you don’t know how many people signed or who signed, simply that a signature is valid (or not). 
   MPC. Multi Party Computation means that each participant has a secret (here, a key share), which they can use together without revealing that secret. It’s what allows individuals to jointly create an edge-identifier key and then for edges to jointly create a clique key.

 Mike Leszcz, OpenID Foundation Operations Director 
<p>This was a hybrid event with some CMF and ecosystem members participating in person in Santiago. OIDF was very fortunate to have founding member and long-time board member, John Bradley with Yubico, representing OIDF in person. The goal of the workshop was to introduce OIDF and OpenID specifications with a focus on FAPI 2.0 to the ecosystem as Chile will require FAPI 2.0 when the Chilean Open Finance System goes live.</p>
<p></p>
 OIDF Standards Overview 
<p>Victor Andrade, Senior Analyst with the CMF, opened the workshop welcoming approximately 190 participants. Gail Hodges, OIDF Executive Director, kicked off the agenda with a brief introduction to OIDF including how the Foundation operates including with other ecosystems and then highlighted how to get involved.</p>
<p>Mark Haine, OIDF Technical Director, presented an overview of current OpenID specifications including recommendations for new vs. existing ecosystems. This introduced a deeper dive into <a href="https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-security-profile.html">FAPI 2.0</a>, delivered by Domingos Creado who represents OIDF certification team and is a valued FAPI Contributor. Domingos discussed key technical details from FAPI 2.0, including how it builds on <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0.html">FAPI 1.0</a> and is intended to be easier to implement. Domingos also confirmed that FAPI 2.0 is on track to be a Final Specification by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>At the request of the CMF, the workshop also included a high-level overview of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals Framework (SSF)</a> specification that improves API efficiency and security by providing privacy-protected, secure webhooks. It is in use by some of the largest cloud services to communicate security alerts and status changes of users, continuously and securely to prevent and mitigate security breaches. It is currently leveraged by two applications – the Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol (CAEP) and Risk Incident Sharing and Coordination (RISC) to achieve this result. Shared Signals WG co-chairs, Atul Tulshibagwale, CTO at SGNL, and Sean O’Dell, Senior Staff Security Engineer at Disney, provided this overview and addressed SSF questions.</p>
<p>Joseph Heenan, OIDF Specifications Specialist and Certification Director as well as a FAPI 2.0 Editor, provided an overview of the <a href="https://openid.net/how-to-certify-your-implementation/">OpenID Certification Program</a>. This included the value of certification including how ecosystems that mandate FAPI and FAPI certification are achieving high security within their ecosystems as well as enabling interoperability. He noted that FAPI 2.0 conformance tests and certifications are currently available with a number of OP and RP certifications from the <a href="https://connectid.com.au">ConnectID</a> private ecosystem in Australia. Joseph highlighted a number of other conformance test suites for other OpenID specifications are currently in development and will be made available for certifications once in production.</p>
 Ecosystem Engagement 
<p>The workshop then turned to ecosystem engagement, facilitated by OIDF Operations Director, Mike Leszcz. Mike spoke about the ecosystems that OIDF has partnered with in recommending or mandating FAPI adoption and FAPI certifications. He noted that OIDF is also supporting some ecosystems that are in the process of going live with their open finance/open data ecosystems.<br><br>This overview introduced the strong partnership that OIDF has had with <a href="https://openfinancebrasil.org.br">Open Finance Brazil</a> (OFB) the last several years as OFB mandates FAPI adoption and certifications with annual recertifications required. We were privileged to have Elcio Calefi, CIO at OFB and OIF board member present, “Technology in Finance – Innovation, Security and Inclusion”, highlighting OFB’s journey from including FAPI into the Brazilian open finance regulation and then operationalizing the mandate for FAPI adoption and certification.<br><br></p>
 Questions Answered 
<p></p>
<p>After a lunch break, OIDF presenters and workshop participants reconvened for a Q&amp;A session that addressed hot topic such as the lifecycle of the standards, the use of mTLS, the implementation of refresh tokens, the practical aspects of changing the scope of authorizations or grants, among others. Other topics during this session included:</p>
 
 Certification costs and OIDF’s recommendations regarding the implementation of certification processes. 
 Adaptations to the applicable profile(s) for Chile and OIDF’s position on possible deviations that a local implementation may have from the plain vanilla standard. 
 OIDF recommendations regarding the use of RAR / PAR, especially in replay attack threat scenarios. 
 Questions on DCR single profile. 
 Inclusion of data finality principles and their relationship to the FAPI standard. 
 Questions on how OIDF has approached to embedded finance for FAPI compliance, in particular where authorizations come from or are managed by third parties. 
 
<p>John Bradley, representing OIDF and an author on a number of the specifications being discussed, took the lead on many of the topics during the Q&amp;A session with support from the workshop presenters. The Q&amp;A session allowed additional time for the Chilean Open Finance System participants to dive deeper into the workshop topics.<br><br>OIDF thanks our colleagues at the CMF for their support and coordination of these two important events in support of the Chilean Open Finance System.<br><br>Links to the session recordings and workshop deck can be found on the OpenID Foundation’s <a href="https://openid.net/presentations-media/">Presentations and Media page</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been around two years since&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>&nbsp;came onto the scene, and the technology has come a long way in making the world a passwordless place.

<p>FIDO Alliance Working on Making Passkeys Portable Across Platforms:</p>



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are an industry standard developed by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium, and were integrated into Apple’s ecosystem with iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, and macOS Ventura. They offer a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional passwords, allowing users to sign in to apps and websites in the same way they unlock their devices: With a fingerprint, a face scan, or a passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.</p>



<p>The draft specifications, called <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF)</a>, will standardize the secure transfer of credentials across different providers. This addresses a current limitation where passkeys are often tied to specific ecosystems or password managers.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is delighted to announce the formation of the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ipsie/">Interoperability Profiling for Secure Identity in the Enterprise (IPSIE) Working Group</a>. This WG aims to tackle key challenges that underlie identity security in today’s enterprise environments.&nbsp;</p>
 The Core Challenge 
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) within the enterprise is a multifaceted endeavor, as indicated by the growing <a href="https://idpro.org/body-of-knowledge/">Body of Knowledge</a> maintained by <a href="https://idpro.org">IDPro</a>. There is a broad range of specifications that are relevant to securing the many IAM functions that underpin operations. Some of these are OIDF standards – like <a href="https://openid.net/wg/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI</a>, and <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals</a> – while others are maintained in different standards bodies. For example, IPSIE has already identified the IETF’s <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/about/">OAuth 2.0</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scim/about/">System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM)</a> as relevant to their initial scope (below). But these specifications are written to support many contexts and use cases; they contain optionality that reduces the likelihood that independent implementations will interoperate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IPSIE Working Group will develop secure-by-design profiles of these existing specifications with a primary goal of achieving interoperability across enterprise implementations.</p>
 Getting Involved 
<p>According to its <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ipsie/ipsie-charter/">Charter</a>, the IPSIE WG will initially focus on standards that support:</p>
 
 Single Sign-On 
 User Lifecycle Management 
 Entitlements 
 Risk Signal Sharing 
 Logout 
 Token Revocation. 
 
<p>As of this publication, the WG is meeting weekly on Tuesdays, though Contributors should always check the <a href="https://openid.net/calendar/">OpenID Calendar</a> for any updates to the schedule. To stay up-to-date with the latest news, please join the <a href="https://lists.openid.net/mailman/listinfo/openid-specs-ipsie?_ga=2.256913483.1116458844.1728995926-1651822361.1725045986">IPSIE mailing list</a>.</p>

Today, the OpenID Foundation’s standards are the connective tissue to enable people to assert their identity and access their data at scale, the scale of the internet, enabling “networks of networks” to interoperate globally. Individuals, companies, governments and non-profits are encouraged to join or participate.

<p>J.R. Rao of IBM and Akila Srinivasan of Anthropic Elected to the OASIS Open Project's TSC Leadership</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 15 October 2024 – The <a href="https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/">Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI)</a>, an OASIS Open Project, announced the formation of its <a href="https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/TECHNICAL-STEERING-COMMITTEE.md">Technical Steering Committee (TSC)</a>, which is responsible for the overall technical health and direction of the project. The TSC will advise the Project Governing Board (PGB), oversee releases, and manage the efforts of the project’s three initial workstreams along with their respective chairs, contributors, and maintainers. The TSC will promote initiatives that align with CoSAI’s mission to promote secure-by-design AI systems.</p>



<p>J.R. Rao from IBM and Akila Srinivasan from Anthropic have been elected co-chairs of the TSC. They will play a central role in steering the direction of the workstreams to ensure that they contribute to the overall goals of CoSAI. J.R. and Akila bring a wealth of experience and leadership from their respective organizations and will be instrumental in driving CoSAI’s technical direction.</p>



<p>“Securing AI, openly and collaboratively, will be critical for inspiring trust and enabling its acceptance by consumers and enterprises alike. As TSC co-chair, I am committed to guiding CoSAI’s three workstreams to establish best practices and frameworks that enhance the security of AI systems,” said J.R. Rao, TSC co-chair, of IBM.</p>



<p>“As co-chair of the CoSAI TSC, I’m committed to developing frameworks and controls that help us attest to the trustworthiness and integrity of AI models,” said Akila Srinivasan of Anthropic. “By fostering transparency and control, we empower organizations to build secure and responsible AI systems that protect users and pave the way for a safe and innovative future.”</p>



<p>The TSC has launched <a href="https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/WORKSTREAMS.md">three workstreams</a> aimed at advancing the security of AI systems and will oversee their efforts to establish best practices, governance, and frameworks for AI security:</p>



 
 Software Supply Chain Security for AI Systems: <br>This workstream focuses on enhancing AI security by addressing the challenges of third-party model risks, provenance, and AI application security. It builds upon widely recognized security frameworks like the SSDF and SLSA, extending them for AI development. 
 



 
 Preparing Defenders for a Changing Cybersecurity Landscape: <br>Designed to equip defenders with a comprehensive framework, this workstream will focus on identifying necessary security investments to counter emerging AI-driven offensive capabilities. 
 



 
 AI Risk Governance: <br>This workstream will develop a comprehensive risk and controls taxonomy, checklist, and scorecard for assessing, managing, and monitoring the security of AI systems across industries. 
 



<p>The governance structure for these workstreams ensures community collaboration, transparency, and alignment with CoSAI’s long-term goals. For more details on the governance model, visit the <a href="https://github.com/cosai-oasis/oasis-open-project/blob/main/TSC-WS-GOVERNANCE.md">TSC and Workstream Governance</a> documentation in GitHub.</p>

<p>Every click, share, and like adds value to others. Every online interaction you make generates valuable data that fuels advertising, shapes consumer insights, and drives the growth of tech giants. Yet, despite being constant producers of digital capital, most of us are neither recognised nor compensated for our contributions. Your online activities are not trivial—they are digital assets with significant value. Content is king, and distribution is queen. Digital empowerment means controlling both. You are the creator; you must own and profit directly from the value you generate online. Let’s dive in.</p>
<p>Traditionally, human labor has been viewed as a liability—a cost to be minimised. As automation increasingly replaces routine jobs, many people will feel displaced. Companies, understandably, seek greater productivity to stay competitive, favoring machines that don’t require salaries or breaks. So, where do humans fit in the future? We must shift from seeing ourselves as physical liabilities to recognising that we are digital assets in the online world. To achieve this, we need to capture the value that is our birthright.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Silicon Valley would be nothing without your data. Machines lack the creativity, empathy, and originality that are inherently human—AI even trains on these traits, but where is the value back? Authenticity is your strength. Recognise your unique human value. You can thrive where machines cannot by turning your talents into digital assets. Technology is a tool that empowers you, while you remain the creator—shaping a digital future where your strengths and individuality truly thrive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Distribution, at its core, is the process of delivering goods from owners to consumers. Traditionally online, this has been facilitated by third-party servers and platforms that act as intermediaries between you and your audience. We connect to external servers because they provide the infrastructure and reach needed to share our content and thoughts widely. However, this reliance often comes with&nbsp;dependence, loss of control, and unfair revenue sharing, as these intermediaries may impose strict terms and conditions and dictate how and where your data is shared.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.ela.city/">Elacity</a>, built on the <a href="https://elastos.info/">Elastos SmartWeb</a>, offers a global marketplace for selling, leasing, and sharing content. Smart contracts—self-executing blockchain agreements—automate digital rights management, access control, and royalty payments. Content is encrypted using decentralized identities, with licensing terms embedded as tokenized rights for trading. Every time your content is sold, smart contracts enforce your terms, ensuring access for the buyer and immediate payments. Let automation work for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let’s imagine owning fractional rights to an AI model, where every subscription instantly pays you. Picture buying a song directly from your favourite artist or renting a movie through a global marketplace. Envision robotics-as-a-service: self-driving cars, 3D printing, healthcare support, and smart locks—all leased directly from owners, with instant access and payments for everyone involved. This is digital participation.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Shifting focus from smart contracts for rights management to data distribution. The encrypted data you own still needs to be stored and managed. Imagine building your own distribution hub—storing data locally while making it available globally, streaming directly from your home. You can create and control communities, with access, security, and payments enforced by smart contracts on your blockchain. This is 100% independent, decentralised distribution—where you own both the content and the distribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By hosting a NAS-like station at home, connected to the Elastos SmartWeb network, you can store, process, communicate, and stream your content globally as an independent “Channel” on a decentralised, interconnected network. Instead of relying on third-party cloud servers, you distribute your content directly from your own property, whether as an individual or an organisation. Blockchain technology ensures that access, decryption, and playback rights are validated first, guaranteeing ownership and security. Alternatively, you can monetise your resources by renting out available storage space and computational power to others, creating a service where everyone can support the network.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine millions of nodes cross-communicating, each owning their narratives, building authentic followers, and, for the first time, truly owning their digital selves. With Elacity on Elastos, smart contracts govern access and payments for your encrypted digital assets, creating a fully decentralised and automated system for security, privacy, and monetisation. This ensures that rights are honored and payments are fulfilled. Royalties are on autopilot, distributed instantly to all stakeholders across millions of smart contracts each time anyone globally interacts to purchase access rights for diverse assets and channels. This is the Elastos SmartWeb: a new internet layer—more open, secure, and user-centric.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Distribution hubs or “Channels” can be public, privately owned by groups, or managed individually. You have the freedom to collaborate with others to expand your reach. Whether you join community hubs with shared profits and collective decision-making or operate your own hub, you set the rules and create specialised environments. This approach fosters a sense of community and shared success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By offering decentralised rights management and distribution, Elastos allows you to focus on what you do best—creating. You can own, distribute, and trade your digital assets, directly influencing the broader economy. Elastos sets the stage for the future of distribution, while Elacity launches the SmartWeb party, turning your online presence into real value and empowering you to control your economic destiny.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We must advocate for fair and inclusive digital policies, setting a new standard for transparency, inclusivity, and opportunity in the digital economy. Everyone should benefit from their contributions and recognise the shifting landscape of automation. Elastos stands for pure integrity, while Elacity sets new standards for fairness, ensuring your voice matters in the evolving digital world. Own your rights. Control your distribution. Now is the time to transition from being undervalued to becoming an empowered digital asset owner, with the freedom to reach a global audience on your terms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Own. Distribute. Prosper. Join Elacity today. Embrace direct distribution, automate your rights management, and unlock your full potential in the digital economy. Take back control of your digital life. <a href="http://elastos.info">Explore Elastos</a> and <a href="http://ela.city">Elacity</a> today, and become part of the movement to restore the internet to its rightful owners—you.

 Gordian Envelope 

<p>Gordian Envelope, Blockchain Commons’ privacy-preserving data-interchange format for data at rest and (using GSTP) data on the wire, remains one of our top priorities. This quarter, we worked to make it more accessible and explored new cases for its usage.</p>

<p>Videos. We produced a trio of videos to offer an introduction to Gordian Envelope: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDI5ihfTB2Y">a teaser</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vcLCFKQvik">an overview</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFxStP3ATkw">a look at extensions</a>. They’re must-watch viewing if you’re interested in adopting a data-storage and data-interchange format that actually focuses on privacy.</p>

<p>Presentations at W3C TPAC (Technical Plenary and Advisory Committee): We’ve worked extensively on using Gordian Envelope to store digital assets such as seeds and SSKR shares. At <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/09/TPAC/">TPAC 2024</a> this year, we presented some new thoughts on using various Envelope and CBOR alternatives in the rechartered DID group, where Christopher is an Invited Expert. We also discussed using Gordian Envelope for some specific DID use cases, which we hope to explore more. There’s more in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/09/24-did-minutes.html#t04">the minutes</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s6tf0VOKdIr3Gf_t7ROypyeg07Lk_myoOFby6AL4I7g/edit#slide=id.g2f88dfb0fe1_53_0">the slides</a>.</p>

<p>dCBOR &amp; Unicode. Gordian Envelope is built on dCBOR, our deterministic CBOR profile. In Q3, we updated our <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor/">dCBOR Internet-Draft</a> to v11. This was to incorporate Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC), to ensure that Unicode strings, used for all text in Gordian documents, will always be deterministic.</p>

 Seed Recovery 

<p>The safe storage and recovery of seeds has long been a focus at Blockchain Commons, because it’s the heart of <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a>. Our August 7th Gordian Developers Meeting focused on the topic and gave community members the ability to talk about their own efforts.</p>

 
   
    <p>BIP-85. Aneesh Karve presented on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/08-07/presentation-bip85.pdf">BIP-85</a>. This is a methodology for deriving many secrets from a single seed.</p>
   
   
    <p>SSKR for Ledger. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/08-07/presentation-bip85.pdf">SSKR</a> has been one of Blockchain Commons’ most successful releases because it allows developers to safely use Shamir’s Secret Sharing. Aido has incorporated SSKR into <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/blob/master/meetings/2024/08-07/presentation-lst.pdf">Ledger Seed Tool</a>, which now allows you to shard your Ledger secrets yourself (without depending on Ledger Recovery and Ledger’s privacy-busting KYC-compliant partners).</p>

 FROST 

<p>FROST is an up-and-coming multisig method that takes advantage of <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Schnorr-based signatures</a> and Multi-Party Computations (MPCs) for key generation and signing. It’s an important new technology for creating keys that are more resilient and more secure. We’ve been supporting it for more than a year now.</p>

<p>FROST Implementers Meeting. Our second FROST Implementers Meeting occurred on September 18th. It gave people working on FROST specs, libraries, and cryptography the ability to talk about their most recent challenges. We’ve got a <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/meeting2/">full record</a> of the event, including videos, slides, summary, and transcript. It was great to bring the community together and plan for the future!</p>

<p>FROST in Gordian. We’ve been doing our own work with FROST! Our Rust and Swift Gordian stacks are switching to fully BIP-340 compliant Schnorr signatures. We’ve also been experimenting with FROST support, to allow the FROST signing method using the Trusted Dealer model. We’re waiting on an updated release of the secp256k1 Rust crate so that we can publish our own Rust crates and Envelope-CLI, but we hope to have our full reference implementation available within the month.</p>

<p>Stack Wallet. We did some light review of the <a href="https://stackwallet.com/">Stack Wallet</a> this quarter, which is the first wallet we know of that incorporates FROST. We’d love to see a security review of its FROST design, but from what we can see from usage, it not only implements FROST, but the ability to change thresholds on the fly, which is one of FROST’s rea2lly amazing capabilities.</p>

<p>We will have a FROST Developer’s Meeting on December 4th that will provide advice &amp; support for wallet developers who want to implement FROST. We’ve already scheduled Stack Wallet to give a presentation, since they’ve already done it!</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://hrf.org/hrf-bitcoin-development-fund-grants-1-billion-satoshis-to-13-projects-worldwide/">The Human Rights Foundation</a> for their support of our FROST work in 2024.</p>

 Reference Upgrades 

<p>Our reference apps and libraries suggest best-practices and offer examples on the uses of our specifications.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Gordian SeedTool for iOS 1.6.2. We released a minor update of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Gordian Seed Tool for iOS</a> that makes our card entropy compatible with other sources, that allows the export of SSKR Envelopes in UR format, and that resolves a few other incompatibilities.</p>

<p>Swift 6 Stack Upgrade. We also upgraded our entire Swift stack to Swift 6. This allows us to take advantage of the Swift 6 concurrency model, remove unnecessary dependencies on forked libraries, and convert the tests of some modules to the new Swift Testing framework. This work can already be found in our Swift libraries, but we’re waiting to release a new Seedtool for iOS until we have other new features to deploy.</p>

<p>More Envelope Signatures in Rust. Fully BIP-340 compatible signatures are just one of our expansions to our Envelope Rust reference libraries. You can now also do Ed25519 signing (again, as soon as we’re able to release our new crates).</p>

 Developer Pages 

<p>Our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/">Developer Pages</a> are intended to help wallet developers to use our specifications (and other important standards like FROST). If there’s anything you’d like to see that isn’t on the pages, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/developer-web-site/issues">please let us know</a>. This quarter, we made some major updates.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Stack Organization. Our biggest upgrade was a reorganization of the website to focus on the technology stacks that we offer. We have a core stack (which is our fundamental techs like dCBOR and Envelope), a user experience stack (which makes it easier for users to transmit and view data), and a crypto stack (which does the heavy lifting of things like sharding seeds). This is how it all fits together!</p>

<p>New Envelope Pages. Last quarter, we did work on the Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol. This quarter, we incorporated that into our developer pages, with new content for <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/gstp/">GSTP</a> and <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/envelope/esc/">Encrypted State Continuation</a>, plus updates to our look at <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/csr/">Collaborative Seed Recovery</a></p>

 What’s Next? 

<p>Our most exciting work planned for Q4 my be our <a href="https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/">December 4th FROST Implementers Meeting</a>. If you are considering incorporating FROST into your own work, please be sure to sign up for our announcements-only <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/subscribe/#gordian-developers">Gordian Developers list</a> to receive notifications on the meeting.</p>

<p>Or, our most exciting Q4 work may be our new work on <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/musings-cliques-1/">cliques</a>, which we think is an innovative new way to look at identity. We’ve released the first article on the topic, with a few more to come.</p>

<p>We’ll generally be talking with members of the identity and credentials community in Q4, including a presentation at the W3C Credentials Community Group, planned for October 22nd.</p>

<p>We’re also looking to roll out our work on FROST and Ed25519 signing, which just requires the official deployment of an updated secp256k1 Rust crate.</p>

<p>There are more projects under consideration! We’re thinking about producing a “Gordian Companion” to offer a reference for storing SSKR shares. We’re looking into more grants, as funding continues to be poor for many of our partners. (You can help by becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor for us</a> at any level!) And of course we’re looking forward to 2025!</p>

The power of that diversity continues to shine through in the new working groups this year, particularly as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti, equity, and inclusion in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Council has identified several areas where diversity, along with expertise in the digital identity space, could help us better serve the community. Nominations from organisations involved in kaupapa Māori, civil liberties, and the business and service sectors are particularly encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as their viewpoint is extremely valuable and relevant to the work we perform. As an NZTech Association, Digital Identity NZ adopts its Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which&nbsp;you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://nztech.org.nz/who-we-are/diversity-and-inclusion/">here</a>.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a>,” the secure authentication mechanism built to replace passwords, are getting more portable and easier for organizations to implement thanks to new initiatives the FIDO Alliance announced this month.</p>



<p>At the FIDO Alliance’s Authenticate Conference in Carlsbad, California, on Monday, October 14, researchers are announcing two projects that will make passkeys easier for organizations to offer—and easier for everyone to use. One is a new technical specification called <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP)</a> that will make passkeys portable between digital ecosystems, a feature that users have increasingly demanded. The other is a website, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.passkeycentral.org/home">Passkey Central</a>, where developers and system administrators can find resources like metrics and implementation guides that make it easier to add support for passkeys on existing digital platforms.</p>



<p>“To me, both announcements are part of the broader story of the industry working together to stop our dependence on passwords,” Andrew Shikiar, CEO of the FIDO Alliance, told WIRED ahead of Monday’s announcements. “And when it comes to CXP, we have all these companies who are fierce competitors willing to collaborate on credential exchange.”</p>

<p>Passkey Central provides leaders with education about passkeys and steps to implement them for consumer sign-ins</p>



<p>October 14, 2024 — Carlsbad, CA —&nbsp; <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">The FIDO Alliance</a> today announced <a href="https://passkeycentral.fidoalliance.org/">Passkey Central</a>, a new web resource where consumer service providers can learn more about why and how to implement passkeys for simpler and more secure sign-ins.</p>



<p>Passkeys, an easy-to-use and secure replacement for passwords, are already available for consumer services around the world including Adobe, Amazon, Apple, eBay, Google, Hyatt, Microsoft, Nintendo, NTT DOCOMO, PayPal, PlayStation, Shopify and TikTok. More than 13 billion user accounts can now leverage passkeys. Passkeys offer significant benefits to implementing organizations, including faster user sign-ins, higher sign-in success rates, reduced account takeovers, reduced costs associated with authentication, and lower cart abandonment. Passkey Central provides product leaders and architects with the information required to implement and realize similar benefits with passkeys.</p>



<p>Passkey Central provides visitors with actionable, data-driven content to discover, implement, and maintain passkeys for maximum benefits over time. The comprehensive resources on Passkey Central include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Introduction to passkeys 



 Business considerations and metrics&nbsp; 



 Internal and external communication materials 



 Implementation strategies &amp; detailed roll-out guides&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 UX &amp; Design guidelines 



 Troubleshooting 



 And more implementation resources, such as glossary, figma kits, and accessibility guidance&nbsp; 
 



<p>Service providers should go to passkeycentral.org to get started with passkeys.</p>



<p>“Passkeys are the simplest and most secure way for consumers to access the global connected economy,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, CEO of FIDO Alliance. “The early adoption of passkeys has been remarkable and it is now time to help more service providers break their dependence on passwords. Passkey Central will accelerate the use of passkeys by providing product leads and architects with independent and authoritative guidance on why and how to implement passkeys for their own website and services.”</p>



 A research-backed public resource 



<p>The content for Passkey Central is based on several years of FIDO Alliance research, including subject matter expert interviews, focus groups and UX testing, to determine what guidance businesses need when implementing passkeys. Investment and participation from the following companies as Founding Underwriters enabled the underlying research, web and content development costs required to launch Passkey Central: Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Google, Trusona and Yubico.</p>



<p>“Our adversaries attack nations in cyberspace using techniques that are blocked by passkeys and related technologies. We need to do what we can to accelerate passkey adoption, and to help regular people understand that passkeys protect countries, and make their online lives a little easier.” – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/craignewmark/">Craig Newmark</a>, Founder and ISR, Craig Newmark Philanthropies</p>



<p>“Trusona is committed to revolutionizing the authentication experience for digital businesses, ensuring customers can sign up and sign in simply, swiftly, and securely. Passkey Central brings that mission to life with a new resource that will positively impact people’s digital lives today and in the future.” – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/orieisen/">Ori Eisen</a>, CEO, Trusona</p>



<p>“Phishing attacks resulting from stolen login credentials is one of the greatest cybersecurity risks facing individuals and enterprises today. In order to achieve a phishing-resistant passwordless future, the solution is clear: prioritize education on passkey implementation and broad support for passkey authentication options globally. Passkey Central is a major step toward achieving this goal, and we look forward to working with the FIDO Alliance toward accelerating adoption of passkeys.” – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/derekthanson/">Derek Hanson</a>, VP, Standards and Alliances, Yubico</p>



<p>“The best way to accelerate passkey adoption is to give website owners and app owners the information they need to get oriented with the benefits of passkeys and guidance on how they can start deploying passkeys. FIDO’s Passkey Central will be a key resource that helps meet this need.” – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samsrinivas/">Sam Srinivas</a>, Product Management Director, Google and FIDO Board Rep for Google.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance has published a working draft of a new set of specifications for <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications/">secure credential exchange</a> that, when standardized and implemented by credential providers, will enable users to securely move passkeys and all other credentials across providers. The specifications are the result of commitment and collaboration amongst members of the FIDO Alliance’s Credential Provider Special Interest Group&nbsp; including representatives from: 1Password, Apple, Bitwarden, Dashlane, Enpass, Google, Microsoft, NordPass, Okta, Samsung and SK Telecom.</p>



<p>Secure credential exchange is a focus for the FIDO Alliance because it can help further accelerate passkey adoption and enhance user experience. Today, more than 12 billion online accounts can be accessed with passkeys and the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/statistics-sources/">benefits are clear</a>: sign-ins with passkeys reduce phishing and eliminate credential reuse while making sign-ins up to 75% faster, and 20% more successful than passwords or passwords plus a second factor like SMS OTP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this rising momentum, the FIDO Alliance is committed to enabling an open ecosystem, promoting user choice and reducing any technical barriers around passkeys. It is critical that users can choose the credential management platform they prefer, and switch credential providers securely and without burden. Until now, there has been no standard for the secure movement of credentials, and often the movement of passwords or other credentials has been done in the clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance’s draft specifications – <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications/">Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF)</a> – define a standard format for transferring credentials in a credential manager including passwords, passkeys and more to another provide in a manner that ensures transfer are not made in the clear and are secure by default.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once standardized, these specifications will be open and available for credential providers to implement so their users can have a secure and easy experience when and if they choose to change providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The working draft specifications are open to community review and feedback; they are not yet intended for implementation as the specifications may change. Those interested can read the working drafts <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-credential-exchange-specifications/">here</a>, and provide feedback on the Alliance’s <a href="https://github.com/fido-alliance/credential-exchange-feedback">GitHub repo</a>. Drafts are expected to be updated and published for public review often until the specifications are approved for implementation.</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance extends a special thank you to its members in the Credential Provider Special Interest Group and its leads for driving and contributing to this important specification.</p>

<p>40 Speakers from Various Sectors Highlight Key Industry Trends</p>



<p>The Summit featured more than 40 speakers from sectors such as banking, government, telecom, enterprises, defense, eCommerce, solution vendors, online service providers, and manufacturers. Speakers represented leading organizations including Google, Lenovo, Samsung, ETDA Thailand, NTT Docomo, Mercari, Visa, SBI Bank, TikTok, iProov, Okta, TWCA, RSA, OneSpan, Thales, and VinCSS. One of the key themes of the 2024 Summit was the adoption of passkeys and the push towards achieving a passwordless experience across platforms. Here are some notable lessons shared:</p>



<p>Google: Demonstrated passkeys as the key to providing personalized experiences that users love. Cases from X, Amazon, Roblox, Kayak, WhatsApp, Zoho, and 1Password were shared. Roblox reported, “Passkeys are a significant security and usability upgrade for all of our users. In the six months since our launch, we have seen millions of users adopting passkeys to enjoy a simpler, faster, and more secure login experience.” Kayak noted a “50% reduction in average sign-in time with passkeys. With passkeys available on most devices, we’ve phased out traditional password logins and eliminated passwords from our servers.” 1Password highlighted that “in 2023, more than 1 million passkeys were created and saved by our users, and trial users who interact with passkey features are roughly 20% more likely to convert to paying customers.”</p>



<p>Samsung: Presented on passkeys on Galaxy mobile devices. Samsung launched the Passkey Provider Service at the end of 2023, providing a convenient user experience with the passkey as the default provider on Galaxy mobiles. Users can easily log in with fingerprint authentication and manage passkeys at a glance. Samsung ensures safe passkey synchronization across multiple devices logged into a Samsung account, including utilization with Samsung Knox Matrix. Statistics from the seven-month record of Samsung Passkey Provider include 7,672,861 cumulative registrations, 1,000,000 average new monthly registrations, and 850,000 average monthly authentications. Plans are in place to expand passkey usage for home appliance connectivity, such as TVs.</p>







<p>NTT Docomo: Highlighted the advantages of passkeys as an ideal authentication method—simple, frictionless user experience with biometric authentication, taking just 4-7 seconds compared to up to 30 seconds for SMS OTPs. They emphasized that passkeys are the only practical phishing-resistant authentication method.</p>



<p>Visa: Introduced Visa Payment Passkey for cardholder authentication in modern e-commerce. Traditional consumer authentication methods reduce fraud but often add friction, whereas biometric authentication with passkeys reduces both fraud and friction, leading to a 50% lower fraud rate.</p>



<p>TikTok: Reported success with passkeys, noting that over 100 million users registered within a year of implementation, with a 97% login success rate and a 17x faster login experience. There was also a 2% reduction in SMS OTP logins, as users who adopted passkeys chose them over other methods, improving app performance and reducing costs.</p>







<p>Workshops, Panel Discussions, and Networking Opportunities</p>



<p>This year’s Summit offered morning workshops on Passkeys and FDO (FIDO Device Onboard), allowing participants to delve deeper into implementing FIDO solutions. Attendees had the chance to work with FIDO experts to learn about integrating FIDO authentication into their services, understand technical specifications, and explore best practices. Experts also discussed the impact of emerging technologies like AI and post-quantum computing (PQC) on the authentication ecosystem while highlighting vulnerabilities related to human elements that can be addressed through implementing passkeys and FIDO’s efforts on future-proofing security.</p>



<p>Networking sessions, including a gala dinner, provided attendees a venue to relax and connect with peers from different parts of the world and sectors, fostering collaboration on developing solutions tailored to regional needs. Many participants enjoyed and respected the local culture while finding value in exchanging ideas and experiences about overcoming specific challenges in their respective sectors.</p>







<p>Celebrating Progress and Looking Forward</p>



<p>The FIDO APAC Summit 2024 showcased the significant progress towards convenient and secure FIDO-based passwordless authentication in the region. Through the collective efforts of governments, private sector leaders, and technology providers, the adoption of FIDO standards across the Asia-Pacific is accelerating, delivering stronger security and a seamless user experience.</p>



<p>The Asia-Pacific region is at the forefront of building a phishing-resistant, passwordless future, serving as an inspiration for other regions. The spirit of innovation and collaboration at the Summit reflects the dedication of all stakeholders to creating a secure and user-friendly digital landscape.</p>



<p>We extend our gratitude to all speakers, sponsors, participants, and members for making this year’s Summit a success. Together, we are shaping a more secure, passwordless future.</p>

The session, Elevating the Institution’s Global Profile Through Student Support Applications and OIT Support, led by Angela Sen, Developer/Analyst I, Software and Application Services, Office of Information Technology, Princeton University, highlighted the critical role of student support applications and the Office of Information Technology in advancing a university’s global profile. By adopting and optimizing these technologies, universities can enhance student satisfaction, academic performance, and institutional reputation on the global stage.</p>
 Innovation in Procurement 
<p>Dan Miller, AVP for EdgeMarket, introduced attendees to the EdgeMarket Higher Education Ecosystem RFP and how this solution is changing the game for higher education procurement. He shared how this strategic approach is designed to simplify the procurement process, foster collaboration between members and solution providers, and drive better outcomes for institutions. The session introduced the Business Capability Model and the Business Outcomes Framework and how they can connect solution investments to tangible business results and align solution portfolios with the operational needs of higher education institutions. Miller shared that by leveraging these powerful tools, institutions can access a streamlined procurement pathway that empowers them to make more informed and effective system selections.</p>

<p>Since the mid-1990s, I’ve been advocating for the creation of secure digital infrastructures that protect human rights, civil liberties, and human dignity online. My mission has always been to decentralize power and give individuals control over their digital lives, from my early work co-authoring the TLS standard to my recent efforts supporting DIDs and Verifiable Credentials.</p>

<p>We now stand at another crossroads in digital identity. The current paradigm, where an individual’s private key is the cornerstone of their identity, has served us well but it also has significant limitations—especially as we move toward a more interconnected, collaborative digital world. Fortunately, advances in cryptography allow us to rethink single-key self-sovereign identity systems, suggesting the possibility for new options such as edge identifiers and cryptographic cliques.</p>

 The Single Signature Paradigm 

<p>Identity management has long  centered on the use of single-signature cryptographic keys. Operating on a straightforward principle, this “Single Signature Paradigm” requires the possession of a unique private key for cryptographic signatures, allowing actions such as authentication, data encryption, and transaction validation.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>The security of this model hinges on the confidentiality of the private key: a compromise  of the key means a compromise of security. To reduce this threat, standards often require private keys be stored in specialized hardware, providing a fortified environment. This model is the cornerstone of security strategies endorsed and required by entities such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), European Union government standards, and various international standards groups such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>

<p>There has been very limited success in strengthening this fundamental methodology through protocols such as key rotation. Meanwhile, the Single Signature Paradigm has many flaws, the most serious of which are Single Point of Compromise (where a key can be stolen) or Single Point of Failure (where a key can be lost). If anything, these problems are worsening, as demonstrated by recent side-channel attacks that can extract keys from older hardware. Other issues include scalability limitations, hardware dependency, operational inflexibility, and numerous legal, compliance, and regulatory issues.</p>

<p>There are fundamental limits to what can be achieved within the confines of a Single Signature Paradigm, making the need for evolution  clear.</p>

 The Keys to Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The Single Signature Paradigm is problematic for many use cases surrounding digital assets, but particularly so for the management of digital identities, because identities are both central to our digital experience and largely irreplaceable. You can’t just create a new identity to replace a compromised one without losing credentials and connections alike.</p>

<p>When I first conceived of my ideas for the personal control of digital identity, known today as self-sovereign identity, I didn’t want to be limited by the Single Signature Paradigm. Instead, I modeled self-sovereign identity to be an identity that existed in a social context, not an isolated identity defined by singular keys. I wrote some on this in <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/origins-SSI/">The Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the key principles of living systems theory is the concept of the membrane. This is not just a physical barrier but a selective boundary that controls the exchange of energy, matter, and information between the system and its environment. The membrane allows certain things to pass through while restricting others, thereby maintaining the system’s integrity and autonomy. It’s a delicate balancing act: the system must allow enough interaction with the environment to sustain itself while ensuring that it isn’t overwhelmed by external forces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though I meant for it to be something that would protect the individual, self-sovereignty doesn’t mean that you are in complete control. It simply defines the borders within which you can make decisions and outside of which you negotiate with others as peers, not as a petitioner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implementing practical solutions that encapsulate this interconnectedness has historically been challenging due to the dominance of the Single Signature Paradigm. This has led to self-sovereign identity systems that actually adhere to the Single Signature Paradigm, which in turn causes the to overemphasize individualism, which was not my intent.</p>

<p>It’s not the only way.</p>

 Relational Edge Identity 

<p>Living systems theory suggests that identity isn’t just about oneself, but about one’s connections to the rest of society.</p>

<p>Consider the process of a child’s identity formation. They may be named “Joshua” upon birth, suggesting a unique, nodal form of identity. But, there are many Joshuas in the world. To truly define the child’s identity requires <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/linked-local-names.md">linked local names</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/petnames.md">pet names</a>) that define relationships. The father and mother say “my child”, attesting to the relationship between each of them and the child. A sibling says, “My brother’s child” and a grandparent says “my grandchild”.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>Though unidirectional descriptors are useful to help identify someone, each link is actually bidirectional, creating an edge between two individual nodes of identity:</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>At this point we must ask: does the node really define identity or is it the edges? The most complete answer is probably that an identity is defined by an aggregation of edges sufficient to identify within the current graph context: “Joshua, who is filially linked with Mary, who is filially linked with Anna.”</p>

 Relational Edge Keys 

<p>We can model the interconnectedness of edge-based relationships in an identity system by using <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/musings/Schnorr-Intro/">Schnorr-based</a> aggregatable multisig systems that support Multi-Party Computing (MPC), such as MuSig2 or FROST (see the Appendix in the next article for more on the technology and the differences between the two systems). Schnorr-based systems are an excellent match for edge identity because their peer-based key construction technique matches the peer-based model of an identity graph: two users come together to create a joint private key.</p>

<p>To create a relational edge key, the two identities (nodes) connected by an edge each generate a private commitment. These commitments are combined in a cryptographic ceremony to form the edge’s private key. The associated public key then effectively becomes an identifier for this two-person group, indiscernible from a single user’s public key thanks to Schnorr.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>Leveraging the Multi-Party Computation (MPC) of MuSig2 or FROST allows for the creation of a private key that doesn’t exist on a single device. It exists only in a distributed cryptographic construct, colloquially called a “fog”. Through unanimous consent, users can use this “fog” to sign collectively, allowing (even requiring) joint agreement for joint actions.</p>

<p>This relational-edge identity model begins to resolve the issues with current self-sovereign identity models by recognizing identity as being about more than just a single self-sovereign person. It also offers substantial benefits including better security, trust, resilience, and verification due to full keys existing only in this distributed cryptographic “fog”. Finally, it allows relationships to dynamically grow and change over time through the addition or removal of edges in a graph.</p>

 Clique Identity 

<p>Edge identity is just the first step in creating a new model for identity that recognizes tthat personal digital identity is founded in relationships. The next step is to expand pairwise relationships by forming a clique, specifically a triadic clique.</p>

<p>A clique in graph theory is “a fully connected subgraph where every node is adjacent to every other node.” Thus, in a complete graph, no node remains isolated; each is an integral part of an interconnected network. This concept is core to understanding the transition from simple pairwise relationships to more complex, interconnected group dynamics.</p>

<p>In our example, there is an obvious triadic clique: the nuclear family of Mary, Bob, and Joshua.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>Remember that the term “nuclear family” comes from the word “nucleus”.That’s a great metaphor for a tight, strongly connected group <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/dyads-triads-the-smallest-teams/">of this type</a>. A triadic clique fosters strong social cohesion and supports a  robust, tightly-knit network.</p>

<p>Cryptographically, we form a triadic clique by generating a relational edge key for each pair of participants in the group. This represents the pair’s joint decision-making capability. Once these pairwise connections are in place, the trio of edges participates in a cryptographic ceremony to create a shared private key for the whole group, which in turn creates a clique identifier: the public key. This identifier represents not just an individual or a pair but the collective identity of the entire triadic group (and, once more, their decision-making capability).</p>

<p>Although my examples so far suggest that nodes in a clique are all people, that doesn’t have to be the case: I’ll talk about cliques of devices as one of three variations of this basic formula in my next article.</p>

 Why Cliques of Edges? 

<p>As noted, a clique is formed by the pairwise edges jointly creating a key, not by the original participants doing so. There are a number of advantages to this.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it builds on the concept of identity being formed by relationships. Call it the Relationship Signature Paradigm (or the Edge Signature Paradigm). We’re saying that a group is defined not by the individuals, but by the relationships between the individuals. This is a powerful new concept that has applicability at all levels of identity work.</p>

<p>Individually, we might use the Relationship Signature Paradigm to create an individual identity based on edge-based relationships. My relationship to my friends, my relationship to my company, my relationship to my coworkers, my verifiable credentials (which are themselves relationships between myself and other entities), and my relationship to my published works together define the “clique” that is me. Crucially, this identity is built upon the relationship with other participants, not the participants themselves.</p>

<p>At a higher-level, we can also use this paradigm to form a clique of cliques, where each member is not a participant or even an edge, but instead a clique itself! Because we already recognized cliques as being formed by relational groups when we defined a first-order clique as a collection of edges, we can similarly define a clique as a collection of cliques (or even a collection of edges and cliques), creating a fully recursive paradigm for identity.</p>


  


<p><br></p>

<p>There is one clique-based design where the Relationship Signature Paradigm can’t be used: fuzzy cliques, which is another variation of clique identity. But more on that in the next article.</p>

 Higher Order Graphs 

<p>There is no reason to limit cryptographic cliques to three edges.&nbsp;However, the larger the group is, the harder it is to close the graph: as the number of nodes (n) in a clique increases, the number of edges grows following the formula <code>(n*n-1)/2</code>, which is the number of unique edges possible between <code>n</code> nodes.</p>

<p>A “4-Clique” (or K4), for example, is a complete graph comprising 4 nodes, where each node is interconnected with every other node, resulting in a total of <code>(4*3)/2 = 6</code> edges.</p>


  

<p><br></p>

<p>This pattern continues with larger cliques:</p>
 
   K5 = <code>(5*4)/2 = 10</code> edges; 
   K6 = <code>(6*5)/2 = 15</code> edges; 
   K7 = <code>(7*6)/2 = 21</code> edges; etc. 
 

<p>In practice, as the number of nodes in a clique increases, the complexity of forming and maintaining these fully connected networks also escalates: each additional connection requires its own key-creation ceremony with every existing member of the graph.</p>

<p>Complete graphs, or closed cliques, have valuable applications across various disciplines, from computer science to anthropology, but they aren’t the only solution for cryptographic cliques. I’ll talk more about the alternative of open cliques as another variation of the clique identity model in my follow-up article next week.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The Single Signature Paradigm has been at the heart of the digital world since the start. It’s always had its limitations, but those limitations are growing even more problematic with the rise of digital identity.</p>

<p>Relational edge keys and closed cliques offer a next step, modeling how identity is actually based on relationships and that many social decisions are made through the edges defined by those relationships.</p>

<p>Other advantages of using clique-based keys and identities include:</p>

 
   Decentralized Identity Management. Peer-based edge and clique identifiers are created collaboratively, bypassing third-party involvement, thus supporting self-sovereign control and improving anonymity. 
   Identity Validation. Peer-based identifiers help to authenticate social identities, creating trust. 
   Resilience Against Single Points of Failure: Distributing control among multiple parties in a clique guards against single points of failure. 
   Secure Group Decision Making. Relations or groups can securely and irrevocably made decisions together. 
   Enhanced Privacy in Group Interactions. Aggregatable Schnorr-based signatures keep the identities of the members of a relationship or a clique private. 
 

<p>Cliques can be quite useful for a number of specific fields:</p>

 
   Blockchains. The use of aggregatable signatures creates smaller transactions on blockchains. 
   Collaborative Projects. Collaborative projects and joint ventures can use clique keys to authenticate shared resource usage and other decisions. 
   Financial Fields. Dual-key control is often required in financial fields, and that’s an implicit element of relational edge keys. 
   Internet of Things (IoT) &amp; Other Smart Networks. Relational edge keys can ensure secure and efficient communication among diverse devices that have paired together. 
   Medicine &amp; Other Sensitive Data. When data is sensitive, cliques can ensure all parties have agreed to the data sharing terms, maintaining both security and collaboration integrity. 
 

<p>By leveraging cryptographic cliques for group identification and decision-making, we open a wide array of opportunities. These are just the beginning: open cliques, fuzzy cliques, and cliques of devices can offer even more opportunities, as I discuss in my next article in this series (which also talks a little bit about the cryptography behind this).</p>

<p>CAP Standard Has Transformed Emergency Communication and Continues to Save Lives </p> 


<p>Boston, MA – 7 October 2024 – This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) being established as an OASIS Open Standard. CAP, part of the EDXL suite of standards, provides an open, non-proprietary message format for delivering all-hazard alerts and notifications. Over the past two decades, CAP has become a model of global collaboration and a fundamental component of emergency communications systems worldwide. Its use across multiple platforms has helped save countless lives through timely, reliable messaging. Today, 87% of the world’s population lives in a country with at least <a href="https://alert-hub.s3.amazonaws.com/cap-sources.html">one national-level CAP news feed</a> for emergency notifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CAP enables a consistent message to be disseminated simultaneously over a variety of communication pathways, including radio, television, mobile phones, emails, and other media. This all-hazards, all-media format ensures that critical alerts (e.g., weather events, earthquakes, tsunami, volcanoes, public health crises, power outages, fires, child abductions, and more) reach the public swiftly and efficiently, regardless of the medium.</p>



<p>“As we celebrate 20 years of CAP, I’m incredibly proud that it has become the backbone of emergency communication worldwide, recognized by the UN as the standard for the Early Warnings for All program. The success of CAP is a testament to the dedication and collaboration of so many over the years, and I extend my sincere thanks to everyone who has played a part in making it the global standard it is today,” said Elysa Jones, chair of the <a href="https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=aca4a7b8-5c48-48f0-b87c-018dc7d3efaa">OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee</a> (EMTC). “CAP’s ability to deliver consistent, interoperable alerts through multiple channels has made it indispensable for disaster management. We’ll continue to evolve CAP to ensure it serves communities in need.”</p>



<p>The CAP community will commemorate this significant anniversary milestone at the <a href="https://cap-workshop.alert-hub.org/2024/index.html">CAP Implementation Workshop</a> from 22-24 October in Leuven, Belgium. OASIS is a co-sponsor of the event, which will focus on the use of CAP and its consistent use throughout the world. OASIS and the EMTC will continue to work with nations and organizations to explore future advancements in global emergency alerting.</p>



<p>The fundamental need for CAP was identified by the Partnership for Public Warning (PPW) in response to the 9/11 attacks when there was no consistent method for informing the nation. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami highlighted the urgent need for improved emergency alert communication across the globe. With the support of Eliot Christian, longtime CAP advocate and former chief architect of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Information System (WIS), and Elysa Jones, chair of the OASIS EMTC, along with EMTC members, CAP was officially adopted by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in 2007 as ITU-T Recommendation X.1303. Since then, many international organizations like the WMO, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) have embraced CAP as an essential standard for emergency alerting. In 2021, the Call to Action on Emergency Alerting set a goal to achieve 100% CAP implementation by 2025, an initiative that has since been integrated into the UN’s Early Warnings for All initiative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OASIS and its partners are committed to increasing global CAP adoption. Participation in the EM TC is open to all through <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OASIS-OPEN-MEMBERSHIP-AGREEMENT_2024_TC.pdf">membership in OASIS</a>, with interested parties encouraged to join and contribute to shaping the future of alerting.

  <p>The Global Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) Summit in Cairo was the world's first summit dedicated to DPI. Bringing together a diverse ecosystem of experts. The summit featured insightful keynotes, engaging discussions, and practical focus panels where participants shared real-world DPI implementation experiences. Success stories spanned across national digital identity, payments, government services, and data exchange initiatives. However, discussions highlighted challenges, particularly in cross-governance data exchange and the interoperability layer, signaling a need for improved solutions to ensure a seamless DPI ecosystem across sectors and borders.</p><p>At the summit, discussions emphasized the need to start thinking about implementation of DPI, beyond service oriented use cases such as finance, public services, and governance. These sectors have benefited from DPI adoption, but as noted during the summit, there remains much work to do in improving its application across industries.</p><p>One of the key discussions revolved around the evolution of DPI. First iteration of DPI&nbsp; provided the initial frameworks for public digital infrastructure, focusing on secure and efficient digital services. However, the future version promises to shift the focus towards interoperability, with a higher emphasis on connecting different systems and ensuring they work together seamlessly. This is a critical development as governments and organizations look to build more integrated, accessible, and collaborative infrastructures. This trend is welcomed by HCF as it goes in the direction the Foundation has been promoting since its creation in 2020, a total interoperability within and across ecosystems.</p><p>Data exchange was a recurring theme during the event.In particular, the necessity of cross&nbsp; borders governance frameworks was raised and discussed. While there has been much progress within individual countries or regions, many experts admitted that the global community still lacks a clear pathway to enable effective cross-governance data exchange. The complexities of regulatory frameworks, governance structures, and varying legal standards pose significant challenges. At present, there seems to be no clear consensus on how to tackle this issue, highlighting the urgent need for collaborative innovation. HCF witness these complexities in the projects we are involved (see <a href="https://humancolossus.squarespace.com/config/pages/5eaecb2534916624d94cccf4/content">Governance Periscope blog post</a> of Sep.16). There is not one single digital governance framework that will capture the world’s diversity.&nbsp;</p>





















  
  














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                

            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>HCF was pleased to see a strong emphasis on inclusion and the need for vendor-agnostic solutions, ensuring that digital public infrastructure is accessible to all, regardless of geography or socio-economic status. This aligns with HCF’s mission of building decentralized, scalable infrastructure that works for everyone, not just for those in advanced economies or within specific vendor ecosystems.</p><p>HCF’s vision for a digital infrastructure that scales horizontally was widely accepted at the summit. The need for a common infrastructure that can be applied across various industries and sectors was highlighted as critical for the next phase of DPI development. This closely aligns with HCF's work, which focuses on enabling cross-sector digital infrastructure that is decentralized, scalable, and interoperable.</p><p>The first DPI summit was a great success, setting the stage for the continued development of global digital public infrastructures. The next DPI Summit is scheduled for November 4-6, 2025, and it promises to build on the momentum from Cairo, with even more insights and innovations expected to emerge.&nbsp;</p><p>HCF is excited to continue contributing to these important discussions, helping shape the global DPI ecosystem and ensuring that it meets the needs of people across all sectors and regions.</p><p>In conclusion, the Global DPI Summit in Cairo highlighted the critical role DPI will play in shaping the future digital economy, and HCF’s work in decentralized infrastructure aligns perfectly with this vision. We look forward to further collaborations and innovations in the years to come.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.truvity.com/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Truvity</a> brings the future of global digital identity management to life with its innovative challenges at the DIF 2024 Hackathon. A leader in user-centric digital identity systems, Truvity is dedicated to making the benefits of self-sovereign identity seamless and accessible for individuals and businesses alike. Their two innovative challenges aim to revolutionize digital identity management for our increasingly global and mobile world, leveraging the power of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.</p><p>Alexander Mikhailov, Product Manager at Truvity shares his thoughts: “We’re excited to see Truvity’s SDK come to life through the creativity and innovation of the DIF 2024 Hackathon participants. Our goal is to make it easy for developers to build with technology like verifiable credentials, so they can have a real impact on how we exchange information and move away from physical documents to a digital future of credentials.”</p> Streamlining relocation-related digital identity complexities with SSI <p>Truvity invites participants to explore how decentralized identity and verifiable credentials can streamline complex eKYC processes and digital identity management using self-sovereign identity solutions.</p><p>At the heart of these challenges is Miko, a talented backend developer embarking on an international relocation. Her journey from outside Europe to Amsterdam serves as the backdrop for exploring innovative applications of digital wallets, smart to-do lists, and interlinked verifiable credentials.</p> The Challenges  Challenge 1: Miko’s Journey to Amsterdam <p>In the first challenge, you will create a Digital Identity Wallet with an embedded to-do list that guides Miko as she relocates to Amsterdam and navigates the complexities of settling in a new country. The wallet should:</p>  Manage and submit Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for various steps of the relocation process  Handle interlinked VCs to maintain data integrity across different procedures  Simplify tasks from obtaining employment contracts to securing housing   Challenge 2: eKYC Compliance Officer Panel <p>Building on Miko's journey, design a user-friendly Compliance Officer Panel for financial institutions. This challenge focuses on streamlining the verification process when Miko opens a bank account. Key aspects include:</p>  Reviewing and approving interlinked Verifiable Credentials  Providing an efficient interface for compliance officers to manage digital identity documents  Ensuring the integrity and completeness of submitted credentials  <p>Both challenges encourage participants to leverage Truvity's SDK and explore innovative ways to make digital identity management more accessible and secure in our increasingly mobile world.</p> Prize Pool and Participation <p>Truvity is offering a total prize pool of $5,000, with each challenge awarding:</p>  1st Place: $1,500  2nd Place: $700  3rd Place: $300  <p>To participate, leverage the Truvity SDK (available in TypeScript and Java) and ensure your solutions use W3C-compliant verifiable credentials.</p> Why Join Truvity's Challenge?

<p>DIF is thrilled to announce <a href="https://pinata.cloud/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Pinata</a> as a Gold sponsor of the DIF 2024 Hackathon! Pinata is bringing challenges that use decentralized file storage in digital identity solutions.</p> About Pinata <p>Pinata, the Internet’s File API, provides simple-to-use decentralized storage solutions for enterprises and individuals. Building on the secure foundation of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which enables content authenticity by design, their tools abstract away the complexity typically associated with decentralized storage and management. Further, it offers robust features for scalable, responsive applications. This includes a global CDN (content delivery network) to boost load times and simple access control options.</p><p>Pinata's technology is widely used in decentralized applications, and its architecture makes it a perfect foundation for decentralized identity applications and solutions.</p> The Challenges <p>Pinata presents three challenges that highlight the role of decentralized storage in enabling decentralized identity solutions:</p> 1. Verifiable File Storage <p>Associate files with users via verifiable credentials. Both files and verifiable credential metadata can be stored publicly or privately using Pinata's immutable Files API. This challenge invites you to demonstrate your creativity in using immutability and verifiable content hashes to solve real-world problems.</p> 2. Proof of Personhood Credentials <p>In this open-to-interpretation challenge, we want to see creative solutions to personhood credentials that leverage immutable file storage. Participants can use private file storage through Pinata's Files API or public file storage through Pinata's IPFS pinning service.</p> 3. Identity-Based Access Controls for Private Files <p>Build an identity-based access control system for retrieving files stored privately on Pinata's Files API. This challenge should focus on private file storage through the Files API, not IPFS, as IPFS is a public network.</p> Prizes: <p>Prizes total $10,000, broken down as follows:</p>  Grand Prize: $5,000  Per-Challenge Prize: $1,500 (1 for each of the 3 challenges above)  Honorable Mentions: 5 x $100   Why Participate in Pinata's Challenges?   Innovative Technology: Work with Pinata's cutting-edge file storage solutions and explore their applications in digital identity.  Real-World Applications: Develop solutions that address practical challenges in file management and access control.  Skill Development: Enhance your expertise in decentralized storage, identity management, and access control systems.  Industry Recognition: Showcase your creativity and technical skills to leaders in the decentralized storage and identity spaces.   Why this Matters <p>The application of decentralized storage to decentralized identity presents exciting opportunities for innovation. Pinata and DIF share their thoughts on the potential impact of these challenges:</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-hunter-b30a1b80/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Justin Hunter</a>, Vice President of Product at Pinata, emphasizes the practical applications: "Decentralized identity has shown that it can solve complex real world problems, and we’re excited to help facilitate continued progress in this area through complementary file storage. Pinata’s been building file storage solutions since 2018, and we’ve expanded to solve both decentralized storage and private file storage. Combined with decentralized identity, we think there can be some incredible applications."</p><p>Kim Duffy of DIF highlights the broader impact: "Pinata's challenges for DIF's Hackathon address a crucial aspect of decentralized identity adoption: making security, privacy, and scalability easily integrable into products by default. Their approach to simplifying decentralized storage is exactly what enterprises need to embrace these technologies at scale."&nbsp;</p><p>She further adds, "I'm personally excited that Pinata is supporting innovation in the Proof of Personhood Credentials challenge. As AI advancements render traditional methods like CAPTCHAs ineffective, we need innovative, privacy-preserving ways to differentiate human users without over-collecting personal data."</p> Ready to Revolutionize File-Based Identity Solutions?

<p>Virginia, US&nbsp;– 30 September 2024&nbsp;– the Board of Directors of Kantara Initiative has announced that Dr Carol Buttle is to join the organization in the newly created role of Chief Technology Officer (CTO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carol joins from the UK government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-science-innovation-and-technology">Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT)</a> where she was Head of Certification and Assurance. She brings with her unrivalled expertise in designing trust frameworks and identifying the implications of specific regulations and standards designed to support personal data privacy and security. Carol has input regularly into the development of identity trust frameworks across the globe.&nbsp; As demand for identity certification extends into new markets and territories, she will ensure that Kantara maintains its role as leaders in identity assurance, offering challenge and guidance to support all our members, clients, and partners.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Standards are everywhere,” said Carol. “We all seek assurance that the products we use, the medicines we consume – even the restaurants we visit – meet the appropriate standards and will not cause us harm. It is no different with identity. I see my role not just about certification and approvals. It is about how I can steer the wider industry to improve for the good of individual citizens, and particularly the most vulnerable.”</p>



<p>We asked Kantara Executive Director, Kay Chopard, about what she sees as the greatest impact of the new role. “Our investment in a Chief Technology Officer demonstrates significant commitment to the future of the industry as a whole, particularly with regard to the potential for international growth and greater interoperability across sectors and territories. Carol’s appointment follows on from the recent arrival of UK-based auditors James Keenan and David Nutbrown as our Head of Certification Delivery and Head of Regulatory Compliance, respectively. Their expertise greatly strengthens our existing operations and will secure confidence in the future direction of certification and identity assurance.”</p>



<p>Commenting on Carol’s appointment, Kantara Board Chair Andrew Hughes stated: “Carol’s appointment brings a real depth of regulatory and operational expertise to our leadership. It underpins the valuable contribution we already make through our Work Groups and certification programs. Carol brings with her thorough knowledge and expertise of UK requirements and how they might apply in the US. This will benefit those Kantara members who are engaged with US Federal Agencies or those wishing to become certified under the UK Digital Identity &amp; Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF).”</p>

<p>In our recently published <a href="https://islstaging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Worldwide-Web-of-Human-Surveillance-Identity-Resolution-and-Customer-Data-Platforms.pdf">research on the worldwide web of commercial surveillance</a>, we took a close look at the global infrastructure connecting and correlating personal information across platforms, devices, and even from physical world sources like point-of-sales systems. The connectivity is, in a word, staggering. At some point, however, there is a first-party relationship with a data subject. From that starting point, personal information is systematically being shared with countless entities including data brokers. In such a hyper-interconnected infrastructure, how can a single publisher make promises about where customer data is going? Moreover, how could a user possibly consent to the sharing of their data with thousands of recipient organizations?&nbsp;&nbsp; But the complexity and unknowability of system behavior isn’t just with these hyper-interconnected marketing networks. As we touched on in <a href="https://youtu.be/AcLposwveNU?si=rHpEOL8QnBEXew13">a recent podcast with Zach Edwards</a>, very large platforms (like Google, Facebook, X) are just as complex and opaque as the identity resolution and customer data platform networks. Software is increasingly a leaky, hyper-connected, unpredictable sieve of personal data sharing. In this blogpost, we take a closer look at the opacity and leakiness of the “big dogs”–large online platforms with hundreds of millions and billions of users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1. Types of Commercial Identity Resolution&nbsp; 
<p>I’ve been digging into this more since the publication of our research on identity resolution and customer data platforms and have revised my framing of identity resolution. To wit, I observe three co-existing types of commercial identity resolution architectures or systems happening in the world:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The first one I call distributed by design. This is the LiveRamps, The Trade Desks, mParticles, etc. of the world. These systems enjoy the power of massive data aggregation with [too] little of the risk and responsibility, as they are designed to be third-parties relative to the data subject. These platforms are architected to ingest and process (resolve) personal information from a disparate array of services and devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 The second one I call company-centric.&nbsp; This is the “big dog” platforms with millions or billions of users; the universes unto themselves. A company-centric identity resolution can also be distributed by design in the sense that it provides numerous small pieces of functionality which can be embedded as third-party resources into other companies’ apps and websites, allowing the big dogs to collect data external users despite not necessarily having direct relationships with them. Microsoft is a good example of this. It’s also true that company-centric identification schemes can and are ingested by distributed systems like LiveRamp. The lines implied by these two categories are fuzzy.&nbsp; 
 The third one I call standardized.&nbsp; This is the hiding-in-plain-sight globally coordinated efforts in <a href="https://unifiedid.com/">Unified ID 2.0</a> and <a href="https://euid.eu/">European Unified ID</a>. Note that these efforts are championed primarily by distributed by design identity resolution and customer data platforms. Scanning the <a href="https://unifiedid.com/partners">partners of just the Unified ID 2.0 standard</a> is enough to give one pause: these are the platforms that want to know who you are and what you’re doing at all times. Notably absent are the big dogs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>A brief word about national/governmental identification schemes, like India’s Aadhaar and the US Internal Revenue Service’s id.ME: these systems operate somewhat like a big dog company-centric identification system, orchestrating personal information across their own services, with the exception that we don’t expect these systems to be either ingesting or sharing data with external, commercial platforms<a>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Internet Safety Labs (ISL), we rate “big dog” platforms as critical risk “data aggregators”<a>2</a>. We do so for the following two reasons:&nbsp;</p>
 
 These corporate entities monetize personal information, either through ownership of advertising platforms, the selling of audience information, or other monetizing behaviors, and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 These entities run multiple consumer products and services with inadequate transparency of how personal information flows across product lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>The remainder of this post takes a closer look at Google and Facebook (Meta) personal data strategies and why they’re so risky.&nbsp;</p>
 1.1 GAIA and Narnia: Google’s Universal Identification and Cross-Product Personal Data Aggregation Grand Plan&nbsp; 
<p>In the wake of the recent Google search antitrust case in the US, Jason Kint published <a href="https://x.com/jason_kint/status/1821554841786683554">a long thread</a> on a recently unsealed <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.533508/gov.uscourts.vaed.533508.1132.2_1.pdf">325-page Google strategy document</a>. The document titled “Display, Video Ads, Analytics and Apps” contains a coordinated and synthesized set of business strategies describing how Google can:&nbsp;</p>
 
 More effectively coordinate the extraction of user information,&nbsp; 
 Better leverage user data across all of their AdTech, and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 In general, increase ad revenues across its entire portfolio of products and services: “make it easier to add monetization to other Google O&amp;O [owned and operated] properties.”<a>3</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>The document also covers how Google doesn’t make as much money from sites it doesn’t own and would like to assert its control to make them more like sites it does own, thereby increasing revenues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly every product line’s strategy contained in the document mentions the use of “GAIA signals” or “GAIA data”. GAIA is Google’s proprietary “universal ID”<a>4</a>. The plan clearly outlines how they can better utilize the massive trove of personal information joined by their GAIA “universal IDs”, amassed across their various owned and operated (O&amp;O) properties, like Gmail and Chrome to name two of the largest. This highlight from page 126 (section on “Smart Campaigns”) makes clear Google’s intention to share user information across all its properties to enrich their advertising services (project Narnia and Narnia2):&nbsp;  But it’s not enough to join user data across Google properties; they also indicate an intention to join external data sources, such as streaming and TV ad networks (pg 150):&nbsp;  The second highlighted section above describes the ingesting of external customer data and resolving the data (i.e. identity resolution) to Google’s GAIA IDs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the document describes an organization-wide, orchestrated plan to amass and unify user data (via GAIA IDs) to better leverage Google ads (Narnia 2.0) for both internal and external properties.&nbsp; How can Google users understand–nevermind consent– to the use of their personal information in this wide-reaching way?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1.2 Facebook Admits Unknowability of User Data Processing&nbsp; 
<p>One of my favorite references for explaining why the world needs software safety labels is <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akvmke/facebook-doesnt-know-what-it-does-with-your-data-or-where-it-goes">this story about two Facebook architects explaining how it’s virtually impossible for Facebook to know where user data is going</a>. The complexity and dynamism of software is making it so it’s not a bounded system—and it’s never the same river twice.&nbsp;&nbsp; The story came out two years ago and I recently read <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21716382/facebook-data-lineage-internal-document.pdf">the discovery document</a> written in April 2021 and it is really good. This excerpt outlines the fundamental problem of the unknowability of Facebook software’s behavior:&nbsp;  And this:   The discovery document contains fascinating information on what Facebook must do to track personal data usage within its system [implement Curated Data Sources and a Purpose Policy Framework], and it’s a massive undertaking: 450-750 engineer years over three calendar years. And even that’s not enough. It also requires “heavy Ads refactoring and adoption work in warehouse.”&nbsp;  Let’s go back to that “closed form system” described by the Facebook engineers. It comes from mathematics’ “closed-form expression”, describing an equation comprised of “constants, variables and a finite set of basic functions connected by arithmatic operations and function composition.”<a>5</a> If we look at realtime bidding as one example of a programmed system, we see that it is necessarily dynamic and unbounded. The participants (buyers) in the realtime bidding network are dynamic; also the ad inventory itself is dynamic. Realtime bidding is, by design, never the same river twice. The system is not a closed form system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Machine learning (ML) is another example: virtually all of the ML technologies generating much recent hype are also not closed form systems by design. They are constantly changing based on the training set, based on ongoing learning, and based on dynamic rule-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 2. Have We Agreed to Be Always Known and Tracked Online?&nbsp; 
<p>To summarize the situation: industry has developed techniques (distributed by design and company-centric) to interconnect and aggregate personal information such that we are always known and tracked online. As noted in the earlier mentioned research paper, there are at least $9T (as in trillion) worth of industries that want to know who we are and what we’re doing at all times. It’s unlikely that we can stop this financially motivated juggernaut of universal identification. So what’s to be done?</p>
 2.1 To Do List&nbsp; 
 
 Consent is dead. It’s impossible and the more we pretend like it’s possible to have informed consent when it comes to the unbounded nature of software, the more we are lying to ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 Privacy policies protect companies but not the people who use technology. Know how you’ve consented into the worldwide web of commercial surveillance? It’s through this phrase found in many privacy policies: “…and we [may] share your data with our marketing partners.”&nbsp;
 
 We need more exposure of actual measured software behavior (ala ISL’s App Microscope: https://appmicroscope.org/app/1579/).&nbsp; 
 
 
 One day, it will be possible for systems to generate machine-readable records of processing activities–a kind of passport stamp showing how your data was processed (used by first party, shared and used by third parties). This will be a landmark moment in empowering people through transparency of actual system behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Data broker regulation is inadequate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 If a platform has your data, it should de facto have a first party relationship with you, and as such, you are entitled to all the proactive data governance rights allowed to you. In other words, nothing about me, without me. Data brokers aren’t and never have been just 3rd parties.&nbsp;
 
 Note that these data rights are unexercisable if people don’t know that they’re actually in a relationship with a particular platform. Thus, there also needs to be a requirements for these platforms to proactively notify all data subjects for which they hold information.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Is the selling of personal information safe for humans and humankind? We’ve agreed as a society that certain things are sacrosanct and the selling of which unacceptably degrades and devalues them (such as votes, organs, children). We need to have a much deeper think about whether or not personal information should fall in that category.&nbsp; 
 Are data broker laws effective in their current form? It seems clear to ISL that all actual data brokers are not currently registered in the states requiring registration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Privacy and safety experts–and perhaps regulatory experts–need to get more aware of and involved in the two universal commercial identification standards (<a href="https://unifiedid.com/">Unified ID 2.0</a> and <a href="https://euid.eu/">European Unified ID</a>) pronto.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Identity resolution platforms and customer data platforms demand substantially more regulatory attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 Minimally, the massive troves of personal information are ripe for data breaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Maximally, the public needs assurances that platforms that are amassing this data are held to accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>In today’s digital landscape, data breaches and cyber threats are rapidly evolving. At a recent conference, Marc Airo-Farulla, Regional Sales Director of <a href="https://www.entrust.com">Entrust</a>, discussed the importance of identity-centric security solutions as the cornerstone for enterprise data protection. He highlighted how identity management is reshaping cybersecurity strategies and shared insights on how organisations can safeguard their data effectively.</p>



 

 



<p>Shifting Threat Landscape</p>



 
 Traditional security methods are no longer enough: Perimeter defences like firewalls fail to address evolving threats. 



 Phishing remains a top concern: 85% of security breaches stem from phishing attacks, often exploiting employee vulnerabilities. 
 



<p>The Role of Identity Access Management (IAM)</p>



 
 Identity is now the frontline defence: Managing user access, including employees and contractors, is critical to mitigating risk. 



 Fragmentation challenges: As more systems and technologies are introduced, IAM becomes harder to manage and protect, leading to vulnerabilities. 
 



<p>Zero Trust Frameworks</p>



 
 Adopt a zero-trust mindset: Zero trust means no user or device is trusted automatically, even within the organisation’s network. 



 Data security first: Protecting sensitive data is key, ensuring minimal access and maintaining strict oversight of who has access to what. 
 



<p>Real-World Breach Examples</p>



<p>Marc shared a cautionary tale of an Australian e-subscription company that collapsed after a cyberattack. Within two months, the business was wiped out, emphasising the dire consequences of inadequate cybersecurity.</p>



<p>The Future of Security with <a href="https://www.entrust.com">Entrust</a></p>



 
 Investing in live identification solutions: Entrust has been at the forefront of developing future-proof security systems, like their partnerships with Onfido for live identification. 



 Securing digital assets: Using tools like hardware security modules (HSM) can safeguard critical business data. 
 



<p>Best Practices for Enterprises</p>



 
 Educate and train employees: From C-suite executives to the newest team members, everyone needs to understand the importance of security measures. 



 Limit data collection: Only store what is necessary, minimising the risk in case of a breach. 
 



<p>Identity-centric security solutions are the future of enterprise protection. By shifting the focus to identity management and implementing zero-trust frameworks, organisations can better protect their digital assets and reduce the risk of devastating breaches.</p>



<p>Thanks to Entrust for this insightful talk, and for supporting the Digital Trust Hui Taumata in 2024.</p>

<p>Observed annually on 16 September, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_16#Target_16.9:_Provide_universal_legal_identity">International Identity Day aligns with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16.9</a>, which aims to provide legal identity, including birth registration, to all people by 2030. While most of us can easily prove our identity, for millions around the world, the lack of legal identity remains a significant barrier to accessing even the most basic services.</p>



<p>If you’re reading this, the chances are that you have a legal identity and can prove it. But without one, life is vastly different. Without legal documentation, children may miss out on vaccinations and education, adults are unable to secure formal employment, access healthcare or welfare, vote in elections, start a business, use banking services, travel abroad, register their children’s births, or even claim inheritance or pensions. In effect, you don’t officially “exist.”</p>



 The Global Picture: Millions Left Behind 



<p>In 2021, the <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0040787">World Bank’s ID4D Global Dataset</a> reported that <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099020824141510923/p176341192f2c50e11bc5619be95c4fb2ed?_gl=1*1uivyea*_gcl_au*MjU0NDc3MDU5LjE3MjY2MjA3NjU.">over 850 million people worldwide had no way to prove their identity</a>. Around 540 million of these individuals were in Africa, and half of all women in low-income countries lacked identification. Although progress has been made since then, it is difficult to determine how much progress has been achieved until the next dataset is published.</p>



<p>Globally, civil registration programmes are being increasingly integrated with healthcare systems to ensure children are enrolled early. National birth registration initiatives have been launched or accelerated in countries like Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Papua New Guinea. This issue is not confined to low-income nations, as high-income countries, including <a href="https://ministers.dss.gov.au/media-releases/15276">Australia</a>, are also making strides in streamlining identity processes. A recent pilot in New South Wales, for instance, allowed parents to register the birth of their baby across federal and state government agencies using a single account. This “tell us once” approach eliminates the need for parents to interact with multiple government agencies—reducing up to seven separate interactions.</p>



 The Challenges Closer to Home 



<p>Whilst Aotearoa New Zealand may seem far removed from these global statistics, <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/blog/designing-proof-of-identification-that-works-for-everyone">we are not without our own identity challenges</a>. Certain groups in our population struggle to prove who they are, including rural communities, blind and deaf citizens, former refugees, unhoused people, those who have escaped domestic abuse, and individuals recently released from prison. These groups often remain legally invisible. This raises the question: can Aotearoa help address this before 2030, or will we run out of time to meet the goal?</p>



 Take Action and Learn More 



<p>International Identity Day serves as a reminder that the right to identity is fundamental. Without it, people are denied basic human rights. For a deeper understanding of this global issue and the progress being made, we recommend listening to the ID16.9 podcast, which offers valuable insights into the state of identity inclusion around the world. The podcast is available on Spotify, Apple, Google, or at<a href="https://id169.com/episodes"> ID16.9 podcast</a>.</p>



<p>As we move towards 2030, it is clear that achieving universal legal identity is not just about meeting a target set by the UN. It’s about unlocking access to opportunities, dignity, and human rights for everyone. Let’s continue to push for meaningful change, both here in Aotearoa and globally.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of Docusign?</p>



<p>Docusign’s mission is to bring agreements to life by accelerating the process of doing business and simplifying people’s lives. With its Docusign IAM platform, Docusign unleashes business-critical data that is trapped inside of documents and disconnected from business systems of record, costing businesses time, money, and opportunity. Using Docusign IAM, companies can create, commit, and manage agreements easily. Focusing on the ‘commit’ capability, where identity verification is more relevant, Docusign’s extensive portfolio of identity verification solutions make it simpler for stakeholders to commit to agreements through advanced, AI-enabled identity verification solutions and multiple levels of authentication. Supporting capabilities such as Phone authentication, ID verification, biometric detection, and FINTRAC-compliant-workflows, not only can signers easily confirm their identities, but senders (i.e. businesses) can also securely capture and store the identity information provided during the agreement completion process. This ensures that all parties are who they claim to be, and agreements are enforceable.</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Over the last few years we’ve seen the highest volumes of fraudulent cases ever on record (Cifas, Fraudscape 2024). Therefore, it’s understandable why we’re starting to notice drastically higher levels of regulatory scrutiny, and more requirements being imposed on businesses in terms of introducing strong identity verification methods for digital interactions. This scrutiny isn’t just in mature markets, but also in emerging ones where the rapid-adoption of new technologies that’s accompanying fast-paced growth, is necessitating urgent regulatory oversight. Therefore, having trustworthy digital identity for both existing and emerging markets is essential for secure, efficient, and inclusive digital economics. For emerging-economies specifically, widely available identity verification tools that are easy to use can help promote secure, sustainable and long-term economic growth that ensures equitable access to increasingly digital services.</p>
 



  
<a href="https://www.docusign.com/en-ca/products/identify"></a> 


<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>The local and international benefits of digital identities are transformative, in the sense that they can help enhance the security of increasingly digital interactions, improve the efficiency of these interactions, and also make them more accessible across various sectors. For example, the adoption of digital identities can further enhance trust in online interactions, making it easier for consumers to engage in e-commerce transactions. This will likely lead to the expansion of the digital economy in Canada, where secure and convenient online shopping experiences will become safer and, therefore, more adopted. Globally, this could drive the growth of e-commerce, particularly in developing economies where digital identities can securely bridge the gap between offline and online markets. That’s where Docusign’s portfolio of identity verification solutions comes in. Our extensive portfolio offers enhanced signer identification and authentication capabilities built into any agreement workflow, enabling organizations to transact a full range of agreements with increased trust and ease of use.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada has introduced a series of anti-fraud initiatives that have made a significant impact on combating various forms of fraud across the country (public awareness campaigns, industry collaboration (‘Canadian Bankers Association’s Fraud Prevention Month’), strong legislative frameworks (FINTRAC), etc.). These initiatives have made significant progress in reducing fraud, increasing awareness, and improving recovery efforts locally. By advocating for similar initiatives internationally, Canada can influence the global development of digital identity systems to ensure other countries can reap similar benefits. Through innovation, collaboration, and advocacy, Canada can help ensure that digital identity becomes a force for good in the global economy.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Focused on securing the online agreement space for everyone, Docusign joined the DIACC to help shape the future of digital identity in Canada and contribute towards developing a more secure, inclusive and beneficial digital agreement ecosystem for its Canadian customers. Being able to collaborate with like-minded industry leaders and drive innovation across the country makes DIACC membership a valuable investment for Docusign.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Agreements are based on intention and identity: organizations need to be able to trust that signers are who they say they are. The standard practice of verifying a signer’s identity is to send a link to the signer’s email address. But agreement value, sensitivity, business risk, regulation, or legal requirements can drive the need for enhanced identification. The challenge is to deliver stronger verification, while keeping the overall experience user-friendly. That’s where Docusign Identify comes in.

 Development vs Engagement in a Collaborative Setting <p>Our new Mozilla Foundation-funded Friends of the Earth ‘Green Screen’ project has the express aim of developing a set of AI principles that the climate movement can use. The project involves desk research and a gathering of experts to influence and contribute to these principles, creating a co-designed starter for ten that others can build upon. We will then take what we’ve learned to report for <a href="https://policy.friendsoftheearth.uk">the Friends of the Earth policy&nbsp;site</a>.</p><p>Part of this involves setting up an online roundtable to gather insights from a diverse range of experts. In our project kickoff call last week, we realised that clarifying the ambitions and aims of such an event is something we do instinctively.</p><p>We’re big fans of <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/expertise/community-calls/">community calls</a>, but the roundtable we will be putting together is something slightly different. In this post, we’re going to give you a few things to think about when you’re gathering people together to co-design a policy or set of best practices — or when you’re more on the development side of the continuum.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO The Development-Engagement continuum <p>First off, there’s tons of value in getting people together and working collaboratively towards something. There is also a lot of nuance in such an endeavour, so it’s best to understand what your long term goal for the project might be. We like to determine where on a continuum between ’development’ and ’engagement’ a particular project might&nbsp;sit.</p><p>Development is the side of the continuum that focuses on the final output of the project. This could be, for example, a report, article, or set of recommendations. Engagement, on the other hand, can serve as a launchpad for building community. While there may be outputs along the way, the main goal is to find and engage with people who are interested in a particular topic. As it happens, we’ve written extensively about <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/How-to-build-a-CoP.pdf">how to build a community of practice</a> in this short (and free!) resource.</p><p>If you’re mostly focusing on development, as we are with our Friends of the Earth (FoE) roundtable, you will need a different kind of preparation and facilitation than if you’re focused on a longer term community- building initiative.</p><p>Of course, many projects have an eye on both the short term and the longer term, and so are looking to do development and engagement. However, it’s important to understand that community building requires designated moderation, facilitation and a place to interact. If there is no one to actively manage and engage the community, it can become stagnant!</p> Co-designing for Development <p>It’s important to note that every collaborative effort does not need to lead to a fully fledged community. For example, with our FoE Green Screen project, the focus is very much on the set of principles that other organisations can build&nbsp;upon.</p><p>If you find yourself looking to engage a group of people around a particular project, like policy development or a set of principles, you should have a think about how your co-design event fits into the “project management triangle”.</p><p>Let’s take each point in&nbsp;turn.</p>PM triangle cc-by Laura Hilliger for&nbsp;WAO 1. Funding <p>How much funding is available for the co-design piece of your project? Can you afford to pay people to participate?</p><p>If you can pay people for their input, you absolutely should. Even a small portion of your overall budget can work, offering people a one-time fee or goodwill payment shows them that you value their contribution. However, we know that sometimes remuneration is not possible.</p><p>If there isn’t enough funding to pay people for their time, make sure you plan to spotlight their contribution in other ways. You can issue badges to contributors, ensure all contributors are named in final outputs and publicly thank people when you share the final&nbsp;outputs.</p>cc-by-nd Bryan Mathers for&nbsp;WAO 2. Scope <p>Based on the funding available, what is the scope of the collaboration? How can you ensure that you are building collaboratively?</p><p>Will you host a single event? You might also have three events or five of them. You might set a six month timeline for your project. Be clear about what you’re asking of people as you are asking them to participate. Are you inviting them to the first of a series of events or a singular event? Is there prep work or ‘homework’ involved? How will their contributions be attributed?</p><p>Together with other contributors, you’ll need to establish procedures to receive feedback and inputs, as well as how you will process them to create iterations. As always, documentation goes a long way and writing openly about the scope and decisions made along the way will help contributors understand the&nbsp;plan.</p> 3. Time <p>How much time and effort can you ethically ask others to put in? How much time are you putting&nbsp;in?</p><p>Depending on your budget, you’ll need to figure out how much time you need to complete your policy, principles, best practices or whatever the output actually is. You’ll also want to think about how much time you require from the people you’d like to&nbsp;invite.</p><p>If you are looking for open contributions to your project, it’s best to try to minimise the amount of time other people will need to participate. Help contributors give good insight quickly by asking specific questions and giving people the opportunity to give feedback via email or a voice&nbsp;text.</p> Bringing things&nbsp;together <p>The three sides of the project management triangle play together to shape your co-design event. Depending on your parameters, it might make sense to do some of the development work on your own and then ask for input and feedback. Alternatively, you might want to get everyone involved from the beginning and co-design the entire project through a series of events. Be adaptable and flexible as you begin to work with others and refer back to <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/the-business-case-for-working-openly-and-transparently-867e3fb04588">the 5 principles of open</a> to remind yourself of what it means to work&nbsp;openly.</p><p>Knowing where you sit on the ‘development/engagement’ continuum and mapping out your funding, scope and time will help you plan a codesign event that leads to great outputs and strengthened relationships.</p><p>Need help figuring out how to design your co-design initiative? <a href="https://weareopen.coop">Get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/building-a-co-design-event-39492530daad">How to build a co-design event</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Husnan Bajwa, Beyond Identity<br>Josh Cigna, Yubico<br>Jing Gu, Beyond Identity</p>



 Abstract 



<p>For enterprises that have implemented a second factor, such as SMS OTP, to mitigate the risk of credential stuffing, this paper will provide guidance on displacing passwords + OTP with passkeys.</p>



 Audience 



<p>This white paper is intended for ISRM and IT staff tasked with deploying and maintaining multi-factor authentication (MFA) sign-in processes.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>Many enterprises aiming to secure their workforces have deployed SMS and application-based one-time passcodes (OTPs) as an additional factor of authentication to passwords. This whitepaper is aimed at these organizations that are now considering a move to FIDO authentication with passkeys. While this whitepaper focuses on OTPs specifically, the discussion and recommendations can be generalized to any system using phishable second factors including application-based OTP and push notifications.</p>



<p>This whitepaper compares OTPs as an additional authentication factor to passwords and passkeys in terms of security, user experience and ease of deployment. And it provides general guidance about migrating from OTPs to passkeys in order to improve user experience while strengthening the organization’s overall security posture. The guidance within this paper will cover key steps for moving towards passkeys, including planning, use case identification and documentation, pilot considerations, as well as deployment and training guidance. This document targets low-assurance use cases, including internal authentication, external authentication and third party and B2B authentication strategies. Given that organizations typically implement OTPs as the second factor to passwords, for this document all references to OTPs should be assumed as being used as a second factor to passwords.</p>



<p>This document will not cover specific vendor technologies or implementations. For guidance on moderate or high assurance use cases please refer to additional <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">whitepapers published by the FIDO Alliance</a> [1]. As this document is a part of a series of whitepapers, it is recommended that the reader start with the <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/June-26-FIDO-EDWG-Spring-2023_Paper-1_Introduction-FINAL.docx.pdf">introductory document</a> [2].</p>

 2. OTP MFA vs Passkeys: Why Choose Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys offer several benefits to security, user experience, and ease of deployment when compared to OTPs.</p>



<p>2.1 Security </p>



<p>OTP-based MFA has been widely adopted to mitigate the risk of credential stuffing and reuse. SMS and authenticator application-based OTP are the most commonly deployed solutions due to their relative low-cost and ease of deployment across a broad set of users and use cases. The relative simplicity of this type of MFA, however, leaves it vulnerable to social engineering and many MFA bypass toolkits, because no bidirectional communication exists between the secrets generator and the validating identity provider (IDP), meaning that an OTP can be intercepted and used by a third party without the knowledge of the end user or IDP.</p>



<p>Additionally, OTP-based MFA requires trust in a device that an organization may not manage nor have visibility into its security posture. This means that organizations are relying on end-users to maintain the security of their own device and their ability to discern phishing attempts. While user training can help to address some of these attacks, historic guidance like checking for secure connections and familiar URLs, still relies on an ever-vigilant user base.</p>



<p>Passkeys provide phishing-resistant, replay-resistant sign-ins that reduce the cognitive load on users and strengthen organizations’ overall security posture. This is achieved because passkeys implement a cryptographic challenge-response protocol scoped to the relying party’s domain. The authenticators then rely on secure behaviors, like biometric proofs or PINS to unlock the credentials on the authenticator while retaining a user-friendly experience. With passkeys, an organization can have a strong first-factor of authentication for passwordless scenarios OR a strong second factor for traditional MFA workflows.</p>



<p>2.2 User Experience</p>



 
 Passkeys improve the user experience over passwords and OTPs in several ways, including: 



 Passkeys work even when there is poor cell coverage whereas SMS OTPs require mobile network connectivity. For example, a user can have wireless access on an airplane but are not permitted to use SMS. In this instance, the SMS OTP cannot be delivered whereas passkeys can be used to authenticate. 



 <a href="https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#autofill-ui">AutoFill UI</a> enables seamless integration within browsers on mobile devices and on desktops. 



 <a href="https://resources.yubico.com/53ZDUYE6/at/6r45gck4rfvbrspjxwrmcsr/Forrester_Report_Total_Economic_Impact_of_Yubico_YubiKeys.pdf?format=pdf">Up to four times faster login</a>, no need to wait for code delivery [3] 



 Protection against mis-keyed passwords and codes 



 Passkeys build on common behaviors for authentication like biometric proofs (face or fingerprint). 
 



<p>2.3 Ease of Deployment</p>



<p>For some micro, small, and medium sized businesses without large, dedicated support staff, end-user deployment of dedicated<br>authentication hardware tokens can create roadblocks. This includes both OTP hardware tokens or FIDO security Keys. Historically, the ease of deployment of SMS/App based OTPs made them a more favorable option. Procurement, logistics, and configuration are a constant battle fought by operations and IT teams. With updates to the FIDO2 ecosystem to expand the authenticator landscape, this problem is alleviated and allows the use of many different devices as passkey stores.</p>



 
 All of this comes together to mean that the deployment of passkeys is much easier and less costly compared to SMS OTP for a few reasons: 



 There is no SMS integration required. Enterprises will not need to configure or maintain interfaces with mobile carriers or third-party SMS vendors which reduces deployment complexity. 



 Enterprises will not have to pay per-transaction fees associated with SMS OTP therefore reducing the total cost of ownership for authentication. 



 FIDO authentication uses passkeys. Passkeys are simple to implement across a range of devices and applications. 



 SMS OTP rely on carrier-specific APIs or third-party vendor APIs that are not standardized which increases risk of vendor lock-in and lack of interoperability. 



 No time-synchronization is needed. Passkeys avoid the time-synchronization requirements of SMS time-bound OTPs (TOTPs). Codes don’t need to be entered within a short time window, and deliverability issues with SMS do not result in login failures. 
 



<p>FIDO authentication with passkeys has been embraced by operating system (OS) and browser providers. This existing OS support from most major vendors means that, in most cases, existing hardware in the enterprise, such as laptops, phones, and tables, can be leveraged to deploy FIDO with passkeys without costly updates and replacements.</p>



<p>In some cases, enterprises use shared, single user devices such as iPads. For these use cases, a passkey stored in the integrated platform authenticator may not be appropriate, since any user of the device has access to the credential. In these cases, organizations should use roaming authenticators (hardware security keys) to generate and store passkeys for use on the shared device. This offers the same ease of use and convenience. Keep in mind, there may be an additional cost to purchase and manage these hardware keys for users. In many cases using hardware keys there may be a need to issue users a second hardware key as a backup to reduce the risk of the user being locked out of their account(s).</p>



 3. Deployment Strategy for Migration from OTP to Passkeys 



<p>3.1 Identifying the Deployment Model</p>



<p>Planning for a successful passkey deployment requires organizations to consider the needs of the user and the computing devices they use in their role to maximize the utility of passkeys for staff. At a minimum, organizations should consider the following questions when planning a passkey deployment in order to make passkeys accessible to the broadest audience possible:</p>



 
 What kind of computing devices are used? 



 Are your users working on laptops or desktop computers? Mobile devices? Tablets? 



 Are the devices single user devices or multi-user (e.g., shared) devices? 



 Are the devices provisioned by the company or are users using their own personal devices at work? 



 Are there limitations on using USB ports, Bluetooth, or NFC? 



 Are there limitations on access to the internet? 



 Are your users commonly wearing gloves or masks which limit the use of on-device biometrics? 
 



<p>Based on the answers to the previous questions, organizations can choose one of a few types of authenticators to store user’s passkeys. The flexibility of passkeys means that organizations can mix and match as their security posture and UX needs dictate. Other documents in this series go into more detail on each type of authenticator.</p>



<p>3.2 Deployment Testing</p>



<p>After determining the deployment model and deploying a FIDO server with applications integrated, it is recommended that organizations use pilot groups to test registration, authentication, and recovery processes (see below) with users. Then use the feedback from the pilot to improve processes and address issues raised by the pilot population before embarking on a broad rollout of passkeys.</p>



 3.3 User Experience 



<p>3.3.1 Registration</p>



<p>Enterprises should implement a reliable registration process to ensure that users are correctly and securely associated with their passkeys, as stated in earlier FIDO whitepapers. The registration experience is critical to consider because it is a user’s first interaction with passkeys. Here are a few elements to consider when it comes to designing the registration experience:</p>



 
 Identity Proofing – Physically or remotely having the user prove their identity at the start of the registration process is recommended to ensure a strong, abuse resistant process. This may involve SMS OTP for the final time. 



 Self-service registration – Users use their existing credentials to bootstrap a new passkey. 



 Supervised registration – work with IT/helpdesk for registration. This reduces the risk associated with self-service models that are vulnerable to phishing the original creds. 



 Pre-provisioned credentials – high effort, high assurance, but a mechanism is needed to get the credential into the user’s hands. 



 Remote users – self-service or pre-provisioned, but a mechanism is needed to provide the PIN to the user to unlock the device the first time. 
 



<p>3.3.2 Sign-In</p>



<p>The first step in designing a FIDO deployment with passkeys is to understand the user base, common work paradigms, and available devices – phones, tablets, laptops, desktops. This step is critical because enabling user-friendly workflows that work with the user’s existing devices is core to developing a successful rollout.</p>



<p>Common users’ environments and equivalent suggestions include:</p>



 
 Environments with users who primarily operate on mobile devices or tablets – Look into built-in unlock capabilities. 



 Mixed device environments or environments that rely on a variety of SaaS tools – Leverage SSO provided by IDP or build flexible login workflows. 



 Shared accounts – FIDO RPs can be configured to allow for more than one credential to be associated with a login. Investigate<br>cross device hybrid authentication or roaming authenticators. 
 



<p>3.3.3 Recovery</p>



<p>Any authentication process is only as strong as its weakest point, which is why recovery processes have often been abused by attackers to compromise systems. Synced passkeys are durable credentials that can survive device loss and unintentional wiping by restoring from a passkey provider and reduce the need to perform account recovery to establish new credentials for the user. With passkeys, users are expected to lose their credentials less frequently. However, there may be cases where passkeys, or access to the passkeys, is lost, thus requiring account recovery.</p>



<p>For passkey implementations utilizing device-bound passkeys that cannot be backed up or recovered, account recovery should be performed using the backup authentication method, such as using a backup authenticator, to bootstrap enrollment of a new authenticator. In the event that a backup authentication mechanism is not available, organizations must provide alternative pathways to recovery. Organizations should take a risk-based approach to designing and implementing account recovery systems. The specific implementation details will vary widely depending upon organizational requirements. In general, recovery mechanisms should never depend on weaker factors than the credential that the user is trying to recover. In the case where passkeys need to be re-registered, organizations should design mechanisms, either automated or manual, to prevent the use of passkeys no longer registered to that user.</p>



<p>For passkey implementations where synchronized passkeys are used, be sure to document the bootstrapping/enrolment process for new devices as well as building a risk averse process (including identity proofing) for full provider account recovery or replacement. While these catastrophic events should be low, it may still be necessary to have users go through this process. Knowing the proper process ahead of time will insulate organizations against manipulations and stop work events.</p>



<p>For additional considerations around account recovery, please see the FIDO Alliance’s <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FIDO_Account_Recovery_Best_Practices-1.pdf">Recommended Account Recovery Practices for FIDO Relying Parties</a>. [5]</p>



<p>3.4 Admin Considerations:</p>



<p>Monitoring of implementation and adoption metrics are critical to ensuring the success of the deployment and ensuring that the security benefits of FIDO authentication with passkeys is realized. Below are recommendations for metrics and processes that are indicative of the success of enterprise passkey migrations.</p>



<p>3.4.1 Monitoring and Visibility into Utilization</p>



<p>Admins are strongly encouraged to use groups or other segmentation structures to allow graceful transition of subsets of users and applications to passkeys. Pilot populations should be carefully constructed and should be composed of a variety of end user types and levels in the organization. Monitoring the usage of items below, both before and after the migration, will provide critical insights into the effectiveness of the program and guide important adjustments.</p>



 
 Device enrollment:
 
 How long did it take the user to enroll their first device? 
 
 



 Security events:
 
 Where was the device at time of onboarding? 



 What, if any, identity proofing approaches were used to ensure that the correct user was onboarded? 



 If manager, IT support, or peer approval workflows were used, who provided attestation? 



 Are there any time of day or device location anomalies that did not previously exist? 
 
 



 User authentication:
 
 Was the user able to successfully authenticate? 



 Are there any observable changes in their daily authentication patterns that would suggest problems or added friction? 



 Does analysis of day-of-week and time-of-day suggest any issues? 
 
 



 Key management:
 
 Are keys being used as expected and only from known devices? Some authenticators support device attestation which provides key provenance and assurance of the identity of the authenticator. If the source of the passkey is an important security control for your implementation, be sure to verify if your chosen authenticator solution supports this kind of attestation. 



 How many keys are associated with an individual’s account? Normal guidance would be to expect the number of passkeys associated with a user’s account to be close to the number of devices that a user leverages. For example, if your users use Android phones &amp; Windows laptops then you should expect to see two to three passkeys associated with a users’ account, one stored on each platform authenticator, and possibly one backup from a security key. In this scenario if an account had five to six passkeys registered, then it would be time to investigate and potentially remove excessive keys. Every organization’s definition of excessive may vary, and should be defined based on observations from their environment. Additionally, depending on your deployment, consider the number of applications that you have enabled for passkey authentication. If you deployed passkeys as credentials for an SSO integration, your users may only have one passkey per device. If you deployed passkeys on an application-specific basis, there may be one passkey per device per application. Organizations are recommended to monitor the number of keys associated with each user and use this data as context for informing passkey management. 
 
 



 Whose keys are associated with administrative/service/break-glass accounts? In the same way that it is best practice to segregate administrative access from normal user access, generating a separate set of passkeys for administrative accounts is also recommended. If they are shared, be sure to include rotation, monitoring, and good cleanup practices. 



 How will passkeys be removed?If an employee leaves the company or moves into a different role, their accounts should be disabled, deleted, or access should be evaluated and vetted. In situations where this is not reasonable due to legal requirements, passkeys should be promptly removed to prevent unauthorized account access as part of the disablement process. Similarly, if a user reports a device missing or stolen, any passkeys associated with those devices should also be removed. 



 Compatibility assurance:
 
 Do any combinations of applications and endpoint platforms show unusual changes or decline in authentication events? 



 Are all invocation methods for passkey authentication continuously functioning, including after upgrades? 
 
 
 



 Next Steps: Get Started Today 



 
 Enterprise organizations should consider migrating to FIDO authentication where possible. 



 Use FIDO standards. 



 Think about what your relying parties are supporting as well as your own enterprise security requirements. 



 Passkeys are far more secure than traditional OTP mechanisms. 



 Passkeys are far more secure than passwords. Look for the passkey icon on websites and applications that support passkeys.

<p>By Eric Drury</p>



<p>If you’re in the digital trust space, like me you might be encouraged by the number and variety of inspiring developments—appearing on an almost weekly basis—which illustrate the momentum that responsible technology is gaining in the drive towards a more trustworthy and sustainable future.</p>



<p>One of the latest and more interesting initiatives comes—yet again—from the Kingdom of Bhutan in the form of <a href="https://gmc.bt/">Gelephu Mindfulness City</a> (GMC). GMC is the Kingdom’s unique version of a smart city. They call it a Special Administrative Region, integrating economic growth with mindfulness, holistic living, and sustainability.</p>



<p>How does digital trust fit into GMC?</p>



<p>In October of last year, Bhutan launched the world’s first self-sovereign national digital identity system, <a href="https://www.bhutanndi.com/">Bhutan NDI</a>. And as a pillar of digital public infrastructure (DPI), a digital identity system forms the basis for trusted interactions between individuals, government, and business.</p>



<p>The NDI system, which Bhutan is currently rolling out nation-wide, will be part of the core infrastructure that provides cutting-edge digital connectivity for GMC. As such, this is an exciting opportunity to further cement the viability of emerging SSI and other trust technologies for implementation at population scale.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP is proud to have contributed to Bhutan’s NDI system both formally and informally.</p>



<p>Drummond Reed, one of ToIP’s founding board members, provided inspiration—and a road map of sorts—for the development of SSI systems via the book he co-authored called ‘<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity – Decentralized Digital Identity and Verifiable Credentials</a>’. Drummond and other ToIP members also provided expertise and input for Bhutan’s National Digital Identity Act, the <a href="https://parliament.bt/uploads/topics/16920885498838.pdf">NDI Act of Bhutan</a>, relying heavily on the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/02/01/the-toip-foundation-releases-its-first-official-governance-specifications/">ToIP governance metamodel</a> which was developed by the ToIP’s Governance Stack Working Group led by Scott Perry.</p>



<p>For an in-depth case study on the Bhutan NDI program, refer to <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Case-Study-Bhutan-NDI-National-Digital-Identity-ToIP-Digital-Trust-Ecosystems-V1.0-2024-05-21.ext_.pdf">Bhutan NDI, Digital Trust Ecosystem</a>, written by DHI’s Pallavi Sharma and Eric Drury, co-chair of ToIP’s Ecosystem Foundry Working Group.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP and Gelephu Mindfulness City further align in that both espouse the intertwining of governance and technology as a core enabler of digital trust.</p>



 
 From a governance perspective, GMC blends robust policies that ‘build trust and accountability with mindful incentives designed to empower both residents and businesses alike to reach their fullest potential’. 



 From a technology perspective, Gelephu Mindfulness City will be built on a foundation of ‘world-class infrastructure seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art technology with sustainable practices’. 
 



<p>In support of GMC, the Kingdom is convening the first <a href="https://www.bhutan-innovation-forum.org/">Bhutan Innovation Forum</a> (BIF), a global initiative uniting international leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs to support Bhutan’s vision of a Mindfulness City.</p>



<p>The BIF takes place in less than two weeks, October 1-3, 2024. ToIP members Drummond Reed and Eric Drury are honored to be invited to attend, representing the ToIP community and continuing the engagement with Bhutan’s digital trust community.</p>



<p>Drummond and Eric will appear on panels to promote the principles of digital trust and will share their experience and expertise on all things digital trust, including the emergence of cross-border digital trust networks.</p>



<p>ToIP is thrilled to once again walk the path with Bhutan towards a more sustainable, trustworthy, and equitable digital future. We look forward to sharing our learnings after the Forum so that the entire digital trust community benefits.</p>

  <p>As we enter the second half of 2024, a time full of global digital governance initiatives, we're excited to share our progress at the Human Colossus Foundation from the governance perspective. This update encapsulates the recent strides of the Swiss E-ID, G20 Digital Public Infrastructure, UN Development Program, and the inaugural event for European Digital Independence.</p> Distributed Governance  Progress update <p>In the summer of 2023, the Human Colossus Foundation published Part 1 of the HCF Distributed Governance Model<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.07280">[1]</a>. The model, though abstract in concept, tackles governance through the lens of the Principal-Agent problem. The core idea is to view information systems (i.e. technology) as agents serving users (i.e. humans) -whether individuals, businesses or any sovereign organisation with a decision power.&nbsp;</p>





















  
  














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                

            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>In today's hyper connected digital society, we lose control over information. It has become challenging to know what happens to the data we share and even more difficult to assess the accuracy of the data we use. Part 1 addressed this need for control and accuracy by introducing a governance framework integrating digital technology with existing (non-digital) frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>While Part 1 lays the conceptual foundation, Part 2 turns theory into action. By collaborating directly with the key players in digital transformation across various sectors, we are building the technology stack that will demonstrate the crucial role of data authenticity and integrity in shaping a digital governance model. This practical approach is a prerequisite to our future work on AI governance for example.</p><p>Therefore, Part 2 develops a concept into a reality we shape through multiple projects. We are well underway and excited to share the progress here.</p> <br>Switzerland’s E-ID - a Sovereign Digital Legal Identity

  <p>HCF Contribution: In 2023, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) published a <a href="https://www.governance4id.org">Legal Digital Entity Framework[7]</a>. Within that framework, UNDP develops the model governance assessment for data exchanges that respect the country's (i.e. sovereign entities) existing governance and fundamental Human Rights principles. The Human Colossus Foundation is part of a UNDP Advisory Board that provides its expertise in developing this work.</p>





















  
  



 


   Current Work at the Foundation: <p>The above initiatives provide input for the continuous development of the core HCF technologies. They help to demonstrate the essential relevance of accurate data for digital governance. From a governance perspective, we can summarise them as follows:</p>  <p>The 'Ambient Infrastructure' is a reputation-based authentication system built upon the decentralised key management infrastructure KERI (Key Events Log Receipts Infrastructure). Launched in 2023 as part of the <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/decentralized-key-management-infrastructure-for-ssi-by-the-human-colossus-foundation/">EU Horizon 2020 eSSIF-Lab project[9]</a>, the Ambient Infrastructure is now advancing in NextGen, an EU Horizon project focused on personalised cardiovascular medicine.</p>  <p><a href="https://oca.colossi.network">Version 2.0 of the OCA specification[4]</a>  supporting the OCA ecosystem. Decentralised semantics architectures are significant developments for digital governance to&nbsp; ensure the respect of different sovereign digital governance.</p>  <p>OCA Ecosystem v1.0. Community based solutions and tooling including extensions (i.e. overlays not part of the core specification). The Human Colossus Research and Technology Councils have open a dedicated focus group to collect community requirements.</p>  <p>This ecosystem, featuring a suite of tools and protocols, ensures consistent and interoperable&nbsp; data flows across multiple stakeholders and jurisdictions.</p> Conclusion <p>The Human Colossus Foundation has a busy autumn ahead. If you would like to help map a distributed governance framework into real-world applications, the HCF Research Council invites you to join its new Focus Group.</p><p>Joining this group will provide you with the opportunity to work closely with our team, share your expertise, and help shape the future of digital governance. We are also expanding our network of subject matter experts.

 Part 3: Identifying leverage&nbsp;points <p>This is the third in a series of posts about Systems Thinking, an approach that helps us make sense of complex situations by considering the whole system rather than just the individual pieces from which it is constituted.</p><p>This series is made up&nbsp;of:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-51d6e4f9df0b">Part 1: Three Key Principles</a>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-77eb29d510a4">Part 2: Understanding Feedback&nbsp;Loops</a>  Part 3: Identifying Leverage Points (this&nbsp;post)  <p>In the first post, we laid the groundwork by exploring the foundational principles of Systems Thinking. We then explored feedback loops in the second post, examining how they drive system behaviour and contribute to stability or&nbsp;change.</p><p>In this concluding post, we turn our attention to Leverage Points — those critical areas within a system where a small shift can lead to profound changes. By understanding and identifying these points, you can uncover powerful opportunities for intervention, allowing you to drive meaningful and lasting change within complex&nbsp;systems.</p> 1. What are leverage&nbsp;points? <p>“When we must deal with problems, we instinctively refuse to try the way that leads through darkness and obscurity. We wish to hear only of unequivocal results, and completely forget that these results can only be brought about when we have ventured into and emerged again from the darkness.” — Carl&nbsp;Jung</p><p>Leverage points are specific areas within a system where a small change can produce a significant impact on the entire system. These points often require careful analysis and a deep understanding of the system’s structure and behaviour, as they are not always immediately obvious. Identifying leverage points can be challenging because they are often hidden beneath the surface of the system’s visible components.</p><p>For example, in the world of technology, offering short, simple, clear (e.g. no legalese) ‘Terms and Conditions’ might be a leverage point. By helping users understand exactly how your organisation uses their data, you might improve customer satisfaction, increase trust, and reduce misunderstandings — all by making it easy for people to understand your company’s policy on&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Leverage points, therefore, offer a way to create meaningful change by focusing on areas where even minimal effort can lead to substantial results. Recognising these points requires stepping back and viewing the system holistically, understanding not just the individual parts but how they interact and influence each&nbsp;other.</p> 2. The role of paradigms in leverage&nbsp;points <p>“Inquiry is the controlled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation into one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and relations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a unified whole.” — John&nbsp;Dewey</p><p>Paradigms are the underlying beliefs and assumptions that shape how we understand and interact with a system. These paradigms represent some of the most powerful leverage points, as changing a paradigm can fundamentally alter the way a system operates. Shifting these beliefs requires questioning what is often taken for granted and being open to new perspectives.</p><p>To go back to our Terms and Conditions example, a paradigm shift from prioritising user convenience to emphasising data privacy can serve as a transformative leverage point. Traditionally, many tech companies have focused on creating products that are easy to use, often at the expense of data privacy. However, as the paradigm shifts towards valuing privacy, we see significant changes in how technologies are designed and deployed.</p><p>This shift has been significantly driven by policy changes, such as the implementation of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR has forced companies to rethink how they collect, store, and manage user data, prioritising privacy by design. As a result, this new perspective has encouraged the development of more secure products, the adoption of stricter data management practices, and an overall increase in consumer trust. The influence of GDPR illustrates how policy can drive paradigm shifts, leading to widespread changes not just in product development but also in corporate strategies, legal frameworks, and consumer expectations. This example demonstrates the profound impact that changing a paradigm, supported by regulatory measures, can have on an entire&nbsp;system.</p><p>By addressing paradigms, especially through supportive policies, you are working at the root of the system’s behaviour. Changing the underlying beliefs that drive a system can lead to widespread and lasting change, making paradigm shifts one of the most effective leverage points in Systems Thinking.</p> 3. Small, incremental changes as leverage&nbsp;points <p>“Of any stopping place in life, it is good to ask whether it will be a good place from which to go on as well as a good place to remain.” — Mary Catherine Bateson</p><p>Small, well-placed actions can serve as powerful leverage points within a system. These might involve slight adjustments in policy, processes, or resource allocation. The key is to identify where these small changes can have a disproportionately large impact, leading to significant shifts in the system without the need for extensive interventions.</p><p>For example, in the context of data privacy, implementing a small but strategic change, such as requiring explicit user consent for data sharing, can have a profound impact. A great example of this is the introduction of GDPR-compliant consent forms across digital platforms in the EU. This seemingly minor policy change has led to a significant increase in user awareness and control over their personal data, contributing to greater trust in online services. The increased transparency and control have demonstrated how a small, well-placed policy change can lead to substantial benefits for both users and organisations, highlighting the power of incremental changes at the right leverage&nbsp;points.</p><p>The success of such small interventions lies in their ability to trigger widespread behavioural changes without the need for drastic overhauls. By carefully identifying and implementing these changes, we can achieve meaningful and lasting impacts across various&nbsp;systems.</p> 4. Communication as a leverage&nbsp;point <p>“We are changed not only by being talked to but also by hearing ourselves talk to others, which is one way of talking to ourselves. More exactly, we are changed by making explicit what we suppose to have been awaiting expression a moment before.” — Geoffrey&nbsp;Vickers</p><p>Communication within a system can serve as a crucial leverage point. The way information is shared and understood can significantly influence the system’s behaviour, impacting everything from decision-making processes to overall system efficiency. Improving communication channels, ensuring transparency, and making sure all stakeholders are heard can lead to more effective decision-making and positive outcomes.</p><p>For instance, in our work at We Are Open Co-op, practicing open communication and transparency is central to our project management approach. By sharing progress, challenges, and decision-making processes openly with all stakeholders, we foster a culture of trust and collaboration. This openness extends to how we handle privacy; by being transparent about how we collect, use, and protect data, we build confidence among our partners and clients. Implementing tools that enable open documentation and communication, such as public repositories or shared workspaces, not only keeps everyone informed but also reinforces accountability and integrity in our practices. This small adjustment in how information is shared and protected can lead to significant improvements in project outcomes, ensuring that tasks are completed effectively while respecting privacy concerns.</p><p>The power of communication as a leverage point lies in its ability to unify and align the various components of a system. By enhancing the flow of information and ensuring that all voices are heard, you can create a more cohesive, responsive, and effective system.</p> 5. Feedback Loops as Leverage&nbsp;Points <p>“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think.” — Gregory&nbsp;Bateson</p><p>Feedback loops, as discussed in the second post, can also act as leverage points within a system. By altering how these loops operate, you can influence the system’s overall behaviour. Identifying and adjusting these loops — whether reinforcing (positive) or balancing (negative) — can be a powerful way to steer the system toward desired outcomes.</p><p>For example, in the context of data privacy, feedback loops between user behaviour and data management practices can be effectively leveraged to enhance privacy protection. By providing users with real-time feedback on how their data is being used and giving them the ability to adjust their privacy settings, you create a positive feedback loop. As users become more aware of how their data is handled, they are often motivated to take greater control over their privacy settings. This increased control leads to further trust in the platform, encouraging users to engage more actively with privacy tools. Over time, this feedback loop can significantly strengthen overall data protection practices, leading to better compliance with regulations and higher user satisfaction.</p><p>This example highlights how adjusting feedback loops can lead to substantial changes in system behaviour with relatively simple interventions. By strategically modifying these loops, you can achieve desired outcomes more effectively and sustainably.</p> Conclusion <p>Leverage points offer powerful opportunities to influence complex systems with relatively small, strategic actions. By identifying where these points lie and understanding how to use them effectively, you can create meaningful and lasting change within any system. Whether you are looking to improve organisational processes, drive social change, or enhance personal decision-making, the principles of Systems Thinking can help you navigate complexity with greater clarity and&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>This post, along with the previous two in this series, provides an introduction to the foundational principles of Systems Thinking and their practical applications. These insights are drawn from my studies toward an MSc in Systems Thinking in Practice through the Open University, and they are just the beginning of what Systems Thinking can&nbsp;offer.</p><p>If you’re interested in applying these principles to your work, We Are Open Co-op is here to help you implement effective systemic interventions tailored to your unique challenges. Thank you for following this series — your journey into Systems Thinking doesn’t have to end here. Continue to explore, apply, and refine these concepts, and watch how they can transform the way you approach complex problems.</p> References   Ackoff, R.L. (1974).

<p>OASIS and the KMIP TC are pleased to announce that KMIP Version 3.0 and KMIP Profiles Version 3.0 are now available for public review and comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The OASIS KMIP TC works to define a single, comprehensive protocol for communication between encryption systems and a broad range of new and legacy enterprise applications, including email, databases, and storage devices. By removing redundant, incompatible key management processes, KMIP will provide better data security while at the same time reducing expenditures on multiple products.</p>

<p>1. What is the mission and vision of IndyKite?</p>



<p>Backed by leading venture firms and based in San Francisco, IndyKite is building a new category of data management and digital identity services by capturing, connecting and controlling data across the enterprise and surrounding ecosystem. With an identity-centric approach to data, IndyKite enables companies to achieve higher trust in their data products, AI and applications with enhanced visibility, data governance and granular access controls. Leveraging knowledge graph technology and machine learning, IndyKite delivers a powerful operational data layer to enable developers with flexible APIs through a growing open-source ecosystem. Learn more at [www.indykite.com](http://www.indykite.com/)</p>


 
 
 
<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Digital identity is a core enabler of applications and services and will only become more important in the future. Digital identity not only applies to humans, but also to all devices, applications, systems, AI, digital products and even individual data points. Securing these identities is paramount, but even more important, is understanding how they drive and enable user experience, functionality and data mobility across the organization. At IndyKite, we see digital identity as the starting point for enabling businesses to build modern solutions, deliver incredible customer experiences and ensure trustworthy AI.</p>
 



  
<a href="http://www.indykite.com"></a> 


<p></p>
 
 
 


<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Modern organizations around the world are undermined by siloed data and disconnected identities. The advent of AI tools is increasing pressure for leaders to address data challenges in the organization to ensure future viability. IndyKite enables organizations to capture, connect and control their data in a flexible and dynamic way, to drive better decisions, security, machine learning and AI and solve challenges.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space? </p>



<p>Canada holds a place of global influence as a leading voice in many sectors. By pioneering a secure and accessible digital identity framework, Canada has ensured the sustainability of its modern economy into the future and created a blueprint for other nations to follow.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>As digital identity is a an essential part of the future, it needs modern approaches and frameworks that enable innovation, without being restricted by legacy thinking. DIACC is an ideal forum for public and private sector leaders to discuss, design and accelerate these approaches to ensure digital trust into the future.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Powered by graph technology, the IndyKite platform increases visibility, trust and control of your data. This enables data pipelines to get the right data, to the right place and in the right context to drive enhanced product development and new revenue channels. It also enables the secure sharing of data beyond the bounds of your organization, and better customer journeys with native identity workflows.

<p>OASIS and the LEXIDMA TC are pleased to announce that DMLex V1.0 CSD04 is now available for public review and comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DMLex is a data model for modelling dictionaries (here called lexicographic resources) in computer applications such as dictionary writing systems. DMLex is a data model, not an encoding format. DMLex is abstract, independent of any markup language or formalism. At the same time, DMLex has been designed to be easily and straightforwardly implementable in XML, JSON, NVH, as a relational database, and as a Semantic Web triplestore.</p>

 What to Do When Your User Research Project Starts to Veer Off&nbsp;Course <p>User research is a journey, and like any journey, it doesn’t always go exactly as planned. We’ve written previously about <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/demystifying-user-research-e345d309abab">starting your own user research journey</a> and <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/key-questions-for-user-research-design-5edfab6046dd">questions to ask</a> that can help get you off on the right&nbsp;foot.</p><p>Sometimes though, despite all best intentions and diligent planning with your chosen selection of <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/pre-mortem/">pre-mortems</a>, checklists, Gantt charts, or Kanban boards, a user research project can still go off&nbsp;course.</p><p>There are many reasons why this might happen, and many may seem well beyond your control. In this post, we’ll share some strategies we’ve found helpful in regaining momentum and getting a project back on&nbsp;track.</p> Common Issues in User&nbsp;Research cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a><p>Before we explore solutions, it’s important to recognise some of the issues that can derail a user research&nbsp;project.</p>  Unclear Objectives<br>Without a clear understanding of what you want to find out, your project can quickly lose focus. For example, if you’re researching a digital tool’s usability but haven’t defined whether you’re focusing on ease of navigation, visual design, or performance, you may end up collecting feedback that’s too broad or irrelevant. This can lead to scattered efforts and data that doesn’t fully answer the questions you initially set out to explore. Clarity in your objectives also helps you stay within scope — after all, projects that become too complex or overly broad can be difficult to&nbsp;manage.  Recruitment Challenges<br>Finding the right participants is crucial, but sometimes, despite your best efforts, recruitment doesn’t go as planned. You may find that a particular community or demographic is underrepresented or face difficulty finding enough respondents due to limited access or poor engagement. This can delay your project and result in a participant pool that’s not as diverse or representative as it needs to&nbsp;be.  External Dependencies<br>Often, research projects rely on external factors like stakeholder input, third-party data, or collaboration with other teams. For example, you could be relying on receiving data from a partner organisation or feedback from a legal team before being able to proceed. When these dependencies fall through, your project can come to a standstill.   Strategies to Get Back on&nbsp;Track cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a><p>Now that we’ve identified some common issues, let’s look at how you can regain momentum and steer your project back on&nbsp;course.</p>  Revisit and Refine Objectives<br>If your project is losing direction, it might be time to revisit your initial objectives. What is the overarching research question you’re trying to answer? Is your objective still relevant? Do they need to be refined based on what you’ve learned so far? Narrowing or reaffirming your focus can help streamline your efforts and ensure that the data you collect is meaningful and actionable.  Simplify Your Scope<br>If you’ve taken on more than you can manage, don’t hesitate to simplify your project’s scope. Focus on the most critical questions and the areas that will have the greatest impact. It’s better to complete a smaller, focused project successfully than to stretch resources too thin across a larger, unfocused one.  Adapt Your Recruitment Approach<br>When recruitment isn’t going as planned, consider adapting your approach. If your initial outreach didn’t yield the desired results, explore alternative channels or adjust your criteria. Techniques like reaching out through community organisations or leveraging existing networks can help you connect with a broader range of participants while maintaining diversity and inclusivity.  Adjust Your Methods<br>If certain methods aren’t yielding results, be flexible and try different approaches. For example, if individual interviews aren’t providing the depth of insight you need, consider adding focus groups? The ability to adjust and adapt is a strength in user research.  Communicate and Realign with Stakeholders<br>If external dependencies are causing delays, clear communication is key. Communicate with stakeholders regularly to identify any roadblocks and realign expectations. Perhaps your pre-mortem <a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/pre-mortem/">foresaw some of the issues that have emerged and have a plan to mitigate already in place</a>? Sometimes, simply clarifying timelines or adjusting deadlines can help get things moving&nbsp;again.  Refresh the Team<br>If a project is dragging on and fatigue is setting in, prioritise tasks based on their impact and feasibility. Reassign team members or bring in extra help if possible. Sometimes, a fresh perspective or additional hands can help push through bottlenecks.   Staying Resilient: Embrace the Learning&nbsp;Process cc-by-nd <a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/">Bryan Mathers</a> for&nbsp;<a href="https://weareopen.coop/">WAO</a><p>Remember, setbacks and challenges in user research are not uncommon, especially when working to include a wide range of voices and experiences. Each obstacle offers an opportunity to learn, grow, and improve your approach. By staying resilient, being flexible, and maintaining clear and empathetic communication, you can navigate difficulties and ensure that your research is both inclusive and impactful.</p><p>Ultimately, the ability to adapt and respond thoughtfully to challenges is what strengthens your user research and makes it more effective. Every project, even those that face hurdles, contributes valuable lessons that can be applied to future work. Embrace these lessons, and use them to enhance your research practices, ensuring that all voices are heard and&nbsp;valued.</p><p>Need help?

<p>OASIS and the OpenC2 TC are pleased to announce that OpenC2 Actuator Profile for Packet Filtering Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>OpenC2 is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems, and systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms, or other aspects of the implementation. This specification defines an Actuator profile for Packet Filtering (PF). Packet filtering is a cyber defense mechanism that denies or allows traffic based on static or dynamic properties. The Actuator profile collects Actions, Targets, Arguments, and Specifiers along with conformance clauses to enable the operation of OpenC2 Producers and Consumers in the context of PF.&nbsp;&nbsp;The documents and all related files are available here:<br></p>

<p>Most of us today are accustomed to unlocking our smartphones with a simple glance or touch. In the blink of the tech industry’s eye, biometric authentication has quickly become a normal part of our daily lives.</p>



<p>Consumers love the convenience and security of biometrics, which has helped propel its growth and mainstream adoption. In the FIDO Alliance’s last global <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/barometer-2023/">barometer survey</a>, biometrics ranked top as the most secure and the preferred way to log in by consumers.</p>



<p>But for biometrics to continue its success, there is a reputation issue and ‘elephant in the room’ that is holding back consumers, governments, and other implementers alike from full trust and confidence: bias.</p>



 Are biometric technologies biased? 



<p>Concerns have been circulating for some time about the accuracy of biometric systems in processing diverse demographics. In the UK in 2021, for example, Uber drivers from diverse ethnic backgrounds took <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/ex-uber-driver-takes-legal-action-over-racist-face-recognition-software">legal action</a> over claims its software had illegally terminated their contracts as its software was unable to recognize them.</p>



<p>In the FIDO Alliance’s recent study, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/remote-identity-verification-biometric-systems-consumer-insights-2024">Remote ID Verification – Bringing Confidence to Biometric Systems Consumer Insights 2024</a>, consumers made clear that they are concerned about bias in biometric facial verification systems.</p>



<p>While over half of respondents indicated they believe face biometrics can accurately identify individuals (56%), others in the survey report a different experience.&nbsp;</p>







<p>A quarter of respondents felt they had been discriminated against by biometric face verification systems (25%).</p>







<p>Organizations like NIST have been closely<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/12/nist-study-evaluates-effects-race-age-sex-face-recognition-software"> monitoring</a> the disparities in bias performance for some time – with NIST’s most recent <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_demographics.html">evaluation</a> ​​of solutions across different demographics released this year. The headline is: Not all biometric systems are created equal.</p>



<p>As face verification has become adopted globally, the accuracy in identifying diverse demographics has gone from weakness to strength, with most leading solutions today operating with extremely small margins of error. However, less sophisticated solutions do exist and are perpetuating a far bigger reputational and adoption challenge.</p>



 Inclusivity and accessibility in remote identity 



<p>Inclusivity is just one part of the problem. Bias impacts the entire user experience and erodes faith in the technology overall. Half of American and British consumers in the survey said they would <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-addresses-accuracy-bias-in-remote-biometric-identity-verification-technologies-industry-first-testing-certification-program/">lose trust</a> in a brand or institution if it were found to have a biased biometric system, and 22% would stop using the service entirely.</p>







<p>Remote identity solutions unlock huge benefits for governments, organizations, and consumers alike. Consider already how many more scenarios where we are asked to prove who we are virtually today – starting a new job, opening a bank account, signing legal documents. And, as outlined earlier, we know consumers already love using biometrics – 48% of those we surveyed preferred biometrics to enroll and verify themselves remotely.</p>



<p>However, the excitement of more remote identity solutions is understandably mixed with these bias concerns, causing some organizations to delay or reconsider implementation. We’re in an age where digital inclusivity is highly scrutinized, especially for public services, and governments are increasingly calling for a way to demonstrate equity.</p>



<p>Equitable biometrics systems are both a practical and a moral imperative. So how do we get there?&nbsp;</p>



 Addressing bias in biometric systems 



<p>The FIDO Alliance has launched its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/face-verification/">Face Verification Certification</a> program, with mitigating bias as a key priority. It assesses a face verification system’s performance across different demographics, including skin tone, age, and gender, in addition to far more wide-reaching security and&nbsp; performance tests.</p>



 Why is independent certification for biometrics important? 



<p>Currently, testing levels are completed on a case-by-case basis, per organization. This means it’s expensive and time-consuming, and what ‘good’ looks like varies widely. The FIDO Alliance’s program is based on proven ISO standards and has been developed by a diverse, international panel of industry, government, and subject matter experts. This means it is unrivaled in its ability to set equitable performance benchmarks.</p>



<p>More broadly, certification and independent global testing catalyze innovation and technological adoption. Whether launching an identity verification solution or including it in related regulations, open standards and certification set a clear performance benchmark. It removes considerable duplicated efforts, improves the confidence of all stakeholders, and ultimately drives up the performance of all solutions on the market.</p>



 How is bias evaluated? 



<p>At this time, the FIDO Alliance program considers false reject rate (FRR) for bias, using FRR methodology, and is measured at the transaction level across skin tone, age, and gender. ISO 19795-10 has multiple options for measuring differential performance. One option is described in the Section: Reporting differential performance against a benchmark (Section 7.4.2). In this approach, testers seek to compare the performance of one or more demographic groups to a specific benchmark. FIDO has chosen this approach given the small sample size of the individual groups (50+ per group). For skin tone, groups are defined and distributed across three brackets based on the Monk Scale. For gender, groups are defined and distributed across male, female, and other. For age, groups are defined and evenly distributed across four age brackets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benchmarks are set at 6% (95% confidence interval), based on bootstrapping simulations. These simulations covered a spectrum of scenarios, population sizes, correlation between attempts. The benchmark chosen reduces the probability that a group will be considered different when it actually is not, i.e., finding a difference by chance (&lt;5%).</p>



 What is the value of certification for Biometric Vendors? 



 
 Independent validation of biometric performance 



 Opportunity to understand gaps in product performance to then improve and align with market demands 



 Demonstrate product performance to potential customers&nbsp; 



 Improve market adoption by holding an industry-trusted certification 



 Leverage one certification for many customers/relying parties&nbsp; 



 Benefit from FIDO delta and derivative certifications for minor updates and extendability to vendor customers 



 Reduce need to repeatedly participate in vendor bake-offs 
 



 What is the value of certification for Relying Parties? 



 
 One-of-a-kind, independent, third-party validation of biometric performance assessing accuracy, fairness and robustness against spoofing attacks 



 Provides a consistent, independent comparison of vendor products – eliminating the burden of maintaining own program for evaluating biometric products 



 Accelerates FIDO adoption to password-less 



 Commitment to ensure quality products for customers of the relying parties&nbsp; 



 Requirements developed by a diverse, international group of stakeholders from industry, government, and subject matter experts 



 Conforms to ISO 



 FIDO Annex published in ISO standards 
 



 What is the value of certification with FIDO accredited laboratories? 



<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/laboratory-overview/">FIDO Accredited Laboratories</a> are available worldwide and follow a common set of requirements and rigorous evaluation processes, defined by the FIDO Alliance Biometrics Working Group (BWG) and follow all relevant ISO standards. These laboratories are audited and trained by the FIDO Biometric Secretariat to ensure lab testing methodologies are compliant and utilize governance mechanisms per FIDO requirements. Laboratories perform biometric evaluations in alignment with audited FIDO accreditation processes. In contrast, bespoke, single laboratory biometric evaluations may not garner sufficient trust from relying parties for authentication and remote identity verification use cases.</p>



 What are the other ISO Standards that FIDO certification conforms to? 



<p>In addition to ISO/IEC 19795-10, vendors and their accredited lab are adhering to the following ISO standards:</p>



Terminology<br>ISO/IEC 2382-37:2022 Information technology — Vocabulary — Part 37: BiometricsPresentation Attack Detection<br>ISO/IEC 30107-3:2023 Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 3: Testing and reporting<br>ISO/IEC 30107-4:2020 Information technology — Biometric presentation attack detection — Part 4: Profile for testing of mobile devices <br>– FIDO Annex, published 2024Performance (e.g., FRR, FAR)<br>ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 1: Principles and framework<br>ISO/IEC 19795-9:2019 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 9: Testing on mobile devices <br>– FIDO Annex, published 2019Bias (differentials due to demographics)<br>ISO/IEC 19795-10:2024 Information technology — Biometric performance testing and reporting — Part 10: Quantifying biometric system performance variation across demographic groups – FIDO Annex, under developmentLaboratory<br>ISO/IEC 17025:2017, General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories



 Enhancing Confidence in the Biometrics of Identity Verification 



<p>The FIDO Alliance continues to champion the cause of combating bias and enhancing security measures in remote biometric identity verification technologies through its <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/">Identity Verification</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/biometric-component-introduction/">Biometric Component</a> certifications. The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certification Programs</a> offer reliability, security, and standardization to certify biometric solutions for remote identity verification, and has specifically set benchmarks for face verification technologies to test for bias.</p>



<p>In addition to the Face Verification program, the FIDO Alliance emphasizes the importance of rigorous testing and certification processes in ensuring that identity verification solutions are trustworthy and secure, including the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/document-authenticity/">Document Authenticity (DocAuth)</a> Certification. These programs offer solution providers the opportunity to differentiate themselves in the market by leveraging FIDO’s independent, accredited test laboratories and industry-recognized brand.</p>

 Part 2: Understanding Feedback&nbsp;Loops <p>This is the second post in a series exploring the fundamentals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking">Systems Thinking</a>. This is an approach that helps us make sense of complex situations by considering the whole system rather than just its individual parts.</p><p>This series is made up&nbsp;of:</p>  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-51d6e4f9df0b">Part 1: Three Key Principles</a>  Part 2: Understanding Feedback Loops (this&nbsp;post)  <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/an-introduction-to-systems-thinking-8af6844edacd">Part 3: Identifying Leverage&nbsp;Points</a>  <p>In the first post, we explored the foundational principles of Systems Thinking: Drawing a Boundary, Multiple Perspectives, and Holistic Thinking. Now, we’ll build on that foundation by examining Feedback Loops, another crucial concept in Systems Thinking.</p><p>Feedback loops are essential for understanding how systems behave, adapt, and evolve over time. By mastering the dynamics of feedback loops, you can identify how small changes can ripple through a system, leading to significant outcomes, whether intended or unintended.</p> 1. What are feedback&nbsp;loops? <p>“You think that because you understand ‘one’ that you must therefore understand ‘two’ because one and one makes two. But you forget that you must also understand ‘and.’” — Donella&nbsp;Meadows</p><p>Feedback loops are the mechanisms by which systems regulate themselves. They can either reinforce a particular behaviour (positive feedback) or counteract it to maintain stability (negative feedback). Understanding these loops helps us see how systems respond to internal and external changes, leading to growth, adaptation, or stability.</p><p>For instance, a classic example of a negative feedback loop is a thermostat regulating room temperature. When the temperature rises above the set point, the thermostat turns off the heating. When the temperature drops below the set point, the thermostat turns the heating back on. This loop maintains the room’s temperature within a desired range, counteracting any deviations. The thermostat example clearly demonstrates how negative feedback loops work to maintain stability within a system, bringing it back to a set equilibrium when it deviates.</p><p>On the other hand, social media platforms often rely on positive feedback loops to increase user engagement. When a user interacts with content, the platform’s algorithm shows more similar content, increasing the likelihood of further engagement. This creates a reinforcing cycle where user behaviour drives more of the same behaviour, leading to increased overall engagement. This example illustrates how positive feedback loops can amplify behaviours, sometimes leading to rapid growth or creating echo chambers where only certain types of content are repeatedly reinforced.</p><p>Feedback loops are crucial for identifying how systems behave over time, which ties back to the principles we discussed in the first post, particularly the importance of considering Holistic Thinking.</p> 2. Negative feedback&nbsp;loops <p>“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think.” — Gregory&nbsp;Bateson</p><p>Negative feedback loops work to stabilise a system by counteracting changes. These loops are vital for maintaining equilibrium and preventing a system from spiralling out of&nbsp;control.</p><p>For example, in economics, the supply and demand mechanism operates as a negative feedback loop. When the supply of a product exceeds demand, prices tend to fall, which in turn reduces supply as producers cut back on production. Conversely, when demand exceeds supply, prices rise, encouraging increased production. This self-regulating process helps to stabilise markets by bringing supply and demand into equilibrium, preventing extreme fluctuations in prices and availability.</p><p>It’s important to understand that in the context of Systems Thinking, “negative” doesn’t imply something bad or undesirable. Instead, it refers to the type of feedback that counteracts changes, helping to stabilise a system and maintain equilibrium. Negative feedback loops are essential for preventing systems from spiralling out of control, ensuring they remain balanced and functional.</p> 3. Positive feedback&nbsp;loops <p>“The only thing harder than starting something new is stopping something old.” — Russell&nbsp;Ackoff</p><p>Positive feedback loops amplify changes in a system, often leading to exponential growth or decline. These loops are self-reinforcing, meaning that as a particular change occurs, it triggers more of the same change, leading to potentially dramatic&nbsp;effects.</p><p>For example, in the context of climate change, positive feedback loops play a significant role in accelerating global warming. One such loop involves the melting of polar ice. As the ice melts, less sunlight is reflected back into space, and more heat is absorbed by the Earth’s surface, which in turn leads to further ice melt. This self-reinforcing loop accelerates the warming of the planet, contributing to increasingly severe climate&nbsp;impacts.</p><p>Again, it’s important to note that a “positive” feedback loop doesn’t necessarily have morally beneficial consequences — rather, it refers to the amplifying nature of the loop itself, which can drive both beneficial and harmful&nbsp;changes.</p> 4. The interaction of Feedback Loops in&nbsp;Systems <p>“The purpose of a system is what it does.” — Stafford&nbsp;Beer</p><p>In most systems, positive and negative feedback loops do not operate in isolation; they interact with each other, creating complex and dynamic behaviours. This interaction can make systems resilient, allowing them to adapt to changes and maintain stability, or it can make them vulnerable, leading to oscillations, chaotic behaviour, or even collapse if not properly managed. Understanding how these loops interplay is crucial for effective system management and intervention.</p><p>In product management, the balance between feature usage and product complexity is shaped by the interaction of feedback loops. When a feature is widely used and appreciated, customer satisfaction increases, leading the product team to enhance or expand the feature (positive feedback). As the feature becomes more complex, it may introduce usability issues, decreasing customer satisfaction (negative feedback). This interaction helps maintain a balance within the product, ensuring it continues to meet customer needs without becoming overly complicated.</p><p>A similar interplay of feedback loops occurs when managing product adjustments. Increasing customer satisfaction through positive feedback can prompt further enhancements, which might initially appear beneficial. Yet, if these enhancements lead to excessive complexity, they may cause usability issues, frustrating users and resulting in negative feedback. This process highlights the delicate balance product managers must maintain to keep their product both innovative and user-friendly, illustrating the challenges of managing feedback loops in product development.</p><p>By recognising and analysing these interactions, systems thinkers can identify points of leverage where interventions can either reinforce desirable behaviours or counteract negative trends, leading to more stable and resilient systems.</p> 5. Recognising feedback loops in your&nbsp;work <p>“Taking action to improve a problematical situation will of course itself change that situation, so that the learning cycle could in principle begin again.” — Peter Checkland</p><p>Identifying and understanding feedback loops in your work or organisational context can be a game-changer. These loops are often the invisible threads that weave through processes, projects, and relationships, dictating outcomes and driving behaviours. By recognising these loops, you can gain a deeper understanding of the forces at play and make more informed decisions that lead to sustainable success.</p><p>Get started identifying feedback&nbsp;loops:</p>  Think of an area in your work where specific actions lead to similar&nbsp;outcomes  Identify the underlying feedback mechanism — is it positive or negative or are multiple loops at&nbsp;play?  Make adjustments to one part of the system and observe how the system&nbsp;changes  <p>Here’s an&nbsp;example:</p>  When our team meets a deadline, team morale improves and I’ve noticed that we often meet our deadlines with the same enthusiasm  This is a positive feedback loop — success breeds further&nbsp;success.  Figure out what works, and further incentivise it.  <p>Conversely:</p>  When our team misses a deadline, we tend to become stressed leading to further&nbsp;delays.  This is a negative feedback loop — the more stressed we are, the more we miss our deadlines.  We need a win, let’s deprioritise X and focus on Y because it’s an easier task. Then we’ll come back to X when team morale is improved.  <p>Recognising these loops allows you to take proactive steps. If you identify a positive feedback loop that is driving beneficial outcomes, consider how you might reinforce or expand this loop. Perhaps you could introduce additional incentives or recognition programs to further enhance the team’s motivation and productivity. On the other hand, if you uncover a negative feedback loop that is leading to undesirable results, it’s crucial to intervene early. For example, introducing stress management resources or adjusting timelines could help break the cycle and restore&nbsp;balance.</p><p>Feedback loops are not limited to project management; they are pervasive in all areas of work, from customer service to organisational culture. In customer service, a positive feedback loop might occur when excellent service leads to customer satisfaction, which in turn results in positive reviews and repeat business. Recognising this loop could lead to further investments in training and support for customer service teams. In organisational culture, a feedback loop could exist where open communication leads to trust, which fosters more open communication, creating a virtuous cycle of collaboration and innovation.</p><p>By consciously identifying and managing these loops, you can transform potential challenges into opportunities for growth and continuous improvement. This approach not only helps in achieving immediate goals but also contributes to the long-term resilience and adaptability of your organisation.</p> Conclusion <p>Feedback loops are a fundamental aspect of Systems Thinking, providing crucial insights into how systems evolve, adapt, and maintain stability. By identifying and analysing these loops, we gain the ability to predict the outcomes of our actions more accurately and craft interventions that are not only effective but sustainable.</p><p>At We Are Open Co-op, we specialise in applying Systems Thinking principles, including the detailed analysis of feedback loops, to help organisations navigate and resolve complex challenges.

<p>By LunarCrush and OriginTrail</p><p>In the rapidly evolving world of tech and finance, the demand for innovation and adaptability is higher than ever, driven by a quest for transparency for internet users. <a href="https://lunarcrush.com/">LunarCrush</a> has been at the forefront of Social Intelligence, converting human-driven insights into actionable information for both retail and institutional stakeholders. Originally focusing on the crypto industry, LunarCrush’s Social Intelligence now extends across diverse sectors such as technology, politics, travel, music, and more. Recognizing the convergence of crypto, the Internet, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), LunarCrush is making a significant leap forward in their transparency efforts through social intelligence. By launching the Social Intelligence Paranet on the <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)</a>, LunarCrush aims to enhance content collection through incentivized crowdsourcing and enable the creation of AI-powered services on this trusted knowledge base.</p> The Decentralized Knowledge Graph and the Social Intelligence Paranet <p>The Social Intelligence Paranet will operate on the OriginTrail DKG, a permissionless peer-to-peer network that ensures all social content published to the Paranet is discoverable, verifiable, and attributed to its owners. This setup allows AI services leveraging this knowledge base to avoid challenges like hallucinations, managed bias, and intellectual property violations. For an in-depth understanding of the technical design of paranets, DKG, and decentralized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (dRAG), we recommend reviewing the <a href="https://origintrail.io/documents/Verifiable_Internet_for_Artificial_Intelligence_whitepaper_v3_pre_publication.pdf">OriginTrail Whitepaper</a>.</p> The Social Intelligence Paranet Initiative <p>Aligned with LunarCrush’s growth trajectory, the Social Intelligence Paranet will initially target the crypto sector, attracting high-quality content creators and community members from various crypto projects.

 Abstract 



<p>Enterprises should consider using passkeys, especially if they are currently relying on passwords. By replacing these credentials with passkeys, enterprises will immediately reduce the risk of phishing and eliminate credential reuse, improving authentication service security. Different types of FIDO authenticators may be used to meet users’ needs with a balance between convenience and security. For enterprises that require high levels of identity assurance, internal security policies, or regulatory requirements, additional scrutiny is needed to determine the appropriate type of passkey. It is important to look at both the enterprise as a whole, as well as parts of the organization because high assurance requirements may not apply to the entire enterprise.</p>



<p>For many high assurance scenarios, attested device-bound passkeys may be more desirable. Relying parties with high assurance requirements will need to decide whether to accept all types of authenticators and adapt their authentication flow based on the attestation characteristics or reject registrations from unattested or unacceptable authenticators at the risk of a poor user experience.</p>



 Audience 



<p>This white paper is intended for IT administrators and enterprise security architects who are considering deploying FIDO authentication across their enterprises and defining life cycle management policies. This paper provides an overview of the different use cases for multi-factor authentication MFA and the FIDO Authenticator choices available to administrators. The intent is to help guide administrators in choosing the right authenticator types for their specific environment. Companies requiring higher levels of security, such as those involved in healthcare, government organizations, or financial institutions that have a hard requirement around the control of the credential, in particular should read this white paper.</p>



<p>It is assumed that the reader has an understanding of FIDO architecture, relying parties, protocols, and has read “FIDO EDWG 2023 Papers – Introduction” that introduces key concepts used in this white paper.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>This document focuses on deploying passkeys for enterprise users in high assurance environments.<br>Readers can find an introduction to the series of papers here. The introductory whitepaper provides additional descriptions and links to all papers in the series, which cover an array of use cases from low to high assurance. Most enterprises will likely have use cases that span more than one of these papers, and readers are encouraged to review the white papers relevant to their deployment environment.</p>



<p>This white paper examines what it means to be in a high assurance environment and how that may influence how FIDO is used. More specifically, the document addresses the challenges with password-only authentication and proposes passkeys as a stronger, phishing-resistant alternative to using passwords to authenticate users. Additionally, the document provides some adoption considerations for IT and security professionals to consider to ensure compliance with regulatory and security requirements for high assurance authentication scenarios. This white paper examines the use cases of registering a device, using a registered device, and dealing with recovering a lost device.</p>



<p>A key part in deciding if a passkey should be allowed in an environment is based on attestations. Attestations can be provided for credentials as part of the registration process, which relying parties can trust as provenance of the authenticator being used. For high assurance enterprise scenarios, attestations should always be requested. What can be discovered from the attestation associated with the credential, or the absence of any attestation, can help drive policy decisions about whether to accept the registration. Without any attestation, it may be difficult for the relying party to decide if the credential should be allowed. They may reject the registration outright, making for a poor user experience, or the enterprise may choose to employ additional, conditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) along with FIDO authentication to meet the high assurance requirements. With an attestation, the enterprise has assurances about the provenance, manufacture type, certifications, and features of the authenticator and often can rely on these assurances as MFA devices, providing multiple factors like credentials and a PIN to unlock the authenticator.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys work well in many use cases and can still work for some high assurance scenarios, depending on the security or regulatory requirements of the enterprise. Synced passkeys are attractive because of their recoverability and ease of use; however, they also change where credentials reside and who controls them. Given this external control of the credentials, some additional MFA may be desired for synced passkeys where the enterprise has control of the lifecycle management of the MFA method.</p>



<p>The remainder of this white paper will examine enterprises or organizations that have high assurance requirements based on Authenticator Assurance Levels [7] and FIDO Certified Authenticator Levels [8] to operate.</p>

 2. Passkey Use Cases 



<p>This section will focus on use cases around passkeys in an enterprise or an organization. There are many use cases for enterprises where synced passkeys work very well for ease and convenience in registering devices, using devices, and recovering lost devices since the credentials are available on other devices. It is highly recommended that organizations look at all the benefits of synced passkeys to determine if they are appropriate for the organization. However, the use of synced passkeys, while convenient, may not meet all the security requirements for an enterprise or organization needing high assurance (e.g., AAL3 requirements). AAL3 level has several requirements with the most significant being the use of a hardware-based authenticator. Please refer to NIST for more detail on the different levels of Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL) [7]. Quite often, AAL3 applies to companies and organizations requiring higher levels of security, such as those involved in healthcare, government, or finance, which have a hard requirement around the control of the credential, specifically, that it is device-bound and never copied.</p>



<p>2.1. Registration<br>The enterprise or organization should first consider what device(s) they will support in their environment and how they will manage the provisioning of devices. For example, an organization may support an environment where users can bring their own device (e.g., mobile phone), or an organization may have very strict requirements around issued devices that meet specific security requirements such as PIN length, particular user presence features, or even specific hardware models. Finally, organizations need to consider whether they will allow passkeys to reside on multiple devices or just a single device. This has both security and recovery implications that need to be considered.</p>



<p>Organizations may have use cases that require credentials to be device-bound and not copyable at all, in which case synced passkeys are not recommended. Organizations may choose to allow synced passkeys alongside traditional MFA mechanisms, replacing the password with a passkey. However, if the organization has strict requirements for where the credentials can reside, they should look closely at restricting use to device-bound passkeys. These factors will decide how organizations manage registration. All these cases put some added burden on the relying party if types of passkeys need to be restricted.</p>



<p>The relying party may need to check if some requirements are met during the registration process, such as requiring an authenticator that meets or exceeds the FIDO L1+ certification [8]. To assess the authenticator’s compliance with these requirements, the authenticator must provide an attestation that can be validated and examined. If an authenticator does not meet the requirements of L1+ then, the relying party may be forced to reject the registration since nothing can be proven about the provenance of the credential, or the party may consider an implementation with additional MFA to meet the requirements of high assurance.</p>



<p>If an attestation is provided, the relying party can check what type of device it is and if it meets the requirements of the enterprise or organization. The relying party may also want to restrict based on the unique identifier for the authenticator, provided an attestation is available. The unique identifier, known as an Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier (AAGUID), can be used to look up the details against the FIDO Alliance Metadata Service [2] to understand what type of device is being registered, the certification level, and what features it provides.</p>



<p>Enterprise Attestation is another form of attestation that can be leveraged during registration. This is implemented by some authenticator vendors to add additional information that is unique to the organization. Including this additional information as part of the attestation and narrowing allowed authenticators can be used to further enhance the registration experience.</p>



<p>Similarly, there may be flags about whether the credential is eligible for backup and/or if it has been backed up. These flags cannot be trusted, however, without some attestation that the device is certified. A relying party might decide to allow or deny the registration based on this information as well as other information provided at runtime.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if the relying party fails the registration of a credential, it forces the user to repeat the registration process again with a different authenticator at step one. Although WebAuthn [5] does not support a preflight mechanism to identify suitable authenticators, relying parties may provide feedback to the user before registration to identify acceptable authenticators. Additional guidance can be provided after failed registration to guide the user’s choice of authenticator. This guidance should be explicit and identify why the authenticator was rejected during registration, which authenticators meet the RP’s requirements, and guidance on managing browser-mandated optionality on communicating attestations.</p>



<p>Relying parties should be able to be more prescriptive in describing requirements of authenticators, allowing for a much better user experience where the end user can only select authenticators that meet the requirements and remove this burden from relying parties. These changes have been proposed to WebAuthn, but they have not yet gathered the support of platform vendors.</p>



<p>Another approach for enterprises might be not to offer any registration use case exposed to the end user. Instead, the enterprise would manage the lifecycle of registering the devices before they are provisioned to users. Similarly, the enterprise might provide some form of supervised registration experience to ensure only authorized authenticators are provisioned and registered. This avoids a number of pitfalls with the user experience mentioned above but puts more lifecycle management burden on the enterprise.</p>



<p>2.2. Sign In<br>Once a credential has been registered, FIDO credentials can be accessed when needed at authentication. The application(s) will leverage the WebAuthn browser API or platform passkey APIs to perform a FIDO authentication using a registered device. Depending on the type of registered device, there will be multiple factors involved in the authentication, like the entering of a PIN or a user presence challenge. The requirement for these interactions is there is a high level of assurance that the user is who they say they are, and they are not impersonating any user. These requirements need to be enforced during the registration process to ensure devices are allowed to meet the requirements of the enterprise or organization.</p>



<p>The only difference in this use case between synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys is what needs to be authenticated. For device-bound passkeys, the original hardware device used during the registration process is needed. Synced passkeys may be accessed from multiple devices that have access to an account hosted by a passkey provider. Furthermore, some synced passkeys may be shared after registration. Relying parties do not have a mechanism for identifying shared credentials in the current specifications, making it harder to understand and manage the lifecycle of synced passkeys.</p>



<p>There are several enterprise use cases covered in the white paper on “Choosing FIDO Authenticators for Enterprise Use Cases” [4]. Organizations should review these to evaluate how FIDO is leveraged. In particular, an organization planning to rely on FIDO as a first factor (passwordless) or a second factor is a key decision, and the white paper may help organizations understand what truly requires high assurance. For example, there may be a specific project, or a use case may apply to an entire industry driven by government or regulatory requirements. Employees might be allowed to use a synced passkey to access a laptop for example, but then need to use a device-bound passkey to sign in to a specific application restricted to certain employees with a particular clearance level.</p>



<p>2.3. Recovery/Lost Device<br>Recovery is where a synced passkey shines. If one loses a FIDO device that holds a credential, they can just access the credential from a different device that shares the same platform account. This is convenient, but also means that a passkey is only as secure as the platform account with which it is associated. Enterprises should examine the vendor solutions to understand how secure it is before relying on a service external to the organization. For example, does it provide end-to-end encryption with keys that are not known to the vendor? What additional measures like MFA are used to secure the user’s account? What process is used for account recovery? End users may not be concerned about such matters, but these details may represent a security concern for the organization’s security administrators. The organization’s security requirements need to be examined to see if an external party can store and manage credentials. Furthermore, without requiring attestations, the relying party has no idea who or what is the issuer of a credential—whether it be the platform, a roaming authenticator, a browser plug-in, or something else. As a result, the relying party cannot provide any guidance as to how to recover access to the credentials while providing high assurance. An alternative form of account recovery external to recovering the FIDO credential would be needed to verify the identity of the user and issue a new device and credentials. Finally, the recovery of a passkey from a provider when using synced is not known to the relying party. This represents a potential attack that the enterprise is unaware of.</p>



<p>For device-bound passkeys, the recovery process is more involved and will likely require the involvement of a help desk [6] to issue a new device and possibly revoke access for the old device. This is a security-first approach over convenience that allows an enterprise or organization to control who has devices. It does mean there are additional steps needed for the end user before they can regain access. However, this gives enterprises more control over the lifecycle of the credentials, allowing enterprises to revoke or expire authenticators at any point and be able to guarantee that credentials are not copied or do not exist outside enterprise controls. Some enterprises have solved this by provisioning multiple devices so users can self-recover. Ultimately, there is a business decision to be made regarding recovery models. In some cases, it may be appropriate to block access until the user can receive a new device, taking loss of productivity over a lower security model. The extra burden highlighted in the registration step if an enterprise chooses to manage the registration experience has a direct impact on the recovery/replacement experience.</p>



<p>2.4. Unregistering<br>At some point an employee will either leave a project or the enterprise overall. The enterprise will want to be sure they have control over credentials and unregister their use so access is no longer possible. This is a bigger consideration when it comes to synced passkeys where the enterprise does not have full control of the lifecycle and management of the credentials. If synced passkeys require additional MFA, the enterprise can control the MFA aspect, expiring the factors involved so authentications no longer are allowed. Device-bound passkey environments have much more control over unregistering devices, either by physically handing in a device and knowing no copies were made, or invalidating/expiring the device so subsequent authentication attempts fail.</p>



<p>The credential lifecycle requires the ability to disable or remove a credential, whether due to a change in status of an employee, such as a leave of absence or separation from the organization, or due to the potential loss or compromise of a credential. Passkeys differ from passwords in these instances since the user may have multiple passkeys registered with the relying party, as opposed to passwords, where the user is expected to only have one password per relying party. In the case of a permanent separation between the user and enterprise, disabling the user account and/or rotating the credential in the service is standard practice to ensure the user is no longer able to authenticate. If the separation is temporary, such as for leave of absence, enterprises may choose to rotate all the user’s credentials or disable the user account until the user returns.</p>



<p>In the case of credential loss, the next steps are dependent upon the deployment scenario. Users with device-bound passkeys who lose their security key should have the credential revoked by the service. Synced passkeys create additional challenges. If the device has been compromised, all credentials resident on the device, including those resident in different passkey providers, should be treated as compromised and revoked by the RP. If the user’s passkey provider account has been compromised, the impacted credential(s) stored with the provider must be revoked. To facilitate revocation in these scenarios, RPs should allow credentials to be named or otherwise identified by the user during registration to facilitate the revocation of specific credentials where possible. Administrative controls must narrow their focus on eliminating credentials from the RP rather than removing the credential private key material from either hardware security keys or a passkey provider’s sync fabric, which may not be possible.</p>



 3. Deployment Strategy 



<p>In a high assurance environment, the enterprise is likely going to want to manage the distribution and retirement of all authenticators. Device-bound passkeys would be managed by IT and provisioned to individuals. Relying parties would need to check for attestations and only allow the registration of authenticators that are managed by the enterprise or organization. If attestations are absent or do not meet the security requirements, the registration should fail. Processes should be established to manage the pool of authenticators to ensure they are retired when individuals leave or no longer require high-level access. Lastly, the organization or enterprise should define what the process looks like for recovering lost/stolen devices. Depending on how critical the access is to the continuity of the business, multiple hardware devices might be issued for a given individual to ensure they always have access.</p>



 4. Conclusion 



<p>There is no argument that passkeys are a strong phishing-resistant alternative option to traditional passwords. In an enterprise environment, it is important to look at security and regulatory requirements to determine if synced passkeys work, or if there are stricter constraints such as internal security policies, regulatory, or compliance requirements that require the use of device-bound passkeys. With either approach, enterprises should spend the time to understand how registration, management, and recovery of FIDO credentials will be managed. This includes important use cases like storage of credentials (external), recovery of lost credentials, and unregistering devices when employees leave. Based on the requirements of the enterprise, passkeys may work without any customizations, or enterprises may need to invest to ensure their authentication experience is more managed and filtered to specific devices.</p>



 5. Next Steps: Get Started Today 



 
 Use FIDO standards. 



 Think about what your relying parties are supporting and consider your enterprise security requirements. 



 Passkeys are far more secure than passwords. Look for the passkey icon on websites and applications that support it.

 Abstract 



<p>The intent of this whitepaper is to provide guidance for organizations as they analyze the abilities and features of both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to determine how both credential types can be utilized in a moderate assurance environment. In this paper, the term “moderate assurance” refers to an environment or organization where the legal, regulatory, and security requirements are flexible enough to allow for the use of both types of credentials, using synced passkeys to replace passwords and multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for standard user accounts and device-bound passkeys for user accounts that require the highest level of protection and assurance. The paper is designed to provide a comparison of features and requirements that are supported by device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys, providing a vision of how both types of credentials can be utilized together in an organization that has moderate assurance needs.</p>



 Audience 



<p>This white paper is one in a series of white papers intended for anyone who is considering deploying FIDO Authentication across their organization, including IT administrators, enterprise security architects, and executives.</p>



<p>Readers can find an introduction to the series of papers <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">here</a>. The introductory white paper provides additional descriptions and links to all papers in the series, covering an array of use cases from low to high assurance. We expect that most enterprises will have use cases that span more than one of these papers and encourage readers to review the white papers that are relevant to their deployment requirements.</p>



<p>The white paper assumes that the reader has a foundational understanding of FIDO2 credentials and the role they play in the<br>authentication process; introductory information on FIDO2 can be found here: <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 – FIDO Alliance</a>.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>The initial implementations of FIDO2 credentials were created as device-bound passkeys on either a roaming authenticator or platform authenticator, where the private key of the credential is stored on the device’s authenticator and not allowed to be exported, copied, backed up, or synchronized from the authenticator. This configuration presents a very secure and phishing-resistant solution for authentication that gives relying parties (e.g., web sites or service providers), a very high level of confidence that the user and the device are legitimate users of the system. With this high level of assurance, however, comes some challenges – primarily regarding usability and account recovery. For example, because there is no way to get the private key off the authenticator, if the device the private key is stored on becomes lost or damaged, then access to the resources that key authenticated would be lost. With device-bound passkeys, the solution is to register a second device-bound passkey with every relying party. This creates a more difficult user experience as the user would be required to register both authenticators. This is somewhat reduced for organizations that have consolidated their authentication flow by using an identity provider (IdP) to federate access to their applications, as the relying party is then the IdP itself.</p>



<p>To solve these challenges, in May 2022 Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced their intent to support synced passkeys in their operating systems. Synced passkeys have many of the same characteristics of device-bound passkeys, including the continued use of private and public key pairs. One significant difference, however, is that synced passkeys allow for the private key of the credential to be synchronized to other devices the user owns that exist in the same vendor’s synchronization fabric ecosystem (e.g., iCloud in the Apple ecosystem). Synced passkeys also allow for the creation of a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. All passkeys share several common security properties, are highly phishing resistant, and use unique key pairs to enable strong authentication. However, it is also important to note the difference between synced and device-bound passkeys. For example, synced passkeys introduce new security considerations when analyzed against a device-bound passkey. Conversely, synced passkeys can more easily address account recovery challenges.</p>



<p>As organizations work to evaluate how and where both credential types can be utilized in their environment, they will need to review and understand their organization’s legal, regulatory, and security requirements. When organizations evaluate these requirements, they will many times refer to the combination of these requirements as an authentication assurance level (AAL) and will reference documentation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which provides guidance and recommendation for different assurance levels. While there is currently work underway by NIST to update these assurance levels to better incorporate synced passkeys, the current standards can be helpful when evaluating the implementation of device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys into an organization. More information regarding NIST and AALs can be found here: Authenticator Assurance Levels (nist.gov).</p>



<p>In terms of this white paper, a moderate assurance environment is an organization that has several different authentication use case scenarios that can be met by a combination of AAL1 and/or AAL2 as well as AAL3 levels of assurance. This white paper will dive deeper into the advantages and disadvantages of both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to provide a comparison between the two that an organization can use along with their own legal, regulatory, and security requirements to determine how and where they can implement both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys into their moderate assurance environment so that they can take advantage of the secure, phishing-resistant, and user friendly authentication process that FIDO2 credentials provide in all parts of their organization.</p>

 2. FIDO Credential Adoption Considerations 



<p>When organizations are evaluating the use of both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to support the AAL1, AAL2, and AAL3 requirements of their organization, there are several factors that they should consider. These factors are described below and are intended to provide the organization with the information they need to help analyze both types of credentials and determine where they can be used in their enterprise.</p>



<p>2.1. User Experience<br>In terms of user experience, the goal of using FIDO credentials to authenticate to a system has always been to provide an easy-to-use and effortless process for the user. The original FIDO implementations provided a streamlined sign-in experience, but still presented some user experience challenges.</p>



<p>Passkeys introduce several enhancements to help provide improve user experience including a new feature called “passkeys Autofill UI” that provides users easier access to the creation of the passkeys and provides an autofill-like experience where users simply pick the credential they want to use when authenticating and no longer type in their username or password. This experience becomes quite easy to use and is very similar to the experience that most users already like and are comfortable with when using solutions such as password managers. Creating a passkey user experience that users like more than their current password experience removes the hurdle to adoption that has been seen with previous passkey implementations.</p>



<p>2.1.1 Backup, Lost Devices, and Recovery<br>With device-bound passkeys, the private key is stored on and not allowed to leave the authenticator. This creates a very secure solution but does create challenges for users and enterprises regarding backup of the key data, loss of the authenticator, and addition of new authenticators for the user. While there are recommended recovery practices for device-bound passkeys (<a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FIDO_Account_Recovery_Best_Practices-1.pdf">FIDO_Account_Recovery_Best_Practices-1.pdf (fidoalliance.org)</a>), synced passkeys work to resolve these challenges in a more user friendly manner. With the implementation of a synced passkey solution, the user no longer must register multiple authenticators with a relying party to ensure continued access in the event of a lost authenticator. If an authenticator is lost, a user can recover their passkey by using the recovery process provided by the passkey provider. Additionally, synced passkeys make for a better user experience as a user does not have to register unique credentials per device or maintain multiple device-bound passkeys to minimize the risk of credential loss. Once configured, synced passkeys are available across all devices synced with the passkey provider.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys do, however, create a dependency on the passkey provider and their synchronization fabric. Each provider implements their own synchronization fabric, which includes their own security controls and mechanisms to protect credentials from being misused. Organizations with specific security or compliance requirements should assess which provider(s) or hardware security keys meet their requirements.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys have a lower security posture as they allow the private key on the authenticator to be synchronized to authenticators of other devices the user has in the same vendor’s ecosystem. Organizations should also be aware that there currently are no standards or systems that allow them to keep track of what devices these credentials have been created and stored on, nor mechanisms to identify when the credential has been shared with another person. For use cases in an organization that require a high level of assurance, the fact that this information cannot be determined or obtained means that synced passkeys would not be a good solution for those specific organizational use cases, and they should look to device-bound passkeys to support those use cases.</p>



<p>2.3 Attestation and Enforcement of Credential Type<br>Attestation is a feature that is designed to enhance the security of the registration process. Attestation mechanisms are defined by the specifications as an optional feature, though most hardware security keys implement it. Attestation is the ability of the authenticator to provide metadata about itself back to the relying party so that the relying party can make an informed decision on whether to allow the authenticator to interact with it. This metadata includes items such as an Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier (AAGUID), which is a unique ID that represents the vendor and model of the authenticator, the type of encryption that the authenticator uses, and the PIN and biometric capabilities of the authenticator. Some authenticator vendors also support a feature called Enterprise Attestation that allows an organization to add additional uniquely identifying information in an attestation that is included with an authenticator registration request, with the intent to use this additional information to support a controlled deployment within the enterprise where the<br>organization wants to allow the registration of only a specific set of authenticators. Additional information about Enterprise Attestation can be found in this white paper: <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FIDO-White-Paper-Choosing-FIDO-Authenticators-for-Enterprise-Use-Cases-RD10-2022.03.01.pdf">FIDO-White-Paper-Choosing-FIDO-Authenticators-for-Enterprise-Use-Cases-RD10-2022.03.01.pdf (fidoalliance.org)</a>.</p>



<p>At the time of publication, synced passkeys do not implement attestation, which means they are not an appropriate solution for scenarios with highly privileged users that require higher levels of assurance or for organizations that want to implement Enterprise Attestation. To support these highly privileged users, relying parties and organizations have historically looked to, and will need to continue to look to, device-bound passkeys and authenticators from vendors that support and include attestation in their solutions. For organizations that have regulatory, legal, or security requirements that require all users to be treated as high privilege users or have a need to implement Enterprise Attestation, it is recommended that only device-bound passkeys be implemented in their environment. A companion white paper, “High Assurance Enterprise Authentication,” provides details on this scenario and can be found here: <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FIDO-EDWG-Spring-2023_Paper-5_High-Assurance-Enterprise-FINAL5.docx-1.pdf">https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/FIDO-EDWG-Spring-2023_Paper-5_High-Assurance-EnterpriseFINAL5.docx-1.pdf</a>. Moderate assurance organizations can support all their users by implementing synced passkeys for their standard users to replace passwords and MFA with a more secure solution and then use device-bound passkeys for highly privileged users and their access to resources that require the highest level of assurance.</p>



<p>Implementing both types of passkeys in the same authentication domain does however create an additional challenge that will require organizations to take additional steps to ensure that the correct type of passkey is used when accessing resources: for example, ensuring that a highly privileged user is using a device-bound passkey and not a synced passkey when accessing a resource that requires a high level of assurance. Organizations can leverage the user risk evaluation and policy engine framework of their Identity Provider to solve this challenge. Watermarking the user’s session with an identifier representing the AAL (or other properties of their choosing) to be used in downstream authorization decisions can also be used to solve this challenge. In federated authentication environments, this may be communicated using standards such as the Authentication Method Reference (amr, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8176">RFC8176</a>) standardized by OpenID Connect.</p>



 3. Conclusion 



<p>In moderate assurance environments, both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys may be implemented together to provide a more secure authentication solution for all use cases of the organization. The more user-friendly synced passkeys can be implemented to replace passwords and MFA for users with standard assurance level requirements, giving them a more secure authentication method that is also easier to use. For highly privileged users in the organization that require the highest level of security, device-bound passkeys can be issued that provide an even higher level of security and an additional level of trust in the authentication process. The white paper provides information comparing synced passkeys, with their better user experience, against device-bound passkeys, with their enhanced security features. Using this information, organizations can evaluate device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys to determine how both can be leveraged in their organization to provide easy-to-use and secure authentication methods that meet and exceed the requirements of their moderate assurance environment.</p>



 4. Next Steps 



<p>The next step for organizations is to start the evaluation of FIDO2 credentials so that organizations can move away from passwords, which are susceptible to phishing and are well documented to be a significant weakness in their overall security posture. Organizations that have a moderate assurance need and will implement both device-bound passkeys and synced passkeys should determine which credential type will provide the best return on investment, work towards implementing that credential type first, and then follow up by completing the deployment of the other credential type when possible. Implementing either type of FIDO2 credential is a large step forward in moving to a passwordless environment and significantly increasing the overall security posture of the organization.</p>

 Abstract 



<p>This white paper describes the need for a more secure and convenient solution for authentication. Passwords have long been the standard for authentication, but the risks inherent to passwords reduce their efficacy as an authentication mechanism. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions have been on market for some time, but their widespread adoption has been slow due to various barriers. Passkeys are an authentication solution that reduces the adoption barriers of traditional MFA mechanisms, while offering improved security, ease of use, and scalability over passwords and classic MFA solutions. Passkeys utilize on-device biometrics or PINs for authentication and provide a seamless user experience. This white paper outlines the benefits of passkeys, the user experience, and adoption considerations for enterprises.</p>



 1. Introduction 



<p>Passwords have long been the standard for authentication, but their inherent security flaws make them exploitable. Many passwords can be easily guessed or obtained through data breaches, and the reuse of passwords across multiple accounts only exacerbates the problem. This vulnerability makes them susceptible to credential stuffing attacks, which use leaked or commonly used passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. In fact, passwords are the root cause of over <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/what-is-fido/">80% of data breaches, with up to 51% of passwords being reused</a>. Despite these security concerns, many consumers and organizations continue to rely solely on passwords for authentication. According to a recent research by the FIDO Alliance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">59% of consumers use only a pass</a><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">w</a><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/online-authentication-barometer/">ord</a> for their work computer or account.</p>



<p>Traditional multi-factor (MFA) mechanisms, such as one time passwords (OTPs) delivered via SMS, email, or an authenticator app, are used by organizations to reduce the risk associated with a single-factor, password-based authentication system. Organizations using single-factor authentication with passwords, or those that have deployed OTPs to reduce phishing and credential stuffing, can implement passkeys as a password replacement to provide an improved user experience, less authentication friction, and improved security properties using devices that users already use—laptops, desktops, and mobile devices. For an introduction to passkeys and the terminology, please see the FIDO Alliance’s passkeys <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">resource page</a>. In the following pages, we will focus on migrating existing password-only use cases to passkeys. For additional use cases, please see <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">here</a>.</p>

 2. Why Are Passkeys Better than Passwords? 



<p>Passkeys are a superior alternative to passwords for authentication purposes and offer improved usability over traditional MFA methods. They offer several benefits such as better user experience, reduced cost of lost credentials, phishing resistance, and protection against credential compromise.</p>



<p>Synced passkeys offer a consistent authentication experience for users across multiple devices. This is made possible by leveraging the operating system platform (or a third party synchronization fabric such as that from password managers) to synchronize cryptographic keys for FIDO credentials. This allows for quick and easy sign-in using biometrics or a device PIN. Synced passkeys also improve scalability and credential recovery. With synced passkeys users do not have to enroll a new FIDO credential on every device they own, ensuring that they always have access to their passkeys, regardless of whether they replace their device.</p>



<p>On the other hand, device-bound passkeys such as security keys can be used on multiple devices allowing for cross-device portability. Unlike synced passkeys that are accessible on any synchronized device, device-bound passkeys are tied to the specific physical security key.</p>



<p>In terms of security, passkeys are built on the FIDO authentication standards, providing strong resistance against the threats of phishing and credential stuffing. Additionally, passkeys rely on existing on-device security capabilities, making it easier for small and medium enterprises to adopt stronger authentication methods.</p>



<p>Finally, passkeys offer a comprehensive solution for secure and efficient authentication that is better than passwords and traditional MFA authentication methods. With a seamless user experience, improved scalability, and enhanced security, passkeys are a valuable solution for organizations of all sizes.</p>



 3. Passkeys User Experience 



<p>3.1 Create a passkey visual UX/UI</p>



<p>Note: This section will provide an overview of the passkey registration and sign-in process using examples. Note The FIDO Alliance User Experience Working Group has developed UX guidelines for passkeys that are available here.</p>



 
 In the passkey registration flow, users are first prompted to provide an email or username along with their password to authenticate. 
 







<p>2. Then, users simply follow the prompts to provide their on-device biometric or PIN authentication.</p>







<p>3.2 Sign in with a passkey visual UX/UI</p>



 
 To sign in with a passkey, a user just selects the email or username. 



 Available passkeys will be shown in the passkey autofill user interface. 
 







 4. Adoption Considerations for Enterprises 



<p>Within businesses large and small, there are systems and services dependent upon single factor authentication using passwords. We collectively refer to these use cases as “low assurance use cases.” For low assurance use cases, technology leaders can displace password-only authentication mechanisms with passkeys, dramatically reducing the risk of phishing, and eliminating password reuse and  credential stuffing. However, even for low assurance use cases, businesses must consider factors that will influence their choice of technology and implementation, which we outline below.</p>



<p>As a prerequisite to deploying passkeys in the enterprise, leaders must clearly define the set of use cases, users, and the suitability of passkeys for this set.</p>



<p>4.1 Does the relying party (RP) support passkeys?<br>At the time of writing (Q2 2023), passkeys are a relatively new technology, and as such broad-based support is not guaranteed. As organizations review their systems to identify candidates for migration to passkeys, leaders must start by identifying where passkeys are supported within their ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, for in-house developed/managed applications, how can passkey support be added to the application(s)?If a single-sign on (SSO) mechanism is used to federate multiple applications and services, adding passkey support to the Identity Provider (IdP) can propagate support for passkeys to numerous federated applications, creating a rich ecosystem of services supporting passkeys with engineering efforts focused on the SSO IdP. Conversely, if the environment uses multiple independent applications, each of which uses password-based authentication, organizations will have to prioritize FIDO implementation across their suite of applications to leverage passkeys, or consider migrating to a federated authentication model where the IdP supports passkeys.</p>



<p>Second, third-party developed or hosted applications may or may not support passkeys. If an organization’s service provider does not support passkeys today, inquire when support is expected. Alternatively, if the organization is pursuing a federated identity model, does the service provider support inbound federation?If so, end users can authenticate to the IdP with a passkey before federating to the service providers’ systems.</p>



<p>4.2 Which devices are used to create, manage, and authenticate with passkeys?<br>After identifying a set of targeted applications or IdPs, identify the users of the applications and the devices they use to access the same. Generally speaking, users on modern operating systems, browsers, and hardware will have broad support for passkeys registered on a platform device, using a credential manager, or with a hardware security key. There are tradeoffs with each mechanism.</p>



<p>Today, passkey providers allow users to register passkeys that are synchronized to all of the devices the user registered with the sync fabric. Passkeys providers may be part of the operating system, browser, or a credential manager which stores and manages passkeys on behalf of the user. If the user loses or replaces their device, the passkeys can be synchronized to a new device, minimizing the impact on users. Typically, this is a good solution for users who use a small number of devices on a regular basis.</p>



<p>Conversely, hardware security keys create device-bound passkeys; they never leave the device. If a user loses their hardware key, they must have a backup or perform account recovery for all credentials stored on the device. Passkeys may be shared with other users if they are not hardware bound.</p>



<p>Hardware security keys require connectivity to the user’s computing device through USB, Bluetooth, or NFC whereas providers are always available on the user’s devices once bootstrapped. Platform credentials may be used to authenticate on nearby devices using the <a href="https://passkeys.dev/docs/reference/terms/#cross-device-authentication-cda">FIDO Cross-Device Authentication</a>. Enterprises should consider whether users who move between a number of shared devices should synchronize passkeys across all the shared devices, use hardware keys, or use the hybrid flow to best support their work style.</p>



<p>When users operate on shared devices using a single account (or profile), passkeys registered to the platform or credential managers are not a good fit. Device bound passkeys on a hardware key are recommended for this scenario. If the user carries a mobile device, consider registering a passkey on the device and using the cross device authentication flow to authenticate users.</p>



<p>Unlike passwords, all of the passkey solutions reviewed above provide strong phishing resistance and eliminate credential theft from the RP and reuse.</p>



<p>4.3 Registration &amp; Recovery<br>If there are no restrictions on which device(s) or platform(s) the user can register their passkeys, users may self-provision passkeys by bootstrapping a new credential from their existing password using the device(s) of the user’s choice. If using hardware security keys, organizations should provide two per user to allow for a backup credential.</p>



<p>As long as a password remains active on the user account, the user can recover from credential loss following the self-provisioning described above. This step is only required if the user is unable to restore their credentials from their passkey provider.</p>



 5. Conclusion 



<p>Passkeys offer a significant improvement in security compared to traditional passwords, but it is important to carefully evaluate and understand the adoption considerations before proceeding with an implementation. Organizations should ensure its technical requirements, security, and management preferences align with the passkey solution. Not all use cases are suitable for a passkey-only implementation. For additional deployment patterns, see the other white papers in this series here.</p>



 6. Next Steps: Get Started Today 



<p>Organizations should upgrade their authentication method and take advantage of the stronger security that passkeys provide. Based on the FIDO authentication standards, passkeys offer a robust solution to the growing threat of phishing attacks. Look for the passkey icon on websites and applications that support it, and take the first step towards a more secure future. Don’t wait. Make the switch to passkeys today!</p>

 1. Introduction 



<p>Last year FIDO Alliance, Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced their intentions to support passkeys— FIDO credentials that may be backed up and made available across devices that are registered to the same passkey provider. Since then, we have seen the support for passkeys and beta implementations by multiple platforms and password managers. Enterprises have expressed interest in passkeys but do not know where to start, what type of passkeys work in their environment, or how passkeys fit in their authentication strategy.</p>



<p>It is important to note that FIDO Alliance has embraced the term “passkey” to describe any passwordless FIDO credential. This includes synced passkeys(consistent with the original announcement and intent) as well as device-bound passkeys – which are FIDO authentication credentials that cannot leave the issued device (e.g., on a FIDO Security Key).</p>



<p>In the following series of papers, the FIDO Enterprise Deployment Working Group (EDWG) will provide guidance to leaders and practitioners on deploying FIDO solutions scaling from SMBs to large enterprises. With recognition that there are a variety of different use cases for FIDO credentials, from synced passkeys to device-bound passkeys, this series will identify key decision points for identifying which solution(s) are a good fit across different enterprise use cases. Enterprises are likely to find there are multiple FIDO-based solutions required to meet their different use cases.</p>



<p>As organizations evaluate how to use passkeys in their environment, they will need to determine the legal, regulatory, and security requirements of their organization and evaluate how both synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys can meet these requirements.</p>



<p>We assume that the reader has a high level understanding of the FIDO protocols, if not, please consult&nbsp;<a href="https://passkeys.dev/">https://passkeys.dev/</a>.</p>

 2. Why Choose Passkeys? 



<p>Passwords are the root cause of over 80% of data breaches, and up to 51% of passwords are reused, making them subject to credential stuffing attacks. FIDO credentials are inherently more secure than passwords due to their design. These credentials are unique cryptographic key pairs scoped to a specific origin (e.g., https://fidoalliance.org/) to prevent discovery by unrelated services. Unlike passwords, FIDO credentials are highly phishing resistant, and the credential—a private key—cannot be stolen from the relying party (RP) servers.</p>



<p>FIDO credentials can be utilized across a variety of use cases—from low to high assurance, balancing user experience, convenience, and security. Authenticators—ranging from hardware security keys to biometric hardware in phones, tablets, and laptops to password managers—enable enterprises to choose the right tools for their unique environments.</p>



<p>While all FIDO credentials are based on cryptographic key pairs, they do not exhibit the same security characteristics, nor are they all suitable for all use cases. For example, hardware security keys may be FIPS certified devices with device-bound passkeys. RPs can identify these credentials based upon the attestation statements provided at registration. On the other hand, synced passkey implementations synchronize key material through a cloud-based service. The export and management of credentials in a third-party service introduces additional considerations and may not meet every organization’s security requirements. The table on page 4 summarizes the use cases and properties of device-bound and synced passkeys.</p>



<p>As you read the series you may encounter terminology that is unique to the FIDO ecosystem. Please consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/common-specs/fido-glossary-v2.1-ps-20220523.html">FIDO Technical Glossary</a>&nbsp;for definitions of these terms.</p>



<p>We expect that most enterprises will have use cases that span more than one of these papers. Wherever organizations find themselves on this journey, they can start using FIDO credentials today to reduce credential reuse, phishing, and credential stuffing.</p>



<p>In the first paper, we examine how organizations can deploy passkeys to their users who are using passwords as their only authentication factor. By deploying passkeys, companies can immediately reduce the risk of phishing or credential stuffing for their staff while using corporate or personal devices for authentication.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>



<p>There are many organizations that have deployed classic second factor authentication solutions such as SMS OTP, TOTP, and HOTP. In many cases, these deployments were tactical responses to reduce the success of phishing attacks. However, none of these mechanisms are immune to phishing. In the second paper of the series, we examine how passkeys can displace less phishing resistant mechanisms while improving the authentication user experience.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>



<p>Enterprises in regulated industries may be obligated to utilize higher assurance authentication for some, or all, of their staff. These companies (or other companies with stringent security requirements) may be able to deploy synced passkeys, device-bound passkeys, or both to meet their authentication requirements. The third paper in the series provides guidance on deciding which FIDO-based solution(s) can meet these requirements.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>



<p>The final paper describes using device-bound passkeys where functional or regulatory requirements require high assurance<br>authentication. These scenarios use attestation data to securely validate the hardware devices used to generate and manage passkeys.</p>



<p>This attestation data can be used to ensure compliance with regulatory and security requirements for regulated enterprises and use cases.&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/">https://fidoalliance.org/fido-in-the-enterprise/</a>.</p>

 Abstract 



<p>This document intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of attestation’s role in enhancing and advancing the digital security landscape, specifically with respect to authentication. It focuses on the core function of attestation: verifying the origin and integrity of user devices and their authentication materials. FIDO credentials are discussed with a focus on how they offer more secure alternatives than traditional password-based systems and how FIDO attestation enhances authentication security for both Relying Parties (RPs) and end-users. In this document, RPs are those entities that provide websites, applications and online services that require the need for secure user access by confirming the identity of users or other entities. FIDO Alliance’s historical journey is presented with practical analogies for understanding FIDO attestation, its enterprise-specific technical solutions, and privacy aspects involved in the attestation process.</p>



 Audience 



<p>Targeted for CISOs, security engineers, architects, and identity engineers, this white paper serves as a guide for professionals considering the adoption of FIDO within their enterprise ecosystem. Readers should possess a baseline understanding of FIDO technologies, the meaning of attestation, and have a desire to understand why and how to implement attestation.</p>

 1. Introduction 



 
<p>While authentication is widely understood, attestation may be less familiar to many practitioners in the information technology field. Attestation, as understood within the FIDO protocols, confirms a set of properties or characteristics of the authenticator. In the physical world, we can rely on examining an object to inspect its properties and verify its authenticity. In the interconnected digital world, physical inspection is not practical. Devices used for FIDO authentication should be carefully checked before use, especially if their source or contents are uncertain. Certain transactions, especially those related to government, healthcare, or financial institutions, demand higher assurance, and it is vital that the Relying Party (RP)&nbsp; confirms the authenticator’s legitimacy in these cases. To ensure that high-assurance transactions are legitimate, RPs can employ attestation to verify the authenticity and properties of the authenticator.</p>



<p>A note on terminology: The term “key” and “key pair” is common to several types of keys described in this paper. To alleviate this confusion the term “passkey” will always be used when referring to a key used to authenticate a user. Use of other instances of the term ‘key’ will be specific by either the context or a modifier such as Attestation Key.</p>



<p>In traditional password-based systems, it may be assumed that users and RPs keep passwords confidential. Because this assumption is not consistently enforced, breaches can occur. Using passkeys instead of passwords is a significant improvement, but some RPs may need more stringent policies to verify the authenticity of the authenticator and its properties.</p>



<p>Unlike passwords, passkeys use securely generated key material allowing access to websites and apps. Users and RPs rely on the authenticator for storage and management of this key material and therefore share the responsibility for secure handling of passkeys.&nbsp; All actors and components of the FIDO solution, including the authenticator, RP, and the passkey provider (when applicable), together ensure a robust security framework. This is in contrast to passwords, where the secure handling of passwords depends primarily on the user’s memory, behavior, the RP, and password managers (if used). RPs can leverage attestations to verify that passkeys are securely handled within&nbsp; properly implemented FIDO certified devices.</p>



<p>Attestation provides RPs with information about the authenticator protecting the user’s passkeys. This provides a means for the RP to enforce security policies for FIDO authentication. In the following sections, we delve deeper into the concept of attestation, its purpose, real-life scenario comparisons, and the problems attestation solves.</p>



<p>1.1 Real-World Analogies for FIDO Attestation</p>



<p>Drawing parallels with everyday security protocols offers significant insights. Both digital and physical environments demand rigorous checks and balances to validate identities and fortify trust. FIDO Attestation reflects the trust and verification processes familiar in the physical world.</p>



<p>To understand the pivotal role of FIDO attestation, consider its application in real-world identification and verification practices. These analogies underscore its integral function and efficacy:</p>



 
 Identity Document Verification: Just as individuals may produce official documents such as passports or driver’s licenses to authenticate identity, the verifier (e.g., immigration official) wants proof of the document’s authenticity and therefore checks for the relevant seals and marks. FIDO attestation provides proof of the authenticity of a user’s authenticator, offers statements for examination, and provides cryptographic signatures for verifying the authenticity of the authenticator and the statements. 



 Gaining Trust Through Authentication: Think of moments where trust is contingent on proof of identity or authority.&nbsp; For example, accessing a secure facility where a guard authenticates you based on your identity documents, authorizing access to the facility. FIDO attestation fosters trust in digital environments when used to confirm the authenticator provenance and authenticity during online registration. 



 Countering Threats and Weaknesses: In real-world scenarios, ID checks exist to counteract impersonation, forgery, and fraud. FIDO attestation identifies the origins of authenticators and assists RPs to detect registrations from devices with known vulnerabilities, thereby enabling them to ensure that users employ only secure devices. 
 
 



 2. Practical Implications and Use-Cases of FIDO Attestation 



 
<p>2.1 From the Perspective of a Relying Party&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delving deeper into FIDO attestation provides invaluable insights into critical roles fortifying authentication systems:</p>



 
 Assured Authenticator Security and Compliance: For RPs operating in sensitive sectors, for example,&nbsp; finance or the public domain, there’s a heightened need to ascertain that authentication devices are secure and meet specific standards. FIDO attestation helps ensure that authenticators accessing services are not only secure, but also adhere to specific standards and regulations. 



 Authenticator Model Specificity and Trust in FIDO Authenticator Models: FIDO attestation is tailored to distinct authenticator models, ensuring that cryptographic proofs during registrations validate said authenticator model authenticity. Beyond general trust in the attestation process, this specificity allows the RP to confirm that the passkey used in the registration request originates from a particular FIDO authenticator model. Such granularity is paramount for RPs where the details of authenticator models are crucial due to regulatory or security reasons. 



 Verification Through Attestation Signature: As a user sets up a new account, the onboarding RP can authenticate that the “attestation signature” linked to the freshly generated passkey is indeed from a genuine authenticator model. 



 Incident handling and Response: If a vulnerability is discovered in an authenticator, RPs checking attestations have the ability to discover which authenticators may be affected and require additional authentication factors or registration of a new credential for impacted users.&nbsp; 
 



<p>2.2 From the Perspective of the End-User</p>



<p>Although end users may not be aware of the technical details, FIDO attestation can enhance their online security:</p>



 
 Enhanced Trust in Services: When using services, particularly in high-assurance sectors such as&nbsp; banking or government portals, users can experience increased confidence. They understand that the RP isn’t just authenticating but is also ensuring that authenticators accessing the platform adhere to specific standards. 



 Authenticator Compliance: FIDO attestation assures RPs of authenticator compliance and security,&nbsp; giving users the benefit of reliable functionality of their authentication devices paired with desired RP-related services. 



 Transparent Registration and Onboarding: &nbsp;The registration process is designed for seamlessness, but includes an additional step when an RP requests attestation of a FIDO authenticator.&nbsp; At this step, users must provide their consent to share the attestation metadata with the RP. This ensures that while backend verifications related to attestations, certification path validations, and authenticator compliance are streamlined, the user is aware of and has approved the process. 
 
 



 3. FIDO Attestation Explained 



 
<p>In this section we describe FIDO attestation and FIDO attestation types.</p>



<p>3.1 What is FIDO Attestation?</p>



<p>Within the FIDO authentication framework, attestation is a process for verifying the authenticity of a user’s authenticator during the authentication process. The attestation can be used in conjunction with the FIDO Alliance’s metadata service [1] to get more information about the authenticator including the model and certification level. An optional level of attestation, known as enterprise attestation, allows for further verification of specific authenticators, see section 4.5.</p>



<p>Note that the term ‘attestation’ might have&nbsp; different meanings outside of the context of FIDO. This paper discusses attestation only within the scope of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>In FIDO registration, a key step is the creation of a user authentication passkey, which occurs regardless of whether attestation is involved. During this process, the user’s authenticator—such as a smartphone—generates a unique cryptographic key pair for each RP. The private key is securely stored within the authenticator, while the public key is shared with the RP, establishing a secure authentication framework. Additionally, during registration, the authenticator may provide an attestation, offering further assurance about the authenticator’s integrity.</p>



<p>In addition to generating the user’s authentication passkey, the FIDO authentication framework includes an optional attestation process. When attestation is requested, the authenticator may provide an attestation (synced passkeys do not currently provide attestations) by using an Attestation Key to sign the AAGUID&nbsp; (Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique ID) along with the passkey public key, creating signed evidence that establishes a trust anchor for the RP to validate that the authenticator properties meet the RP conditions through the MDS (FIDO Alliance’s Metadata Service [<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.4bvk7pj">1</a>], see section 3.3 for additional information).&nbsp; If the authenticator cannot provide an attestation, the RP can authenticate the user with the passkey, and may obtain authenticator information (e.g. AAGUID), but it may not obtain verifiable evidence that the required authenticator properties are present.</p>



<p>This attestation process helps protect against supply chain attacks, such as the introduction of substitute or counterfeit authenticators. By verifying the authenticity of the authenticator, the RP understands the properties of the authenticator and assesses whether it meets the expected security standards, particularly during the registration phase, to ensure the device’s legitimacy.</p>



<p>FIDO attestation is thus a key component of the broader security and privacy objectives of the framework. It minimizes reliance on passwords, fosters strong device authentication based on public-key cryptography, and aims to offer a standardized and interoperable approach to authentication across different platforms and devices.</p>



<p>3.2 Types of FIDO Attestation</p>



<p>There are several types of FIDO attestation which differ in how the attestation statement is signed. Note that none of these attestation types except Enterprise Attestation provide information about the specific authenticator. This is to preserve user privacy.</p>



 
 Self-attestation: The attestation statement is signed by the user’s passkey. This provides integrity protection for the attestation statement and provides no other assurances. 



 Basic attestation: The attestation statement is signed by a key created by the authenticator’s manufacturer and embedded into the authenticator. This provides integrity protection of the attestation statement and proof of the authenticator’s manufacturer. For privacy purposes, this key must be duplicated across many of the same authenticator’s model (current FIDO Alliance requirement is &gt;100,000 devices). It is not unique to a specific authenticator instance. 



 Attestation CA (AttCA) or Anonymization CA (AnonCA): This is similar to basic attestation, except the attestation statement is signed by a TPM Attestation Key. In this case, the TPM, a hardware-based module where cryptographic operations occur and secrets are stored securely without leaving the module, has its Attestation Key’s certificate signed by a trusted authority managing the authenticator. 



 Enterprise attestation: This is discussed in section 4.5, 
 



<p>It should be noted that the FIDO2 Specifications work along with the WebAuthn specification <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.4bvk7pj">[2].</a> The type of attestation used is determined by examining fields within the attestation object which are defined in the WebAuthn specification. Further definitions provided by the WebAuthn specification includes a number of different types of formats, for example: packed, TPM, and Android-key as well as supporting custom formats if needed.</p>



<p>3.3 Using AAGUID</p>



<p>The Authenticator Attestation GUID or simply AAGUID, uniquely identifies the authenticator’s make (manufacturer) and model. It does not uniquely identify the specific authenticator. The AAGUID&nbsp; is returned by the authenticator when attestation is requested by the RP and&nbsp; the RP may use it to determine if the authenticator’s make and model meets its policies. Among other uses, the AAGUID is the lookup value within the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/">FIDO (MDS)</a> [1] providing the RP detailed information about the authenticator.</p>



<p>The authenticator’s conveyance of the AAGUID provides no proof of its integrity or authenticity. The RP must trust the specific authenticator to provide truthful information.</p>



<p>This point is important to emphasize:</p>



 
 The AAGUID without attestation is “informational” only and does not provide any assurance of its authenticity. 



 Attestation provides a signature providing a level of assurance (depending on the type of attestation) of the authenticator’s identity. 
 
 



 4. Technical Solutions&nbsp; 



 
<p>This section describes the sequence of events and involved components that make up FIDO attestation.</p>



<p>4.1 Authentication vs. Attestation Keys&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of keys and methods for user authentication from FIDO have been introduced in previous documents, but the use of&nbsp; keys and methods used for attestation may not be familiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 User Authentication: This is the process where the user demonstrates possession of the correct system credentials, utilizing a passkey instead of the traditional password, which is a common application of FIDO technology. 



 Attestation: This is the process of the authenticator using a key that is not assigned to a user, but instead&nbsp; assigned to the authenticator,&nbsp; to digitally sign a message providing proof of the message’s authenticity. The message involved is called the “attestation statement” and contains information about the authenticator. When the attestation statement is digitally signed by the authenticator’s attestation key, the RP can verify the validity of the attestation statement. 
 



<p>In summary:</p>



 
 A passkey authenticates the user to an RP 



 An attestation key signs an attestation statement to authenticate its origin 
 



<p>As stated in section 3.3 an RP may obtain the authenticator’s make and model by simply checking the authenticator’s AAGUID against the Metadata Service to get this information. Without being digitally signed by a key trusted by the RP, the RP has no proof this information is authentic or associated with the authenticator being queried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: As discussed in section 3.2, there are several attestation types. One of these, “self-attestation”, uses the User Authentication key to sign the attestation statement. This is not technically a contradiction, but a simplification provided to allow integrity protection, not authenticity, of the attestation statement.</p>



<p>4.2 Trust in the Attestation Key – Trust Chain</p>



<p>Fundamental to attestation is the RP’s trust in the Attestation Key. The Attestation Key must be generated by a trusted source and protected by the authenticator. The trusted source is typically the authenticator’s manufacturer however, in the case of “Attestation CA (AttCA) or Anonymization CA (AnonCA)”, a trusted agent or Certification Authority (CA) is asserting the authenticity of the authenticator. The public part of the Attestation Key is obtained by the RP using a trusted channel, typically the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/">FIDO MDS</a> [1], mentioned previously.</p>



<p>4.3 FIDO Attestation Sequence</p>



<p>Attestation uses a key pair associated with an authenticator, not a user. It is important that all authenticators of the same make and model return the same attestation statement. The format of the attestation is examined later in this section, but it is important to understand that, at a high level, the attestation provides information about the type of authenticator, and it is not specific to a single device.</p>



<p>The following steps (1.a or 1.b then 2.) summarize a FIDO authenticator’s attestation lifecycle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Authenticator Manufacturing: There are two models for provisioning the Attestation Key: case “a” for roaming authenticators, such as smartphones or USB security keys used across multiple platforms, and case “b” for platform authenticators, which are built-in authentication mechanisms within devices like laptops or smartphones.</p>



<p>Note: This two-model distinction is not architecturally required by the FIDO Specification, but it is the practical implementation known today and provides a simplified explanation for the purpose of this paper. Also, the descriptions are generalizations and manufacturers may deploy different methods than described here – this is only a generalization.</p>



 
 Roaming Authenticator: The authenticator manufacturer generates an Attestation Keypair (AK) for a specific authenticator model. The manufacturer creates a certificate with the AK’s public key. The AK Certificate is commonly put into the MDS. This allows a RP to retrieve the AK Certificate from a trusted source, MDS, when an AAGUID is provided. The AK Certificate itself is usually signed with the authenticator’s manufacturer’s issuer key. This creates a verifiable cryptographic chain from the authenticator back to its manufacturer. 



 Platform Authenticator: The authenticator is not shipped from its manufacturer with an attestation key that can be used for FIDO attestation. Instead, it relies on persistent keys within the platform authenticator. These keys are crucial cryptographic elements that the attestation service uses to generate a FIDO Attestation Key. The attestation service is trusted by the Relying Party to provide assurance in the platform authenticator’s integrity and compliance. The attestation service creates an attestation key that is used to sign an attestation object which asserts the properties of the authenticator. The RP must trust the attestation service in the same way it trusts the roaming authenticator’s manufacturer. 
 



<p>2. User Provisioning with Attestation: During registration (setting up the new account), a new User Credential (a passkey) is created with a unique cryptographic key pair, and the public key is sent to the RP. The RP may optionally require an attestation. Note that the User or the authenticator may ignore the requirement for attestation. If the authenticator possesses an attestation key and it is allowed by the User, the user’s public passkey (along with the attestation statement) will be sent to the RP signed with the attestation private key. This allows the RP to verify the attestation statement which includes the User’s Public passkey for the newly created User. Therefore, providing confidence/proof that the User’s private passkey originated from a specific authenticator with known properties.</p>



<p>4.4 A General Description of the Attestation Lifecycle</p>







<p>The attestation key generally has an associated attestation certificate, which links to a trusted root certificate of the Manufacturer. Once the RP has determined the authenticity of the signed attestation statement, the RP can use the attestation statement along with the MDS to learn more about the authenticator. For example, the RP may want to understand what level of encryption is used and what type of activation secrets is leveraged (e.g., biometrics) with a certain level of accuracy, etc. In order to get details about the authenticator an AAGUID value identifying the authenticator model is sent to the RP along with the newly created public passkey. Since the&nbsp; AAGUID represents a specific group of authenticator instances such as specific product release with a specific characteristic, specific form factor, or enterprise branding, an RP can use this AAGUID to lookup more information about the authenticator from the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/metadata/">MDS</a>.</p>



<p>As shown in the diagram, the attestation object, if provided, will indicate the format of the attestation statement, and then include some data the RP can examine. The attestation object includes a statement that typically contains a signature as well as a certificate or similar data providing provenance information for the attestation public key.&nbsp; Detail of the attestation object is provided in section <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.3cqmetx">9.1</a> of the Appendix.</p>



<p>RPs should first verify the signature of the attestation statement and once verified, then examine the attestation statement.&nbsp; Once the RP has identified the attestation statement’s format and type, the RP then reviews the contents and compares the contents against its policy.</p>



<p>An example attestation response resulting from a&nbsp; direct request to the authenticator by an RP is provided in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSvoJ3HbhXufrZJCRkj9XjKSfl4dfKjv/edit#heading=h.1rvwp1q">9.2</a> of the Appendix. The AAGUID provided in the attestation response can be used to obtain additional&nbsp; details about the authenticator from the FIDO Metadata Service.</p>



<p>4.5 Enterprise Attestation</p>



<p>By default, FIDO allows an authenticator to provide only product information using the AAGUID and high-level information about its type and capabilities, explicitly prohibiting an authenticator from providing uniquely identifying information.&nbsp; However, Enterprise attestation removes that limitation, as it binds a unique authenticator key pair to a serial number or equivalent unique identifier.</p>



<p>4.5.1 Use Cases</p>



<p>Enterprises actively manage authenticators for various purposes and are essential for securing high-value assets. While employees may select their own authenticators, enterprises may limit authenticators per employee and revoke them upon a departure or loss, as they oversee the entire process from purchase to collection. Additionally, enterprises may prioritize manageability and traceability to safeguard resources. Upon a threat incident, forensic investigations may need to trace activities related to a particular authenticator and correlate the authenticator’s usage activity patterns in order to discover anomalies or the source of threat. Tight management enhances their ability to ensure non-repudiation for transactions. High-risk users may be assigned dedicated authenticators from the enterprise for access to restricted sensitive information or services. These authenticators are assigned specific PINs and are acquired through trusted supply chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certain enterprise deployments require the use of FIDO authenticators with enterprise attestation in order to identify specific device identities (e.g. device serial numbers). Enterprise Attestation validation must also be supported by the organization’s specific Relying Parties. These practices actively address enterprise-specific needs for improved control over device provisioning and lifecycle management.</p>



<p>4.5.2 Process</p>







<p>4.5.2.1 Provisioning&nbsp;</p>



<p>Provisioning for enterprise attestation, is modified from the process described in section 4.3 to include both authenticator unique information in the attestation statement and to add any specific RPs permitted to receive this unique information from any set of RPs permanently “burned” into the authenticator by the authenticator’s manufacturer. The authenticator performs enterprise attestation only to those RPs provisioned to the authenticator. Other RPs may still perform any other type of attestation that excludes the unique identifier.</p>



<p>Authenticators that have the enterprise attestation burned into them must not be sold on the open market and may only be supplied directly from the authenticator’s manufacturer to the RP.&nbsp; An RP wanting an enterprise attestation enabled authenticator will order them directly from the authenticator’s manufacturer by providing a list of RP IDs (RPIDs). These specific RPIDs are the ones permanently burned/written to the authenticator.</p>



<p>4.5.2.2 User Registration with Enterprise Attestation</p>



<p>During a FIDO user registration described in section 4.3, the RP may indicate the need for enterprise attestation. This will uniquely associate the user with the specific authenticator by providing proof of the authenticator’s unique identifier. During user registration the authenticator verifies that the requesting RP (using its RPID) is among those listed in the permanently provisioned list of RPID permitted to perform enterprise attestation. If approved, this unique identifier is added to the attestation object and signed by the Attestation Key. The RP should validate the attestation object and, optionally, the certificate link/chain used to sign the attestation object. The RP can then verify, at user registration time, that the unique identifier was indeed purchased by the enterprise and may include that verification in its records.</p>



<p>The implementation used by an RP to authenticate the uniquely identifying information varies by authenticator. Some authenticators may use vendor facilitated methods where the enterprise provides a list of the RP IDs to the manufacturer and those are imprinted into the authenticators. Another is where some enterprise managed platforms maintain a policy, such as an enterprise managed browser. Rather than imprinting the list of allowed RPs into the authenticator, an enterprise managed platform will make the determination if the enterprise attestation is provided to the RP based on the policy.</p>
 



 5. Privacy Implications and Considerations 



 
<p>While attestation provides a valuable assertion of trust for authenticators, privacy concerns can arise from the information shared during attestation. Some privacy considerations include:</p>



 
 While the attestation properties described in this paper include a broad set of privacy controls, implementers should consider these capabilities against regional and local privacy policies. 



 Attestation enables sharing information, such as authenticator’s make and model, firmware version, or manufacturer details, with the RP. Concerns may arise regarding the potential exposure of sensitive authenticator-specific data and the subsequent tracking or profiling of users based on this information.&nbsp; For this very reason, an attestation batch of at least 100,000 is recommended so it is not a small pool to identify devices from. 



 Non-enterprise attestation prevents the association of multiple passkeys within an authenticator with different RPs, thus safeguarding user privacy. For example, a person using a single authenticator may create a User Authentication passkey (passkey1) for RP 1 (RP1), then create a new User Authentication passkey (passkey2) for RP 2 (RP2). Even though the person is using the same physical authenticator for both RPs and using attestation, even if RP1 and RP2 collaborate, they cannot determine that passkey1 and passkey2 are from the same authenticator, therefore, they cannot determine the transactions are from the same person. 



 Enterprise attestation adds uniquely identifying information (e.g., a device serial number) allowing an authorized RP to track the use of a specific authenticator across several pre-provisioned RPs within the enterprise. It is expected that users in this environment have an understanding of this property and the value it adds to the enterprise.&nbsp; 
 
 



 6. Adoption and Deployment Considerations 



 
<p>RPs can determine the registration requirements for a FIDO authenticator, as&nbsp; reflected in their preference for attestation conveyance. Some RPs may not require attestations to decide if registration is allowed. Other RPs may have security requirements that require an attestation object in order to make risk decisions. Security requirements may be based on characteristics of the authenticator (e.g., whether it requires a PIN) or could be as specific as the model of authenticator(s) allowed. Finally, in more protected environments, some RPs may require additional enterprise attestations to ensure an authenticator is known, controlled, and trusted by the enterprise.</p>
 



 7. Conclusion 



 
<p>FIDO attestation, a component of the FIDO and WebAuthn standards, validates the authenticity of a user’s authenticator. This process provides a defense against various threats such as supply chain attacks, counterfeit authenticators, and substitution attacks. For RPs requiring higher authentication assurance, attestation is a FIDO-centric mechanism to obtain that assurance. For RPs that need to ensure the authenticity of specific authenticators,&nbsp; attestation provides these RPs assurance that they are dealing with a known and trusted device.</p>



<p>By generating unique key pairs for each RP that a user registers with, FIDO underscores its commitment to user security, eliminating potential cross-service vulnerabilities. The enterprise attestation feature provides organizations with better management of authenticators used by their personnel and is vital to environments that prioritize precise device management.</p>



<p>FIDO attestation brings certain privacy considerations. Disclosing authenticator-specific information, user device fingerprinting and the potential for user tracking, all highlight the importance of a privacy-aware approach. All stakeholders, including RPs, manufacturers, and users, must navigate the path between enhancing security and preserving user privacy.</p>



<p>FIDO attestation is adaptable.&nbsp; RPs have the discretion to request their desired level of attestation, ensuring a tailored approach suitable for both specialized services and large enterprises.</p>



<p>In summary, FIDO attestation augments online authentication. With a focus on public-key cryptography, unique key pairs, and specific attestation processes, its efficacy is maximized through careful deployment, thorough understanding of its capabilities, and a consistent commitment to user privacy.</p>

<p>On July 9, 2012, not long after <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">The Intention Economy</a>&nbsp;came out, I got word from <a href="https://x.com/garyrosenWSJ">Gary Rosen</a> of <a href="https://wsj.com">The Wall Street Journal</a> that the paper’s publisher, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Thomson_(executive)">Robert Thomson</a>, loved the book and wanted “an excerpt/adaptation” from the book for the cover story of&nbsp; the WSJ’s Weekend Review section. The image above is the whole cover of that section, which appeared later that month.</p>
<p>In the article I described a new way to shop:</p>
<blockquote><p>An “intentcast” goes out to the marketplace, revealing only what’s required to attract offers. No personal information is revealed, except to vendors with whom you already have a trusted relationship.</p></blockquote>
<p>I also said that this form of shopping—</p>
<blockquote><p>…can be made possible only by the full empowerment of individuals—that is, by making them both independent of controlling organizations and better able to engage with them. Work toward these goals is going on today, inside a new field called VRM, for vendor relationship management. VRM works on the demand side of the marketplace: for you, the customer, rather than for sellers and third parties on the supply side.</p></blockquote>
<p>The scenario I described was set ten years out: in 2022, a future now two years in the past. In the meantime, many approaches to intentcasting have come and gone. The ones that have stayed are Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Instacart, TaskRabbit, Thumbtack, and a few others. (Thumbtack participated in the early days of ProjectVRM.) We include them in <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work#Intentcasting">our list of intentcasting services</a> because they model at least some of what we’d like intentcasting to be. What they don’t model is the full empowerment of individuals&nbsp;as independent actors: ones whose intentions <a href="https://dsearls.medium.com/customers-need-scale-f8e045b90304">can scale across whole markets</a> and many sellers:</p>
 <p>Scale gives the customer single ways to deal with many companies. For example, she should be able to change her address or last name with every company she deals with in one move—or to send an intention-to-buy “intentcast” to a whole market.</p> 
<p>Should we call the sum of it “<a href="https://customercommons.org/blog/the-dawn-of-i-commerce/">i-commerce</a>“? Just a thought.</p>
<p>Back to the Wall Street Journal article. It is clear to me now that&nbsp;The Customer as a God would have been a much better title for my book than The Intention Economy, which needs explaining and sounds too much like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Attention-Economy-Understanding-Currency-Business/dp/1578518717">The Attention Economy</a>, which was the title of the book that came out ten years earlier. (I’ve met people who have read that one and thought it was mine—or worse, called my book “The Attention Economy” and sent readers to the wrong one.)</p>
<p>Of course, calling customers gods is hyperbole: exaggeration for effect.&nbsp; VRM has always been about customers coming to companies as equals. The “revolution in personal empowerment” in the subhead of “The Customer as a God” is about equality, not supremacy. For more on that, see the <a href="https://projectvrm.org/?s=r-button&amp;category=r-button">eleven posts</a> before this one that mention the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/R-button">R-button</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/R-button"></a></p>
<p>That symbol (or pair of symbols) is about two parties who attract each other (like two magnets) and engage as equals. It’s a symbol that only makes full sense in open markets where free customers prove more valuable than captive ones. Not markets where customers are mere “targets” to “acquire,” “capture,” “manage,” “control” or “lock in” as if they were slaves or cattle.</p>
<p>The stage of Internet growth called Web 2.0 was all about those forms of capture, control, and coerced dependency. We’re still in it. (What’s being called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> is, while “decentralized” (note: not distributed), it is also based on tokens and blockchain. ) Investment in customer independence rounds to nil.</p>
<p>And that’s probably the&nbsp;biggest reason intentcasting as we imagined it in the first place has not taken off. It is very hard, inside industrial-age business norms (which we still have) to see customers as equals, or as human beings who should be equipped to lead in the dance between buyers and sellers, or demand and supply, in truly open marketplaces. It’s still easier to see us as mere consumers (which <a href="https://www.jerrymichalski.com/">Jerry Michalski</a> calls “gullets with wallets and eyeballs”).</p>
<p>So, where is there hope?</p>
<p>How about AI? It’s at the late end of its craze stage, but still here to stay, and <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en">hot as ever</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=AI&amp;hl=en"></a></p>
<p>Can AI provide the “revolution in personal empowerment” we’ve been looking for here since 2006? Can it prove <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page#VRM_Principles">our thesis—that free customers are more valuable than captive ones—to themselves and to the marketplace</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.searls.com/personal-ai/">Only if it’s personal</a>.</p>
<p>If it is, then the market is <a href="https://projectvrm.org/2024/06/11/pai-greenfield/">a greenfield</a>.</p>
<p>Some of us here are working at putting AI on both sides of intentcasting ceremonies. If you have, or know about, one or more of those approaches (or any intentcasting approaches), please share what you know, or what you’re got, in the comments below. And come to VRM Day on October 28. I’ll be putting up the invite for that shortly.</p>

<p>In the years since <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a> were first announced, a lot has changed in their availability to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkey-use-case/consumer/">consumers</a>, nomenclature across platforms, and even <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/implement-passkeys-overview/">implementation</a> requirements. However, one thing that has yet to change is the need for more awareness on what passkeys are, how they work, and their benefits.</p>



<p>In this webinar we debunk common misconceptions associated with passkeys, which we’ve heard from customers, FIDO members and industry participants, and see pop up across social networks. By doing so, we’re confident we can help drive our industry towards a passwordless world.</p>

<p>Kia ora,</p>



<p>If Tina had been in the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/photo-gallery/">Oceania Room at Te Papa Tongarewa last Tuesday</a>, and for the two&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/">Digital Trust Hui Taumata</a>&nbsp;that preceded it, like some of you were, I think this would have been her observation. It certainly was for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vanessaronanpearce_digitalidentitynz-innovation-payments-activity-7229439216848412672-YzKe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">another singer</a>. The buzz in the room was palpable from the very start. Compared to the previous two years, this event saw increased attendance (214 registered, 202 in the room), more international and local speakers, and an increase in panels and roundtable discussions. It’s tangible evidence that Digital Trust is entering the consciousness of more people, accompanied by a desire to ‘get stuff done’. To that end – amongst several other great presentations, panels and exhibits of things currently in progress for those that wish to opt-in – NZTA showcased its&nbsp;<a href="https://nzta.govt.nz/about-us/app/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwt4a2BhD6ARIsALgH7Dp4rtVIKTd5kCl3AqZhTLoLAgzvRz2ym6ebiMtIvag2xz7M_dSomXoaArUTEALw_wcB">NZTA vehicle status app</a>, DINZ member Worldline walked us through its<a href="https://www.paymark.co.nz/blog/safer-faster-simpler-how-a-digital-identity-could-transform-our-day-to-day-lives/">&nbsp;Digital Identity Acceptance Network</a>&nbsp;at POS terminals, and DINZ member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xebo.me/">Xebo&nbsp;</a>demonstrated the application of its information assurance platform for a document (quote) using verifiable credentials in the exhibition area. We are hugely grateful to the Hui’s&nbsp;<a href="https://digitaltrusthui.co.nz/partners/">partners</a>, speakers and panellists, without whom this fantastic event would not have been possible.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Awareness and education play the most critical role in people’s adoption of these new services. In their absence, misinformation and disinformation fill the vacuum. A case in point is the jaw-dropping statistic from&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2023/02/Digital-Identity-in-Aotearoa-Report_final-1.pdf">DINZ’s research published last year</a>&nbsp;regarding the extent to which organisations are trusted to protect identity and use personal data responsibly. Government agencies only scored 51%. And yet,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/privacy-act-2020/information-sharing/approved-information-sharing-agreements/">OPC’s Approved Information Sharing list&nbsp;</a>is much more limited and evidentially contradicts the surveillance conspiracies that swirl around the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly with the opt-in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/identity/trust-framework/">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework</a>, where it’s not widely known that it’s primarily targeted at service providers to help keep their clients’ (you and me) information private and secure from fraudsters by introducing best practices, such as adopting protected reusable verifiable credentials that you decide who gets to see – so you are not forced to hand over documents to all and sundry for copying, which carry the risk of targeted data theft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my closing remarks at the Hui, I asked each attendee to consider what single action they can undertake right now to improve Digital Trust in Aotearoa. And I’m asking again here. There is a private-sector-initiated awareness and education module all set to go. Will your organisation step up to its corporate social responsibility in this domain and help sponsor it?&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@digitalidentity.nz">Reach out to me</a>&nbsp;if you’re interested to know more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, please take some time to listen to the first of DINZ’s new podcast series, Digital Identity in Focus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ5DHM28YRM&amp;list=PLvjBoMqh1G6_AY36W4nbUdvACyMmjvp8y">here</a>.

  <p>Addressing the Challenges of FAIR Data Implementation</p><p>The paper addresses a critical issue in implementing the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. While many research groups strive to make their data FAIR, they often encounter challenges documenting the context in which data was collected, processed, and analysed. This lack of machine-actionable, contextual metadata frequently renders data less reusable and visible outside the immediate research team.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, the authors present the first version of the Semantic Engine, a tool designed to facilitate the creation of decentralised, machine-actionable metadata schemas. This tool is handy when data is collected across multiple projects and institutions, such as Agri-Food Data Canada.</p><p>Leveraging Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)</p><p>The Semantic Engine is built upon the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a flexible and extensible standard hosted by the Human Colossus Foundation. OCA supports decentralised collaboration and reproducibility by allowing multiple contributors to work on different aspects of a data schema without compromising the integrity of the core data structure. This approach is particularly beneficial in the agri-food sector, where data heterogeneity and decentralised research efforts are expected.</p><p>The Semantic Engine is built upon the Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA), a flexible and extensible standard hosted by the Human Colossus Foundation. OCA supports decentralised collaboration and reproducibility by allowing multiple contributors to work on different aspects of a data schema without compromising the integrity of the core data structure. This approach is particularly beneficial in the agri-food sector, where data heterogeneity and decentralised research efforts are expected.</p><p>Applications and Future Implications</p><p>The Semantic Engine, freely accessible at <a href="https://semanticengine.org/">semanticengine.org</a>, allows researchers to create, edit, and manage OCA-based schemas. It has been thoroughly tested by researchers at the University of Guelph and is designed to be user-friendly for the broader research community.</p><p>The potential applications of OCA and the Semantic Engine extend beyond the agri-food sector. The paper highlights ongoing projects in Canada and Switzerland and the EU Horizon project 'NextGen,' which uses OCA to harmonise semantic data in cardiovascular personalized medicine.</p><p>The release of the "Decentralised Semantics: A Semantic Engine User Perspective" paper represents a significant step forward in making research data more FAIR and usable. By leveraging the Semantic Engine and OCA, researchers can ensure that their data is well-documented, reproducible, and accessible to a broader audience. The Human Colossus Foundation is proud to support this critical work and looks forward to its continued impact on the research community.</p><p>You can access the full paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2024-042">here</a> and explore the Semantic Engine at <a href="https://semanticengine.org/">semanticengine.org</a> for more information.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">GLEIF</a> is pleased to have broadened its engagement and participation in <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP)</a> by becoming a member of the ToIP Steering Committee in March 2024, recognizing the importance of well-functioning governance to the ongoing success of the foundation.&nbsp;GLEIF has been a member of ToIP, as a Founding Contributor member, since May 2020.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>, GLEIF has pioneered a new form of digitized organizational identity to meet the global need for automated identification, authentication and verification of legal entities across a range of industries. By creating the vLEI, GLEIF is now answering to this urgent and unmet need of pioneering a multi-stakeholder effort to create a new global ecosystem for organizational digital identity.</p>



<p>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier vLEI concept is simple: It is the secure digital counterpart of a conventional <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a>. In other words, it is a digitally trustworthy version of the 20-digit LEI code which is automatically verified, without the need for human intervention. The vLEI concept is also very much in-line with ToIP Technical and Governance Frameworks as detailed below.</p>



<p>The vLEI Trust Chain demonstrates the ability to chain the issuance of vLEI credentials as well as providing the foundation for the automated verification of vLEIs back to GLEIF which enable cryptographic verification of the identity of an organization back to its validated LEI identity.</p>







<p>vLEIs go further though in being able to cryptographically tie persons to organizations in the roles in which the persons are representing or engaging with these organizations. vLEI Role Credentials combine three concepts – (1) the organization’s identity, represented by the LEI, (2) a person’s identity and (3) the role that the person plays for the organization.&nbsp;</p>







<p>GLEIF works to advance digital trust standards in the neutral ToIP forum through participation in the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Ecosystem+Foundry+Working+Group">Ecosystem Foundry Working Group</a>, the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/04/02/new-issuer-governance-requirements-guide-for-verifiable-credentials-public-comment-needed/">Issuer Requirements Task Force</a> of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">Governance Stack Working Group</a> and as a co-chair of both the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ACDC/KERI Task Force</a> and <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technical Stack Working Group</a>.&nbsp;It is here in which the technical specifications of the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">KERI Suite</a> have been drafted and have begun the process of approval to become published ToIP standards. The <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2024/03/21/authentic-chained-data-containers-acdc-task-force-announces-public-review/">KERI Suite of specifications</a> is made up of 3 documents – the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification, the Authentic Chained Data Containere (ACDC) specification and the Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) specification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GLEIF also contributed to the development of the ToIP Ecosystem <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">Governance Metamodel</a> and <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-Companion-Guide-V1.0-2021-12-21.pdf">companion guide</a>.&nbsp;The verifiable LEI (vLEI) Ecosystem Governance Framework is based on the ToIP Governance Metamodel.</p>

  <p>A vision for the future of health data.</p><p>With the recent legislative work of the European Parliament and Council, the European Union is taking a visionary step towards establishing the EHDS. Beyond its benefits for patients and research, the EHDS has the potential to leverage digital technologies to significantly enhance the resilience and long-term sustainability of Europe's universal healthcare systems, provide a unique economic advantage, and set global standards in privacy, individual protection, and data governance. </p><p>For a European health data space that can be adopted by everyone (including patients!), individuals must rely on a system that embeds information security by design. A working group approached the question by leveraging the participants' diverse perspectives as stakeholders in a European Health Data Space.</p>





















  
  






  <p>Under the leadership of Philippe Page from the Human Colossus Foundation's Research Council, an international team of eleven students from diverse disciplines embarked on the mission to address key aspects of the EHDS. Their goal was to create a safe, accessible, and economically viable solution that would benefit patients and researchers alike.</p><p>Three guiding questions anchored their deliberations:</p>  <p>How might EHDS revolutionize medical research pathways via expanded data accessibility?</p>  <p>What measures could ensure the EHDS contributes to the EU economy without compromising health data privacy from commercial exploitation?</p>  <p>Which components constitute a secure, scalable infrastructure that meets the EHDS expectations and security demands? Would such an implementation prove sustainable?</p>  <p>The working group organized itself into three distinct focus groups, each addressing specific themes related to the broader topic. These subgroups operated autonomously throughout the sessions, diving into their subjects. Daily, the working group would collaborate in a collective session to share insights on primary/secondary data usage, discuss findings, and harmonize perspectives to manage risks in commercial usage. Through these collaborative efforts, the participants crafted a first draft of a position paper encompassing essential questions about the future development of the EHDS.</p>





















  
  














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                

            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  





  <p>In conclusion, the Human Colossus Foundation thanks the organisers for creating space for bringing new ideas forwards in a manner respecting everyone’s perspective. The vision initiated during the retreat in Disentis Monastery is just the beginning. With plans to reconvene in 2025, the group aims to build upon its foundational ideas. Its aim is to create a safer, more inclusive European Health Data Space that sets global benchmarks in privacy, individual protection, data use in research, and data governance.</p>

 Databases on Ceramic <p>OrbisDB has emerged as a premier database solution for the Ceramic Network. Building on the foundation laid by ComposeDB, OrbisDB brings significant advancements in functionality, performance, and user experience. This blog post will elaborate on the connection between Ceramic and OrbisDB, highlight OrbisDB's new features, and showcase its value to developers.</p> ComposeDB: The Original Building Block <p>ComposeDB was the first database and has become an integral technology for many decentralized applications built on Ceramic, such as <a href="https://www.passport.xyz/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Passport.xyz</a>, <a href="https://www.zuzalu.city/dashboard/home?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Zuzalu City</a>, <a href="https://charmverse.io/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">CharmVerse</a>, and <a href="https://www.lateral.io/desci?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Lateral DeSci</a>.</p><p>ComposeDB has been instrumental in dapp development on Ceramic because it introduces a robust, scalable, and user-friendly approach to data management. It supports structured data models, advanced queries, and the integration of decentralized identities, all while leveraging <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/revolutionizing-data-publishing-why-ceramic-shifted-from-multicast-to-pairwise-synchronization/">Ceramic's fast performance and high transaction capacity</a>.</p> OrbisDB: A Practical Evolution <p>3Box Labs designed Ceramic as an open network upon which an ecosystem of data-handling solutions could emerge. <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/composedb-is-live-on-ceramic-mainnet/">We launched ComposeDB in 2023</a> as the first database service on the network. </p><p>While ComposeDB represented the first database service offered on Ceramic and introduced many advancements for interacting with Ceramic, the need for simple onboarding, hosted nodes, SQL, and easy integrations with other services led the Orbis team to create OrbisDB.</p><p>Built initially as the Ceramic-based infrastructure for Orbis Social, OrbisDB evolved from a template implementation used by leading crypto projects such as Iggy Social, CoinEasy, Autonolas, and Gitcoin Schelling Point, into a slick set of interface services for data on Ceramic, including a UI for no code deployment, integrated hosting, support for additional languages, and a blue sea of possibilities made possible by plugins.</p> Key Upgrades with OrbisDB   Simplified Ceramic Developer Experience:  Rapid Ceramic Onboarding: OrbisDB offers a web app and SDK for storing and managing datasets on Ceramic, no-code, or CLI.  Hosted nodes: OrbisDB makes Ceramic DevOps easy with an in-built hosted node service.  Accelerated Customization: Extend the functionality of your database with plugins. Build plugins for other developers.      Database Language Choice:  SQL Queries: Using PostgreSQL as its indexing database, OrbisDB offers scalable performance and the benefits of traditional scaling methods.  GraphQL: (already available on ComposeDB) and vector embeddings are both in development.    Plugin Ecosystem:  Optional and Versatile: Developers can easily add plugins to OrbisDB. These plugins are optional and designed to perform operations beyond the core's scope, providing additional functionality and connections to other blockchain services. Recently released plugins for Dune (link) and Base (link) make data visualization and importing on-chain data from any Base smart contract code-free and straightforward.  Open source: Plugins are open source. Users can build and share plugins with other developers in the ecosystem.  Do anything with plugins:  Combine on-chain transactions from Base or other EVMs with verifiable data on Ceramic (e.g., enable mutable and verifiable metadata)  Provide sybil-resistance and instant reputation score to all user-generated data using Passport.xyz or Verax attestations.  Easily token-gate your applications via pre-defined indexing logic  Resolve ENS Domain names directly from any datasets in one click  Enable a single query from multiple data sources (API, on-chain, Ceramic data, etc.)      <p>Get Early Access to OrbisDB Studio</p><p>OrbisDB represents a practical evolution of databases on Ceramic, building upon the foundations laid by ComposeDB and significantly improving experience, languages, and interoperability.</p><p>Projects have already started building on OrbisDB in beta, including Index Network, Plurality, and Flashcards, for various use cases, including a blockchain event listener and storing encrypted user data and educational content.</p><p>We're excited to work with Orbis to support the future of decentralized data management. OrbisDB Studio, accessible later this year, will offer the developer experience improvements discussed above. <a href="https://app.formo.so/hJ5VGyugmGigyVFyqdHJa?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Sign up here to get on the waitlist for early access</a>. </p><p>Learn more about OrbisDB at <a href="https://useorbis.com/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">useorbis.com</a></p>

<p>It’s cybersecurity season in Las Vegas and I’m inspired to write an overdue post on why I hate the phrase “cyber civil defense”. Actually, I don’t hate the phrase, I disagree with its usage. Being the literal sort I am, I have to of course start with a long look at what the three words seem to mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cyber: aka technology; though perhaps a more detailed definition would include “software driven” and “internet connected” as necessary attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civil: in this context, I think it means “citizens” or just “people”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Defense: The catch with this term is that it’s unclear what or who is being defended and by what or whom. For instance, this innocuous three-word phrase could mean any number of things:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 Civilians defending “cyber” [tech] from other civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Civilians defending other people from civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending civilians from other civilians.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending civilians from tech.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Tech defending tech from civilians. (ew.)&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>I could go on but my head hurts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civilian defense seems to imply a kind of volunteer force to defend people from cyber threats (what kinds of threats?).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s where the wheels fall off this phrase: what about when the call’s coming from inside the house? Meaning, what about when the technology—as designed and with perfect integrity—is itself harmful to people? I’m not fine with using the phrase in the context or implication of defending people from risks from commercial technology itself because doing so:&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Reinforces that it’s acceptable for commercial technology (i.e. commercial products) to be a thing that civilians need to protect themselves from,&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Gaslights people into thinking that it’s somehow their responsibility to protect themselves against commercial technology that is evolving faster than the governance around it, bolstered by staggering amounts of financial resources, and whose risks are admittedly poorly understood by the makers themselves, but with just a little more elbow grease, you, dear user, can maybe be marginally less at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Smacks a bit of a military operation. I don’t want to join an army, I just want to have reasonably safe technology products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>– Also it’s a smidge paternalistic. (I can almost hear the “little lady” in there…)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is we already have a phrase to describe risks of commercial products on humans. It’s called Product Safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But product safety is an abject failure when it comes to commercial software and software-driven technology. In the US we have a dedicated product safety commission, but their scope hasn’t been updated since 2008, and was hamstrung by budgetary contractions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. Other agencies pick up pieces of product safety in the style of the blind men and the elephant, using their granted powers to maximum effect. The failure, however, is with the law makers. We have not updated ideas of “products” and “product safety” to keep pace with the internet age and citizens pay the price every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, from my research, it usually does take around 50 years after the launch of a new commercial product for US product safety laws to emerge, so we’re depressingly on time. For example, seatbelts became mandatory on January 1, 1968, sixty years after the commercial launch of the Fort Model T.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU recognized this gap in 2023 with their <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/general-product-safety-regulation-2023.html">updated product safety law</a>. As we in the US still wait for a federal privacy law, perhaps we can leapfrog ahead to a reimagined federal product safety law. Good news: we at ISL have tons of data, know-how, and tools to support this; it doesn’t have to start from scratch. But it would take extraordinary intestinal fortitude on behalf of the lawmakers to create something that meaningfully throttles the myriad risks technology foists upon us today. It would take precise regulation and a financially backed commitment to enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won’t be holding my breath, but we are absolutely here for that moment if and when it comes. Meanwhile, in the likely event the US government continues to ignore product safety for technology, ISL will continue to champion the safety of all tech users through our maturing safety labels and research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To mark the entry into force of the eIDAS Regulation 2.0 in May 2024, the Blockchain Berlin news platform has published a comprehensive review of the IDunion research project’s work over the past three years.</p>

<p>While the original aim of the project was to develop a decentralised identity management system based on blockchain, the project was subsequently refocused on federated data storage using the OpenID4VC protocol family developed by the consortium partners. The integration of these protocols into the eIDAS 2.0 Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) by the EU confirms IDunion’s expertise and its important contribution to digitalisation in Europe.</p>

<p>The article presents various possible use cases for digital credentials, such as the digital student ID card of the TU Berlin or the digital product passport for seamless identification and transparency of product sustainability data. </p>

 New Initiative to Drive Sustainability, Circular Economy, and Data Interoperability Across&nbsp;Europe <p>In response to the sustainability and circularity data sharing needs highlighted in the EU Green Deal and the new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), the European Commission adopted the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) in March 2022. This regulation establishes the Digital Product Passport (DPP) system, designed to provide essential information on a need-to-know basis to support sustainable production and enable the transition to a circular economy. The DPP aims to boost material and energy efficiency, extend product lifetimes, and optimize product design, manufacturing, use, and end-of-life handling.</p><p>Beyond facilitating sustainability and circularity-related data sharing among economic operators along value chains, the DPP is intended to create new business opportunities through digital and circular value retention and optimization, such as product-as-a-service, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling. It also helps consumers make sustainable choices and allows authorities to verify compliance with legal obligations.</p><p>Currently, there are numerous initiatives for such data sharing systems at the industry sector, platform, or individual company level. However, there is a lack of standardization in data definition, data format, and IT infrastructure, which hinders cross-sectoral interoperability. To address this, the EU Commission initiated the CIRPASS Coordination and Support Action (CSA) in October 2022, with the project set to conclude in March 2024. The focus is on batteries, electronics, and textile sectors. By the project’s end, CIRPASS will propose a clear cross-sectoral definition and description of the DPP system, identify key data for circularity, and define requirements for product identification and data exchange protocols to support further legislative and standardization developments.</p><p>To ensure inclusivity, an open call for pilot proposals was widely disseminated, forming the CIRPASS-2 project consortium, which will run from May 2024 until April 2027. Alongside 17 partners, CIRPASS-2 will demonstrate functioning Digital Product Passports in real-world settings through circular pilot deployments and use cases in textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, tires, and construction value&nbsp;chains.</p><p>CIRPASS-2 will show that the DPP, as a digital transformation initiative, helps strengthen the Union’s resilience and data sovereignty. It will develop a DPP data space fully aligned with Europe’s ongoing efforts in this field (such as SIMPL and DSSC) and emphasize interoperability based on harmonized standards. The focus on open source and architecture will also foster the EU data economy while ensuring compliance with data regulations. By taking the conceptualized DPP and pilot solutions and deploying them at scale, CIRPASS-2 aims to bridge the gap between digital technology research and market deployment. The project will contribute directly to Digital Europe Programme (DEP) objectives through its results and will provide extensive policy and business recommendations to further these&nbsp;goals.</p><p>CIRPASS-2 is an Innovation Action project funded by the European Commission’s Digital Europe Programme, running from May 2024 until April 2027. With 13 lighthouse pilots, the project will demonstrate functioning DPPs in real settings and at scale across four target value chains: textiles, electrical and electronic equipment, tires, and construction materials. Additionally, CIRPASS-2 will create a broad community of DPP stakeholders to facilitate the deployment of DPPs in various product sectors across Europe and&nbsp;beyond.</p> About Energy&nbsp;Web <p>Energy Web is a global non-profit organization accelerating the energy transition by developing and deploying open-source decentralized technologies.

The guide outlines high-priority security requirements from the earliest stages of software development, a principle central to creating “secure by design” products.</p>



<p>Among the items highlighted are phishing-resistant authentication methods, such as <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, as a default feature in software products. Announced on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at Black Hat USA, this new guidance represents a vital step forward in securing the digital supply chain in the United States and worldwide.</p>



 Secure by Demand, Secure by Design 



<p>This new guidance complements CISA’s recent <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/Shifting-the-Balance-of-Cybersecurity-Risk-Principles-and-Approaches-for-Secure-by-Design-Software.pdf">Secure by Design Guide</a> aimed at technology manufacturers to improve their software product security. By focusing on the procurement aspect in the supply chain, the new guidance advises software buyers to demand modern security features from technology manufacturers, such as phishing-resistant authentication and passkeys. By doing so, customers can drive demand for security as a baseline feature and compel technology manufacturers to adhere to secure design practices.</p>



<p>The guidance also includes an assessment to evaluate software security and include security requirements in contracts. It encourages a proactive procurement approach, where a buyer can assess a manufacturer’s security and capabilities to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen resilience. The guide establishes best practices for secure software procurement and highlights the product security features that bolster supply chain security and interoperability.</p>



 Passkeys Take Center Stage 



<p>CISA’s guidance aligns with the recent guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in their digital identity guidelines on authentication and lifecycle management. In supplemental guidance, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/nist-cites-phishing-resistance-of-synced-passkeys-in-digital-identity-guidelines-update/">NIST SP 800-63Bsup1</a>, NIST affirmed that synced passkeys meet Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) requirements and device-bound passkeys satisfy Authentication Assurance Level 3 (AAL3). The two guidance documents emphasize the importance of security, including digital identity and authentication best practices, across the digital supply chain.</p>



<p>The Secure by Demand guidance empowers IT buyers, who can drive market demand for secure software features, such as passkeys and FIDO authentication. Given that weak or stolen passwords account for <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/resources/reports/global-password-security-report">80% of hacking-related breaches</a> and <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/100067-report-shows-1265-increase-in-phishing-emails-since-chatgpt-launched">credential phishing has skyrocketed by 967%</a> since 2022, buyers can use the guide’s security assessment to evaluate software security, including passkey capabilities, and improve security risk management in the supply chain. With this guidance, CISA aims to increase awareness and drive market demand for secure software.</p>



 Key Recommendations for Software Manufacturers 



<p>CISA’s Secure by Demand guide outlines several critical requirements that customers should evaluate when procuring software, and includes questions to assess a software manufacturer’s security capabilities in the following areas:</p>



 
 Authentication: Manufacturers should support secure, standards-based Single Sign-On (SSO) and implement phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) or passkeys — by default, and at no extra cost. 



 Eliminating Vulnerabilities: Systematic efforts should be made to address and prevent classes of software defects, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. 



 Secure Defaults: Security logs should be provided to customers without additional charges, ensuring transparency and accountability in software security. 



 Supply Chain Security: Ensuring the provenance of third-party dependencies via Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and robust processes for integrating open-source components are vital. 



 Vulnerability Disclosure: Transparency and timely reporting of vulnerabilities, including authorization for security testing by the public, is crucial for maintaining trust and improving security outcomes. 
 



 A Call to Action for Security Leaders 



<p>The guidance for those manufacturing or procuring software across the software supply chain is clear: passkeys improve third-party supply chains and ensure higher security standards in software procurement and development processes. By integrating passkeys into authentication processes, organizations can strengthen end-to-end digital identity lifecycle management and significantly reduce the risks of phishing and social engineering attacks.</p>

<p>Submitted by: Joni Brennan, President</p>



<p>List of recommendations</p>



 
 Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:
 
 Digital Trust in Citizen Services; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety; and 



 Digital Trust in Business and Industry 
 
 



 Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing privacy-protecting verification and authentication tools as part of its Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategy. 



 Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike. 
 



<p>Introduction</p>



<p>The spread of misinformation is evolving around the world at a concerning pace. Bad actors are finding new battlegrounds and frontiers every day, and information and images generated by AI are being used to push political agendas and false narratives, scam and steal money and identities, and, even worse, lure online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, AI is also evolving rapidly, with risks as significant as the benefits. Further, now that AI is generative, users can manipulate images and information at unprecedented speed and scale, and vast amounts of inaccurate and malicious information make it difficult for people and organizations to verify information authenticity.</p>



<p>In today’s era of information warfare, authenticity and verification must be prioritized — particularly given the role of digital trust and identity verification in the delivery of government and business services.</p>



<p>Our submission and recommendations reflect the deep experience and expertise of DIACC’s member organizations, and our collective commitment to working with leaders in both the public and private sectors to secure verifiable information authenticity to the benefit of government, industry, and citizens alike by prioritizing inclusive and accessible privacy-protecting digital trust and verification capabilities.</p>



<p>About DIACC</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, with a goal to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>DIACC is guided by a belief that our public safety, civic engagement, and economic prosperity depend on leveraging trusted solutions and using well-established risk mitigation and certification tools. DIACC is committed to accelerating digital trust adoption and reducing information authenticity uncertainty by certifying services against its Pan-Canadian Trust Framework — a risk mitigation and assurance framework developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts that signals trustworthy design rooted in security, privacy, inclusivity, accessibility, and accountability.</p>



<p>Recommendations</p>



<p>Recommendation 1: That the government prioritize digital trust in four areas critical to Canada’s leadership and the privacy, security and protection of our people and industries, including:</p>



 
 Digital Trust in Citizen Services; 



 Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory; 



 Digital Trust in Public Safety; and 



 Digital Trust in Business and Industry. 
 



<p>Digital Trust in Citizen Services</p>



<p>DIACC advocates for digital trust in citizen services, emphasizing the importance of secure, privacy-respecting, and user-centric solutions through collaboration between government, private sector, and civil society. Leveraging our collaborative partnerships, we developed the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) – a risk mitigation and assurance framework that extends standards and open source code to help service providers ensure risk mitigation and user care.</p>



<p>As public services continue to move online, digital trust and verification services will be critical for ensuring that services are secure and accessible. From online healthcare consultations to digital government services, these technologies provide the necessary security infrastructure to protect public interactions and data.</p>



<p>Through partnerships with organizations such as DIACC, the government is encouraged to prioritize innovation in digital trust technologies through pilot projects, research, and education. Collaboration with various sectors will ensure the development and implementation of secure, efficient, inclusive, and accessible digital trust solutions, fostering a reliable digital ecosystem for accessing healthcare, banking, and government services.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Finance and Regulatory</p>



<p>Canadians benefit from being a highly banked jurisdiction with broad inclusivity and accessibility – according to the Canadian Bankers Association, approximately 99 per cent of Canadian adults have a bank account.</p>



<p>Existing financial regulations provide powerful and internationally recognized tools that act as a solid foundation to fight fraud and foster a more verified, authentic, and trustworthy ecosystem that supports the needs of people, governments, and businesses alike. However, the government is encouraged to build on the existing regulatory framework and develop new regulations to facilitate secure digital transactions, including compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.</p>



<p>Further, digital trust and verification services will be critical as the government moves forward with its commitments to open-banking, with interoperability also being paramount as the federal framework and existing provincial frameworks work together.</p>



<p>Similarly, the government has committed to reducing incidents of mortgage fraud and strengthening proof of borrower and title insurance, and digital trust and verification services can and should play a critical role in making that commitment a reality.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Public Safety</p>



<p>DIACC believes that implementing digital trust and verification services are essential for enhancing public safety. Digital verification can play a crucial role in protecting vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities.</p>



<p>By ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive areas such as schools, healthcare facilities, and care homes, digital trust services can help safeguard these groups from potential harm. Further, digital trust and verification services enable secure and reliable cross-border identity verification, facilitating international collaboration in law enforcement, disaster response, and public health.</p>



<p>By prioritizing advanced authentication methods that ensure individuals and organizations are who they claim to be, we can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and critical infrastructure, minimize financial scams and misuse of personal data, and enhance public safety for all Canadians.</p>



<p>Digital Trust in Business and Industry</p>



<p>Enhanced security is a primary benefit of digital trust and verification services for businesses and industries. These services provide robust security measures that protect businesses from fraud, identity theft, and cyber threats. Ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information and resources, these services help maintain the integrity of business operations.</p>



<p>By prioritizing digital trust in business and industry and implementing authentication and verification tools, the government can help drive the following benefits:</p>



 
 streamlined business processes by automating identity verification and reducing the need for manual checks; 



 faster, more efficient operations and reduced administrative costs, allowing businesses to allocate resources more effectively; 



 data minimization and the secure handling of personal information, increasing customer confidence; 



 a competitive advantage for Canadian businesses by helping them innovate and offer their customers new, secure digital services; and 



 a reduction in incidents of fraud, resulting in significant cost savings for businesses. These savings can be reinvested into other business areas, driving growth and innovation and improving overall business performance. 
 



<p>Recommendation 2: That the government recognize the necessity of embracing and prioritizing verification and authentication tools as part of its AI strategy.</p>



<p>In today’s world, where AI is becoming smarter every day, and information can be generated and manipulated at unprecedented speed and scale, ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of information is critical. It is vital to maximize the benefits of an AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-fueled data ecosystem for Canada while also fostering citizen trust and protecting their safety.</p>



<p>To effectively address the challenges we’re facing while realizing the benefits of AI, the federal government should prioritize verification and authentication tools as part of its broader AI strategy. Prioritization must include funding, collaboration, and urgent action to support the development, adoption and certification of tools that verify information authenticity while protecting privacy and empowering Canadians. Governments, banks, telcos, tech companies, media organizations, and civil society must work together to deploy open, standards-based solutions and services to verify the authenticity of information.</p>



<p>The economic imperative of investing in these capabilities is clear. According to a <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting/perspectives/generative-ai-in-finance.html">study</a> by Deloitte, the Canadian economy could unlock an additional 7 per cent (CAD $7 trillion) in economic value through AI and AGI technologies. People and organizations can only realize this potential for the good of society by investing in tools, processes, and policies that support verifying the authenticity of the information generated and processed by AI and AGI technologies.</p>



<p>Recommendation 3: That the government allocate the funding needed to support the adoption of digital trust tools to the benefit of government, businesses, and citizens alike.</p>



<p>Today, solutions can signal verified trust by getting certified against a technology-neutral risk and assurance framework like DIACC’s Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, developed collaboratively by public and private sector experts.</p>



<p>Verifiable information authenticity relies on critical principles, including provenance and traceability: provenance establishes the origin and history of information, ensuring it comes from a reliable source, while traceability allows for audibility of the flow of information, enabling people, businesses, and governments to verify its accuracy and authenticity. These principles are essential in combating the spread of misinformation and disinformation, which can have far-reaching consequences in an AI-fueled world.</p>



<p>Provenance and traceability are potent information authenticity tools that can help:</p>



 
 businesses and professionals reduce liabilities and meet obligations to verify information about their clients and their operations; 



 citizens and residents interact securely and efficiently with governments; 



 customers and clients transact with privacy and security anywhere, anytime; 



 industries manage decision-making and securely supply chains using trusted data; 



 producers verify essential data related to environmental, safety, and operational goals and 



 creators track intellectual property to ensure fair payment and cultural protection. 
 



<p>Conclusion</p>

 Registry enables tracing and tracking of sustainable aviation fuel with the help of Energy Web and Polkadot technologies <p>The Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificate or SAFc registry was recently launched to support major consumers of air travel and transport in their efforts to help directly decarbonize flight. The registry’s design, development, and testing was spearheaded by nonprofit organizations RMI and the Environmental Defense Fund, that work through the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), an organization whose members include major airlines, fuel providers, and sustainable aviation buyers such as Novo Nordisk looking to reduce the climate impacts of air transport.</p><p>The <a href="https://safcregistry.org/">SAFc Registry</a> connects corporate consumers, airlines, freight forwarders, and clean fuel providers in one universally accessible platform that will spur the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by ensuring that SAF certificates purchased outside of the platform are delivered consistently, verifiably, transparently, and credibly. The registry builds on industry best practices and was subject to public consultation to ensure SAF certificates exchanged realize their intended environmental impact and can be claimed towards emissions reduction goals.</p><p>SAF is made from renewable or waste materials and can decrease the lifecycle emissions of flight by more than 80%. However, the fuel is not yet widely available and can be significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. The Registry helps address this market gap by connecting corporate demand for emissions reductions to SAF producers through an auditable ledger for certificates which decouples the emissions benefits of SAF use from the physical fuel supply. It is the final piece of market infrastructure — in addition to robust <a href="https://rsb.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/RSB-PRO-20-001-001-RSB-Book-and-Claim-Manual-3.0.pdf">standards</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificate-safc-emissions-accounting-and-reporting-guidelines/">book &amp; claim accounting guidelines</a>, and structured <a href="https://flysaba.org/2023/04/04/first-collective-purchase-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates/">RFPs</a> — to create a robust and de-risked market for SAFc investment.</p><p><a href="https://flysaba.org/2024/04/17/sustainable-aviation-buyers-alliance-announces-historic-agreements-to-purchase-sustainable-aviation-fuel-certificates-to-grow-investment-in-clean-fuel-technologies/">Major customers have already banded together via SABA to collectively procure SAF certificates</a>. Several of these deals will use the SAFc Registry as the delivery mechanism. Future procurement efforts inside and outside of SABA can use the SAFc Registry to seamlessly ensure the delivery of SAF certificates and sustainability assurances to buyers. Q8Aviation, an international jet fuel supplier delivering sustainable aviation fuel to the aviation market, recently enrolled to the registry saying, “We look forward to leveraging the SAFc registry to expand accessibility and support broader adoption of&nbsp;SAF.”</p><p>Additionally, climate tech company CHOOOSE is complementing the registry with features to streamline the flow of SAF transactions across the value chain. “At CHOOOSE, we build and operate software that supports airlines, freight forwarders, clean fuel providers, and corporate buyers in scaling their sustainable aviation fuel programs. Recognizing the vital role SAF plays in helping to decarbonize the aviation industry, these programs contribute meaningfully to SAF’s adoption. By leveraging systems like book and claim, the SAFc Registry ensures the secure transfer of certificates — and when coupled with CHOOOSE technology, SAF transactions become more automated, streamlined, and accessible. Through this partnership, we’re able to accelerate the use of SAF across the sector,” said Gaute Gamst, Chief Technology Officer at&nbsp;CHOOOSE.</p><p>Web 3 technologies play an important role in operation of the SAFc Registry in order to provide deep transparency to end-users. With the support of so-called worker nodes anchored and supported by the Energy Web X blockchain on Polkadot, actions on the SAFc Registry are checked, validated, and digitally recorded in a zero trust, tamper proof way. For registry users, the public, and auditors, this represents a continuous audit of registry operations.</p><p><a href="https://safcregistry.org/">For more information, please visit the SAFc registry&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>Notes to&nbsp;Editors:</p><p>About Energy Web Foundation:</p><p>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

 Championing European Gymnastics with Borderless Knowledge enabled by Artificial Intelligence and OriginTrail <p><a href="https://www.europeangymnastics.com/">European Gymnastics</a> is a sports organisation counting 50 national member federations, and reaches beyond the borders of political Europe. It nevertheless bears the idea of a united gymnastics nation. As guarantor of interests of its around 8,500,000 gymnasts, European Gymnastics represents many different facets. From high-level competitive sports in four Olympic, and three non-Olympic disciplines to leisure sports in gymnastics for all with offers for all age groups, from toddlers to senior citizens. European Gymnastics transmit their understanding of being together beyond borders and set an example in community.</p><p>Now, European Gymnastics is launching its own Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant powered by <a href="https://origintrail.io/">OriginTrail</a> to drive borderless knowledge in order to further their mission to promote, develop and support synergy among the community to make Gymnastics and gymnasts at all levels, shine. The friendly mascot Luigi who you can meet at all major European Gymnastics events, is now receiving its digital twin. Powered by AI, digital Luigi allows anyone to learn and keep in touch with the European Gymnastics community. From finding the information about the next competition to learning about​​ important events in European Gymnastics history or helping you understand which elements are important for scoring a routine on parallel bars — all can be discovered with the help of the AI-powered Luigi.</p><p>The uniqueness of our digital Luigi is that his responses always include sources of information, allowing the user to explore any particular source further. This capability is unlocked by using OriginTrail’s Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is promising to unlock an even more powerful Luigi assistant as it will allow the initial knowledge base to continuously expand, not only by European Gymnastics’s inputs but also with contributions of the national federations, gymnasts and fans. As OriginTrail is based on blockchain, all such contributions will also be protected against tampering — extending European Gymnastics’s commitment to integrity from the sport halls to managing&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today’s launch of Luigi is accompanied by the launch of the biggest sporting event in the world — the Olympic Games. To help you navigate all the performances by European gymnasts in Paris, Luigi is already equipped with knowledge about the schedule and will also be receiving updates about results every&nbsp;day.</p><p>“European Gymnastics is excited to keep pushing the innovation in our sport. After being the first continental gymnastics federation to launch a digital cup competition this year, we are now making first steps into adopting Artificial Intelligence and blockchain to improve the ease of interaction with what is sometimes considered a complex world of Gymnastics. This is an important step in our newly adopted Strategy 2030, embracing top technology which has a lot to offer..” Dr. Farid Gayibov, European Gymnastics President.</p><p>You can find Luigi’s digital twin on the <a href="https://europeangymnastics.com/ask">European Gymnastics website</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/championing-european-gymnastics-with-borderless-knowledge-enabled-by-artificial-intelligence-and-f49dae6f6e25">Championing European Gymnastics with Borderless Knowledge enabled by Artificial Intelligence and…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>About a month ago one of our founders, Joel Thorstensson, released an <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/t/private-data-architecture/1585?ref=blog.ceramic.network">initial overview</a> of our plans to begin ideating how physical private data capabilities could be natively offered to developers using the Ceramic Network. The forum post includes details of how this would be rolled out in two phases in the form of a proof-of-concept, which is advisable to read before consuming this article.</p><p>It's also important to mention the motivation behind this effort. To start, Ceramic doesn't currently offer any native privacy features. This means that all data on Ceramic is public by default. At the same time, over the past few years, we've recognized the strong need for access control across several applications and use cases. A rough estimation would be almost half of all apps built on Ceramic have access control needs in one form or another.</p><p> In thinking about a solution, we aligned on the premise that physical access control (where data lives and who can sync it, as opposed to encryption) resonates most directly with the uniqueness of Ceramic's event-based architecture and our desire to align with edge privacy principles.</p><p>As such, our next step was to define a scope around a minimalist build to showcase how physical data privacy could be implemented in Ceramic.</p> Phase 1: API Read Access Control <p>If you've read Joel's forum post (linked above), you already know the details of the concept we've designed for this first phase. However, below are several key takeaways:</p>  Builds on <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Ceramic-one</a> (implementation of the Ceramic protocol, written in Rust)  Leverages the Feed API on Ceramic-one nodes, thus allowing nodes to filter the feed of events based on which permissions a user has  Designed to showcase how two users could share private data from the same node by leveraging object-capabilities (OCAP)  Shows how an object-capability generated by user 1 references a stream containing the data they want to share (as well as the DID corresponding to user 2, the person they want to share their data with) and allows user 2 to access data that would otherwise be physically inaccessible to query and obtain without the OCAP  <p>This article will walk through how to run the PoC locally.</p><p>If you prefer video, please view the YouTube version of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNiUlGremBQ&amp;ref=blog.ceramic.network">Private Data Playground</a>:</p> Setting Up Your Environment <p>This walk-through requires you to generate clones of two repositories, one of which is the PoC itself, while the other is the Rust-Ceramic codebase.</p> Rust-Ceramic Set-Up <p>First, install protobuf:</p> <code># You can alternatively use `brew install protobuf`
PROTOC_VERSION=3.20.1
PROTOC_ZIP=protoc-$PROTOC_VERSION-linux-x86_64.zip
curl --retry 3 --retry-max-time 90 -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v$PROTOC_VERSION/$PROTOC_ZIP \
    &amp;&amp; unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc \
    &amp;&amp; unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*' \
    &amp;&amp; rm -f $PROTOC_ZIP</code> <p>Next, clone the Rust-Ceramic codebase:</p> <code># we will need a special branch from the repo
git clone https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic &amp;&amp; cd rust-ceramic &amp;&amp; git fetch</code> <p>We need to set up our Rust-Ceramic node from a specific branch. Enter the branch relevant to this PoC, build, and run the daemon:</p> <code># enter the special branch
git checkout feat/private-data

# build and run
cargo run -p ceramic-one -- daemon</code> <p>If your terminal starts populating with logs like the screenshot below, you've successfully started your node!</p><p>You now have an active Ceramic node running in the background! Next, we'll walk through the configuration for the private data playground web app.</p> Private Data Playground Web App Setup <p>First, clone the Private Data Playground repository:</p> <code>git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/private-data-playground</code> <p>Go ahead and open the private-data-playground repo in your text editor of choice. Once open, we will need to create a copy of the example environment file and rename it:</p> <code>cp .env.example .env</code> <p>Our first step is to supply a value to our <code>NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID</code> variable by setting up a Project ID with WalletConnect. You can set one up for free (if you don't already have one) by following the simple steps in our <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/walletconnect-tutorial/">WalletConnect tutorial</a> (under "Obtain a WalletConnect Project ID). We will need this given that our application's Wagmi hooks rely on a contextual wrapper that will allow us to leverage these hooks within all child components, and use <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/appkit/overview?ref=blog.ceramic.network">Web3Modal</a>.</p><p>Once obtained, paste this into your new environment file next to the variable name referenced above.</p><p>Next, install your dependencies:</p> <code>npm install</code> <p>We're now ready to run the PoC!</p> Running the Application <p>Start up your application from within the private-data-playground repository in developer mode to initiate the UI:</p> <code>npm run dev</code> <p>You should now be able to access the UI by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:3000/?ref=blog.ceramic.network">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser!</p> Creating a Stream and a Capability <p>Our first section will focus on generating a stream (containing a simple message) and an OCAP. </p><p>To begin, self-authenticate by clicking "Connect Wallet." </p><p>You should see a secondary signature request appear after selecting an account - approving this request will create a browser session (specific to your DID, stemming from your Eth address) that the application will use to sign and submit data on your behalf as you create messages:</p><p>There are two views contained in this simple PoC - one for writing data, and one for reading. Make sure you're in the "Write" view by clicking the toggle under your address:</p><p>Go ahead and enter a simple message of your choosing - for example, "I love Ceramic!" would be an obvious choice. Go ahead and click the "Create" button. This action initiates a process that builds a new Ceramic stream and constructs your message into a payload that the Rust-Ceramic feed API will accept.</p><p>You should now see the resulting identifier under "Stream ID":</p><p>Go ahead and copy this value. Save it somewhere as it's needed later (a simple text document will suffice). </p><p>Finally, select another Eth address you control (make sure to remember which one) and enter it into the text input under "Delegate read access to". When ready, click "Create Capability". If you've followed all the steps correctly, your screen should look something like this:</p><p>Copy the capability value somewhere you can reference for the next section.</p><p>Congrats! You've successfully created both a Ceramic stream and a capability object! The next section will show how to use these to access otherwise private data.</p> Using the OCAP to Access Private Data <p>Go ahead and disconnect your current authenticated account from the web app. Next, go through the sign-in flow using the address you selected for the "Delegate read access to" input from the prior section.</p><p>Once authenticated, navigate to the "Read" toggle in the web app:</p><p>Enter the Stream ID and the Capability generated and saved from the prior section.</p><p>If you've copied over the values correctly, you should now be able to view the original message:</p><p>Congratulations - you've successfully used a capability to access otherwise private data on Ceramic. </p><p>You can also run through the "Read" process again, but this time make an arbitrary edit to the OCAP (thus invalidating it). With the Stream ID value kept the same, you'll notice that you no longer access the resulting message.</p> Next Steps <p>This minimal PoC is only the beginning of our plans for rolling out private data on Ceramic, with phase 2 coming soon (showcasing data privacy in the form of nodes and their ability to sync data between each other based on signed capabilities).</p><p>Is private data relevant to what you're building? Have feedback, questions, or concerns about our current thinking around private data? We'd love to hear from you! Fill out our <a href="https://ceramic.network/contact-us?ref=blog.ceramic.network">community contact form</a>, or email us at <a>partners@3box.io</a>. </p><p>Happy buidling!</p>

<p>Today, we are excited to announce our latest research exposing the massively networked personal information sharing happening between and across identity resolution and customer data platforms that has been hiding in plain sites for over 10 years. These industries are the plumbing backbone in synthesizing personal data from hundreds of data sources—across services, devices, and spanning the digital world and the physical world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February 2024, Cracked Labs published <a href="https://crackedlabs.org/en/identity-surveillance">“Pervasive identity surveillance for marketing purposes”</a>, an in-depth analysis of LiveRamp’s RampID identity graph. One of the most superficial yet most powerful functions of this excellent report was to guide attention towards industries responsible for pervasive consumer surveillance. The timing was excellent as I’d already committed to present “The Hidden Identity Infrastructure” at Identiverse (May 2024) and prompted by the report, I dug in to better understand the two industries underpinning hidden identity infrastructure, namely, Identity Resolution (ID Res) and Customer Data Platforms (CDPs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are nearly $9T worth of industries worldwide that rely on persistent, hidden identification of people. Naturally, demand of this magnitude fueled the now mature industries that perform pervasive, universal identification of people and their personal information. ISL identified over 350 companies providing either identity resolution platforms, customer data platforms, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This paper explores the magnitude and reach of these two industries, how they came to be, and most importantly, why, from a human well-being perspective, it’s crucial that these kinds of platforms be held to higher regulatory standards of scrutiny, transparency, and accountability. One identity resolution company alone out of 93&nbsp; such companies (worldwide) boasts the collection of 5,000 data elements for [each of] 700 million consumers in 2021. To put this in perspective, the number of user accounts breached worldwide in 2023 was about 300 million1. Is there an appreciable difference between stolen user data and undisclosed “legitimate” personally identifiable information sharing? Moreover, nearly 40% of the 93 companies that provide identity resolution platforms are registered data brokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, after reviewing the research, we must ask ourselves, is this the kind of world we want to live in: a world where everything about us is always known by industry; a world where the ongoing surveillance of people is deemed necessary in the name of capitalism. Is this the kind of world in which humans and societies will flourish or self-destruct? Are humans more than capitalistic consumers? Are we more than our purchasing potential?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A Call to Action&nbsp; 
<p>ISL conducted this research to help illuminate the sizable risk of hidden identification and the worldwide web of user surveillance. ISL believes naming and exposure is crucial to effecting change. Identification resolution and customer data platforms have been hiding in plain sight for more than a decade, and yet even the “identerati” are largely unfamiliar with these industries. How can we expect everyday people to know?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This paper is a rallying call for privacy advocates to come together to demand greater regulatory scrutiny, transparency and oversight for these industries, in conjunction with more meaningful data broker regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, this is a rallying call to acknowledge the catastrophic failure of notice and consent as a valid permissioning mechanism for highly complex and interconnected digital services. It’s inconceivable that people understand the magnitude of data sharing that consenting to sharing “your data with our marketing” entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must ask ourselves if this is the kind of world we want for ourselves and our children, where our preferences, practices, relationships, behaviors, and beliefs are all up for sale and broadly shared without our awareness. Are we ourselves in fact being sold?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technologies fueling these capabilities have received billions of dollars; consumers don’t have a chance in the face of voracious hunger to identify, know, and manipulate them. We hope that this research shines a much needed light on the forces enabling the worldwide web of human surveillance so that they may be held to accountability for their troves of data on nearly all internet users.&nbsp;</p>
