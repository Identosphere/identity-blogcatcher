 What is Digital Transformation and why it is essential to have a blockchain&nbsp; like Commercio.network&nbsp; to implement it. 
 What is digital transformation? 
<p>In 2014, the EU issued the eIDAS directives by regulating Trust Services to create electronic identities, sign and send electronic documents with legal value. This has made it possible to dematerialize all business processes in digital form. According to an EU estimate, digital transformation is expected to increase gross domestic product by 2.2 trillion euros over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why is it essential to be a blockchain ? 
<p>The blockchain is the technology made famous by Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s a network that allows you to exchange something that has value and must remain original to keep it. You can exchange copies of images on the internet, but you can’t transfer originals. If it were possible we could all send each other pictures of money via whatsapp and not exchange banknotes. The blockchain solves the problem of exchanging value by exchanging originals. That’s why the founders of Commerc.io thought of using it to exchange documents with legal value.</p>
<p>The Digital Transformation&nbsp; blockchain Commercio.network is an open-source PROJECT that gives companies the ability to sign and exchange documents using blockchain technology to guarantee:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Paternity: The document was created by the declared sender.&nbsp; 
  Non-repudiation: The sender cannot deny having&nbsp; signed the document&nbsp; 
  Integrity: The document has not been altered during transport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>There are two main groups of business documents:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Structured: Mostly XML (Invoices, orders, order confirmations, etc).&nbsp; 
  Unstructured: Mostly PDF (Contracts, forms, letters, etc).&nbsp; 
 
<p>The network is organized through an international network&nbsp; of 100 independent companies. Any company, especially yours, is welcome to join the consortium and take advantage of this next-generation technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commercio.network is called The Documents blockchain because it focuses on solving one core business problem: legally exchanging and signing business documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mission&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our mission is to spread blockchain technology to worldwide companies with a bold Go to market&nbsp; plan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  100 Node validators companies to onboard. 
  1000&nbsp; distributors companies to onboard. 
  10.000 IT companies to onboard…&nbsp; 
  100.000 end customers companies on the blockchain.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to provide every IT Company in the world a simple, fast, profitable way to create value for them and their end customers with:</p>
 
  the vision&nbsp; 
  the skills&nbsp; 
  the core technology&nbsp; 
  the network of validators&nbsp; 
  the developer tools&nbsp; 
 
<p>We have removed the underlying complexity of implementing a blockchain project by defining a three layer approach.&nbsp;</p>
 
  APPLICATION LAYER: where IT companies build apps for solving users’ problems.&nbsp; 
  NETWORKING LAYER: where the companies run the blockchain network nodes.&nbsp; 
  PROTOCOL LAYER: where the basic 8 Core Functions are implemented on the node.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 8 Core Functions Our blockchain core Node software has a group of “Smart Contracts” focused on the world of the document:&nbsp;</p>
 
 CommercioWallet (Done) : Enable users account and access&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioID (Done): Enable users self sovereign identity&nbsp; 
 CommercioDocs (Done): Enable users to exchange business documents&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioSign (Done): Enable users to sign business documents&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioMint (Done): Enable users to create blockchain Tokens&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;CommercioKYC (Next) : Enable TSPs to issue verifiable credentials&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 CommercioDex (Next) : Enable users to exchange blockchain Tokens&nbsp; 
 CommercioPay (Next) : Enable users to get SEPA payments

<p><a>3Box Labs</a> is about to open up a lot of new roles. As we grow into our next phase, we spent a lot of time last month digging into a critical question: how do we improve the diversity of our team?</p><p>Our current team is far from representative of the global population we aim to build for. Our team of 12 is 9 men and 3 women. 9 of us are white. We are geographically spread out - but only in North America and Europe. And our pipeline of incoming applicants is more homogenous than this.</p><p>Last month we had a series of full-team conversations about our approach to building a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable team. We had plenty of differing opinions and useful debates, and did not end with 100% agreement on everything. We did end with a deeper shared appreciation for how much this matters, an approach that we believe in, and some steps we are putting into action.</p><p>We'd love your support, input, and feedback as we put this into action and so are sharing thinking as well as our plans.</p> Why diversity is critical to us <p>Our team first dug into why it is important to us. There are many reasons building a diverse team matters. Bringing focus to those that hold the most meaning to our team helped us make sure we arrived at a plan of action that would resonate. It also let us get extremely specific about how this goal relates to our overall mission and the other goals — and other constraints — that we have as a team. This helped us ensure our plan of action would be practical.</p><p>After several iterations, we arrived at this summary of why this topic is so important to us, which now lives on our <a href="https://www.notion.so/About-3Box-Labs-7100eadf86624b1ba00793da29a08711">About Us page</a>.</p>  🤝🏽 Commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion <p>Building a diverse team is a top priority because nothing will impact our success more deeply. Our ambitions for change are global and our team must represent perspectives from across the world we aim to improve.</p>  The challenges we face are incredibly complex. We must tackle these with ideas and ingenuities from a wide variety of backgrounds and contexts.  Our technology impacts how information and identities are controlled online, with deeply personal and widespread effects. We each have blind spots and need many viewpoints to anticipate the consequences of our work.  We want to face the many unforeseen changes and challenges we have ahead with a balanced and robust team, drawing on a diversity of strengths to adapt and improve through adversity.  <p>We have work to do here, as a team and industry. It's our responsibility to model that only a diverse team working together can we succeed in building a more sustainable, fair and equitable web.</p> <p>One thing absent from this is anything about our role in helping close the opportunity gap for underrepresented groups in crypto, tech, and knowledge economy jobs. We debated this internally at length, as we do feel a responsibility to advance equity more generally in the greater ecosystem in which we operate. However, we feared diluting the messaging that building a diverse and inclusive team is central to our core mission. Aiming to impact social justice in tech felt like a big undertaking and adjacent to our core goals. We have a deep conviction that building a diverse team is critical to our success as an organization, so we decided to keep our statement focused on reinforcing that rather than adding additional diversity goals related to social justice more broadly.</p><p>We talked with several DEI advisors and heard mixed reactions. One felt it absurd to make a 'business case' for an equitable team; it's simply the right and necessary thing to do. Others felt that grounding our commitment to diversity deeply in our team's mission would help us feel the priority more concretely and urgently. We ended, for now, keeping our commitment tied explicitly to our mission. We do hope that through that commitment we will be able to model equity in a space where lack of representation is too much the norm.</p> Our approach to building a diverse team <p>To live up to our commitment, we need a principled approach to hiring that values and emphasizes diversity while still holding to other values, including evaluating every candidate as an individual. We established two particularly important principles:</p>  Invest heavily in proactively building a representative pipeline for every role  Out of that pipeline, hire the candidate who adds the most to our team's mission  <p>At the end of our hiring process, we always want to hire the person that will add the most value to our team. This is not purely about their ability to excel in the role; it also includes character that reinforces our values, and capacity to add new dimensions to our team. This step cannot function in isolation, though. If we hire the best candidates from a pipeline of white male candidates, we will always be hiring white males.</p><p>We must build a broad and representative pipeline of quality candidates for every role. As noted earlier, this does not happen organically right now. We have to put significant proactive effort towards it, then pair it with a thoughtful evaluation and offer process. &nbsp;This is an investment, and will take more time and will mean slower hires on some roles.</p><p>At a startup with limited resources and an urgent need to hire, this is hard. The two priorities of hiring fast and hiring deliberately - including to add diversity - are directly at odds. By explicitly tying our commitment to diversity and success in our mission together, and adding more concrete tactics, we hope to turn diversity into a top-of-mind priority for every hire.</p> Concrete changes we're making  Make it very clear that all candidates are welcomed on our team <p>Adapt our job descriptions, incorporating the knowledge that different candidates react differently to certain language and elements (e.g., men are more likely to apply to jobs where they don't meet all listed requirements). Three changes we've made:</p>  Replace "Requirements" with a section called "You're likely to succeed if," which focuses on capabilities and outcomes and avoids past experiences that would narrow the candidate pool  Explicitly encourage candidates from underrepresented groups to apply in every job description  Ensure inclusive language, using a tool to detect wording that may appeal more to men than women  <p>Share our commitment publicly. We added a commitment to diversity to our <a href="https://www.notion.so/About-3Box-Labs-7100eadf86624b1ba00793da29a08711">About Us</a> page. We will also begin sharing more from inside our team about this topic and related ones, starting with this post.</p> Invest in proactive sourcing <p>We will spend time, money and creativity to bring more candidates from a diverse set of backgrounds into our pipeline. A few actions we are taking towards this:</p><p>Tech talks: our team will start doing these far and wide in the tech world to build bridges in new communities (if you'd like to set one up, reach out!)</p><p>Be wary of opportunistic hires: these tend to be from similar backgrounds, and deprives us of an opportunity to build a more intentional pipeline. This is so hard because when a great candidate from our network emerges, it's likely a very high signal on a very strong candidate. We haven't ruled this out for certain specialized roles, but we cannot let it become a habit.</p> Refine our interview process to value difference and remove bias <p>A few changes we are making on this front: </p><p>Early rounds will focus on skills relevant to the role. Later rounds, with more of the team involved, will evaluate value alignment and teamwork so there are more perspectives to balance out potential biases.</p><p>Removed sources of bias from our scorecard. For example, we used to score candidates on if they "would bring energy to our team." The goal was to find people who would energize us to work with, but it ended up creating a tilt towards high-energy extroverts which was not the intent.</p><p>Add "Would bring a new dimension to the team" to our scorecard, to make sure we consider this for every candidate.</p> Ensure we operate as an inclusive team  <p>Most of our current efforts are focused on hiring. But equally essential is maintaining an inclusive team culture that is welcoming, inspiring, and comfortable to all. This is critical to retaining candidates and to make sure our outreach to new candidates is authentic. It also lets us all be happier and more productive, and comfortable being ourselves.</p> Seek help from groups and people doing great work in this arena <p>We have a lot to learn and a long way to go. There are great teams and individuals that we can learn from, support, and work with. We have a list of those we've already been inspired or educated by. Over time, we'll aim to partner with organizations driving diverse hiring in Web3, amplify the voices of those helping make Web3 a beacon of equity in tech, and make long-term commitments to support the most aligned communities.</p><p>We also continue to do more of this work in public. We hope this will allow others to learn from our experience and open opportunities to work together to improve the practices and norms throughout the ecosystem. We also hope it creates an opportunity for the community to provide feedback and advice back to us. We have a long ways to go and value any support, critiques, and help.</p> <p><a href="https://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs Site</a> | <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord Community</a> </p><p></p>

     <p>Denver, CO (JULY 7, 2021) – Open banking is proving to be a game changer for financial services. Open banking is the structured sharing of data using application programming interfaces (APIs) between financial institutions and third-party providers. It helps financial institutions more efficiently partner with fintechs and it helps consumers more easily and securely leverage their data across solutions</p>
<p>CUFX, or the Credit Union Financial Exchange, has been the credit union industry’s open integration standard allowing credit unions to efficiently share data between banking systems, reduce redundancy, reduce technical complexity, drive down costs and improve speed to market. Since its inception, the credit union industry has greatly benefited from CUFX by supporting credit unions’ own API gateways or through easy integrations with third-party providers.</p>
<p>CUFX is expanding its support of open banking and interoperability by joining the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) consortium. FDX is a non-profit organization operating in the U.S. and Canada that is dedicated to unifying the financial industry around a common, interoperable and royalty-free standard for the secure access of user permissioned financial data, aptly named the FDX API. By collaborating with FDX, CUFX will enable credit unions and interested organizations to bridge both standards to leverage a broader, more interoperable transaction set and market reach.</p>
<p>“With CUFX as a protocol for the exchange of data, this membership will give credit unions a seat at the table with a best-in-class standards organization and help CUFX further evolve in support of digital identities, open banking and API exchanges,” says John Ainsworth, president/CEO of Bonifii.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to welcome CUFX to the Financial Data Exchange family,” said Don Cardinal, Managing Director of FDX. CUFX’s participation in our consortium will help FDX continue to connect credit unions of all sizes so that they can offer their customers API-based data sharing with third-party fintechs via a common industry standard,” added Cardinal.</p>
<p>With the pandemic causing credit unions to accelerate their digital strategies, now is the right time for credit unions to start to begin leveraging open banking to help them grow and compete as they serve their members.</p>

<p>The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) Open Project applies Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP), to create a cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other distributed network resources to interoperate successfully.</p>



<p>Requirements Management V2.1 builds on OSLC’s Core Specification to define the resources, properties and operations to be supported by an OSLC Requirements Definition and Management server. It joins OSLC Change Management Version 3.0 as the latest OASIS Standard from the project. OSLC Core Version 3.0 and Query Version 3.0 are currently in public review as candidates for OASIS Standard.</p>

 Creative workshop encourages hands-on experience to create questions about&nbsp;time Olivia Tai and Sarah Newman hosted the workshop.<p>by Grace&nbsp;McFadden</p><p>The philosophy of time can be introduced quite simply, according to Harvard Physicist Jacob Barandes: all it takes is a stack of pancakes.</p><p>Barandes was a guest speaker at “The Mysteries of Time in Physics and Philosophy,” the second in the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-05/2021-virtual-creative-spring-workshops">Creative Workshop series</a> that metaLAB is offering this summer designed and led by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/snewman">Sarah Newman</a>, Director of Art &amp; Education at <a href="https://metalabharvard.github.io/">metaLAB at Harvard</a>, and supported by Olivia Tai, a student at Harvard College and research assistant at metaLAB. The workshop brought together sixty attendees from seventeen different countries.</p><p>The event began with Barandes discussing presentism and eternalism, two different theories of how time works. This discussion formed the basis of a hands-on creative exercise led by Newman and Tai to explore the “mysteries of&nbsp;time.”</p><p>Barandes framed time as follows: “Think of each layer in the stack as a successive moment in time. Roughly speaking, if you’re standing still, you’re at the same place in each successive pancake. You’re at the same place in the bottom pancake, the next pancake, the next pancake.”</p><p>Presentism, explained Barandes, can be thought of as the idea that we all experience the same pancake at the same time. This universal present, which Barandes likened to a hot pancake, is the only one in which we exist. This also means that neither the future nor the past is&nbsp;real.</p><p>Barandes then explained how <a href="https://www.space.com/36273-theory-special-relativity.html">Einstein’s theory of special relativity</a> serves as a challenge to presentism, which he also referred to as the A Model of&nbsp;time.</p><p>“The special theory of relativity says we do not all experience pancakes the same way,” Barandes&nbsp;said.</p><p>As explained by Barandes, Einstein’s theory of special relativity says that because the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer, there are repercussions for how time happens to each person. He said that the familiar, everyday laws of physics dictate that if someone threw a baseball on an airplane, a person outside the airplane would perceive the baseball to be moving at the combined speed of the throw and the airplane.</p><p>“But if you shine a light with the flashlight on the airplane, what Einstein said was, you on the airplane will perceive light travelling at the speed of light. Someone on the ground looking up will also see light going at the same constant speed. Light doesn’t combine. This is a very weird thing, it means that somehow time and space have to change,” Barandes&nbsp;said.</p><p>Space and time being relative and interconnected serves as a challenge to the idea that the present is experienced universally.</p><p>“Maybe the most profound weirdness here is that if you’re moving relative to someone else, then your pancake slices are not horizontal. Your pancake slices are slightly diagonal. So you don’t slice the pancakes horizontally anymore. If you’re moving, you slice the pancakes a little bit diagonally,” Barandes said. “And if different observers in different states of motion slice the stack of pancakes differently, that’s a challenge to the notion that one pancake slice is the ‘hot’ one for everybody. So that’s a challenge to presentism.”</p><p>Eternalism, which, Barandes explained, is known as the B Model, holds that the past, present, and future are all equally&nbsp;real.</p><p>The talk by Barandes primed the audience to form questions about time. Newman then guided participants through exercises to explore their own questions about&nbsp;time.</p><p>Tai guided the audience through a short meditation. The object, explained Tai, was to experience time in a different way than we usually do in our busy&nbsp;lives.</p><p>“The experience of time can feel very different when you are turning your intention inwards rather than outwards,” Tai&nbsp;said.</p><p>As part of the pre-work to the event, participants were encouraged to spend 90 seconds creating a timeline of their lives, which they had the opportunity to share with others during the workshop. Newman then prompted the group to write down things they “knew”,“believed”, and “didn’t know”. Participants were then asked to do the same exercise, except focusing on their knowledge of&nbsp;time.</p><p>From there, participants used these thought experiments to generate two of their own questions about time, which formed the foundations of the final steps of the workshop: exploring these questions visually by drawing them, and then creating physical sculptures to represent their&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>In preparation for the event, participants had been asked to spend ten minutes gathering materials ranging from “something that changes in time” to “two things that rhyme with each other.” After choosing one of their questions about time, participants created a sculpture to represent their question using the objects they gathered prior to the&nbsp;event.</p>A sculpture created by participant <a href="https://twitter.com/dashiel_carrera/status/1403374002232610821">Dashiel&nbsp;Carrera</a>.<p>Sculptures created by participants sought to explore questions such as “Could we have a functioning society without a supposedly objective passage of time, measured by clocks?” and “What would it look like if we perceived space as time and vice versa?” The resulting prototypes from the event were made of materials including lichen, incense, dice, and a bedspring.</p><p>Newman’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/473445114">methodology</a> for her creative workshops emphasizes the importance of asking questions, the value of interdisciplinary perspectives on hard topics, and then using found materials to physically wrestle with these abstract ideas. This allows workshop attendees to free their thinking when it comes to concepts that can be difficult to conceptualize. The event received positive feedback from attendants, one of whom <a href="https://twitter.com/silviabauer/status/1403380086380892162">said</a> that “time passed at light-speed” during the workshop.</p><p>The final event in the Creative Workshop series, entitled “Telegrams to Telepathic Memos: The Future of Trust and Truth Online,” was held on June 25. The metaLAB team will be displaying the creations from this workshop series&nbsp;<a href="https://metaworkshops.cargo.site/">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/meditation-and-metaphorical-pancakes-exploring-the-philosophy-and-physics-of-time-with-metalab-4e24d7713062">Meditation and Metaphorical Pancakes: Exploring the philosophy and physics of time with metaLAB</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>Event Title: Evolving Disaster Recovery Strategy: From Physical Colocation to the Cloud</p>
<p>An effective disaster recovery (DR) strategy is essential to continuity of operations for Florida State University. Over the last several years, maximizing efficiency and performance while operating within budget has meant a move to cloud-based DR for essential systems. In this session, you’ll learn how FSU’s DR strategy has evolved over time, and how the shift to the cloud has provided benefits to both operational performance and budget.</p>
<p>Key takeaways include:</p>
 
 An understanding of the DR challenges facing FSU, and how they made the determination to shift to a cloud-based model 
 An understanding of the process of moving DR operations to the cloud from legacy colocation, from evaluation to execution 
 How and why FSU leveraged AWS CloudEndure to execute their new DR strategy, including a review of resources AWS makes available to institutions to facilitate success

<p>Conformance Testing for Measurable Goals</p><p>[Written in consultation with the Interoperability Working Group&nbsp;chairs]</p><p>A recurring topic in the Interoperability Working Group is that of defining short-, medium- and long-term goals or “targets” for interoperability. The topic comes up again every few months, and each time it does, the chairs try to tackle it head-on for a full meeting or two, some emails, and various off-line discussions, but doing so never seems to arrive at a satisfactory or definitive answer. Each time, what feels a Herculean outlay of effort only gets us a tentative resolution, as if we’d deflected a debt collector with a minimum payment. Dear reader, we would like to refinance, or at least restructure, this debt to our community!</p><p>In this two-part overview of our goals for 2021, we would like to survey the landscape of “provable,” testable interoperability targets and give some guidance on what we would like to see happen next in the testable interop world. Then, in a companion article, we will lay out clear proposal for parallel, distributed work on multiple fronts, such that progress can be distributed across various subcommunities and hubs of open cooperation, each reasonably confident that they are helping the big picture by “zooming in” on one set of problems.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christopherphigh">Christopher Paul&nbsp;High</a> A seemingly uncontroversial target&nbsp;state <p>Interoperation is a deceptively transparent etymology: any two things that perform a function are inter-operating if they can perform their operation together and mutually. Two fax machines interoperate if one sends a fax and the other receives it, which is a far more impressive feat if the two machines in question were designed and built by different companies on different continents, fifteen years apart. This is the kind of target state people usually have in mind when they imagine interoperability for an emerging technology.</p><p>This everyday example glosses over a lot of complexity and history, however. Standards bodies had already specified exact definitions of how the “handshake” is established between two unfamiliar fax machines before either model of fax machine was a twinkle in a design team’s eye. In addition to all the plodding, iterative standardization, there has also been a lot of economic trial and error and dead-ends we never heard about. Even acceptable margins of error and variance from the standards have been prototyped, refined, socialized, and normalized, such that generations of fax machines have taken them to heart, while entire factories have been set up to produce standard components like white-label fax chips and fax boards that can be used by many competing brands. On a software level, both design teams probably recycled some of the same libraries and low-level code, whether open-source or licensed.</p><p>Decomposing this example into its requirements at various levels shows how many interdependent and complex subsystems have to achieve internal maturity and sustainable relationships. A time-honored strategy is to treat each of these subsystems in a distinct, parallel maturation process and combine them gradually over time. The goal, after all, is not a working whole, but a working ecosystem. Architectural alternatives, for example, have to be debated carefully, particularly for disruptive and emerging technologies that redistribute power within business processes or ecosystems. Sharing (or better yet, responsibly open-sourcing and governing) common software libraries and low-level hardware specifications is often a “stitch in time” that saves nine later stitches, since it gives coordinators a stable baseline to work from,&nbsp;sooner.</p><p>Naturally, from even fifty or a hundred organizations committed to this target state, a thousand different (mostly sensible) strategies can arise. “How to proceed?” becomes a far-from-trivial question, even when all parties share many common goals and incentives. For instance, almost everyone:</p>  Wants to grow the pie of adoption and market&nbsp;interest  Holds privacy and decentralization as paramount commitments  Strives to avoid repeating the mistakes and assumptions of previous generations of internet technology  <p>And yet, all the same… both strategic and tactical differences arise, threatening to entrench themselves into camps or even schools of thought. How to achieve the same functional consensus on strategy as we have on principles? Our thesis here is that our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.</p> Today’s test suites and interoperability profiles <p>Perhaps the biggest differences turn out not to be about target state or principles, but about what exactly “conformance” means relative to what has already been specified and standardized. Namely, the core specifications for DIDs and VCs are both data models written in the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), which put protocols out of scope. This stems partly from the decisions of the groups convened in the W3C, and partly from a classic division of labor in the internet standards world between W3C, which traditionally governs the data models of web browser and servers, and a distinct group, the Internet Engineering Task Force&nbsp;(IETF).</p><p>VCs were specified first, with a preference (but not a requirement) for DIDs, with exact parameters for DIDs and DID systems deferred to a separate data model. Then, to accommodate entrenched and seemingly irreconcilable ideas about how DIDs could best be expressed, the DID data model was made less representationally-explicit and turned into an abstract data model. This shift to a representation-agnostic definition of DIDs, combined with the still-tentative and somewhat representation-specific communication and signing protocols defined to date, makes truly agnostic and cross-community data model conformance somewhat difficult to test. This holds back interoperability (and objective claims to conformance)!</p> W3C: Testing the core specifications <p>The only test suite associated with the core W3C specifications is the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/tree/main/packages/vc-http-api-test-server">VC-HTTP-API test suite </a>for VC data model conformance and the fledgling <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">DID-core test suite</a>, both worked on in the W3C-CCG. The former tests implementations of VC-handling systems against some pre-established sample data and test scripts through a deliberately generalized API interface that strives to be minimally opinionated with respect to context- and implementation-specific questions like API authentication. The latter is still taking shape, given that the DID spec has been very unstable in the home stretch of its editorial process arriving at CR this last&nbsp;week.</p><p>The VC-HTTP-API interface, specified collectively by the first <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">SVIP</a> funding cycle cohort for use in real-world VC systems, has been used in some contexts as a de facto general-purpose architecture profile, even if it is very open-ended on many architectural details traditionally specified in government or compliance profiles. Its authors and editors did not intend it to be the general-purpose profile for the VC data model generally, but in the absence of comparable alternatives, it is sometimes taken as one; it has perhaps taken on more of a definitive role than originally intended.</p><p>Following the second iteration of the SVIP program and the expansion of the cohort, the API and its test suite are poised to accrue features and coverage to make it more useful outside of its original context. Core participants have established a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/">weekly public call</a> at the CCG and a lively re-scoping/documentation process is currently underway to match the documentation and rationale documents to the diversity of contexts deploying the&nbsp;API.</p> Aries: End-to-end conformance testing <p>Other profiles, like the Aries interoperability profile, serve an important role, but it would be misleading to call it a VC data model test suite — it is more like an end-to-end test harness for showing successful implementation of the Aries protocols and architecture. Here “interoperability” means interoperability with other Aries systems, and conformance with the shared Aries interpretation of the standard VC data model and the protocols this community has defined on the basis of that interpretation.</p><p>Many matters specified by the W3C data model are abstracted out or addressed by shared libraries in Ursa, so its scope is not exactly coterminous with the W3C data model. Instead, the Aries interoperability profile has its own infrastructural focus, which focuses on scaling the privacy guarantees of blockchain-based ZKP systems. In many ways, this focus complements rather than supplants that of the W3C test&nbsp;suites.</p><p>Many of the trickiest questions on which SSI systems differ are rooted in what the Aries and Trust-over-IP communities conceptualize as “<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack">layer 2</a>,” the connective infrastructural building-blocks connecting end-users to VCs and DIDs. As more and more features get added to be testable across language implementations, and as feature-parity is achieved with other systems (such as <a href="https://youtu.be/LC0OXAir3Qw">support for LD VCs</a>), the case for productive complementarity and deep interoperability gets easier and easier to&nbsp;make.</p> The first wave of local profiles and guidelines <p>Other specifications for decentralized-identity APIs and wallets, modelled on that W3C CCG and/or extending the work of Aries-based infrastructures, are starting to crop up around the world. So far these have all arisen out of ambitious government-funded programs to build infrastructure, often with an eye to local governance or healthy competition. Canada and the European Commission are the most high-profile ones to date, building on earlier work in Spain, the UK, and elsewhere; Germany and other countries funding next-generation trust frameworks may soon follow&nbsp;suit.</p><p>It is important, however, to avoid framing these tentative, sometimes cautious attempts at bridging status quo and new models as universal standards. If anything, these frameworks tend to come with major caveats and maturity disclaimers, on top of having carefully narrowed scopes. After all, they are generally the work of experienced regulators, inheriting decades of work exploring identity and infrastructural technologies through a patchwork of requirements and local profiles that tend to align over time. If they are designed with enough circumspection and dialogue, conformance with one should never make conformance with another impossible. (The authors would here like to extend heartfelt sympathy to all DIF members currently trying to conform to multiple of these at&nbsp;once!)</p><p>These profiles test concrete and specific interpretations of a shared data model that provide a testing benchmark for regulatory “green lighting” of specific implementations and perhaps even whole frameworks. Particularly when they specify best practices or requirements for security and API design, they create testable standardization by making explicit their opinions and assumptions about:</p>  approved cryptography,  auditing capabilities,  privacy requirements, and  API access/authentication  <p>These will probably always differ and make a universal abstraction impossible; and that’s not a bad thing! These requirements are always going to be specific to each regulatory context, and without them, innovation (and large-scale investment) are endangered by regulatory uncertainty. Navigating these multiple profiles is going to be a challenge in the coming years, as more of them come online and their differences come into relief as a stumbling block for widely-interoperable protocols with potentially global&nbsp;reach.</p><p>The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/setting-interoperability-targets-part-1-of-2-c6cbeaf82e98">Setting Interoperability Targets Part 1 of 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Medium-term interoperability challenges</p><p>[Written in consultation with the Interoperability Working Group chairs]</p><p>In our <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets/">last essay</a>, we explored the means and ends of interoperability targets and roadmapping across stacks and markets. “Interoperability,” like “standardization,” can be a general-purpose tool or an umbrella of concepts, but rarely works from the top-down. &nbsp;Instead, specific use-cases, consortia, contexts, and industries have to take the lead and prototype something more humble and specific like an “interoperability profile”-- over time, these propagate, get extended, get generalized, and congeal into a more universal and stable standard. Now, we’ll move on to some technical problem areas ripe for this kind of profile-first interoperability work across stacks.</p><blockquote>What makes sense to start aligning now? What are some sensible scopes for interoperating today, or yesterday, to get our fledgling market to maturity and stability as soon as safely possible?</blockquote>Ponte Vecchio, Fiorenze, by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/GHoX7zFRMMU">Ray Harrington</a> From testable goals to discrete scopes <p>The last few months have seen a shift in terminology and approach, as many groups turn their attention from broad “interoperability testing” to more focused “profiles” that test one subset of the optionalities and capabilities in a larger test suite or protocol definition. This decoupling of test suites from multiple profiles each suite can test helps any one profile from ossifying into a “universal” definition of decentralized identity’s core featureset. </p><p>As with any other emerging software field, every use case and context has its own interoperability priorities and constraints that narrow down the technological solution space into a manageable set of tradeoffs and decisions. &nbsp;For instance, end-user identification at various levels of assurance is often the most important implementation detail for, say, a retail bank, and DID-interoperability (which is not always the same thing!) might be a hardware manufacturer’s primary concern in being able to secure hardware supply chains. </p><p>Every industry has its unique set of minimum security guarantees, and VC-interoperability is obviously front-of-mind for credentialing use-cases. For example, in the medical data space, “Semantics” (data interpretation and metadata) might be a harder problem (or a more political one) than the mechanics of identity assurance, since high standards of end-user privacy and identity assurance have already made for a relatively interoperable starting points. &nbsp; Which exact subset of the many possible interoperability roadmaps is safest or most mission-critical for a given organization depends on many factors: the regulatory context, the culture of the relevant sectors, its incentive-structures, and its <a href="https://www.eff.org/de/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">business models</a>. </p><p>Cross-cutting industry verticals, however, are structural issues with how decentralized identity stacks and architecture vary, which can already been seen today. &nbsp;By applying “first principles,” (or in our case, the “<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md">functions</a>” of a decentralized identity system and its many moving parts) across use-cases and industrial contexts, certain shared problems arise. As is our default approach in DIF Interop WG, we applied DIF’s in-house <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/interop-mapping-version-by-Hakan-Yildiz(TUB).pdf">mental model</a> of the “5 layers” of decentralized identity systems, sometimes called “the 4+1 layers”. (See also the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/raw/master/assets/crosscommunity-architecture-survey-oct-2020.pdf">more detailed version</a>).</p><p>We call these the “4+1” layers because our group agreed that a strict layering was not possible, and that all the architectures we compared for using verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers had to make major architectural decisions with consequences across all four of the more properly “layered” categories. This fifth category we named “transversal considerations,” since they traverse the layers and often come from architectural constraints imposed by regulation, industrial context, etc. Foremost among these are storage and authorization, the two most vexing and cross-cutting problems in software generally; these would justify an entirely separate article.</p><p>In a sense, none of the topics from this transversal category are good candidates for specification in the medium-term across verticals and communities-- they are simply too big as problems, rarely specific to identity issues, and being addressed elsewhere. These include “storage” (subject of our newest <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">working group</a>), “authorization” (debatably the core problem of all computer science!), “cryptographic primitives”, and “compliance.” (These last two are each the subject of a new working group, <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/crypto.html">Applied Cryptography</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallet Security</a>!). These interoperability scopes are quite difficult to tackle quickly, or without a strong standards background. Indeed, these kinds of foundational changes require <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">incremental advances</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093">broad cooperation</a> with large community organizations. This is slow, foundation work that needs to connect parallel work across data governance, authentication/authorization, and storage in software more generally.</p><p>Similarly, the fourth layer, where ecosystem-, platform-, and industry-specific considerations constrain application design and business models, is unlikely to crystallize into a problem space calling out for a single specification or prototype in the medium-term future. Here, markets are splintered and it is unclear what can be repurposed or recycled outside of its original context. Even if there were cases where specification at this later would be timely, DIF members might well choose to discuss those kinds of governance issues at our sister-organizations in the space that more centrally address data governance at industry-, ecosystem-, or national- scale: <a href="http://trustoverip.org">Trust over IP</a> was chartered to design large-scale governance processes, and older organizations like <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData.org</a> and the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a> also have working groups and publications on vertical-specific and jurisdiction-specific best practices for picking interoperable protocols and data formats.</p><p>That still leaves three “layers”, each of which has its own interoperability challenges that seem most urgent. It is our contention that each of these could be worked on in parallel and independently of the other two to help arrive at a more interoperable community-- and we will be trying to book presentation and discussion guests in the coming months to advance all three.</p> Scope #1: Verifiable Credential Exchange <p>The most clear and consensus-building, even urgent way forward is to bring clarity to Verifiable Credential exchange across stacks. &nbsp;This has been the primary focus of our WG for the last year. Given that most of the early ecosystem-scale interest in SSI revolves around <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/#vc-infrastructure-layer-3">credentialing</a> (educational credentials, employment credentials, health records), it is highly strategic to get translation and unified protocols into place soon for the interoperable verification and cross-issuance of credentials. </p><p>In fact, there has actually been a lot of good progress made since Daniel Hardman wrote an <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/getting-to-practical-interop-with-verifiable-credentials/">essay</a> on the Evernym blog making a pragmatic case for sidestepping differences in architecture and approach to exchange VCs sooner. This aligned with much of our group’s work in recent months, which has included a <a href="https://hackmd.io/t1cotiReTXCnkpDG8k2tVA#THE-MAIN-EVENT">survey of VC formats</a> among organizations producing “wallets” for verifiable credentials (be they “edge” wallets or otherwise). Our group has also sought to <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8j6niRuFWTjVMIXqmw3zX-4KkLt-sli8">assist educational efforts</a> at the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>, in the Claims and Credentials <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">working group</a>, and elsewhere to make wallet-producing organizations aware of the relevant <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/vc-spec-map">specifications</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/dif/be6763341a014d248f655aea187d7890?v=c9ac48a07f3d411c9a1bea32b55f7e76">other references</a> needed to make their wallets multi-format sooner and less painfully. Much of this work was crystalized into an <a href="https://www.lfph.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Verifiable-Credentials-Flavors-Explained.pdf">article</a> by co-chair Kaliya Young and crowd-edited by the whole group; this work was a major guiding structure for the Good Health Pass work that sought to make a common health record format (exported from FHIR systems) equally holdable and presentable across all of today’s VC systems.</p><p>One outgrowth of this effort and other alignments that have taken place since Hardman’s and Young’s article is the work of prototyping a multi-community exchange protocol that allow a subset of each stack’s capabilities and modes to interoperate. This tentative, “minimum viable profile” is called <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">WACI-PEx</a> and is currently a work item of the Claims and Credentials working group. Work is ongoing on v0.1, and an ambitious, more fully-featured v1 is planned for after that. This profile acts as an “extension” of the broader Presentation Exchange protocol, giving a handy “cheat sheet” for cross-stack wallet-to-issuer/verifier handshakes so that developers not familiar with all the stacks and protocols being spanned have a starting point for VC exchanges. &nbsp;Crucially, the results of this collaborative prototype will be taken as inputs to future versions of the DIDComm protocols and the WACI specification for Presentation Exchange. </p><p>Note: There has been some discussion of a OIDC-Presentation Exchange profile at some point in the future, but given that the alignment of DIDComm and Presentation Exchange started over a year ago, the most likely outcome is that work on this would not start until after v1 has been released of the “WACI-PEx” profile for DIDComm has been released.</p> Scope #2: Anchoring layer <p>Of course, other forms of alignment are possible as well in the “bottom 3” layers of the traditional stack, while we wait on the ambitious transversal alignment specifications and the ongoing work to align and simplify cross-format support for VCs (and perhaps even multi-format VCs, as Hardman points out in the essay above). </p><p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Identifiers and Discovery</a> WG at DIF has long housed many work items to align on the lowest level of stack, including general-purpose <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-common-java">common libraries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">recovery mechanisms</a>. It has also received many donations that contribute to method-level alignment, including a recent <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/trinsic-donates-did-key-rs-to-i-d-wg-8a278f37bcd0?source=friends_link&amp;sk=dbd175f5db9107ed1e9d953a386441a4">DID-Key implementation</a> and a linked-data <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-document-loader">document loader</a> donated by Transmute. The group has also served as a friendly gathering point for discussing calls for input from the DID-core working group at W3C and for proposing W3C-CCG work items.</p><p>One particularly noteworthy initiative of the group has been the <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-universal-resolver-infrastructure-395281d2b540?source=friends_link&amp;sk=306a37f289dcf61a89d19cd11f5be04e">Universal Resolver</a> project, which offers a kind of “trusted middleware” approach to DID resolution across methods. This prototype of a general-use server allows any SSI system (or non-SSI system) to submit a DID and get back a trustworthy DID Document, without needing any knowledge of or access to (much less current knowledge of or authenticated access to) the “black box” of the participating DID methods. While this project only extends “passive interoperability” to DIDs, i.e., only allowing DID document querying, a more ambitious sister project, the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">Universal Registrar</a>, strives to bring a core set of CRUD capabilities to DID documents for DID methods willing to contribute drivers. Both projects have dedicated weekly calls on the DIF calendar, for people looking to submit drivers or get otherwise involved.</p> Scope #3: “Agent”/Infrastructure Layer <p>There is another layer, however, in between DIDs and VCs, about which we haven’t spoken yet: the crucial “agent layer” in the ToIP/Aries mental model, which encompasses trusted infrastructure whether in or outside of conventional clouds. The Aries Project has scaled up an impressively mature ecosystem of companies and experimenters, largely thanks to the robust infrastructure layer it built (and abstracting away from application-layer developers and experimenters).</p><p>Until now, differences of strategy with respect to conventional clouds and infrastructures have prevented large-scale cooperation and standardization at this layer outside of Aries and the DID-Comm project. Partly, this has been a natural outgrowth of the drastically different infrastructural needs and assumptions of non-human, enterprise, and consumer-facing/individual use cases, which differ more at this level than above or below. Partly, this is a function of the economics of our sector’s short history, largely influenced by the infrastructure strategies of cloud providers and telecommunication concerns.</p><p>This is starting to change, however, now that agent frameworks inspired by the precedent set by the Aries frameworks have come into maturity. Mattr’s <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/verifiable-credentials-with-auth0-and-mattr/">VIII Platform</a>, the Affinidi framework SDK (including open-source <a href="https://docs.affinidi.com/interop">components by</a> DIF members Bloom, Transmute, and Jolocom), ConsenSys’ own modular, highly <a href="https://veramo.io/docs/veramo_agent/plugins">extensible</a> and interoperable <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> platform, and most recently Spruce ID’s very <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">DID-method-agnostic</a> <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a>/<a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">Credible</a> SDK all offer open-source, extensible, and scalable infrastructure layers that are driving the space towards greater modularity and alignment at this layer. </p><p>As these platforms and “end-to-end stacks” evolve into frameworks extensible and capacious enough to house ecosystems, DIF expects alignment and harmonization to develop. This could mean standardization of specific components at this layer, for example:</p>  The DIDComm protocol could expand into new <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-looker-jwm-01.html">envelopes</a> and transports  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secret-recovery-methods">Control recovery</a> mechanisms could be specified across implementations or even standardized on a technical and/or UX level  Auditing or historical-query requirements could be specified to form a cross-framework protocol or primitive  Common usages of foreign function interfaces, remote procedure calls like gRPC and JSON-RPC, or other forms of “glue” allowing elements to be reused or mixed and matched across languages and architectures could be specified as a community<br>  <p>We are very much in early days, but some see on the horizon a day when frameworks that don’t cooperate with one another can’t compete with the ones that join forces. After all, adoption brings growing pains, particularly for the labor market-- aligning on architectures and frameworks makes onboarding developers and transferring experience that much easier to do!</p> Next Steps <p>I would encourage anyone who has read this far to pick at least one of the three scopes mentioned above and ask themselves how they are helping along this alignment process in their day-to-day work, and if they truly understand what major players at that level are doing. Often large for-profit companies pay the most attention to what their competitors are doing, but here it is important to think outside of competition and look instead at non-profit organizations, regulators, and coalitions of various kinds to really see where the puck is heading. Sometimes consensus on one level is blocking compromise somewhere else. &nbsp;It can be pretty hard to follow!</p><p>In recent articles, DIF has encouraged its members to think about an open-source strategy as comparably important to a business plan, a living document and guiding philosophy. I would like to suggest that the subset of DIF companies working with VCs and DIDs should also think of interoperability strategy and conformance testing as the most crucial pillar of that strategy-- if you cannot demonstrate interoperability, you might be asking people to take that strategy on faith!</p>

	<p>When is Independence Day for&nbsp;the Digital World?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m writing this on USA’s Independence Day 2021. I’ve been thinking a lot about freedom—especially in the digital world. Mainly because it doesn’t exist&nbsp;there (or&nbsp;here, since I’m posting this online).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some time, the Me2B Alliance has been working on easy-to-understand educational material to better convey the particular harms visited upon us through the “Invisible Parallel Dataverse”, which is mainly embodied through a vast network of entities artfully calling themselves a “media ecosystem” but which is in fact the massive infrastructure and industry of Digital Advertising.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The magnitude and complexity of the AdTech&nbsp;machine&nbsp;is a natural deterrent for most of us—“I can’t make sense of that; too complicated, too arcane, too opaque.” Turns out, it’s not at all opaque. The detailed underpinnings that have borne&nbsp;that&nbsp;vast ecosystem have been hiding in plain sight for years, in publicly available&nbsp;protocols and specifications at the IAB Tech Lab. I count myself among the many who didn’t turn their full gaze onto the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, with the help of incredibly talented people like our lead data flow tester, Zach Edwards, I’m&nbsp;slowly&nbsp;learning the full magnitude of the situation. And here’s&nbsp;my pithy summary:&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many things are “free” on the internet,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are anything but free in the digital world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me try to paint&nbsp;a picture of&nbsp;one piece of the problem here: we call it the Invisible Parallel&nbsp;Dataverse.&nbsp;We all&nbsp;careen&nbsp;around the web, driving our fancy browser-mobiles,&nbsp;opening websites,&nbsp;or&nbsp;downloading&nbsp;and installing&nbsp;apps. We are&nbsp;in control of&nbsp;things as we&nbsp;traverse the digital world.&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp;It may&nbsp;feel&nbsp;like that,&nbsp;but&nbsp;in reality, there&nbsp;is an Invisible Parallel&nbsp;Dataverse&nbsp;which is constantly watching us, talking about us behind our backs [like THOUSANDS of orgs], trying to get us to buy more, click this, do that, spend more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Invisible Parallel&nbsp;Dataverse&nbsp;is fueled by an equally invisible [to users] infrastructure that is ubiquitous—on every website, in every app—EVERYWHERE. It doesn’t matter what cookie settings you disable/enable.&nbsp; (In fact, I’m&nbsp;increasingly convinced that&nbsp;cookie settings are a trivial “bone” being thrown to us&nbsp;panting dogs, to pacify and provide a semblance of control.)&nbsp;In reality, advertising&nbsp;technology executes the moment the web page opens, and the minute you open an app—and sometimes the&nbsp;adtech&nbsp;code&nbsp;runs when no ad&nbsp;is&nbsp;presented to the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The browser you’re using constantly sends the latest reports on your behavior to this advertising ecosystem every time you open a new page—cookie,&nbsp;shmookie, data about you is shared externally no matter what.&nbsp; NOTE: not just&nbsp;when you open&nbsp;a new website&nbsp;or page, but even multiple times on the&nbsp;same page.&nbsp;The browser isn’t being a sneaky bastard here; it’s in many ways “dumb”,&nbsp;it’s blindly executing the HTML and&nbsp;Javascript&nbsp;code&nbsp;that define the contents of&nbsp;the&nbsp;page materializing before your eyes.&nbsp;One or more of the code snippets in that package of page-code is&nbsp;for an&nbsp;Ad, which will send an Ad Request containing&nbsp;some&nbsp;info about you off into the&nbsp;vast hinterland of the&nbsp;AdTech network. This innocuous single message results in:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Your latest browsing information being sent to literally thousands of entities within the&nbsp;adtech&nbsp;ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your browsing activity is one of the most intimate snapshots&nbsp;of&nbsp;who you are;&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;elaborately and specifically detailed&nbsp;by&nbsp;the things you look for online, how much time you spend looking at them, what you click on, what you buy—nevermind&nbsp;coupling that with other information the browser has access to—like&nbsp;on&nbsp;which sites you have accounts/login credentials&nbsp;[we call these “Me2B Marriages”]. 
 And while some of the data in the Ad Request may not seem “personal”, the real dark magic of the adtech ecosystem is that the vast network of THOUSANDS of entities who receive that first “Ad Request” at the start of the RealTime Bidding (RTB) system masterfully correlate whatever meager (or not so meager) crumbs of data from the Ad Request to you, specifically– your sweet little self, doggedly searching for an air conditioner repair person on a Sunday in August in the remote desert in Nevada even though you’re usually in church at this time–that you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, these profiles can be used for ANY purpose whatsoever, because the&nbsp;adtech&nbsp;technology is ungoverned and unmonitored.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>For now, that is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Johnny Ryan and a group of dedicated lawyers and researchers have been persistently working to expose the realities of AdTech, first at <a href="https://brave.com/rtb-updates/">Brave</a>,&nbsp;and now at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iccl.ie/rtb-june-2021/">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a>&nbsp;(ICCL).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>His latest effort&nbsp;at the ICCL&nbsp;will once again&nbsp;take to the courts&nbsp;–&nbsp;Hamburg, Germany&nbsp;this time&nbsp;–&nbsp;to convince the authorities that&nbsp;this&nbsp;RTB&nbsp;adtech&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;systematically and at vast scale&nbsp;violates&nbsp;GDPR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth&nbsp;is, this RTB machinery violates human freedom itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ICCL website has some excellent materials to&nbsp;explain the case, and it accurately describes RTB as the&nbsp;world’s&nbsp;biggest&nbsp;data breach. Well, nearly accurately–I offer this refinement:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The&nbsp;world’s biggest&nbsp;ongoing, ceaseless&nbsp;data breach.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this day of&nbsp;celebrating hard fought and won freedoms in the United States, the Me2B Alliance picks up the mantle to continue the fight for freedom in the Digital World. We assert our support of the ICCL and their&nbsp;pivotal&nbsp;case against RTB.&nbsp;&nbsp;How this&nbsp;intention&nbsp;will manifest remains to be&nbsp;defined, but&nbsp;watch this space. Or better yet, come&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/membership/">join us</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;help create that future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a Me Should Do&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn’t comprehensive, but&nbsp;first of all,&nbsp;we recommend&nbsp;using&nbsp;either an ad-blocking browser&nbsp;like&nbsp;Mozilla’s Firefox,&nbsp;and&nbsp;install an ad-blocking browser extension, like&nbsp;the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s&nbsp;<a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, enable all privacy settings on your mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;please consider supporting&nbsp;the work at the ICCL to make sure that this landmark GDPR case succeeds, paving the way for freedom in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By Guy Martin, Executive Director, OASIS Open</p> 


<p>So much is happening here at OASIS Open in June, but I’m especially excited that our <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/foundation-as-a-service/">Foundation-as-a-Service</a> (FaaS) program has expanded to include <a href="https://samvera.org/">Samvera</a>, a community widely respected for its work promoting best-in-class digital asset management solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OASIS designed our FaaS program with new groups in mind, because we wanted to make it easier for communities to get off the ground by giving them a place within our legal infrastructure where they could operate independently under their own governance rules if our Open Project structure wasn’t a good fit for their needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Samvera does not need help getting off the ground. The group was founded in 2008 as Hydra and has grown to more than 30 partners and more than 40 adopters around the world. Its focus, then and now, is on collaborative development of repository solutions for the digital collections held by libraries, archives, museums, and other organizations. ‘Samvera’ means ‘togetherness’ in Icelandic–a fitting name for a group committed to the belief that challenges are best solved through combined effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve come to know Samvera as a vibrant, welcoming group of information and technology professionals. Their software is free and open source, available under an Apache 2 license, and their suite of repository software tools offers flexible and rich user interfaces tailored to distinct content types on top of a robust back end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As someone who came to OASIS to help us bring more open source work into our portfolio, I’m thrilled to see this great project join our larger community. If you aren’t already familiar with what they’re doing, I strongly encourage you to check out their work.</p>



<p>Learn More about OASIS FaaS&nbsp;</p>



<p>OASIS Foundation-as-a-Service is the smart solution for groups that want to advance open source code, standards, or related activities. Foundations operate independently while enjoying the benefits of the OASIS nonprofit corporate structure. Groups are advised and supported every step of the way by the technical, operational, legal, and marketing staff of OASIS, which has a 28-year track record of developing some of the most widely adopted open standards and open source code in use today. The <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/">Open Mobility Foundation</a> (OMF) was the first group to take advantage of the OASIS FaaS program. OMF is an open-source software foundation that creates a governance structure around open-source mobility tools.</p>



<p>We invite you to <a href="mailto:communications@oasis-open.org">contact us</a> or visit our <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/foundation-as-a-service/">Foundation-as-a-Service page</a> to learn more about how we can help your group form or transition existing open source foundations using our FaaS program.&nbsp;</p>

	 WHAT IS THE ME2B ALLIANCE: A Safety Standard for the Internet 
 
 
 
 
<p>Version 1.0 |&nbsp;June 21, 2021</p>
<p>Author: Me2B Alliance</p>
<p>#SDO #SSO #SafetyStandard #RespectfulTechSpec #IndependentTesting</p>
 
 
 
 

	 
 

	 

 

	

	<p>IN A NUTSHELL<br>
The Me2B Alliance is a 501c3 nonprofit creating a safe and just digital world through standards development and independent technology testing. We are a new type of Standards Developing Organization (SDO) – involving everyday people in creating the standard for safe and respectful technology. We also perform independent testing and audits of connected technology, like websites and mobile apps.</p>


	
 
	 

 

	
	 
 
 
 
 What are standards and who develops them? 
<p>Standards are norms or requirements for various industries and their products. They are usually created by Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs), also known as Standards Setting Organizations (SSOs). From Wikipedia:</p>
 
 
 
 

	 
 

	 
 <p>[a Standards Developing Organization] is an organization whose primary function is…producing technical standards to address the needs of a group of affected adopters…Most standards are voluntary…without being mandated in law. Some standards become mandatory when they are adopted by regulators as legal requirements in particular domains, often for the purpose of safety or for consumer protection from deceitful practices.”</p>

 	 

 

	
	 
 
 
 
<p>Industry standards grow markets and consumer choices by establishinginteroperability, safety or performance norms for an existing or emerging industry. Standards take an average of three years to be developed and approved1, and typically another one to three years before the standard appears in commercial products.</p>
 What kind of standard is the Me2B Alliance developing? 
<p>The Me2B Alliance is creating a safety standard for the internet. The world is waking up to online harms related to unfettered data acquisition and the deliberate manipulation of end users in the digital world. We need a safety standard for internet connected products and services to ensure that they treat us with respect.</p>
<p>Our Respectful Tech Specification is designed to objectively measure the ethical behavior of connected technology. Version 1.0 (in development) covers websites and mobile apps and focuses on what we consider to be the bare minimum of respectful behavior. In its fullest realization, the specification will include tests for every possible digital harm that’s listed in our Digital Harms Dictionary, for every kind of connected technology.</p>
 What are some other safety standards? 
<p>Safety standards are often “invisible” to consumers. For example, ASTM International has over 12,000 standards ranging from from cribs, toys, and trampolines, to aircraft manufacturing. Other safety standards are better known such as Underwriters Labs (UL), which measures the safety of electrical products, visible through the sticker or tag on household appliances like toasters. The US government’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, which keep people safe in their workplaces, are also widely recognized.</p>
 How is the Me2B Alliance different from other SDOs? 
<p>There is increasing global attention on the social and ethical impacts of technology as an integral aspect of standards development.2 Nevertheless, SDO membership has traditionally been limited to industry representatives and experts in their fields – either independent participants or “delegates” from relevant companies. Everyday people – the “experiential experts” who use the technology regularly – are rarely involved.</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance approach is different – we encourage and invite everyday people to have a voice in the standards development process. We’re structured as an SDO, but we believe it is essential to bring everyday people actively into the process of creating an ethical and respectful standard for measuring technology. Interested people can become members and participate in the Respectful Technology Specifications Working Group or signing up for Me2B Research Panels and sharing opinions on critical issues through surveys and interviews that help us consistently validate our specifications.</p>
 Why does the Me2B Alliance perform independent testing? 
<p>Currently, internet technology is largely ungoverned (especially in the US), and presents many risks and potential harms to users. Safety risks are often unknowable at the introduction of new technology, but every new technology eventually gives rise to corresponding “safety standards” to ensure human safety – for instance, automobiles, televisions, telephony. The internet is overdue for a safety standard.</p>
<p>Our goal is to empower people—and businesses— with information about how safe and respectful a product or service is, so that people can make more informed choices about the technology they use, and businesses can know how to build respectful and safe products.</p>
 What kind of independent testing does the Me2B Alliance perform? 
<p>The Me2B Alliance performs independent testing of digital products and services, measuring risks and potential harms to people. Our current independent testing services include:</p>
 
 Analysis of public products and services, such as the work described in our Spotlight Report on data sharing in K-12 education “utility” apps. 
 Auditing services for developers of mobile apps and websites, based on the Me2B Respectful Tech Specification. Our auditing services help businesses know how to make their websites and mobile apps more respectful. Please contact us if you’re interested in having your site or app audited. 
 In the future, as the specification matures, we will introduce Me2B Certification, for websites and apps that pass our rigorous testing. 
 
 Why trust us? 
<p>The Me2B Alliance is proud to have some of the best privacy, legal, technology, business and digital interaction experts in the industry leading our efforts. Restoring respect and safety in digital interactions is our unwavering passion, and our standard reflects an uncompromisingly high bar—one which most products do not currently meet. Our standard is developed by the expert volunteers involved in the working group, and we conduct ongoing validation testing with everyday “Me-s” on key parts of the standard.</p>

This update will improve EWC performance and security, and keep the EWC aligned with the latest developments in the Ethereum ecosystem.  If you are running an EWC node, you must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update it to a Berlin-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+Berlin+Hardfork">update the chainspec</a> as soon as possible. EWC validators have already completed all the necessary updates.  If you are an EWC user or EWT holder, no action is required.  <p>In April 2021 the Ethereum mainnet implemented the Berlin upgrade, which introduced four improvement proposals (i.e., <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565">EIP-2565</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718">EIP-2718</a>, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929">EIP-2929</a>, and <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930">EIP-2930</a>) that modified gas prices and created new transaction types. Combined, these updates improve the overall performance and security of EVM blockchains (including the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain).</p><p>In May 2021, after observing the successful Ethereum upgrade, <a href="https://validators.energyweb.org/">the EWC validators</a> voted to adopt Berlin on the EWC as well. Since then the EWC validators have successfully implemented the upgrade on the <a href="https://volta-explorer.energyweb.org/">Volta test network</a> and are now preparing for the upgrade to occur on the main&nbsp;EWC.</p><p>The EWC Berlin upgrade will occur at <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org">block 12,649,625</a>, which will occur on or around Tuesday, 6 July (the precise time will depend on block time variation). All full node operators must <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/706478224/Updating+the+Client">update their node to a Berlin-compatible client</a> and <a href="https://energyweb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EWF/pages/2568257551/Chainspec+update+for+Berlin+Hardfork">implement the Berlin chainspec</a> prior to the hard fork transition block. Due to subtle variations in the EWC block time, it is recommended to perform the update several days prior to the expected transition date.</p> FAQ <p>Who does this announcement impact?</p><blockquote>This announcement only impacts people or organizations that are operating a full node on the EWC. All EWC node operators should update the client and chainspec as soon as possible. As of the time of publication, all EWC validators have already completed the necessary updates to successfully implement the Berlin upgrades.</blockquote><p>If I’m an EWT holder but I’m not operating my own full node, is there anything I need to&nbsp;do?</p><blockquote>No, if you connect to the EWC via the public RPC and Metamask, an exchange (including Kucoin, Kraken, Liquid, Bitmart, or Hotbit), a web wallet (e.g., MyCrypto), or hardware wallet (e.g., Trezor, Ledger) then you do not need to take any&nbsp;action.</blockquote><p>Why is the Berlin upgrade happening on the&nbsp;EWC?</p><blockquote>The <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">EWC is a public, proof-of-authority EVM blockchain</a> and it benefits from adopting the latest upgrades and improvements from the wider Ethereum community. The EWC validators voted to adopt the upgrades contained in the Berlin fork in May&nbsp;2021.</blockquote><p>What will happen before, during, and after the&nbsp;upgrade?</p><p>As mentioned above, the decision to proceed with the upgrade is made by the EWC validators via the established governance process. After the decision is approved and before the upgrade occurs, all EWC validators and other node operators will update their node clients and chainspecs. During the upgrade (i.e., at the specified transition block), the new rules defined within the improvement proposals will take effect, creating a “new and improved” version of the EWC. There are no expected operational or performance impacts to the EWC during the upgrade. Following the upgrade, users and node operators can continue to interact with the EWC as&nbsp;normal.</p><p>If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please get in touch via our <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/psraNwqGqp">Discord</a> channels.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/announcing-the-berlin-upgrade-on-the-energy-web-chain-98c8da76054b">Announcing the Berlin Upgrade on the Energy Web Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Still frame from The Intersection<p>By Julia Solano, Eshanthi Ranasinghe, and Nicole Allred, Exploration &amp; Future Sensing, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p> The Intersection, a short film in collaboration with Superflux, creates a hopeful future that reimagines extractive, hyperconnected technology to serve community, support nature, and value human relationships. Watch&nbsp;<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/569842501?badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479">here</a>. <p>My low balance of -$1.50 glows red above my wrist as I cross through the turnstile and enter the station. Options to top up via crypto or credit are greyed out on my digital wallet; those accounts are empty. Guess I’m watching the ads today, just like they’re watching&nbsp;me.</p><p>As I sit down on the train, images — shoes I’ve always wanted, modeled by my favorite influencers, with payment plans to shrug off my empty bank account — flash before my eyes. There’s no hiding from them — the algorithms track my eye-movement, my heartbeat, my temperature. They know what I want before I&nbsp;do…</p><p>Technology is causing our perception of reality — and of each other — to splinter. The same stories and facts can be twisted and contorted to fit a desired narrative depending on which slice of the web we are tuned into. Social media content is engineered for our reaction, “taking our hopes and fears, our pain and suffering and using it as content between ads” (The Intersection); pitting us against each other in a race to the bottom line. We live in fundamentally different worlds — each with its own set of facts — depending on the media we&nbsp;consume.</p><blockquote>The average person touches their phone 2,617 times every day, and cellphone addiction (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/nomophobia">nomophobia</a>: the fear of going without your phone) is rising. This begs the question: Are we driving technology, or is our technology driving&nbsp;us?</blockquote>Still frame from The Intersection What if this reality wasn’t limited to our&nbsp;screens? <p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/ingestibles-wearables-and-embeddables">Ingestibles, wearables, embeddables</a>; smart homes and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/02/ring-camera-fears/">peer-to-peer surveillance</a>; the Internet of Things (IoT) and <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/industrial-internet-of-things-iiot">Industrial IoT</a>; 5G; <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/smart-cities-digital-solutions-for-a-more-livable-future">smart cities</a>; facial recognition, temperature checking <a href="https://dronelife.com/2020/03/31/this-pandemic-drone-can-see-who-has-a-temperature-or-coughs/">pandemic drones</a>, and satellite imagery — a new layer of ambient (ever-present, always-on, hyper-connected) technology is seamlessly enveloping the world around us. Ambient data collection and algorithmic decision-making allow our physical environments, like our devices, to be infiltrated with information and metadata constantly gleaned from our search histories, our purchases, our locations, our sleep patterns, our menstrual cycles.</p><p>Our physical and digital worlds are developing to become almost indistinguishable. This web of ambient technology is shaping our new reality. Question is, is that what we&nbsp;want?</p><blockquote>With the encompassing and interconnected nature of ambient technology, we are barreling towards a society in which each interaction with the physical and digital world is fair game for extraction and exploitation.</blockquote><p>This world isn’t science fiction — its creation is in progress, atop a complex web of existing technologies and systems already leveraging the personal data of&nbsp;users.</p>Still frame from The Intersection<p>Omidyar Network’s Exploration and Future Sensing team has been tracking this evolving trend since 2018. Our initial investigations provoked many questions: What could this world look like with a new layer of ambient technology? What currently drives its development and the course it takes? What is the experience of those already commonly marginalized, excluded, and/or discriminated against in current tech and surveillance systems? What might be the experience of immigrants, minorities, elderly, special needs, rural, urban, etc in this world? How could our interaction with technology, government, companies, society, each other change? Will these technology developments only be extractive, or is there a world where they could be supportive, or even regenerative? Is it possible for this world to be designed from a place that acknowledges our interconnectedness and centers diverse perspectives?</p> Making of “The Intersection” <p>To provoke the possibilities of this hyper-connected world, we partnered with <a href="https://superflux.in/">Superflux</a>, a speculative design and foresight agency. We hoped to provoke imagination about futures that could evolve what we, collectively, would like our relationship with technology to be, as we build the infrastructure, protocols, norms, social structures, and policies, for a technology ecosystem that can be empowering for us&nbsp;all.</p><blockquote>“I don’t want the tech we build to consume the world, but to augment and support it. We’re starting to build something new. A new way of networking and connecting. The tech was built from the ground up. To support people, instead of mining them.” — The Intersection</blockquote><p>Together we produced “The Intersection”, a short film that explores the future of ambient technology through the lens of four protagonists whose lives have been shaped by the dissonance of extractive technology norms, misinformation, surveillance capitalism, and context collapse:</p>  Ericka, a young activist whose movement for justice is derailed by a never-ending feed of misinformation and conspiracies concocted to extract&nbsp;data.  Jake, a journalist whose work is diluted and corrupted by AI systems that helped him prioritize clicks over the truth, taking news out of context and pandering to readers’ “intensely monitored, precisely categorized fears.”  Amp, a hardware engineer who set out to change the world using technology, only to have her utopian dream shattered by the realization that the only problem she was solving was finding new ways for technology companies to make&nbsp;money.  Tammi, a climate migrant who became a refugee in her own country because her family refused to evacuate in the face of an impending storm, citing “fake news”&nbsp;reports.  Still frame from The Intersection<p>As the film begins, the future of ambient tech is all-encompassing and ever present in every aspect of life. Individually, then together, the protagonists find ways to re-evaluate their relationships with technology — to repurpose and redesign ambient tech to serve their communities, support nature, and value human relationships. They come together to reconcile their differences — illustrating how people can be united by a common purpose, regardless of how different their backgrounds and world views may be. The film ends at a new beginning, open to audiences to shape — where could we head from here? What would we do today, if we knew this is where we were&nbsp;heading?</p><blockquote>“We wanted to show in an experiential way, the interconnected nature of the issues present in our world. Whether environmental, social or technological, these domains don’t reside within neat categories, they overlap and intermingle, giving birth to new hybrid forms that are as tricky to define as they are to address”– Anab Jain &amp; Jon Ardern, Superflux.</blockquote><p>We hope this film makes the future of ambient technology more tangible, prompts us to investigate our relationship with technology, and encourages us to build towards a more just, pluralistic world that centers the experiences of those most marginalized among&nbsp;us.</p><p>Watch the Intersection <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/569842501?badge=0&amp;amp;autopause=0&amp;amp;player_id=0&amp;amp;app_id=58479">here</a>.

<p><a href="https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#introducao">Brazil recently published their open banking technology stack</a> including the <a href="https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-financial-api-1_ID1.html">security and identity standards</a> that the&nbsp;financial services sector&nbsp;must adopt and implement in multiple phases in 2021.&nbsp;Building on the global and increasingly ubiquitous OpenID Foundation FAPI&nbsp;specification, the Brazilian open banking ecosystem is leveraging the work of the Foundation’s FAPI working group.

These efforts help ensure that non-digital users can access services offered by third party providers (TPPs,) which is an important step forward for financial inclusion. The OpenID Foundation is currently developing RP/TPP tests specific to Brazil that will be released in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Brazil’s rapid adoption of open banking technical standards is evidenced by the hundreds of technologists attending the <a href="https://openid.net/oidf-fapi-outreach-workshops-for-open-banking-brazil-spring-2021/">series of OpenID Foundation workshops</a> that focused on the technical implementation of FAPI as well as FAPI conformance testing and self certification. Our Brazilian colleagues will utilize the OpenID Foundation’s <a href="https://openid.net/certification/">Certification Program</a> to ensure FAPI technical conformance needed to meet compliance requirements, which goes a long way towards the interoperability open banking relies upon.</p>
<p>We’re impressed by our new Brazilian colleagues who’ve become members of the OpenID Foundation and their contributions to the Foundation’s working groups that are evolving the OpenID standards. New Foundation members include seven of the 26 banking institutions required to be FAPI conformant and certified by July 15, 2021 under Phase 2 of the Brazilian open banking regulations, as well as a number of fintech service providers in Brazil. Special thanks to the GT Open Banking Information Security Working Group and all who have invested both the human and financial capital needed for secure and safe data sharing in Brazil!</p>

<p>What is MiCA?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MiCA is the Acronym of Markets in Crypto Assets</p>
<p>The EU will create a SINGLE regulation &nbsp; for ALL 28 members Countries regarding Crypto</p>
<p>A Regulation..&nbsp; Basically&nbsp; is a LAW IMPOSED upon all countries immediately that supersedes any national regulations.</p>
<p>MiCA Regulation therefore is a single set of rules , Immediately applicable, Throughout the Single Market.</p>
<p>Is MiCA good or bad?</p>
<p>To Answer this question let’s focus on why they are doing it. The EU is drafting new strategy on digital finance for the EU financial sector. The EU with MiCA aims to ensure that the EU embraces the Blockchain revolution and become leader with innovative European firms in the lead, On one side they want&nbsp; to be innovation-Friendly to make digital finance available to European consumers and businesses. On the other side wants to&nbsp; mitigate the risk to consumers (and banks).</p>
<p>MiCA Objectives</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 First objective give LEGAL CERTAINTY to&nbsp; crypto-asset markets. The EU thinks there is a need for a sound legal framework, clearly defining the regulatory treatment of all crypto-assets that are not covered by existing EU legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Second objective is to SUPPORT INNOVATION.&nbsp; The EU wants to&nbsp; Promote crypto-assets development and new user cases while putting in place a safe and proportionate framework to support innovation and fair competition. 
 Third objective is CONSUMER PROTECTION. The EU thinks crypto-assets present many of the same risks as traditional&nbsp; financial instruments.&nbsp; 
 Fourth objective is to ensure FINANCIAL STABILITY. The EU is literally&nbsp; terrified by ‘stablecoins’, because&nbsp; unlike cryptocurrencies have the potential to become widely accepted and potentially systemic disruptive for the status quo.&nbsp;

<p>Second public review ends July 18th</p> 


<p>OASIS and the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC are pleased to announce that Specification for JSON Abstract Data Notation Version 1.0 is now available for public review and comment. This is the second public review for this specification.</p>



<p>JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is an information modeling language. It has several purposes including defining data structures, validating data instances, informing user interfaces working with structured data, and facilitating protocol internationalization. JADN specifications consist of two parts: abstract type definitions that are independent of data format, and serialization rules that define how to represent type instances using specific data formats. A JADN schema is itself a structured information object that can be serialized and transferred between applications, documented in multiple formats such as text-based interface definition languages, property tables or diagrams, and translated into concrete schemas used to validate specific data formats.</p>

<p>Kestrel lets threat hunters 'devote more time to figuring out what to hunt, as apposed to how to hunt' </p> 


<p>BOSTON, MA, USA, June 29, 2021 – <a href="https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/">Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA)</a>, an OASIS Open Project, today announced it has accepted IBM’s contribution of&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang">Kestrel</a>, an open-source programming language for threat hunting that is used by Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts and other cybersecurity professionals. Kestrel streamlines cyber reasoning and threat discovery, which can help analysts complete this process more quickly and effectively.</p>



<p>Threat hunting is a proactive way to find hidden threats in an organization before an attack is executed. This methodology follows the scientific process of establishing a hypothesis for threats likely to be found and then creates detection procedures to confirm or deny the threat’s existence – helping security professionals respond to indicators of compromise with increased speed.</p>



<p>While threat hunting has been successful as a technique, its success unfortunately has been limited due to the high human bandwidth required. Existing threat hunting approaches are primarily manually driven and require deep technical skills that are in short supply. Instead of benefiting from the threat hunting community’s collective knowledge and sharing code, threat hunters often end up working in isolation rewriting the same programs following each attack. IBM Research and IBM Security jointly developed Kestrel to enable threat hunters to express hunts in an open, composable threat hunting language. Kestrel leverages automation to execute tedious hunting tasks, allowing threat hunters to focus on higher priority tasks. Its combination of human ingenuity coupled with machine-based automation helps accelerate threat hunting. The composable hunting flows enable the reuse of best practices and helps reduce the time to create new hunts. Because IBM Security has open-sourced this project, threat hunters across the globe are now able to collaborate, share and use the knowledge curated continuously by threat hunters using Kestrel.</p>



<p>This contribution from IBM marks a major milestone in OCA’s mission to drive greater interoperability across the security industry. The work of the OCA connects the fragmented cybersecurity landscape and enables disparate security products to freely exchange information, out of the box, using mutually agreed upon technologies, standards, and procedures that make it possible for companies to “integrate once, reuse everywhere.”</p>



<p>“Kestrel is designed to take advantage of the collective learned experience of the threat hunting community – and enable that to be combined with the power of machine learning and automation to speed response to threats,” said Jason Keirstead, CTO of Threat Management for IBM Security and Co-Chair – Open Cybersecurity Alliance. “By sharing new threat hunting patterns as they emerge via code that can be easily customized, Kestrel lets threat hunters devote more time to figuring out what to hunt, as opposed to how to hunt.”</p>



<p>“This is a really exciting contribution from IBM, a founding member of the Open Cybersecurity Alliance. Kestrel is a fully open-source threat hunting language that leverages the federated data service capabilities of STIX Shifter which were previously contributed to the OCA by IBM. I cannot wait to see how OCA member organizations and the community of like-minded people, pursuing open interoperability of security solutions, leverage these tools to further enhance their security operations across heterogeneous solutions.” <br>— Mark Mastrangeli, Lead Architect, McAfee, and Co-Chair – Open Cybersecurity Alliance</p>



<p>“The future of cybersecurity automation is in analyst augmentation and platform interoperability. Kestrel embodies both of these traits, enabling SOC analysts to hunt threats at scale using a standardized language. Cydarm is pleased to see this project included as an OCA capability.” <br>— Dr. Vaughan Shanks, CEO, Cydarm Technologies</p>



<p>“We are proud to support the continued refinement of this standard language. It further builds confidence with the threat intelligence community and enables a true collective defense,” said Avkash Kathiriya, Vice President of Research and Innovation at Cyware. “As a part of the community, Cyware understands how valuable the standard is, which is just one of the reasons we use it as a backbone for intel sharing and automation.”</p>



<p>“It’s good to see additional capabilities being built upon STIX. The Kestrel project is a great example of how the community can develop normalised methods, in this case, a threat hunting language, to easily interact with the growing security technology landscape.“ <br>— Tyler Oliver, XDR Product Manager at EclecticIQ</p>



<p>“Robust threat hunting is a function of data correlation and contextual analysis. For transforming threat discoveries into actionable threat intelligence at-scale, the organizations need a powerful language to communicate the threat hunting tasks and operations, and we believe that Kestrel is an answer to that.” <br>— Renuka Nadkarni, VP and CTO Security, F5 Inc.</p>



<p>“To meet today’s increasing threats requires tools to help defenders share both between people/organizations and between products. OCA helps with vendor-agnostic, machine-speed cyber-defense automation. The new Kestrel project is a welcome addition to that toolset to assist with sharing in threat hunting.” <br>— Duncan Sparrell, Chief Cyber Curmudgeon, sFractal Consulting</p>



<p>“ThreatQuotient is pleased to continue its partnership with the Open Cybersecurity Alliance to help drive standards to encourage interoperability between security vendors to benefit network defenders,” said Haig Colter, Director of Alliances. “Our continued participation in the OCA demonstrates our commitment to follow established standards that encourage the communication of security information in ways that benefit a broader audience.”</p>



<p>The OCA is led by organizations committed to solving the costly problem of siloed cyber tools and products that create integration nightmares for cybersecurity professionals in every environment.

<p>OCA technologies work together to deliver more value and improve product interoperability across security tools and teams – for example, Kestrel utilizes&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/stix-shifter">STIX-Shifter</a>&nbsp;to unify threat hunting experience across different security tools. To learn more about the other OCA technologies that are available to help security teams connect their security tools and data, please visit:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance">https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance</a>.</p>



<p>More Support for OCA</p>



<p>“Kestrel is about to change the way we approach threat hunting, instead of continuously rebuilding our analysis Kestrel allows us to ask what patterns or what behaviours are present during an investigation. Instead of dissecting indicators of compromise, we will be dissecting playbooks of entire hunt logic and across data sources. As adoption of the language continues to roll out, our collective hunt teams will be able to collaborate and approach cyber investigations differently – as a leader in bringing cyber collectives together to solve problems CyberNB welcomes the innovative thinking of IBM Security.” <br>— Sheldon Shaw, Vice President, Innovation &amp; Infrastructure, CyberNB</p>



<p>“For threat hunting, Kestrel fills a critical need of a common language to express data and share insights. Combining Kestrel with predictive data sources will make threat hunting far more powerful and empower security teams to drive down the risks that matter. SafeBreach is excited to be the first predictive data source that will enable querying future threats”. <br>— Valeriy Leykin, Director Product Management at SafeBreach</p>



<p>The OCA is actively seeking additional contributors from across the security industry to help guide and drive innovative new use cases for these open-source projects.</p>

<p>By CV Madhukar, Responsible Technology, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>In a world where digitization ubiquitous, we now have an opportunity to shape digital ID programs and other components of the digital public infrastructure in a direction that serves the <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar-network-unpacks-good-id-update-our-point-view-digital-identity/">public interest</a> and powers the digital economy, rather than only serving private corporate interests.</p><p>Back in 2015, the UN Sustainable Development goals called for “legal identity for all” by 2030. At the time, the World Bank released data which revealed that 1.5 billion people in the world lacked formal identification. Those working on financial inclusion challenges were among the first to articulate the societal cost of this gap; if a person is unable to identify themself, then they will be unable to engage in for the formal financial system and economic growth will&nbsp;stall.</p><p>Yet conversations about digital identity innovation were mostly treated as a developing country issue, with ardent advocates in the West unwilling to acknowledge that digital identity could add value to developed economies. Now, as the world <a href="https://omidyar.com/a-decade-of-digital-public-goods-holding-up-the-digital-economy-preventing-monopolies-and-safeguarding-freedoms-for-all/">emerges from the pandemic</a>, attitudes seem to have taken a 180-degree turn.</p><p>The recognition that digital identification is increasingly central to the digital public infrastructure (that is, digital spaces for the public good) is gaining currency worldwide. Earlier this month, the European Commission proposed the creation of trusted and secure “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">Digital Identity for all Europeans</a>”. This is expected to go into effect in late 2022. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also spoke in February about the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0023">need for Digital IDs</a>, saying, “The same digital ID technology that protects against money laundering can also help us reach more people with&nbsp;relief.”</p><p>Every country will need to reimagine its technology infrastructure and make it fit-or-purpose for a digital century. While developing countries suffer from lack of technology infrastructure, developed economies have legacy systems that need urgent reimagining. The Clinton era effort of “Reinventing Government” will need a whole new makeover right now in the US with regard to reimagining technology infrastructure. But to really reimagine this, key stakeholders will need to overcome a deep chasm caused by the compartmentalization in thinking about the role of public sector and the private&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In her important work on the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/final_the_entrepreneurial_state_and_public_options.pdf">Entrepreneurial State</a>, noted economist Mariana Mazzucato argues that the state as a fixer of market failures offers a limited view. The state as a market shaper and market maker is less recognized in the US, even though the state (through DARPA, NIH, etc.) has had a deep impact on the course of innovation in the private sector over several&nbsp;decades.</p><p>The very nature of infrastructure is such that it is an enabler for private sector economic activity. In the digital era, such infrastructure also has the ability to ”see” every transaction that takes place in these digital spaces. That is why when a website that requires some form of identification asks offers the option to login in with Facebook or Gmail credentials, the big tech platforms get to see much of the activity that the individual does on this third-party website. Similarly, when a payment platform uses the infrastructure provided by Visa or Mastercard, these companies gain insights on financial activity of the individuals that use such a provider.</p><p>At a time where data will be a “factor of production” in the new digital economy, those providing such infrastructure will naturally become massive monopolies or oligopolies. Using antitrust laws to remedy this without recognizing what caused data monopolies in the first place, is like trying to pick up water with a sieve. We need viable and scalable public alternatives for the existing digital infrastructure to truly curb such monopolies. This will provide a level playing field for all private market players, create the basis for interoperability, prevent data monopolies, and make services more accessible for individuals.</p><p>This is, according to a recent <a href="https://www.journalismliberty.org/publications/what-is-digital-public-infrastructure">paper</a> by Ethan Zuckerman, the strongest case for policymakers to take urgent and concrete measures for the development and adoption of digital public infrastructure as a way of shaping the trajectory of the future digital&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We need governments to own this agenda so that any new conception of digital public infrastructure is built on a solid foundation of safeguards. Even as we think about such large-scale deployment of technology, we must deliberately think about unintended consequences of such efforts and mitigate them. Safeguards in the form of technology, law, and institutions must drive the norms and behavior of both the designers of technology and its users, and the government must guarantee these protections. The financial sector or the pharmaceutical industry can offer valuable lessons in this&nbsp;regard.</p><p>Reimagining digital public infrastructure could have a positive, transformative impact on the global economy and global development. But it’s going to be important for the US and Europe to install safe and inclusive, digital public infrastructure (like federated digital ID and payment platforms) to see real change. If they make this kind of investment, we can begin to build a world where gaps in technology won’t limit the development programs governments can implement, the progress they can make, or support they can give people to improve their own&nbsp;lives.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-digital-public-infrastructure-is-no-longer-just-a-development-agenda-6c3915d20598">Reimagining digital public infrastructure is no longer just a development agenda</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Most of us understand how fingerprinting works, where we compare a captured fingerprint, from a crime scene for example, to a live person’s fingerprint to determine if they match. We can also use a fingerprint to ensure that the true owner, and only the true owner, can unlock a smartphone or laptop. But could a fake fingerprint be used to fool the fingerprint sensor in the phone? The simplest answer is yes unless we can determine if the fingerprint actually came from a living and physically present person, who might be trying to unlock the phone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In biometrics, there are two important measurements, Biometric Matching and Biometric Liveness. Biometric matching is a process of identifying or authenticating a person, by comparing their physiological attributes to information that had already been collected. For example, when that fingerprint matches a fingerprint on file, that’s matching.&nbsp;Liveness Detection is a computerized process to determine if the computer is interfacing with a live human and not an impostor like a photo, a deep-fake video, or a replica. For example, one measure to determine Liveness includes determining whether the presentation occurred in real-time.&nbsp;Without Liveness, biometric matching would be increasingly vulnerable to fraud attacks that are continuously growing in their ability to fool biometric matching systems with imitation and fake biometric attributes. Attacks such as “Presentation Attack”,&nbsp; “spoof”, or “bypass” attempts&nbsp; would endanger a user without proper liveness detection. It is important to have strong Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) as well the ability to detect injection attacks (where imagery bypasses the camera) as these are ways to spoof the user’s biometrics. Liveness determines if it’s a real person while matching determines if it’s the correct, real person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
 
 

 



 
<p>With today’s increasingly powerful computer systems, have come increasingly sophisticated hacking strategies, such as Presentation and Bypass attacks.&nbsp;There are many varieties of Presentation attacks, including high-resolution paper &amp; digital photos, high-definition challenge/response videos, and paper masks. Commercially available lifelike dolls are available, human-worn resin, latex &amp; silicone 3D masks, as well as custom-made ultra-realistic 3D masks and wax heads. These methods might seem right out of a bank heist movie, but they are used in the real world, successfully too.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 


<p>There are other ways to defeat a biometric system, called Bypass attacks. These include intercepting, editing, and replacing legitimate biometric data with synthetic data, not collected from the persons biometric verification check. Other Bypass attacks might include intercepting and replacing legitimate camera feed data with previously captured video frames or with what’s known as a “deep-fake puppet”, a realistic-looking computer animation of the user. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sfhar1sGi7c">This video</a> is a simple but good example of biometric vulnerabilities, lacking any regard for Liveness.</p>



<p>The COVID19 Pandemic provides significant examples of Presentation and Bypass attacks and resulting frauds. Pandemic Stay-at-Home orders, along with&nbsp; economic hardships, have increased citizen dependence on the electronic distribution of government pandemic stimulus and unemployment assistance funds, creating easy targets for fraudsters.&nbsp;Cybercriminals frequently utilize Presentation and Bypass attacks to defeat government website citizen enrolee and user authentication systems, to <a href="https://abc7news.com/california-edd-unemployment-fraud-ca-scam-insurance/10011810/">steal from governments across the globe which amounts in the hundreds of billions of losses of taxpayer money</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Properly designed biometric liveness and matching could have mitigated much of the trouble Nevadans are experiencing.&nbsp;There are various forms of biometric liveness testing:</p>



  Active Liveness commands the user to successfully perform a movement or action like blinking, smiling, tilting the head, and track-following a bouncing image on the device screen. Importantly, instructions must be randomized and the camera/system must observe the user perform the required action.&nbsp;  Passive Liveness relies on involuntary user cues like pupil dilation, reducing user friction and session abandonment. Passive liveness can be undisclosed, randomizing attack vector approaches.&nbsp;Alone, it can determine if captured image data is first-generation and not a replica presentation attack. Significantly higher Liveness and biometric match confidence can be gained if device camera data is captured securely with a verified camera feed, and the image data is verified to be captured in real-time by a device Software Development Kit (SDK). Under these circumstances both Liveness and Match confidence can be determined concurrently from the same data, mitigating vulnerabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Multimodal Liveness utilizes numerous Liveness modalities, like 2 dimensional face matching in combination with instructions to blink on command, to establish user choice and increase the number of devices supported. This often requires the user to “jump through hoops” of numerous Active Liveness tests and increases friction.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Liveness and 3-dimensionality. A human must be 3D to be alive, while a mask-style artifact may be 3D without being alive. Thus, while 3D face depth measurements alone do not prove the subject is a live human, verifying 2-dimensionality proves the subject is not alive. Regardless of camera resolution or specialist hardware, 3-dimensionality provides substantially more usable and consistent data than 2D, dramatically increasing accuracy and highlights the importance of 3D depth detection as a component of stronger Liveness Detection.  



<p>Biometric Liveness is a critical component in any biometric authentication system.&nbsp;Properly designed systems require the use of liveness tests before moving on to biometric matching. After all, if it’s determined the subject is not alive, there’s little reason to perform biometric matching and further authentication procedures. A well-designed system that is easy to use allows only the right people access and denies anybody else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wakefield, Mass. and Woburn, Mass., – June 29, 2021 – ​The<a href="https://entethalliance.org/"> Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)</a> and <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/org/">OASIS Open</a> today announced that the<a href="http://bit.ly/EEACommProjectsGitHub"> Ethereum OASIS Open Project</a>, home of the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline">Baseline Protocol</a>, will now operate under the banner of <a href="http://bit.ly/EEACommunityProjects">EEA Community Projects</a>. The move leverages the strengths of both standards bodies, building on EEA’s leadership role in Ethereum standards for business while continuing to rely on OASIS’ expertise in supporting open source and open standards development. The formation of EEA Community Projects signals to the world that there is now a central location where Ethereum-related business standards are developed and new projects are advanced.</p>



<p>“The Ethereum OASIS Open Project has become the go-to community for open source-based standards development in Ethereum, such as the Baseline Protocol initiative. Transitioning Ethereum OASIS to the new EEA Community Projects will enable the Ethereum business ecosystem to leverage a wider network of resources and further accelerate innovation,” said Dan Burnett, EEA Executive Director and EEA Community Projects Governing Board Chair. “We look forward to working together to chart the future of Ethereum innovation and collaboration.”</p>

<p>THE FUTURE OF EQUITY CROWDFUNDING RUNS ON BLOCKCHAIN</p>
<p>(Milan 28 June ) 2Meet2Biz.com, equity crowdfunding and debt platform, is the first among the platforms authorized by Consob to use blockchain technology to manage all internal document processes, thanks to its presence, as a validator node, on the Commercio.network blockchain.</p>
<p>With equity crowdfunding Startups and SMEs can collect risk capital to finance the birth or the development of their business project.&nbsp; Italy has been among the first countries to regulate this kind of investment creating a real ecosystem and an official registry by Consob. In recent years the sector has evolved in terms of the number of platforms and capital raised, as well as the number of transactions managed, but from a technological point of view few steps have been taken.</p>
<p>The desire to use blockchain technology in 2meet2biz stems from a precise need: to apply the potential of a blockchain to the processes that normally characterize equity crowdfunding campaigns and that, by type, are essentially replicable and procedurizable for all bidding companies.</p>
<p>That’s why 2meet2biz, developed and managed by Migliora Srl, has embarked on an absolutely innovative path: to ensure to its corporate clients, as well as to all investors who join the campaigns, transparency, security and immutability of all processes related to the collection of capital, from the receipt of the initial documentation until the conclusion of the campaign, this thanks to a blockchain technology compliant, moreover, to the eIDAS directives.</p>
<p>For the same reason – to integrate with third party technologies with the aim of improving efficiency and security in economic and financial transactions – 2meet2biz has chosen to use an open banking software system, fully integrated into 2meet2biz, which through APIs securely guarantees financial flows, automating all phases of bank reconciliations and transactions.</p>
<p>2Meet2Biz.com is now part of Commercio.network, a blockchain that since 2018 has enabled all companies around the world to manage the three indispensable fiduciary processes of digital transformation: Creating a digital identity with eID, signing a document with eSignature and certifying the exchange of documents with eDelivery. Thanks to this the customer experience of the platform is ZERO PAPER and the processes from onboarding to eKYC (electronic know your customer) are totally digital.</p>
<p>2Meet2Biz.com has become the 45th of the 100 validator nodes of commercio.network joining the most important European players already present, such as Namirial, Infocert, VAR Group Zucchetti. Being a Validator Node means to participate in the most innovative, sustainable and advanced European project in the Blockchain field, also proposed as a technology for the EBSI call for proposals financed through PCP by the European Commission.</p>
<p>This step from one side is part of a very precise strategy, that is to integrate 2meet2biz with</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commerce Network</p>
<p>third party technologies that allow it to progressively improve the customer experience of all its customers, and on the other hand it is the first step of a wider project to exploit all the potentialities</p>
<p>that this business model intends to offer, from a procedural point of view and not only, ensuring a degree of transparency never seen in its sector in full compliance with EU MICA directives.</p>
<p>2meet2biz intends to guide the processes of crowd campaigns through the digital transformation, with the development and use of SAAS technologies able to make even the investment process innovative, both for principals and investors, maximizing the value chain of the campaigns presented, from their origin to the access to the target market. A new international strategic approach, with a path that will soon be applicable to all investors, involving partners with platforms that comply with the standards required by the European regulatory bodies.</p>

<p>Notice of Intent: DIACC is collaborating to develop and publish a Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF) Assurance Maturity Model to set a baseline of public and private sector interoperability of identity services and solutions.</p>



<p>To learn more about the Pan-Canadian vision and benefits-for-all value proposition please review the<a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PCTF-Overview-FINAL.pdf"> Pan-Canadian Trust Framework Overview</a>.</p>



<p>Document Status: This review document has been approved as a Draft Recommendation V1.0 by the DIACC’s<a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/"> </a><a href="https://diacc.ca/committees/">Trust Framework Expert Committee</a> (TFEC) that operates under the DIACC controlling policies.</p>



<p>Summary: It is essential that Participants in a digital ecosystem have a way to evaluate the robustness and trustworthiness of transactions within that ecosystem. In order to do so, Participants must share a common vocabulary that describes the level of confidence they can associate with an Entity or transaction, as well as a common way in which to determine that level of confidence.</p>



<p>In the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework™ (PCTF), a Level of Assurance (LoA) represents the level of confidence an Entity may place in the processes and other conformance criteria defined in any given component of the PCTF.&nbsp; Levels of Assurance are elemental in creating networks of trust. Levels of Assurance models only work if all Participants in a digital ecosystem are able to interpret them consistently. It is therefore critical that all Participants in an ecosystem agree upon a minimum set of criteria for each Level of Assurance. Only then will a Relying Party in that ecosystem be able to properly evaluate the risks inherent in a relationship or transaction, and the Level of Assurance that can be placed in Participants, Credentials, and those transactions. The components of the PCTF describe the detailed conformance criteria that should be used to evaluate such Levels of Assurance in the context of a given PCTF component. This document provides guidance regarding how to use those criteria in order to properly classify Levels of Assurance.</p>



<p>Invitation: All interested parties are invited to comment.</p>

<p>Context: The purpose of this Draft Recommendation review is to ensure transparency in the development and diversity of a truly Pan-Canadian, and international, input. In alignment with our<a href="https://diacc.ca/principles/"> Principles for an Identity Ecosystem</a>, processes to respect and enhance privacy are being prioritized through every step of the PCTF development process.</p>



<p>DIACC expects to modify and improve this Draft Recommendation based upon public comments. Comments made during the review will be considered for incorporation into the next draft and DIACC will prepare a Disposition of Comments to provide transparency with regard to how each comment was handled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By: FIDO Alliance Staff</p>



<p>The digital security, privacy and authentication landscape is evolving quickly in the European Union with new regulations that could have a broad ranging impact for its citizens, as well as companies around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Authenticate Virtual Summit: Focus on Europe, which was held on June 17, experts on the authentication market in Europe provided insight into the latest developments including PSD2 SCA (Payment Services Directive Strong Customer Authentication), delegated authentication, eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) and the EU Digital Wallet among other efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Kicking off the virtual summit, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance outlined how the FIDO specifications work and why strong authentication is essential for multiple use cases including ecommerce, Internet of Things (IoT) and identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“FIDO’s goal from day one was to certainly reduce reliance on passwords, but in some ways that was just a means to an end, really trying to address the data breach problem, as the vast majority of data breaches are caused by weak credentials,” Shikiar said.</p>



<p>As FIDO is moving forward, there has been a need to strengthen identity verification assurance to support better and safer account recovery. As part of that, Shikiar noted that the FIDO Alliance launched the Identity Verification &amp; Binding Working Group (IDWG) which is driving that work forward.</p>



<p>“We’re seeking to establish best practices for possession based identity verification,” Shikiar said. “That will not only enable safer, easier and stronger account recovery, but doing so will also stop hackers from using the account recovery process as an opening for social engineering account takeovers.”</p>



<p>Helping to Limit Cart Abandonment</p>



  



<p>There is a tangible connection between ecommerce success and strong authentication, according to Rolf Lindemann, VP products at NokNok.</p>



<p>Lindermann noted that during the pandemic, ecommerce grew faster than ever before. But with 13% of credit card online payments not being completed, it’s clear that cart abandonment is still impacting business in a significant manner.</p>



<p>“We learned that authentication friction in general is a major factor for card abandonment,” Lindermann said. “This becomes obvious given that online authentication is at the core of all online transactions. Authentication is the front door to digital services in general.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The path to reducing authentication friction involves the use of FIDO, which Lindermann said can help to enable strong customer authentication that can be implemented in a single convenient step.</p>



<p>Toward a Strongly Authenticated Digital Identity&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Europe and elsewhere around the world, there is a growing conversation about the need to enable and provide some form of digital identity. According to Steve Pannifer, COO of Consult Hyperion, digital identity consists of three things: identification, authentication and authorization.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Pannifer explained that identification is all about asking the question – is this person real, unique and identifiable? Authentication is the process of realizing that an identified person is coming in to use the service again, as the service provider wants to know if it is the same person that established the identity at some point in the past. Authorization ties it all together, which uses identity and authentication to access services.</p>



<p>“Digital identity is not a means in and of itself, it’s a means to an end,” Pannifer said. “The end that it is serving is all of those services that I’m trying to get access to.”</p>



<p>Fabian Eberle, co-founder and COO at <a href="https://keyless.io/">Keyless</a> is also a big believer in digital identity. In a session, Eberle outlined the need for a decentralized system for personal identity management. Such a system puts users in control of their own identity information, and lets them selectively disclose that identity data in a more private and secure way.</p>



<p>Eberle noted that at LUISS Guido Carli University, over 10,000 students are now benefiting from a digital identity system that helps to support remote education services. The Keyless approach benefits from FIDO standards that helps to authenticate a device and identify students in a frictionless approach.</p>



<p>Digital Identity in Europe: eIDAS</p>



<p>In the European Union, there is an effort known as <a href="https://www.eid.as/">eIDAS</a> which is a legal framework for mutual recognition of national digital identity schemes.</p>



<p>“The purpose of eIDAS is cross border access for citizens in any European country to gain access to any public service in the EU,”Sebastian Elfors, senior solutions architect at Yubico explained.</p>



  



  



<p>FIDO standards are being increasingly adopted by European governments to help support eIDAS efforts. Among those that Elfors highlighted is healthcare authentication in Norway, EduID for universities in Sweden and the National Health Service (NHS) in the U.K.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO standards are also helping the Czech Republic with its CZ.NIC top level domain registry which also operates the mojedID (my ID in Czech) service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jaromi Talir, technical fellow at CZ.NIC and member of eIDAS Technical subgroup explained that the domain registry had a requirement to authenticate the identity of domain owners. That requirement led to the creation of mojeID, which has been using FIDO standards since 2019. Talir explained that CZ.NIC uses FIDO to support a multi-factor strong authentication based approach to help authentication user identity.</p>



<p>Using FIDO to Support Delegated Authentication</p>



<p>With the European Union’s Payment Services Directive Strong Customer Authentication (PSD2 SCA), that came into effect in 2021, there are very stringent requirements for merchants to authenticate consumers with payment providers.</p>



  



<p>In a panel discussion, Jonathan Grossar, VP, product development at Mastercard commented that within a few months of the introduction of PSD2 SCA there has been an increase in the number of transactions that have been abandoned by consumers.</p>



<p>“So a problem with PSD2 SCA is that consumers may have to authenticate twice,” Grossar siad. “First with the merchant to have access to the account or to the card that is stored on file and then a second time doing the transaction with the bank and potentially then with a different authentication mechanism.”</p>



<p>All those extra steps introduce additional friction and complexity for both merchants and consumers that can be alleviated with an approach known as delegated authentication. Grossar explained that with delegated authentication, the entire authentication piece is handled&nbsp; with a secure mechanism by merchants. Using FIDO standards in combination with EMVco’s <a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/3d-secure/">3-D Secure</a> standards to share authentication and risk data is the way forward in Grossar’s view.</p>



<p>“FIDO is interoperable across multiple devices and platforms,” Grossar said. “So in short, you have today billions of devices that are enabled with FIDO, and that potentially can be used for delegated authentication.”</p>



<p>Jason Muncey, principal, EU Payment Acceptance &amp; International Expansion, at Amazon is also optimistic about using FIDO for delegated authentication. Muncey commented that even before the PSD2 SCA requirements cart abandonment was just a pain that all merchants have had to live with. In his view, there is a real need to have some form of consistent approach.</p>



<p>Lee Goddard, product director, head of authentication at Worldpay also noted that – there will always be some amount of abandonment potential in that purchase process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think the FIDO approach to delegated authentication will really take things a step further in removing evermore abandonment,” she said.</p>



<p>Remote Identity Verification in Europe</p>



<p>With the pandemic, the ability to do in-person identity verification became challenging, which led to a need for increased remote identity verification in Europe and other areas around the world.</p>



<p>In a panel discussion, Santosh Rajvaidya, senior director, product management at Jumio noted that to date, there is no consistent approach when it comes to remote ID verification in Europe. That situation could be changing with the new digital identity wallet approach from the European Commission that could be the first step in the right direction.</p>



  



<p>“What is happening with digital identity wallet is you do a one time verification of your ID and the identity is created in the digital identity wallet,” Rajvaidya said. “From there on the user can reuse it multiple times across different applications.”</p>



<p>There is now also an ID Verification and Binding Working Group IDWG within FIDO that is doing work that will also help with remote identity verification efforts. Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow, commented that when it comes to verification, user experience and convenience are key attributes.</p>



<p>“Most users aren’t concerned with their identity or the data privacy, they’ll tick the boxes and move on, they just want to get their service,” she said.</p>



<p>Wrapping up the virtual Authenticate Summit, Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance emphasized that the FIDO Alliance is in a very good place today, in Europe and around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re seeing more and more companies adopt FIDO authentication,” Shikiar said. “I personally firmly believe that virtually every consumer service online will be offering passwordless login options in the next few years and our hope is that the vast majority of these leverage FIDO.”</p>



<p>Looking forward to the next FIDO Authenticate virtual summits is in September with a focus on government services. Then in October, the FIDO Alliance will be hosting its first live event with the Authenticate Conference in Seattle.</p>

  Tiles is a browser for Ceramic streams that empowers anyone to explore, inspect, and eventually transform open information flows.

<p><a href="http://tiles.ceramic.community">Tiles</a> is the first browser for content on the Ceramic Network. Built by several early Ceramic community members, Tiles is the easiest way to explore all streams being created and updated on the network or to examine the content of any given stream. It also helps developers discover the formats, schemas, and metadata being used by others, enabling them to build their applications with common data formats and patterns.</p><p>With upcoming features such as lenses, Tiles is primed to help Web3 developers create an open-source approach to data management and unlock more expressive UIs and experiences for their users.</p>  The cost of fragmented data <p>We've gotten so used to the fragmentation of data on Web2 that we sometimes forget how much it costs us. Developers and product builders are forced to contend with this fragmentation whenever they want to consume and make use of data from multiple sources. Similarly, users are forced to deal with data lock-in resulting in limited data in any single application or frustrating processes to manually export and connect data across multiple applications – usually with very limited success.</p><p>Oaksprout, one of the creators of Tiles along with his collaborator Izzy, has been trying to work around the patchwork data architecture that exists in Web2 for nearly a decade. He says:</p><blockquote>Services built on top of fragmented data are wildly limited because you can't aggregate information across them, which means that services in the Web2 world are just really, incredibly underpowered.</blockquote><p>Since Web2-powered products run on data stored in private database servers which are independently controlled and managed, there is no way for third parties or the general public to input or agree on the proper formats for certain types of data. Even in cases where a given data object is so common that it should conform to a standard — say, the format for a blog post or how to represent a step in a fitness tracker — each vendor will choose to implement their own model and schema for that data with no natural way to collaborate and coordinate with other vendors storing or consuming data for the same type of object.</p><p>In this paradigm every application exists only within its own silo, unable to connect with other applications or experiences that a user has on the web. Because of this, developers are forced to start cold or succumb to being locked into a specific platform, rather than being able to build on existing patterns that the ecosystem has aligned around and the data that has been created within other applications. If disparate, third-party applications and data sources were able to connect more easily, developers would be able to build richer and far more seamless user experiences, while dramatically accelerating development speed.</p> Consensus on data models <p>One great promise of the distributed web is data interoperability and composability: the ability to use the same content across different contexts, organizations, and applications. In practice, data interoperability requires more than just decentralized storage; it requires the ability for many different, unrelated parties to openly discover, interpret, and transform data formats and schemas - and eventually, over time, converge on them.</p><p>The Tiles team sees Ceramic as a promising solution for enabling distributed parties to come to consensus on data models for any use case. On Ceramic, data formats and schemas are published openly, where they can easily be discovered by others, and updated over time while maintaining a complete version history. &nbsp;This allows developers to examine the data models for popular applications and data sets, to discover standards being used widely, and to use them or extend them.</p><p>Ceramic offers an open-source approach to data, which can revolutionize how we interact with data on the web.</p>  Tiles v1: A stream browser <p>Tiles aims to provide an interface that makes it easy for developers to discover and make use of collaborative data models on Ceramic. The first version of Tiles is a simple streams explorer which lets users input a streamID to see the content it contains and the schema it uses. Users can inspect the content of a stream as well as the stream type, format, metadata, and history.</p>Using Tiles to examine a recently created Ceramic stream<p>Oaksprout believes that by presenting this information in such a simple and open way, Tiles will inspire developers to explore the possibilities of what Ceramic can enable.</p><blockquote>I think that when people can see what's on the network and the kind of streams that are being created, people will intuit what can be done.</blockquote> Unlocking UIs and customizable experiences <p>The value of discovering and building on shared data models starts with reusable, cross-application data – but to the Tiles team, this is only the beginning. In the future, they believe that a foundation of dependable, shared data models will give birth to user interfaces (UIs) that are much more customizable, dynamic, and flexible. When applications no longer need to define their own data models or spend time worrying about normalizing and integrating with data from other applications, they all can dedicate more time and resources to innovating much more freely on the UI and experience. Says Oaksprout:</p><blockquote>All the [related] data on Web3 will have a very similar structure. That means you can decouple the UI from the data layer and present in any way that you want to.</blockquote><p>For example, an application could be built that renders all Web3 blog posts in audio format since the application would be able to dependably ingest blog posts in text format, interpret the schema, and perform any required transformations (if necessary) before rendering the audio output. Everything would already be there to make this possible.</p><p>While it's difficult to predict exactly how this freedom will be deployed within applications and what innovations will emerge from it, the Tiles team is already seeing mounting evidence that end-users want the ability to program and customize their online experiences more than in the past. As one small example, Oaksprout believes that users' obsession with dark mode is only partly about the actual screen brightness, and equally about a desire to express their preferences in their own tools.</p><blockquote>People are tired of having one point of view, a Silicon Valley aesthetic, forced on them.</blockquote><p>The software of today is built rigidly and leaves very little ability for end-users or third-party applications to customize functionality, modify design, or adapt features to better fit their needs, preferences, and desires. The software of tomorrow will enable far more dynamic experiences by building on consensus-driven data models that lower the cost of standardization and reduce the risk of incompatibilities.</p>  Lenses for rendering data in apps at runtime <p>Currently, Tiles only lets users search and explore data streams on Ceramic. However, soon the product will expand into allowing users to view that data in new ways. For any stream, Tiles will allow users to choose a lens (format/view) through which to render and view that content. After a user selects their lens for a given stream, Tiles will transform the UI and display the content in the desired manner. This is all possible due to public schemas.</p><p>Eventually, Tiles aims to enable the dynamic rendering of data into various formats and UIs using a concept it calls "Lenses," which act as a way to view or transform data streams at runtime into the proper format for a given application.</p><blockquote>Tiles will give UIs the benefit of a very consistent consensus layer around data structures.</blockquote><p>At scale, lenses enable the same data to be leveraged across many different applications and experiences without requiring that all parties come to an explicit consensus on data schemas, or worry too much about maintaining version compatibility. Instead, with lenses, data can be transformed as needed between different versions, schemas, or formats directly inside an application's front-end at runtime. These lenses could be used directly in Tiles to examine data, but also deployed by developers to render data in different ways within their own applications. Oaksprout discusses the possibilities for lenses in this clip:</p>The future of apps with lenses Lens curation <p>As Tiles builds towards this ecosystem of open data models and runtime rendering options, they also envision helping the community curate the most useful lenses. For any given schema, the community could curate which lenses are most valuable and which defaults should be used.</p>Discovering and curating lenses<p>Beyond curating smart, global lens defaults for common data, lenses could also be specifically curated for different use cases, communities, or unique individuals. This combination of curating the best lenses globally and the best lenses for a given moment can make Tiles a key component of Web3's open source information flows.</p>  Tiles: Next Steps <p>Apart from further developing the concept of lenses, Tiles will continue to add functionality to their application as more projects onboard onto Ceramic mainnet and more streams are created. In the near future, the Tiles team aims to explore two additional areas of focus:</p>  Maturing their Ceramic indexing service in order to expose the interdependence and intersection of data that can be found on the network  Developing an open set of streams that can be used as data structure building blocks that will serve as frameworks for content on Ceramic  <p>If any of this piques your interest, please join the <a href="https://discord.gg/zgFSeRyWCb">Tiles project discord</a> and start contributing!</p> <p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Documentation</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

<p>The state of California recently <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">announced their Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record system</a>. It allows Californians to access a digital copy of their vaccine records, rather than having to depend entirely on their physical copy. The main entry point is a QR code containing a rudimentary Verifiable Claim (VC), which makes for great ease of use. However, Blockchain Commons has concerns over how the user experience (UX) design might negatively affect both privacy and security; we are working to address these with our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone, Blockchain Commons’ first Apple appstore release.</p>

<p>
For a while now, increasingly personal information has been getting encoded as QRs. During the pandemic, COVID tests were  often stored as QRs. There has also been extensive use of QR codes to transmit secure information across an airgap. Many people first saw this use of QRs when they read a QR code for a two-factor authentication seed into their phone’s Authenticator app. At Blockchain Commons, we similarly use QR codes as an encoding method to transmit seeds and keys.</p>

<p>Some possible architectural issues arise from using QR codes for confidential data, such as the fact that you’re actually transmitting the data (not a proof of the data), that the QRs tend to contain all of the data (not just a selection), and that there’s no way to rescind a QR or expire it. Those issues will have to be dealt with at a foundational level as we figure out what can safely be encoded as a QR — and more importantly how to offer restricted proofs rather than complete information.</p>

<p>However, there are also security &amp; privacy UX issues related to the storage of QR codes that need to be resolved no matter what is encoded. The state of California itself demonstrated the bad habits that we’re already developing when they said in <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">their official press release</a>: “individuals are encouraged to screenshot the information and save it to their phone files or camera roll”.</p>

<p>Now, storing QRs as photos on a phone does meet some minimal security requirements. Most phones are closely held and protected by  a PIN, a thumbprint, or a faceprint. They’re often backed up to a cloud service and that cloud data is mostly secured as well. Still, there are numerous opportunities for problems.</p>

<p>That’s in large part due to the fact that photos are built to be shared. It’s very easy to send a photo to a friend or a social network, which is great for photos, but less so for your QR codes. In addition, photos are built to be synced. Though your data might be relatively safe if it’s synced to the cloud, it’s not that secure when synced to your desktop computer, which is vulnerable to malware and other attacks.</p>

<p>Photos also aren’t built to be searched and their categorization systems are usually rudimentary. Even if your QR code was safe, you might not be able to easily find it.</p>

<p>
That’s where Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone comes in. Though we can only make sure that our own uses of QR codes are architecturally secure, we can definitely provide better ways to store QR codes, and that’s what QR Tool does.</p>

<p>QR Tool lets you scan any QR code into an encrypted vault. It then protects your code with two-factor authentication: you initilally log in with your Apple login and password, and then anytime you want to view your codes, you additionally must use a biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint. Unlike your semi-porous camera roll, QR Tool was built to keep confidential information secure.</p>

<p>QR Tool also provides proof that your codes weren’t changed. Using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash">Lifehash</a> technology, QR Tool links each code to a unique, evocative, and unchanging graphical color representation. This will prove particularly useful when the Lifehash specification is adopted by other companies, so that you can transfer a QR code between applications and verify immediately that it’s the same — something that’s difficult with the QR code alone.</p>

<p>Finally, QR Tool resolves the problem of categorization by automatically recognizing a wide variety of QR codes and giving you the opportunity to change those categorizations as you see fit.</p>

<p>If the future we hope to see more fully featured <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, but there’s no doubt that QRs are with us for the moment, and we need to make sure that they remain secure and easy to use. This is why we released QR Tool. It’s a reference implementation for the Gordian Principles, demonstrating how to store confidential data in a way that’s independent, private, resilient, and open: QR Tool ensures that you hold your own QRs, that they’re safe, and that you can easily transmit them to other services.</p>

<p>If you’ve got QRs of your own to secure, you can purchase QR Tool from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple Store</a> or you can compile it directly from the source code found at the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>The OpenID Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Financial-grade API (FAPI) OP and RP conformance tests for the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/12/fapi-1-0-part-1-and-part-2-are-now-final-specifications/">Final FAPI&nbsp;1.0 Part 1 and 2&nbsp;specifications announced on March 31, 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Many organizations and jurisdictions utilized the FAPI Implementer’s Draft 2 as the starting point of their adoption of FAPI in defining their open banking solution stacks. To assist these organizations and jurisdictions in transitioning from the FAPI RW Implementers Draft 2 to the FAPI 1 Part 1 and 2&nbsp;final specifications, Joseph Heenan, OpenID Certification Program Technical Lead,&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/FAPI_1.0/changes-between-id2-and-final.md">published a non-normative list of changes document</a>.</p>
<p>This document is a non-normative list of the changes between the second implementer’s draft of FAPI1 part 1 (read only / baseline) and part 2 (read-write / advanced) and the final versions:</p>
 
 
 
 Changes are listed as major if they may require alterations to implementations. 
 Changes are listed as minor if they are generally clarifications and are unlikely to require alterations to existing implementations that were already applying best current practice. 
 Most changes have both client and server clauses that reflect the same change to the protocol; such a change is only listed once below in the interests of brevity.

<p>The newest OASIS Standards are now publicly available for download and implementation.</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standards, approved by the members on 10 June 2021:</p>



<p>STIX Version 2.1<br>OASIS Standard<br>10 June 2021</p>



<p>and</p>



<p>TAXII Version 2.1<br>OASIS Standard<br>10 June 2021</p>



<p>The OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) TC was chartered to define a set of information representations and protocols to address the need to model, analyze, and share cyber threat intelligence. The work was based initially on three specifications contributed by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for development and standardization under the OASIS open standards process: STIX (Structured Threat Information Expression), TAXII (Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information), and CybOX (Cyber Observable Expression).</p>



<p>Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence. STIX enables organizations and tools to share threat intelligence with one another in a way that improves many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.</p>



<p>The TC received 11 Statements of Use from Accenture Security, Anomali, Avast Software s.r.o., CISA, DarkLight, Inc., EclecticIQ B.V., Fujitsu, IBM, New Context, SEKOIA, and Trend Micro.</p>



<p>TAXII is an application layer protocol for the communication of cyber threat information in a simple and scalable manner. it is specifically designed to support the exchange of CTI represented in STIX, but is not limited to STIX.</p>



<p>The TC received 9 Statements of Use from Avast Software s.r.o., Celerium, CISA, Cyware Labs, EclecticIQ B.V., FreeTAXII, Fujitsu, SEKOIA, and Trend Micro.</p>

<p>By Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and Chief Marketing Officer, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication has seen remarkable acceptance over the past few years, thanks in large part to standardization by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the subsequent adoption into leading device platforms and browsers. All told, we estimate over 4 billion devices (inclusive of Windows 10 PCs as well as every modern Apple and Android device) now support FIDO Authentication, as do over <a href="https://caniuse.com/webauthn">88% of web browsers</a>. Couple that addressable market with the ability for developers to write to the public FIDO2 WebAuthn API and you can see why so many enterprises are featuring FIDO support in request for proposals (RFPs) and accelerating related development plans.</p>



<p>However, while FIDO definitely does provide a simpler, stronger approach to user authentication, there is still a need to get users more accustomed to the user experience – and to optimize these flows as much as possible.&nbsp; In short, “if you build it they will come” isn’t always sufficient for paradigm-changing technologies. We’ve heard from more and more relying parties that they would benefit from tips on how to most effectively implement FIDO in a way that resonates with consumers and works across major browsers and platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past five years, the Alliance has conducted research that has consistently found consumers want to use FIDO authentication once they understand what it is and to have common “FIDO-enabled” signals to show where to obtain it. This illustrates the need for FIDO to be introduced to consumers in a user-friendly and consistent way in order for our protocols to be adopted at scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this requirement, FIDO’s Board of Directors last year launched a User Experience (UX) Task Force (UXTF), drawing on world-class UX experts from many of our member companies, including Bank of America, eBay, Facebook, Google, HYPR, IBM, Intuit, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Microsoft, Trusona, Visa, and Wells Fargo. The UXTF was tasked with creating recommendations and best practices for how to deploy FIDO, factoring in utilization of FIDO messaging, logos and other visual cues. We partnered with consulting firm <a href="https://blinkux.com/">Blink UX</a> to conduct the first formal usability research of FIDO user journeys, including registration and authentication steps and various use cases – all feeding into our Desktop Authenticator UX Guidelines.</p>



<p>To complement this effort, we constructed a strawman banking user journey that could be used to test various assumptions and to better examine the authentication steps actually employed by users. With IBM’s assistance, a <a href="https://digitalbank-test.com/">website</a> was created to reflect this use case and was utilized during our testing and analyses.&nbsp; The site will remain live as a reference implementation of our UX Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We divided the typical FIDO journey into a series of four major steps:</p>



  Promote awareness of the availability of various biometric sign-ins, then perform the actual sign-in and determine if a user has a FIDO-eligible device that can be used in the authentication process.  Invite users to register via FIDO, especially if they are using Windows Hello or Apple TouchID.  The actual FIDO registration of the user’s desktop authenticator, along with messages showing success or failure.  Making FIDO the primary sign-in path, and issue appropriate confirmation messages.  



<p>The UX tests were done in three different rounds. First was a qualitative series where we walked participants through a mock-up of the site and test. This allowed us to get feedback on some of our initial messaging and visual assumptions, which fed into the final site design. Next, we ran 100 subjects through independent quantitative testing – where they were assigned and had to complete a mock banking task, which included a prompt to enroll for FIDO login. Our last round of testing were qualitative video interviews, which provided an invaluable human element and insights on the FIDO value proposition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collectively, these tests are what helped define and focus our messaging, logos and various other iconography and logic flows that were useful in developing UX guidelines and other best practices for FIDO implementations.</p>



<p>Our preliminary recommendations from these tests are:</p>



  Use a simple biometric image (such as a fingerprint icon) to trigger the initial user registration, then have FIDO logos at each touchpoint to confirm that a user is following the right sequence of steps.  Make sure developers optimize for each type of environment (operating system and device form factors such as laptop or phone) for each FIDO-capable device. For example, Windows and MacOS have different icons that are used to designate fingerprint usage, as shown in the below screencaps.  



  



  Use one of two suggested messaging styles: we tested and validated one style that is simple and one that is to “add an option.” For example, a simple message might say: “You’re eligible for a simpler sign-in! Learn how you can skip your password the next time you sign in. Register now.” And the optional message might say:&nbsp; “Add an easy and safe way to access your account. Register now.”  Take steps to educate consumers and customer support staff on FIDO. Promote FIDO awareness across multiple touch points and marketing channels such as email and direct postal mail campaigns and social media. This should include information about FIDO-capable device availability and <a href="https://loginwithfido.com/">how to use FIDO on Windows 10 Hello and Apple smartphones.</a>&nbsp; This also will help address potential user reluctance around using biometric sign-ins. Although many users view biometric sign-in as desirable, convenient, and secure, some users initially express hesitancy to share biometric or other computer sign-in information with their bank or with FIDO – and hence need to be educated that their biometrics stay safely on their device.  Have a special “problem resolution” path for those customers who run into problems.  



<p>FIDO Alliance’s ultimate goal is to see as many service providers moving their customers away from password-based authentication as soon as possible – and we hope that these UX guidelines can help accelerate this movement.&nbsp; As this is our first foray into usability guidance we’re also open to and appreciative of <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/UX-Guidelines">feedback</a> from deploying organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>By David Turner, Director of Standards Development, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Today we are announcing enhancements to two of the core FIDO protocols, the Client To Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) v2.1 and WebAuthn Level 2 – which collectively comprise FIDO2. Both are significant advances in extending FIDO’s capabilities specifically for enterprise users and supporting more complex application use cases. These enhancements come at an appropriate time, given the increased demand and rate of adoption for FIDO methods as the pandemic and remote work continues throughout the world.</p>



<p>The FIDO2 WebAuthn protocol is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that describe how to enable authentications inside browser sessions. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Level 2 is the latest version of the standard</a>, which is maintained by the W3C organization and was released in April. This standard makes it easier to write web applications that use FIDO Authentication, which is now supported across the five major endpoint operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, ChromeOS, and iOS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are six major improvements that we are announcing today:</p>



<p>Enterprise attestation</p>



<p>Today’s announcements increase support for enterprise management of devices and users. The CTAP and WebAuthn protocols have added features that make it easier for enterprises to add specific user identity data during the registration process, so corporate administrators can more easily track key distribution and usage. Because these features can reveal some private user information – information that they would have divulged anyway to their employer – this feature is not available directly to consumers’ authenticators. Instead, authenticators must be pre-programmed (before credential registration) with these enterprise attestations by the enterprises themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cross-origin iFrame support</p>



<p>This feature allows web-based ecommerce transactions to be completed within pop-up windows on a browser, something that was forbidden in earlier FIDO versions as a way to protect potential man-in-the-middle and man-in-the-browser attack scenarios. The new standards make a very safe, secure and encrypted way to accomplish these transactions, without revealing data pulled from multiple domains such as the originating vendor, the user’s bank account, a credit card issuer, and so forth. It also helps in situations when users are connecting via bandwidth-limited circumstances (such as via Bluetooth or poor Wifi signals) to keep the authentication workflow moving without a lot of back-and-forth network traffic and latency delays.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Support for Apple Attestations</p>



<p>FIDO Alliance has been pleased to have Apple as a contributing member for the past 18 months.&nbsp;This feature adds support for Apple’s method of doing attestation on their devices using the WebAuthn protocols.</p>



<p>Better biometric management</p>



<p>The CTAP v2.1 additions include better biometric enrollment and management features, so that users can register multiple fingerprints and other bio-markers. Additionally, enterprises can set minimum PIN lengths. As more mobile devices include facial and fingerprint recognition, this keeps FIDO current with the latest authentication technologies.</p>



<p>Large blob support</p>



<p>An alternative to running a centralized authentication service, this feature includes a way to store things like certificates that may be necessary for other authentication scenarios, such as using encrypted SSH connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Resident credential improvements&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now called discoverable credentials, this enables passwordless workflows to re-authenticate a user. The authentication dialog automatically finds and applies an existing credential and asks for user confirmation, thus making FIDO easier to use.</p>



<p>Always Require User Verification</p>



<p>This feature allows a user to protect the credentials on their authenticator with some form of user verification independent of the Relying Party. Platform authenticators and other authenticators with the feature enabled will always perform user verification. Some certification programs such as US FIPS 140-3 prohibit the authenticator performing signing operations without authentication.</p>

 Women in Identity member and Technology Strategist, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-sarnek-4a260321/">Anna Sarnek</a>, shares her thoughts on working in the “new normal” 
<p>Remote and flexible work environments had become a point of interest and the new buzzword before the forced shift during the COVID pandemic. Flexibility gradually gained traction among the tech sector, particularly in the startup culture that started associating flexibility with work-life balance, accrediting it as fundamental to innovation, happier employees and better work culture. While there are companies like Auth0, Bug Crowd and GitHub (now part of Microsoft) that have been fully remote from their founding, perhaps the most notable pre-COVID flexibility came from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-4-day-work-week-boosts-productivity-2019-11">Microsoft’s announcement of a 4-day work week</a> and the productivity increase that the company noted.</p>
<p>For those of us who were office bees, the shift to a fully remote work environment gradually repositioned remote working as the “new normal”. This was further amplified by companies like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlypage/2020/10/09/microsoft-will-let-employees-work-from-home-permanently/?sh=2c245272172a">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/technology/facebook-remote-work-coronavirus.html">Facebook</a> as they announced their intent to allow employees to remain fully remote. Yet I’ve had several conversations with team leaders at a number of these companies over the last 16 months which highlighted that they fully expect their teams to be both home- and office-located. I started scratching my head at this mixed messaging. It seemed misaligned with the corporate message. I realzed that corporate intent does not always translate down to a specific team leader’s intent. This, in turn, led me to ask: “Are you actually ready to be remote?”.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I know that there are specific job functions that flourish from an in-person working environment, particularly in product development where innovation often spins out of coffee chats. I’m also not about to minimize the significance that the office environment brings to company culture – my teams and colleagues were part of what made my own career so enjoyable. I also recognize that my newest friends in the industry are those who I’ve met once in person and who reside in South Africa, California, Texas, and Washington State. What I question is whether organisations may have untapped pools of talent that they are missing by not exploring these remote options. And is there&nbsp; and another layer to diversity and inclusion that we’re not addressing by dismissing the benefit of remote work.</p>
<p>It is no secret that we’ve made strides in closing the gender gap in employment <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/05/10/469739/breadwinning-mothers-continue-u-s-norm/">as women in America have become the breadwinners of the family</a>. It is easy to measure diversity and inclusion through data like headcount, demographic data and income statistics. (Although, I would point out that while US companies gather disability data, disability seems to be an often forgotten criterion in diversity and inclusion.) I wonder whether the next transformative step towards increased diversity and inclusion resides in cementing a work environment where location and commute are no longer a factor. At the end of the day, what makes us unique doesn’t just stop at human characteristics. It extends to our day-to-day environments – often the ones where we can best foster unique ideas and diverse perspectives. It is easy to claim successes in diversity by normalizing the entire employee base, stripping away the fact that environment is a substantial factor. There are unique characteristics as to how each family unit will operate, or how each individual will fit into society. These should be am important consideration when redesigning the “new normal” of workplace management.</p>
<p>At a personal level, I’m not currently constrained by a need to put my family first. Nor do I have a physical or hidden disability that affects my ability to work from an office. But as a partner of someone in the US military, I am all too aware of the tension that exists between juggling career and family life. So I ask you to think, is your team really ready to be remote?</p>
 Why not join the Women in Identity team to develop this theme at our interactive discussion on “Recruiting for Diversity”?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tuesday 29th June at 16:30 BST

<p>One of the most frequent questions we get asked is about the technology choice of Cosmos. Why do you use Cosmos technology ? why didn’t you choose Bitcoin or Ethereum ?</p>
<blockquote><p>The answer is simple : Horizontal scalability.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of computing history there were only a few few computers called Mainframes. &nbsp; The first (Bitcoin) and second generation (Ethereum) blockchains are like Mainframes: a single large computer where everyone shares the same computing resources and writes code with Cobol-like languages. Vertical scalability on these blockchains is limited, and horizontal scalability is impossible.</p>
<p>Vertical Scalability:&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes methods to scale the blockchain itself. Moving away from Proof-of-Work and optimizing its components, Tendermint BFT can reach thousands of transactions per second. The bottleneck factor is the application itself. For example, an application such as a virtual machine (e.g., the Ethereum virtual machine) will impose a much lower limit on transaction throughput than an application where transaction types and state transition functions are directly embedded in it (e.g., standard Cosmos SDK application).</p>
<p>This is one reason why application-specific blockchains make sense.</p>
<p>Horizontal scalability:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if the consensus engine and application are highly optimized, at some point the transaction volume of a single blockchain inevitably hits a wall that it cannot cross. This is the limitation of vertical scaling. To overcome it, the solution is to move to multi-chain architectures. The idea is to have multiple parallel chains running the same application managed by a common set of validators, making blockchains theoretically infinitely scalable. The details of horizontal scalability are quite complex and beyond the scope of this introduction.</p>
<p>We need the Internet. A network of networks where everyone runs their own server. We need the Internet of blockchains.</p>
<p>Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by the same consensus mechanism: <a href="http://www.tendermint.com">Tendermint.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is a Cosmos blockchain?</p>
<p>A Cosmos blockchain is a digital ledger maintained by a set of validators that remains correct even if some validators (less than a third) are malicious. Each validator stores a copy of the ledger on their computer and updates it according to the rules defined by the protocol protocol when they receive transaction blocks.</p>
<p>Cosmos technology makes sure that the ledger is properly replicated, which means that every honest party sees the same version of the ledger at all times. A Cosmos-based blockchain has the ability for actors to share a ledger without having to rely on a central authority.</p>
<p>Achieving 15,000 transactions per second, was one of the goals of commerce.network and the only technology that can do this with 100 validator nodes is Cosmos.</p>
<p>For this reason in 2018 we chose <a href="http://www.cosmos.network">Cosmos.</a></p>

<p>The UK’s Department for International Trade (DIT) is seeking tech companies from Australia and New Zealand who are considering the UK for international expansion. The selected group will join the official hybrid mission to&nbsp;<a href="https://londontechweek.com/">London Tech Week</a>&nbsp;in September 2021.</p>



<p>LTW&nbsp;is Europe’s largest technology festival. The annual event brings together the world’s most inspirational founders, global leaders, senior investors and rising talent. In 2020 the festival was held as a virtual event for the first time, attracting over 20,000 attendees from across the globe. The festival hosted over 700 sessions across 11 days, featuring upwards of 750 leading speakers and innovators.</p>



<p>Australian and Kiwi scale-ups who are considering expansion to the UK can apply to one of the following streams:</p>



  creative technology (AR/VR/MR, gamification, adtech, media, eCommerce, sportstech, marketing tech)  digital health and wellness  edtech  future technology (AI, cyber, blockchain/distributed ledger, IoT, robotics, big data, space)  impact technology (companies making a positive social or environmental impact)  



<p>The successful applicants will be invited to join a pre-mission in-person networking event in early September. They will then participate in a series of virtual evening sessions from 20 to 29 September 2021.</p>



<p>Those selected will join a programme curated for&nbsp;ANZ&nbsp;scale-ups. This will include sessions from key players in the UK tech ecosystem, who will provide exclusive insights on market opportunities and guidance on capital raising, R&amp;D and support to set up.</p>



<p>British Consul General and Deputy Trade Commissioner Asia Pacific (Australia and New Zealand), Louise Cantillon said:</p>



<blockquote><p>The UK tech sector has reached new heights and is the first country in Europe to reach 100 unicorns [tech companies valued at US$1 billion]. This means the UK now has the largest number of tech unicorns in Europe. With a fantastic track record for supporting tech companies and innovation, the UK is the ideal location for Australian and Kiwi tech companies who are ready to expand internationally.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The UK’s Department for International Trade team is delighted to be running this mission again. Despite physical restrictions, this is a great platform for the tech community to come together and for Australian and&nbsp;NZ&nbsp;companies to explore the opportunities the UK market has on offer. Good luck to everyone applying.</p></blockquote>



<p>DIT’s delegation last year was the largest ever from Australia and New Zealand. 130 tech founders and industry representatives joined the mission.</p>



<p>LTW&nbsp;is part of a broader programme of initiatives to increase digital trade and investment opportunities between the UK and&nbsp;ANZ&nbsp;tech sectors. Earlier this year the UK launched the Digital Trade Network (DTN) for Asia Pacific. The network will support UK-ANZ&nbsp;tech collaboration and support UK tech scale-ups in the region.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;LTW&nbsp;application process is open to Australian and New Zealand companies only. Victorian companies need to apply via the Global Victoria application.</p>



<p>Applications to join the mission will close on Friday 30 July 2021.</p>

<p>The latest version of the electronic interchange format for business documents is now an OASIS Standard.</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce the publication of its newest OASIS Standard, approved by the members on 15 June 2021:</p>



<p>Universal Business Language Version 2.3<br>OASIS Standard<br>15 June 2021</p>



<p>Universal Business Language (UBL) is the leading electronic interchange format for business documents. It is designed to operate within a standard business framework such as ISO/IEC 15000 (ebXML) to provide a complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all sizes.</p>



<p>The European Commission has declared UBL officially eligible for referencing in tenders from public administrations, and in 2015 UBL was approved as ISO/IEC 19845:2015.</p>



<p>Specifically, UBL provides:</p>



  A suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business documents.  A library of schemas for reusable data components such as Address, Item, and Payment, the common data elements of everyday business documents.  A set of schemas for common business documents such as Order, Despatch Advice, and Invoice that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation contexts.  



<p>Version 2.3 is a minor revision to v2.2 that preserves backwards compatibility with previous v2.# versions. It adds new document types, bringing the total number of UBL business documents to 91.</p>



<p>The TC received 4 Statements of Use from IBM, ClearView Trade, the Swedish Procurement Agency, and Philip Helger.</p>

<p>How to scale your Blockchain project using the Agile Method</p>
<p>The Agile Method is a particular project management approach that is used in software development. This method helps teams respond to the unpredictability of building software through the use of incremental and iterative work sequences, commonly known as sprints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The general principles of the Agile method</p>
<p>Our top priority is to satisfy the customer by releasing valuable software, right out of the box and continuously.<br>
We embrace changes in requirements, even at advanced stages of development.<br>
Agile processes leverage change for the customer’s competitive advantage.<br>
We frequently deliver working software, ranging from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, preferring short periods.<br>
Clients and developers must work together on a daily basis for the duration of the project.<br>
We base projects on motivated individuals.<br>
We give them the environment and support they need and trust in their ability to get the job done.<br>
A face-to-face conversation is the most efficient and effective way to communicate with and within the team.<br>
Working software is the primary measure of progress. – Agile processes promote sustainable development.<br>
Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to indefinitely maintain a steady pace.<br>
Continued focus on technical excellence and good design enhances agility.<br>
Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential.<br>
The best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams.<br>
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, after which it adjusts and adapts its behavior accordingly.</p>
<p>History of the Agile Method&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the Agile ideas emerged in the 1970s. Studies and reviews were conducted on the Agile Method explaining its birth as a reaction against traditional approaches to project development. In 1970, Dr. William Royce published a paper discussing the management and development of large software systems. The paper outlined his specific ideas about sequential development. Specifically, his presentation stated that a project could be developed like a product on an assembly line: each phase of development had to be completed before the next phase could begin. The idea required that developers had to first put together all the requirements for a project. The next step was to complete its architecture. Code writing followed, and the development sequences continued in increments aimed at closing integral parts of the project. When these steps are completed, there is little or no contact between the specialized groups completing each phase of the project. The pioneers of the Agile Method believed that if developers studied the process, they would find the most logical and useful solution for software development.</p>
<p>Companies that use the Agile Method</p>
<p>Although there is no official list of companies that use the Agile Method for their projects, IBM is one of the companies that openly uses this method to develop software. In fact, many companies adopt it within their development structure, but they are not always open about their choice to use it. According to IBM, the use of the Agile Method generates significant organizational changes. IBM believes that many Agile software development teams will increase their chances of success by collaborating with reliable guidance. That company also helps clients implement their own Agile software development strategies for their projects and provides critical guidance that will help Agile software development teams avoid common pitfalls of adoption, expansion and implementation.</p>

<p>Blockchain Model Canvas (BMC)</p>
<p>Alex Osterwalder in his famous book explains a fantastic method to describe any business idea: the Business Model Canvas. With nine blocks in a grid drawn with a marker on a whiteboard and post-it notes he manages to explain any business in the universe.&nbsp; No wonder that because of the clarity of the information and the ease of use of the Business Model Canvas, Osterwalder was so successful. Next, we created our own model called BMC, more based on Ash Mayura’s work, which is fast, concise and in a single page represents the entire business model of a Blockchain project</p>
<p>What is the Business Model Canvas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a nine-block model called the Blockchain Model Canvas (BMC) (based on the work of Ash Mayura and Alexander Osterwalder) to describe your vision and a method called Lean Startup (based on the work of Eric Ries) to test validity.</p>
<p>The problem and the customers</p>
<p>Having found these first two elements, everything else in the BMC is easier to complete. It is for this reason that it always pays to analyze them together. Writing three main problems for the customer segment you have in mind, describe the three main problems that need to be solved.</p>
<p>The Value Proposition (VP)</p>
<p>At the heart of the BMC is the most important element of the entire model, and incidentally also the hardest to hit on the first shot. The VP must contain why the product is different, and that difference must matter. People who visit a site for the first time spend an average of eight seconds there. The Value Proposition is their first interaction with the product.</p>
<p>The Solution</p>
<p>Now you are ready to tackle the various solution scenarios. Understand that since everything we write about BMC is just an untested hypothesis, it is not advisable to convince yourself that you have found a definitive solution to your customers’ problems. At this stage, it is best to simply sketch out the salient features of the product alongside each problem. Ideally, you should strive to associate a solution to the client’s problem as late as possible, at least after you’ve spoken to the client once…</p>
<p>The Metrics</p>
<p>There are only five key metrics that drive a Blockchain project</p>
<p>Acquisition How users arrive and from what channels they arrive at your service<br>
Activation How users first register with your service<br>
Retention How users come back to your service again and again<br>
Referral How users like your service enough to suggest it to others<br>
Revenue How users buy your service</p>
<p>Channels</p>
<p>How to distribute our Value Proposition to the customer? In addition to defining the right product to build, it’s just as critical to start finding, building and testing a path to your customers from day one. There are a variety of distribution channels: some may be inapplicable in the early stages of your startup, while others may be feasible during the later stages of your startup.</p>
<p>The Relationship</p>
<p>In the first phase, you need to find potential clients (prospects) to talk to. You need to remember that you are looking for people who are suffering from a problem and who, as a result, should be willing to pay to have your solution. How do you find and reach prospects? There is no right answer, no magic formula. It depends on the resources available.</p>
<p>Revenues and Costs</p>
<p>Many companies postpone the “pricing question” because they don’t think their product is ready. Time and time again, you hear the phrase, “how do we charge for an MVP?” MVPs are supposed to solve big problems for the identified customer segment and so, by definition, the MVP must offer enough value to justify the expense.</p>

  <p>According to a recent global study from McKinsey &amp; Company, Covid-19 has accelerated business’ digital initiatives by, on average, seven years.</p>
<p>In acknowledgement of this monumental leap forward, GLEIF has launched several strategic initiatives over the past year designed to broaden the value of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in the fields of digital identity, digitized counterparty verification and their related use-cases. </p>
<p>As Germany celebrates Digital Day on June 18, GLEIF looks back at these milestones and considers what the future holds for the LEI and the global digital economy.  </p>
<p>The Validation Agent: Opening the door to business ID services for legal entities</p>
<p>In September, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-defines-new-validation-agent-role-for-banks-financial-institutions-to-simplify-and-accelerate-client-lifecycle-management">GLEIF introduced a new role into the Global LEI System called the Validation Agent</a>. The role is designed to help financial institutions and other supervised organizations make immediate gains in client lifecycle management and begin to develop innovative business identity services for their clients.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/validation-agents">Validation Agents</a> leverage their know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulated ‘business-as-usual’ onboarding processes to obtain LEIs for their customers. By equipping their business client base with LEIs, Validation Agents can promote financial inclusion and create new value by pioneering revenue generating digital services in corporate identity management and cross-border supply chain relationships. </p>
<p>Validation Agents can also utilize the LEI to accelerate their internal digital transformation, in areas such as customer onboarding, payments and other transactions, and contract signing.</p>
<p>Since its launch at the end of 2020, the Validation Agent framework has gained significant traction around the world. Two significant institutions, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-confirms-j-p-morgan-as-first-validation-agent-in-the-global-lei-system">J.P. Morgan</a> and the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">China Financial Certification Authority (CFCA)</a>, have already completed the qualification process, with many more to follow. </p>
<p>The vLEI: Enabling instant, automated verification of business identity</p>
<p>Until now, the absence of an independent governance authority capable of establishing universal digitized trust between legal entities has presented an industry-wide barrier to innovation. To overcome this obstacle, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-advances-digital-trust-and-identity-for-legal-entities-globally">GLEIF launched a cross-industry development program</a> in 2020 to create a digitally verifiable LEI (vLEI).  When complete, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">the vLEI</a> will extend the Global LEI System to create a fully digitized LEI service that can enable instant and automated identity verification between counterparties operating across all industry sectors, globally. </p>
<p>With GLEIF acting as the ‘root of trust’, the vLEI service creates a cryptographically secure chain of trust that can replace the manual processes required to access and confirm an entity’s LEI data. This will give organizations worldwide the capacity to use their LEI’s non-repudiable identification data relating to their legal status, ownership structure and authorized representatives in a huge number of digital activities, many of them automated, enabling them to participate in the global digital economy for years to come. </p>
<p>As a result, the vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world; it will be the hallmark of authenticity for all legal entities everywhere.</p>
<p>In February 2021, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-unveils-issuance-and-infrastructure-models-for-verifiable-lei">GLEIF unveiled the official issuance and technical infrastructure models</a> which will support the development of the vLEI and now invites software developers to engage with the program’s stakeholders to explore how the vLEI can be leveraged in future applications. </p>
<p>Digital Certificates: Embedding the LEI to uphold trust in the system</p>
<p>As legal entities’ use of digital certificates continues to grow in both number and use-case application, so too does the time and cost required to maintain them. The increasing complexity of this task is already <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/the-lei-the-missing-ingredient-in-digital-certificate-management">undermining the trust system that digital certificates were designed to create</a>. </p>
<p>To address this problem GLEIF has worked closely with the International Standards Organization (ISO) to <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/iso-standardizes-the-process-of-embedding-leis-in-digital-certificates">standardize the process of embedding LEIs into digital certificates</a> at the point of issuance, which will make certificates easier to manage, aggregate and maintain, as well as increasing transparency across the digital identity ecosystem. <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/the-lei-in-digital-certificates">By becoming the common link between digital certificates</a>, the LEI will provide certainty of identity in any online interaction, making it easier for everyone to participate with confidence in the global digital marketplace. </p>
<p>GLEIF is actively engaged with Certification Authorities (CAs) and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) to support and encourage LEI adoption in digital certificates as part of its new CA Stakeholder Group, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-launches-new-stakeholder-group-to-accelerate-the-integration-of-leis-in-digital-certificates">announced in March 2021</a>. This group aims to facilitate the transfer of mutually beneficial information between stakeholders in a joint effort to develop best practice guidelines and case studies for LEI integration. Following this, GLEIF <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-welcomes-pioneering-advances-by-china-financial-certification-authority-cfca-which-pave-the-way-for-increased-lei-usage-in-mass-market-digital-identity-products">welcomed the first commercial demonstration of an LEI embedded within a digital certificate</a> with the launch of the China Financial Certification Authority’s (CFCA) TrustSign® software in March 2021. </p>
<p>LEI Search 2.0: Enriching and automating access to LEI data</p>
<p>GLEIF has also been hard at work to ensure the LEI’s own tools stay ahead of the digitalization curve. </p>
<p>In 2020, in line with its vision to enable broader, automated use of the LEI, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-answers-industry-demand-for-customized-automated-access-to-rich-lei-data-with-lei-search-2-0-and-companion-api">GLEIF completed its migration to LEI Search 2.0</a>, a new LEI search engine with rich data functionality, and published a companion API enabling third-parties to set up fast, customized and automated searches and retrieve open, higher quality LEI data from within their application environments.</p>
<p>By expanding the number of search parameters available, <a href="https://search.gleif.org/#/search/">LEI Search 2.0</a> delivers a new level of transparency over how legal entities have evolved over time, enabling faster and more sophisticated counterparty due diligence, heightened granularity in regulatory oversight procedures and richer reporting potential for market data aggregators. </p>
<p>What’s next? </p>
<p>In the coming months GLEIF will continue working hard to advance these strategic initiatives. </p>
<p>The Validation Agent Framework is maturing and GLEIF’s focus is now on championing the roles benefits and encourage take-up from financial institutions and other supervised organizations around the world. </p>
<p>The vLEI continues to evolve at pace as stakeholders across healthcare, pharmaceutical, telecom, automotive and financial services begin to build out sector-specific applications. </p>
<p>In collaboration with members of the CA Stakeholder Group, GLEIF continues to combat complexity and advance trust and transparency across the digital certificate ecosystem around the world.</p>
<p>The LEI’s legacy is proudly rooted in financial services and regulation. Its future, however, undeniably points beyond to broader, digitized adoption and utilization across public and private sectors around the world. The Global LEI System is the only open, commercially neutral, and regulatory endorsed system capable of establishing digitized trust between all legal entities everywhere. It was established as a public good, and GLEIF remains committed to ensuring that every last drop of value is wrung from the system, and used to the benefit of all.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has given many consumers their first taste of virtual content tied to physical locations, with restaurants around the world replacing menus with QR codes for customers to scan. This trend is accelerating, with augmented reality (AR) and integrated digital/physical experiences becoming more commonplace. But the merging of our physical and digital worlds can't really take off while we rely on QR codes posted everywhere or siloed smartphone apps for each use case.</p><p><a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">Geo Web</a> is creating a set of open protocols to anchor digital content in the physical world on a shared, fair, decentralized network. By using NFTs and a creative system of property rights, Geo Web hopes to create the virtual land layer that can be overlaid on the offline "meatspace" for any use case.</p> Decentralizing ownership of the web's AR platform <p>As augmented reality (AR) technology matures and it becomes easier to layer digital content into physical spaces, a key question becomes "who controls the platform?" &nbsp;With a purely open, unconstrained platform there will be competing content that drowns out high-value data with noise and spam. And with closed, proprietary platforms, one dominant gatekeeper could exert massive power.</p><p>Geo Web co-founder Graven Prest first started thinking about geospatial AR after seeing one such platform in 2014:</p><blockquote>I realized that whoever created that platform would control a global virtual real estate market.</blockquote><p>Unlike with virtual reality (VR) and "other metaverses," with AR it's likely important that we all share a single platform so that we can interact with it together. As Prest puts it, "We have one Earth we all share, and I don't want to be walking down the street and be in a different metaverse than you are. We need to coordinate our collective attention, and the only way we're going to do that is by being fair and legitimate."</p><p>In pursuit of this vision, Geo Web combines decentralized AR content stored on Ceramic with a system of digital property rights tied to physical land which keeps the content of every land parcel productive, while enabling open participation and community ownership of an augmented, shared reality.</p> NFTs for digital land parcels <p>Geo Web accomplishes this by representing each parcel of physical land as an NFT in a <a href="https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/core-contracts">registry smart contract</a>. The owner of that NFT has exclusive rights to control the digital content associated with that parcel of land, which is stored in streams on Ceramic.</p>Claiming a Geo Web land parcel NFT in Times Square with the <a href="https://cadastre.geoweb.eth.link/">Geo Web Cadastre</a><p>The parcel owner can anchor any kind of digital content to that land on the <a href="https://cadastre.geoweb.eth.link/">Geo Web Cadastre</a>. For example, a restaurant can purchase the parcel it resides on and show its menu to guests or today's specials to people walking down the street. Sports teams can purchase parcels near their stadium or in their hometown to show highlights and news. Governments can rent space to display public service announcements (PSAs). Collectors can display their digital art, or museums could add digital information to their physical exhibits.</p><p>Geo Web uses a unique property rights system called <a href="https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/partial-common-ownership">partial common ownership (aka Harberger Taxes)</a> that works as follows:</p>  Parcel owners pay a license fee to the network (similar to a property tax). This fee goes to fund public goods on the network.  The fee is based on the owner's self-assessed value of the land.  At any time, anyone else can purchase the parcel at that self-assessed value.  <p>This ensures fair market pricing over time, and that valuable virtual land is being used productively. If a digital real estate mogul is squatting on valuable property and self-assessing a below-market rate to avoid paying fair fees, this model incentivizes a new virtual property developer to come in and purchase that land to put it to more productive use.</p><p>Each parcel owner can choose how they wish to use their digital airspace, and can change it freely over time. Individual consumers, standalone businesses, or broader efforts like gaming studios or media platforms can all participate on the same network and AR metaverse. This means users don't need to constantly switch applications, but instead can benefit from AR technology on a single easy, fair, and collectively-owned network that resembles the open web. Geo Web can become a shelling point for augmented reality tied to physical geography.</p> Managing dynamic, decentralized content at scale <p>To tie virtual content to specific parcels, Geo Web needed a way to store and manage that content such that:</p>  The content can be anything - from text to digital art to videos  Only the current parcel owner is able to control it  The content can change often at a reasonable cost  <p>Essentially, Geo Web needed a way to manage dynamic, ever-changing IPFS content, with access control permissions limited to the current NFT holder. They considered using an end-to-end smart contract solution for storing the CIDs of static IPFS files, but the team ultimately decided that this model would be prohibitively expensive and cumbersome since it would have required a smart contract interaction for every content update.</p> Ceramic streams for decentralized content storage <p>In their search for the best way to anchor digital content to NFTs, Geo Web discovered Ceramic's mutable data streams. Says Prest:</p><blockquote>Ceramic is the best, easiest way to manage mutable information peer-to-peer</blockquote><p>Ceramic provides a completely trustless way to save and update content that can operate at the scale they needed, without requiring blockchain transactions. In their design, each NFT points to a Ceramic stream where the NFT's owner is the only one able to publish, select, and update the digital content they want displayed for that physical location.</p>A simple Geo Web browsing experience seen as if you were in Antarctica<p>When any user navigates to a parcel's corresponding real-world location, they will be able to see and interact with this content through <a href="https://browse.geoweb.eth.link/">Geo Web's geospatial browser</a> or any other browser that supports the Geo Web protocol.</p> Decentralized identity for personalized experiences <p>Geo Web is also using <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, Ceramic's identity protocol, for user identity. In addition to basic profiles, this lets Geo Web store the keys for all Ceramic streams a user has control over. As Geo Web matures, they will also store settings and preferences with IDX, giving Geo Web the ability to implement user-centric controls, reputation systems, and filters for the content that users prefer or would like to avoid, for a more personalized and fine-tuned user experience. This lets Geo Web stay neutral and open at the base protocol layer while enabling each user to create their own customized experience.</p> DID:NFT for NFT-based access control <p>In the future, Geo Web plans to add <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-94/CIP-94.md">DID:NFT</a> - a standard that turns any NFT into a decentralized identity (DID) that can control content on Ceramic - to give the current owner of each land parcel exclusive access to update the Ceramic stream that contains the parcel's entire content history.</p><blockquote>With DID:NFT, because the content that is anchored to a Geo Web parcel can actually be owned by the parcel itself, when someone buys the land they're also getting the infrastructure that's been built up on that land.</blockquote><p>Without DID:NFT, each time a parcel is sold a new stream must be created. This means that every ownership transfer wipes the previous content from the land. However, tying content ownership and rights directly to the land NFT opens up new and exciting use cases – both for Geo Web's property model, but also for NFT use cases in general.</p><p>Geo Web envisions an ecosystem of "digital real-estate developers" building infrastructure, tooling, applications, and marketplaces around NFT land parcels. We may see virtual fixer-uppers and physics-defying architecture in the AR metaverse before too long.</p> What's next for Geo Web? <p>Geo Web is actively researching and testing Ethereum L2 roll-up solutions for a mainnet fair launch later this year. The team will also be adding to the network's open publishing and browsing infrastructure, including integrating DID:NFT and releasing native browser apps for more immersive augmented reality experiences. If you want to support their open source work, Geo Web has <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/1403/the-geo-web">a grant active in Gitcoin's GR10</a>. </p><p>If you're a digital artist, app developer, or Web 3.0 enthusiast interested in learning more about the Geo Web, get in touch with the team in their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/reXgPru7ck">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/thegeoweb">@thegeoweb</a> on Twitter, or through the <a href="https://www.geoweb.network/">project website</a>.</p> <p>Thanks to 0xElle for contributing to this article.</p><p><a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic website</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/ceramicnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="http://chat.ceramic.network">Discord</a> | <a href="http://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic">GitHub</a> | <a href="http://developers.ceramic.network">Docs</a> |<a href="https://forum.avax.network/"> </a><a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">Blog</a> | <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX Identity</a></p>

The DeFi application will be built on the open-source Energy Web tech stack and enable investors to provide microloans that support clean energy deployment.</p><p>In 2019, an estimated <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/sdg7-data-and-projections/access-to-electricity">580 million people</a> in sub-Saharan Africa remained off grid and in the dark, accounting for three-quarters of the global population without electricity access. After years of steady declines since 2013, that number has risen in 2020 due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Thus rapid deployment of solar home systems (SHSs) and clean energy mini-grids is a crucial humanitarian cause that supports health, quality of life, and economic growth in off-grid regions of the subcontinent.</p><p>ENGIE Energy Access integrates and unites ENGIE’s solar home system companies, Fenix International and ENGIE Mobisol, as well as its mini-grids provider, ENGIE PowerCorner, under one entity and one name. “To date, ENGIE Energy Access has served over 1 million customers and 6 million people in 9 countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The new DeFi platform in partnership with Energy Web will help ENGIE Energy Access deploy more solar faster, by directly tackling a key challenge: access to low-cost financing,” commented Gillian-Alexandre Huart, CEO of ENGIE Energy&nbsp;access.”</p><p>“We’re excited to bring crypto-based decentralized finance to rural electrification in Africa,” said Stefan Zelazny, Head of Software and IT at ENGIE Energy Access and previously CIO at ENGIE Mobisol. “We believe this can accelerate much-needed clean energy deployment throughout the region by connecting impact-oriented investors with unbanked rural customers. Combining the technology that remotely connects and controls our Solar-Home-Systems with the Energy Web Chain will result in the first smart asset-backed NFT where asset use can be controlled via the&nbsp;chain.”</p><p>The first phase of this initiative will focus on integrating the Energy Web software tech stack with ENGIE’s platform to further promote rural electrification in Africa. The crowdfunding platform to be developed by Energy Web will allow micro-investors to finance the installation of clean energy assets by staking Energy Web Tokens (EWT), the native token of the Energy Web Chain, in exchange for a fixed interest rate. This setup will unlock capital from the global cryptocurrency market, bringing a significant new source of capital to clean energy deployment in Africa. To help mitigate the risk for everybody involved, the Community Fund of Energy Web will back this first phase of the platform. Giving people in Africa access to new green electricity solutions utilizing the Energy Web DOS is a great first use case for the Community Fund.</p><p>In the second phase, Energy Web will work together with ENGIE Energy Access to give a unique decentralized identifier (DID) to each one of the home appliances and rooftop solar deployed by ENGIE. This way, one can directly add credits to the appliances owned by locals to support their access to electricity and its services.</p><p>“Creating positive impact in people’s lives is one of our core principles at Energy Web. But the global energy transition must also reach those who don’t yet have access to electricity,” explained Energy Web’s Walter Kok. “We are happy that ENGIE — one of the biggest energy players in the world and one of the founding members of the Energy Web Chain — has embraced the Energy Web technology stack to support such an important mission.”</p><p>About ENGIE Energy Access<br>ENGIE Energy Access is the leading Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGo) and mini-grids solutions provider in Africa, with a mission to deliver affordable, reliable and sustainable energy solutions and life-changing services with exceptional customer experience. The company is a result of the integration of Fenix International, ENGIE Mobisol and ENGIE PowerCorner; and develops innovative, off-grid solar solutions for homes, public services and businesses, enabling customers and distribution partners access to clean, affordable energy. The PAYGo solar home systems are financed through affordable installments from $0.14 per day and the mini-grids foster economic development by enabling electrical productive use and triggering business opportunities for entrepreneurs in rural communities. With over 1,700 employees, operations in nine countries across Africa (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), over 1 million customers and 6 million lives impacted so far, ENGIE Energy Access aims to remain the leading clean energy company, serving millions of customers across Africa by&nbsp;2025.</p><p>For more, please visit<a href="https://engie-energyaccess.com/"> https://engie-energyaccess.com/</a></p><p>Contact&nbsp;: <a href="mailto:stefan.zelazny@engie.com">stefan.zelazny@engie.com</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies.

 Energy Web Names Chief Commercial Officer Jesse Morris as Energy Web CEO, Outgoing CEO Walter Kok will lead Lab.EnergyWeb <p>Zug, Switzerland — 16 June 2021 — Today we’re excited to introduce <a href="https://lab.energyweb.org/">The Lab (Lab.EnergyWeb)</a>, a new R&amp;D initiative housed within Energy Web to build out cutting-edge functionality, services, SDKs, and other enhancements on the Energy Web stack. Initial projects under development within our new Lab unit include a DeFi application for crowdfunding energy-sector projects in emerging economies via Energy Web Tokens, additional staking models on the Energy Web stack, migrating non-energy crypto applications to the Energy Web Chain, and launching the development of Energy Web Chain 2.0. The announcement comes as we celebrate the second anniversary of the launch of the Energy Web Chain later this week. Walter Kok will lead this new initiative whilst he steps down as&nbsp;CEO.</p><p>In tandem, we’re pleased to announce that Jesse Morris, our longtime chief commercial officer, has been named Energy Web’s new CEO. Since our founding in 2017, Morris’ leadership has been fundamental to the growth of Energy Web into the world’s largest ecosystem of energy companies focused on accelerating the energy transition with open source digital technology.</p><p>“This is an exciting moment for Energy Web, as we move into the next phase of the organization’s evolution,” explained Jules Kortenhorst, EW Foundation Council member and CEO of Energy Web co-founder RMI. “Walter came to Energy Web to launch the world’s first public blockchain tailored to the energy sector. Under his leadership the Energy Web community experienced very rapid growth while adoption of the EW tech stack has scaled in a growing list of major projects around the world — especially impressive against the backdrop of a global pandemic. The next era of Energy Web with Jesse’s leadership promises to be just as revolutionary. Jesse has been instrumental to the success of Energy Web since its incubation and together with Walter leading the Lab we will continue to accelerate the energy transition through digital&nbsp;tech.”</p><p>In a similar move of promoting from within, Kok was Energy Web’s chief operating officer before being named its second CEO in August 2019. He came to Energy Web from a 30+ year career spanning ING Bank, Vodafone Global Enterprise, and NEC Corporation and several startups. Prior to joining the co-founding team of Energy Web, Morris was a principal in the electricity practice at RMI, where he partnered with utilities, technology providers, developers, and regulatory stakeholders to help distributed energy resources become an integral, widely-accessible part of the global electricity system.</p><p>“Walter and I have been working closely together for years now and we’re both excited about our new roles and responsibilities,” reflected Morris. “Me taking the reins as CEO will free up Walter to incubate a series of bleeding-edge crypto and digital projects under the new Lab. This move will make it easier for not just Energy Web as an organization but for our entire community to continue innovating well ahead of the energy&nbsp;market.”</p><p>“Coming from major enterprises like ING Bank and Vodafone, it’s been an incredible experience to lead the Energy Web team. There are so many talents at Energy Web and Jesse stepping into the CEO role is a great example of how we develop the new breed of leaders.” added Kok. “We are growing fast around the world, and I’m thrilled to continue informing our strategy as we forge ahead with The Lab. We will kick-off additional bleeding edge projects to demonstrate the level of innovation that is possible with our EW-DOS today. We are going to speed up the pace and will bring other sectors to our carbon-neutral Energy Web Chain too. Acting our way into new thinking”</p><p>Energy Web’s core team has grown rapidly under Kok’s watch — scaling alongside our ambition and work with the global energy and crypto sectors — almost tripling since the EW Chain’s one-year anniversary in 2020.

<p>Over the last couple of weeks I’ve been thinking quite a lot about the concept of the Trust Economy.&nbsp; What is it? And why should we care about it?</p>



<p>My interest was first piqued when I came across two videos on YouTube from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vbPXbm8eTw">Rachel Botsman</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNog-xrc_YA">Philipp Kristian Diekhöner.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trust has always been at the centre of society overall and commerce in particular.&nbsp; There’s a reason why during the first industrial revolution banks always built the most impressive, secure looking buildings in town – so you trusted them to deposit you money there!</p>



<p>Now with the 4th industrial (digital) revolution the old vertical, siloed trust models are breaking down and we are moving to a more horizontal, distributed environment.&nbsp; The decline in trust in the media (fake news) and the lack of trust we are all now feeling with the way big tech is monetising our personal data is creating ever increasing demands from people to significantly improve trust models for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have a strong sense that Aotearoa New Zealand has always projected a reasonably trusted persona globally;&nbsp; good people, good morals, good global citizens etc… and now our Covid-19 response would appear to have bolstered the level of trust people have in us across the planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example of this is the <a href="https://brandirectory.com/globalsoftpower/">Global Soft Power Index</a> which for its 2021 ranking had Aotearoa New Zealand as the fastest improving nation in the Index, claiming 16th place in the ranking (up from 22 last year), citing “perceptions of New Zealand have no doubt been bolstered as nations such as the UK and the US cede their usual place as leaders in public health, with both battling repeated waves of the COVID-19 virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There would now appear to be a real opportunity for us to focus on really enhancing our trust position globally.&nbsp; 100% Pure New Zealand was a really strong brand position.&nbsp; Might something like 100% Trusted New Zealand be a branding idea for our future?</p>



<p>And in the context of the digital economy, digital identity and trust go hand in hand as cornerstones of the Trust Economy.</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>When Energy Web <a href="https://rmi.org/press-release/press-release-energy-web-foundation-launch/">launched in early 2017</a>, we did so with the support of two key cofounders: RMI, a leading global think-and-do tank focused on the energy transition, and Grid Singularity, an award-winning energy blockchain developer.</p><p>Two years later in June 2019 we <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-launches-worlds-first-public-open-source-enterprise-grade-blockchain-3a67fc457341">launched the Energy Web Chain</a> in partnership with a global community of energy companies, grid operators, and other enterprises that had grown into the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-foundation-surpasses-100-affiliates-en-route-to-becoming-largest-energy-blockchain-4823616b1579">world’s largest energy blockchain ecosystem</a>. Within the first year of the EW Chain’s operation, solutions and transactions on the network grew quickly, while the validator network <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-chain-celebrates-tripling-of-validator-network-9cdfd830e044'">more than&nbsp;tripled</a>.</p><p>As we now look ahead to the third year of the Energy Web Chain’s growing prominence in the energy and crypto spaces, the cofounders remain as committed as ever to the Energy Web mission of accelerating the energy transition by unleashing the potential of blockchain and other digital technologies.</p><p>For example, RMI partnered with Energy Web and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) earlier this year to launch the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord</a>.

We recognize that building a successful utility token platform will take time and know that EWF is well on its way to creating a world-changing model that fuses decentralized, low carbon generation with distributed ledgers and computing.”</p> Statement from Grid Singularity <p>“Grid Singularity will continue to strongly support the value created by the Energy Web Foundation and the Energy Web Decentralized Operating System. Grid Singularity intends to use held EWT to scale the development of the Grid Singularity energy exchange for peer-to-peer and community trading, to invest in community applications and to contribute to the next growth stage of EWF 2.0, leveraging Polkadot technology, such as by staking, bonding for parachains, and advancing on-chain governance.”</p><p>Their statements are a testament to their continued trust and investment in the potential of blockchain and other decentralized, digital technology—including the evolving Energy Web tech stack—to accelerate the energy transition.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-cofounders-rmi-and-grid-singularity-reaffirm-their-commitment-to-the-mission-81ef02df81bb">Energy Web Cofounders RMI and Grid Singularity Reaffirm Their Commitment to the Mission</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

     <p>Denver, CO (JUNE 14, 2021) – Bonifii, an industry leader in privacy- and security-enhanced solutions, announces the release of CUFX versions 4.5 and 5.0.  More than just a recent update, the two versions are a milestone in the evolution of CUFX (Credit Union Financial Exchange).  Credit unions can share data between banking systems by leveraging CUFX, the open integration standard designed to make products and services available to their members more quickly, while reducing implementation costs. </p>
<p>CUFX was created by and continues to be a community of thought and technology leaders to advance a financial services ecosystem standard that reduces technical complexity, drives down costs, and improves speed to market.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://bonifii.com/2021/02/credit-union-financial-exchange-cufx-to-be-acquired-by-culedger/">With the acquisition by Bonifii earlier this year</a>, CUFX is a protocol for the exchange of data supported by a systems integration standard that will allow credit unions the ability to increase the speed to become more digital,” says John Ainsworth, president/CEO of Bonifii.  “We’re very pleased these new updates will enable greater security and privacy of information transmitted between credit union systems.”</p>
<p>Key Feature of CUFX Version 4.5</p>
 
 CUFX, Version 4.5, has been published and will expand the capability to accept verified credentials, establish secure connection protocols, and pass decentralized identifiers for verification in the credential group message. These new capabilities will enable CUFX to utilize cutting-edge technologies for superior security in communications, identity, and fraud prevention that will benefit not only credit unions and their members but the providers that service this industry.  
 
<p>Key Features of CUFX Version 5.0</p>
 
 Open API 3 upgrade so that users can now show the override and properly show the examples in Swaggerhub. This will allow architects to pass content in the message body where it is more secure and encrypted.  
 New data elements have been expanded for all account types to ensure their availability and consistent use for all account types—deposits, loans, and investments. 
 For remote deposit, the update improves the organization of data for images and image validation for better results.

<p>Diplomas and Certificates no more falsifiable, thanks to the APP DIPLOMI on blockchain by T.S.C. srl on Commercio.network.</p>
<p>18 students of the Re-Europe training path for young graduates , will receive in Herculaneum their certificates with electronic delivery (eDelivery) on blockchain.</p>
<p>Ercolano, June 14th, 2021 ,</p>
<p>18 students of the Re Europe training path, to enhance the skills necessary to support the management of European and regional funds, will receive their certificates that will be certified on blockchain.</p>
<p>The benefits of using this innovative technology in the school environment and consequently also for the working context are many.</p>
<p>The first is certainly to allow all parties involved, such as students, colleges, universities and companies, to easily and immediately verify if the digital diploma in possession is the original one and does not present alterations from the one produced by the Institute or by the ‘Issuing Body.</p>
<p>Thanks to the solution developed by T.S.C Technology srl and to the use of the blockchain technology of Commercio.network the students will be able to guarantee the authenticity and the integrity of their electronic diplomas and certificates to potential employers all over the world, in a simple and immediate way.</p>
<p>In fact, this innovative solution allows students to generate an electronic diploma or certificate. Each digital document has a unique and unchangeable fingerprint. This fingerprint is recorded in an unchangeable way on the blockchain, through a special transaction called ShareDOC. This transaction certifies the electronic delivery (eDelivery) of the diploma from the Issuing Institution to a student’s personal wallet (ewallet) that can in the future contain all of the student’s educational and biographical information while maintaining the highest degree of privacy currently possible.</p>
<p>The electronic certificate visually looks like a classic paper diploma, where all the identifying information is present: school year, name of the student, name of the school or institution, type of course attended, date and place.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not simply a matter of having a digitized copy of a paper certificate.&nbsp; Due to its decentralized nature, blockchain technology cannot be tampered with, and the certification of graduation remains forever.</p>
<p>The blockchain record contains encrypted information without any personal data, and therefore cannot be directly traced to the student at all.</p>
<p>The adoption of blockchain in schools is already law in Malta and is used on an experimental basis in several prestigious universities abroad such as MIT in Boston, Holberton School in San Francisco and Imperial College in London. In Italy, a few institutions have launched similar initiatives, waiting for the school system to massively adopt these solutions.</p>

		<p>In short, the way to [advancement], if you desire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words: industry and frugality.</p>
<p>–Benjamin Franklin<br>
‘The Way to Wealth” (1758)</p>
<p>Technology investment is regarded by many leaders as the single most strategic investment that institutions of higher learning can make to accelerate their mission and achieve their business strategy in a timely and effective manner. Yet, all too often institution senior leadership bemoan the fact that technology investment continues to increase as a share of annual operational expense while returning little return on that investment. This dilemma begs a few questions. First, why is this the case ? What can/should leadership do to extract maximum value from their escalating technology costs?</p>
<p>Ideally, technology should be an accelerator for higher education, yet many institutions suffer chronically from overpriced and under utilized technology assets.&nbsp; Over time these assets become expenses that do&nbsp; little more than keep the lights on for an institution, constraining IT leaders from emerging as thought leaders in support of the overall institutional mission and vision.&nbsp; The effort required to maintain legacy systems often prevents IT from emerging as a strategic asset that is able to meet the wants and needs of faculty, students, and staff.&nbsp; The unwise investments lead to the law of diminishing returns as these technology investments chip away at the institution’s balance of technology expense versus value.&nbsp; This is evinced annually through the escalating price of licensing and maintenance fees for hardware, software, and technical services which in reality produces very little improvement to automation, workflow, or true cloud hosting and cloud management. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding to key functional officer and executive stakeholder frustration, these same technologies often accrue increasing indirect expenses in the form of time spent by the resident-based functional office and technical office labor resources, namely people, and the good people&nbsp; always seem to bear the brunt of the burden.&nbsp; Shadow IT organizations emerge, that is, functional office staff self-modifying or sometimes by management decree perform more and more duties aligned with that of technical professionals as a result of underutilized technology, slow and poor upgrades and configurations.&nbsp; Shadow IT also emerges because actual IT spend increases the amount of knowledge, skill, and effort required to maintain information systems as opposed to maturing them. This lack of technical professional unity results in haphazard cybersecurity protocols whenever new tools are supplied by functional offices to authenticate behind the firewall, whereas they ought to be demanded by functional offices and supplied by a centralized IT authority, or at a minimum, a decentralized IT community that is centralized on standard operating procedures, practices, and policies through formal and executive sponsored governance.&nbsp; I’m fine with shadow IT, so long as it stands in the shadow of my department.&nbsp; In the worst of these scenarios, and unfortunately all too common, technology is refreshed as an annual budget surprise to the CIO and the CFO because of poor planning in IT management ranks, and the lack of coordination with functional office managers, resulting in sudden death (i.e., premature-obsolescence) of the technology system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The opportunity cost couldn’t be more clear; the same functional and technical staff would best serve each other, the faculty, students, and the institutional mission if they could afford sufficient time to evolve and mature their knowledge, skill, and effort so as to keep up with the latest trends, reduce costs through improved efficiency, and add value through increased output, in other words; accelerate.&nbsp; Some accelerators include, but are not limited to; cabinet leadership enterprise thinking regarding information systems and data governance, reorganizing IT into its various IT reference disciplines (e.g., network, security, cloud, user support, emerging technologies etc.) and empowering its staff to achieve excellence in their specialization.&nbsp; Lackluster and legacy IT departments, staff, and tools cause presidents, CFOs, Deans, faculty, and more, to assert technology as an expensive cost center, as opposed to a valuable investment, to evoke cliches for technology resources and IT leadership such as “the gift that keeps on giving.”</p>
<p>Begs The Question – Savings, Capital, and Technology<br>
Okay Mr. Smart guy, then what’s the silver bullet?&nbsp; Well, none exists, but the application of business and social science to assist information technology/information systems management is an option.&nbsp; Economists in this space have been gathering and synthesizing data into useful information and wisdom for over a century, Nobel prizes have been awarded for theoretical proofs leading to practical benefits and heuristics, and application of these by microeconomic entrepreneurs have evinced their real value.&nbsp; Classical and neoclassical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Ludwig Von Mises asserted institutions would best serve themselves, their constituency, and the overall economy through frugality and savings.&nbsp; Others, such as John Maynard Keynes and new keynesian economists Stanley Fischer and Gregory Mankiw, assert that while this may work for individuals and firms, there may be antithetical results at higher levels of aggregation in economic policy, hence the paradox of thrift. Still, both major schools of economic thought agree that the best microeconomic policy for individual decision makers and collective wills of the institution (the firm), in public, private, and non-profit sectors is one that incorporates frugality in expenses and a strong focus on savings in both purchasing power as well capital planning and services.</p>
<p>Technical Progress<br>
Economist Robert Solow, Nobel Prize winner, Harvard graduate, and professor of technology and growth economics at MIT, discovered something of significance for the world of enterprise as well as key decision makers of public and non-profit institutions that he refers to as the Solow Growth Model.&nbsp; First, he concluded that savings and frugality has a positive impact on growth, but that savings, frugality, and capital planning are subject to the law of diminishing returns just like anything.&nbsp; Second, Solow calculated that about four fifths (⅘ths) of growth in output per worker was attributable to technological progress and entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Technology seems to be more important to institutional economic growth, when acquired and adopted correctly, than savings, frugality, labor, research and development, and natural resources.&nbsp; According to Solow, increasing saving and capital investment, even with aid, isn’t enough to stimulate growth; the adoption of technology is essential.</p>
<p>Finally, entrepreneurship and technology subject matter expertise are in short supply and high demand, especially in our volatile time due to the pandemic.&nbsp; Because of the constant change in technology and business process, exasperated by the recent pandemic, it is of paramount importance that higher education institutions partner for success with the right experts and innovators.&nbsp; Subject matter experts, leaders, and innovators who possess the knowledge, skill, and ability as well the solutions and services to truly add value and accelerate the mission of higher education.&nbsp; Expertise and knowledge alone are not enough. Partners who have deliberately defined, designed, and applied this expertise and knowledge for the benefit of institutions by way of a defined ecosystem of solutions and services are necessary for real value to be rendered.&nbsp; As a non-profit minded organization, given birth by to by a highly esteemed council of university and college presidents, Edge represents the quintessential technology solutions and services organization as it has proven itself to be a maturely formed ecosystem of technology solutions, services, experts, and innovators who have aligned with every aspect of the student lifecycle to render real value to the higher education community.&nbsp; Our approach is an economic advancement one, it is a results based approach that leverages the collective and collaborative power of a fully mature technological economy that is at the ready and forefront always to serve the mission of higher education.</p>

 If we accept the premise that on the Internet “if you’re not paying, you’re the product”, in the Metaverse you will become a walking — talking billboard. The Metaverse, art by the author of this post <a href="https://www.picmonkey.com/legal/tos">under license by PicMonkey</a>. Intro: Video games&nbsp;now <p>Amongst the changes that “lockdowns” and “new normality” have brought, there is a revalorization of digital interactions as valuable and meaningful. Ironically, what was once regarded as isolationist or a poor substitute for “real life” (an expression used as an interchangeable semantic proxy for “in-person”) experiences, has become the glue that holds the social fabric together.</p><p>Connecting in and through digital spaces has been a staple of 2020: from work or formal education moving to online alternatives, to recreational uses of video platforms. In these virtual spaces, human ingenuity has found new testing grounds to deal with the challenges presented by the pandemic. It can be a thoughtful provocation to say that since lockdowns started, we might have been living in a proto-version of the Metaverse.</p><p>The silver lining is an accelerated digital transformation, even for those areas traditionally reluctant to innovate or that deemed remoteness incompatible with organizational culture (like small businesses adopting digital payments as opposed to inveterate cash-only business practices, or governmental bureaucracies offering online alternatives to otherwise mandatory in-person procedures).</p><p>Amidst this burgeoning digital life, video games have experienced an influx of new players, <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/game-engagement-during-covid-pandemic-adds-15-billion-to-global-games-market-revenue-forecast/">growing revenue</a>, and newfound mainstream respect. One year after designating video game addiction as a <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/addictive-behaviours-gaming-disorder">mental health disorder</a>, the OMS has taken a more nuanced position, acknowledging their positive value for socialization.</p><p>Beyond their collective value, in times of uncertainty video games constitute a space to regain some sense of control and security, as well as a place to <a href="https://anormallostphone.com/">exercise empathy</a>. By design, challenges in gaming are presented to the player with the implicit promise that they can be solved with the tools provided beforehand, and the skills gained along the way. Good game design will equip players with prerequisite skills and knowledge to arrive at that stage with a chance of success, and never confront them with a challenge that is impossible to win. With the unspoken pact that there is always -at least- one guaranteed possibility of triumph, losing just becomes a matter of trying but not a failure. With the reassurance of success looming ahead, losing becomes just another moving part of the game, a rehearsal in the path to&nbsp;winning.</p><p>Considering games as a narrative medium that separates itself from others by its interactivity, gaming presents unprecedented potential as a rehearsal space for empathy. When we play, we are able to try a different skin and participate in a story from a privileged insider perspective that no other medium can&nbsp;match.</p><p>Video games are consumed not only by playing but also by communal activities like engaging in watching others play. Streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube are popular amongst youth due to the added value of interpersonal interaction, a sense of belonging, and community building.</p><p>The Metaverse, defined as an encompassing, persistent, virtual world, can be seen as the newest iteration of the Internet, both an evolutionary step and a fusion of social networks and online gaming. As gaming becomes more ubiquitous and social media platforms resort to gamification mechanics to promote interaction between users, the frontiers between these two worlds tend to blur: platforms become games and games take the place of social media spaces. Twitch, which started as a platform to watch other people play games, has evolved into a community-building space where games are also played with the audience, by using overlays and gamified mechanics of interaction.</p><p>Fortnite has been a pioneer in this space, not only with its “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4lJlaP-2HY">Party Royale</a>” mode and providing concerts and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/fortnite-is-screening-an-entire-christopher-nolan-movie-for-free/">movie screenings</a> (separated from the core gameplay but organically integrated as a whole) but also by creating a gaming experience that incentivizes socialization. Gaming platforms have become the new town square, where bonds, friendships, and rivalries are forged over voice&nbsp;chat.</p><p>Besides social aspects of play, in a receding economy for industries related to in-person activities (affected by the pandemic through overstressed supply chains and reduced demand), the video game industry and its ecosystem have been one of the few to increment growth. With changes in consumer behavior driven by stay-at-home routines, it is no surprise that fashion, movies, and other related domains are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gucci-roblox-76339d10f139e9b0d39761bd8426c11e">moving into digital spaces</a> and seeking to create digital doppelgangers of the goods and services they provide in the tangible world. Marketing and advertising are <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/01/the-metaverse-needs-responsible-stewardship-not-greedy-predators/">increasingly interested in the Metaverse</a>, as the next frontier for expanding their brand’s business and targeting prospective new audiences.</p><p>The recent explosion of the NFTs market is a closely related phenomenon, and its rise is partly attributable to their ability to create artificial scarcity. Through maiming their essentially infinitely replicable with near-zero marginal cost attribute, NFTs provide to digital goods the non-fungibility characteristic of analog goods. Decentralized blockchain applications and NFT’s based business models allow the creation of secondary markets for digital goods, providing a foundational economic backbone for the Metaverse.</p><p>Paired with advancements in VR/XR and AR technology, investment and <a href="https://epicgames.com/site/th/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse">funding</a> attracting new <a href="https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/">players</a>, all of these factors converge into creating a critical juncture for the pursuit of the Metaverse.</p> “Metaverse/s” and virtual&nbsp;worlds <p>The term Metaverse is attributed to Neal Stephenson and his book Snow Crash, a novel about a protagonist (actually, a Hiro Protagonist) interacting in a persistent, immersive, shared, virtual&nbsp;world.</p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/30455994@N03/4955876395">“Neal Stephenson — Snow Crash”</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/30455994@N03">RA.AZ</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>The concept, which both echoes and modifies the idea of “cyberspace,” a term popularized by the 1984 William Gibson novel “Neuromancer,” has been revisited in other sci-fi works like Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Both movie and book portray OASIS (which stands for Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), as a massively multiplayer online simulation accessible via haptic devices, that hosts entertainment, commercial and educative hubs.</p><p>People will participate in these spaces through a digital representation of themselves, as avatars or skins, that could assume any possible shape or form. Restrictions will probably come from the terms of service, community standards or policies, intellectual property infringements, or licensing requirements.</p><p>The Metaverse is different from virtual worlds in the sense that it aspires to contain all or several of these virtual worlds, or at least, to create interoperable gateways to connect them, functioning as an all-encompassing, unified portal and hub. That poses an interesting tension between the pretended decentralization where blockchain advocates see an intersection with the Metaverse, against its own monopolistic proposition. One friction that only can be solved by creating a pipeline of true interoperability, both technical and legal, that enables the flow and uniform treatment of data (by uniform data protection laws) and content (likewise, for intellectual property regulations).</p><p>The architecture of the Metaverse can be fragmented into several attributes that should be checked by those aspiring candidates:</p>  ubiquity: the Metaverse will need to encompass different aspects of human experience, from leisure to education, finances, political expression, etc. <a href="https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/cybersex-second-life/Content?oid=80223585">Adult clubs</a> have a prominent role in Second&nbsp;Life.  synchronicity; with events happening in real-time or a shared time-scale  interconnection: allowing the transition between several virtual worlds (relevant questions here will be about the portability of digital goods from one world to another, and if they will remain functional)  persistent, implying that events will take place at its pace no matter whether the person remains or not logged; and that they can`t probably be reset or modified (as in loading a saved&nbsp;game)  virtual/ immersive; being a digital representation that sets the Metaverse apart from AR interfaces that add layers of extended meanings and content to the physical&nbsp;world.  collective and shared; as in virtual worlds populated by other beings ( question remains if human,<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8410872"> artificial,</a> or&nbsp;both)  <p>Necessarily, it should provide a self-representation construct (in the form of skins, avatars, or any sort of digital manifestation able to interact within the virtual world), and arguably, building tools that enable creative outlets for the expansion of these worlds through a <a href="https://blog.siggraph.org/2019/10/siggraph-spotlight-episode-30-tim-sweeney-and-the-metaverse.html/">creator-centric </a>approach.</p><p>Questions remain on how those spaces will be adjudicated and governed. The answers to that will shape further attributes, such as: openness, decentralization, portability, artificial scarcity, and interoperability (allowing to interface with other applications, not just to create with the building tools provided as in user-generated content).</p><p>The core idea behind the Metaverse proposition is to create an immersive digital place that duplicates reality without physical constraints. Nevertheless, that doesn’t necessarily imply that real-world rules don’t apply in the Metaverse. Paraphrasing an iconic Morpheus quote from The Matrix, “some rules can be bent, others can be broken”, and even when the laws of physics may not apply, that most certainly won’t be the case of intellectual property rules and other regulatory frameworks. Governance challenges arise in similar ways to those already existing around the Internet, only to be enhanced by the invasive and intimate nature of this immersive technology with sensors and devices connected close to the body and extracting biometric sensitive data, -like eye-tracking devices-, that is ripe for abuse. Digital wellbeing and the <a href="https://vhil.stanford.edu/mm/2013/fox-chb-sexualized-virtual-selves.pdf">effects of virtual embodiment representations</a> should be carefully considered.</p>The Matrix, one of the cornerstones of simulation narratives.<p>Adding to that, the fact that it will be a privatized playground, with the potential to construct inferences by statistical mining; and the use of generative artificial intelligence paired with biometric data raises high privacy and self-determination concerns, in an ecosystem that could further lead to reinforcing tech- solipsism tendencies.</p><p>Even with strong contenders like <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/680139/minecraft-active-players-worldwide/">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox</a>, or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/04/17/fortnite-metaverse-new-internet/">Fortnite</a>, that already have a huge player base and infrastructure to become aspiring Metaverses, the fact remains that there is still none that can claim the title. In the meanwhile, digital rights communities, academics, and policymakers should remain vigilant, and engage in this brave, new, virtual&nbsp;world.</p><p>(Note: This article is an excerpt of a forthcoming paper on the Metaverse and its governance).</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/the-metaverse-a-brave-new-virtual-world-2f040cbae7d4">The Metaverse: A brave, new (virtual) world</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Joon Hyuk Lee, APAC Market Development Director, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Welcome to the Challenge</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance is pleased to announce our first global FIDO Developer Challenge, where participating developer teams will create and demonstrate compelling and innovative applications leveraging FIDO standards and technologies.  Prior challenges based in&nbsp;Korea over the past two years proved to be very successful and&nbsp; we are now pleased to expand this program globally.</p>



<p>FIDO has come a long way since the Alliance’s inception in 2012, going from a whiteboard concept to a core technology supported by billions of consumer devices worldwide.&nbsp; With over 85% of browsers now supporting FIDO Authentication, now is the time for web developers to ditch password-based logins in favor of FIDO’s approach, which provides a superior user experience and prevents phishing and other computer&nbsp;hacks.  We are looking forward to seeing the selection&nbsp; of implementations the developer community comes up with this year, leveraging the public FIDO2 WebAuthn API to bring FIDO Authentications to websites and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Projects we are looking for&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are looking for projects that address a technical or social challenge in today’s world. There is no limit on the development ideas, but we expect implementation of FIDO Authentication to take place in various fields such as Fintech, eCommerce, IoT, retail, blockchain, gaming and education. Samples from the previous regional challenge include projects like FIDO-based IoT storage services for low-income families, FIDO-based drone platforms, FIDO-based smart home security systems, FIDO- and DID-based smart health insurance card services and a FIDO-based passwordless WiFi router control system. We are happy to expand this year’s program globally to attract even more innovative ideas to solve technical and social challenges.</p>



<p>The process</p>



<p>The FIDO Developer Challenge takes place in a virtual format and focuses on implementation of the FIDO2 WebAuthn API. The Challenge is open to students, individual developers, and pre-seed stage venture companies only.</p>



<p>Our website contains all the details on how to participate in the FIDO Developer Challenge. Here are a few milestones we are looking forward to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  We will be accepting applications until July 9. Upon receiving applications from all over the world, we will do the initial screenings and announce the top 20 teams within two weeks of the application submission deadline.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Then, we will invite 20 teams to implement the FIDO2 WebAuthn API in their inventions, online services or products.  The teams that successfully implement FIDO2 will be invited to the final evaluation step, where they will give an online presentation and demo. They will also&nbsp; participate in a Q&amp;A with our judges.  The judges will select the top three teams, all of which will be featured in a session at our Authenticate conference (Oct 18-20 in Seattle, WA; USA), with the winner being offered the opportunity to attend with all their expenses paid by the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Prizes and opportunities</p>



<p>In addition to exposure at Authenticate, the top three teams will receive prizes from FIDO members, awarded public recognition, and the unique opportunity to share their business vision with panels of early-stage investors. More details can be found on the Challenge website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We encourage you to think outside the box, considering new experiences and benefits that FIDO can bring to users and developers alike. Best of luck to you all. We cannot wait to see your submissions!</p>

<p>Me2B Alliance’s&nbsp;Head of Validation Research,&nbsp;Noreen Whysel,&nbsp;recently presented&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theiaconference.com/session/shedding-light-on-dark-patterns-a-case-study-on-digital-harms/">“Shedding Light on Dark Patterns: A Case Study in Digital Harms,”</a>&nbsp;at the 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theiaconference.com/">Information Architecture Conference</a>.&nbsp;Whysel’s presentation was aimed at the digital creators&nbsp;in attendance. These&nbsp;designers, developers and product managers&nbsp;are responsible for developing&nbsp;technology products, and thus&nbsp;may&nbsp;perpetuate harmful or&nbsp;disrespectful patterns.&nbsp;Social media companies designing addictive apps – on purpose – is an extreme example of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whysel&nbsp;began&nbsp;the talk&nbsp;by&nbsp;describing the&nbsp;Me2B&nbsp;Alliance’s approach to&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/about/principles/">respectful technology behavior</a> and her contribution to our standards development and independent testing work.&nbsp;&nbsp;She then introduced the product integrity framework based on the Me2B Alliance’s Respectful Technology Specification, currently in development. The Specification incorporates routine information architecture heuristics and prioritizes clear communication with users – especially regarding their control over what they do and share, as well as what data may be collected from them. Whysel’s presentation included examples of <a href="https://me2ba.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Marketing/EeYWAV1wqqNNj77iE86ijZUBBPtlpg2uHQwQ22vzDfXSgA?e=uvwcRt">digital harms</a>&nbsp;known as&nbsp;“dark patterns.”&nbsp;She also&nbsp;encouraged the audience to rethink&nbsp;the&nbsp;labels&nbsp;themselves, asking,&nbsp;“is&nbsp;calling it a ‘Dark Pattern’ itself a dark pattern?”&nbsp;—&nbsp;pointing out the <a href="https://exygy.com/blog/racist-language-in-software/">inherent racism</a> of describing negative things as dark.&nbsp;She closed with advice on how to&nbsp;work with&nbsp;digital creators&nbsp;to&nbsp;avoid harmful patterns&nbsp;and&nbsp;create a path toward&nbsp;healthy&nbsp;technology&nbsp;relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>June 10, 2021, Geneva Switzerland: After more than a year of pandemic restrictions, resulting in a greater than 70% decline in travel and tourism activity, health status exchange will enable economies and borders to reopen. On February 9th, 2021, the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC) was launched to build an interoperable bridge blueprint to accommodate varying standards-based health credential formats, driven by disparate governing authorities to serve the complex travel industry.</p><p>To implement a subset of its recommendations, on June 8th, 2021, <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) announced the facilitation of the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN), a network of expert collaborators to facilitate trust building and interoperable exchange of COVID certificates for safe reopening of borders globally by operationalizing the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p><blockquote><p>“The first wave of apps for proving one’s COVID status did not allow that proof to be shown beyond a single state or nation, did not avoid vendor lock-in, and did not distinguish between rich health data and simple passes. The Blueprint gives this industry a way to solve those issues while meeting a high bar for privacy and integrity, and GCCN turns those plans into action.”</p></blockquote><p>Brian Behlendorf, General Manager for Blockchain, Healthcare and Identity at the Linux Foundation</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


&nbsp;<p>Good Health Pass Collaborative (GHPC) Releases Draft Blueprint for Digital Health Passes in Advance of G7 Summit </p><p>[Official GHPC press release <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GHPC-Blueprint-Announcement.pdf">here</a>]</p><p>As a global multi-sector initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes while streamlining the standards development process, GHPC grew from 25 partners to more than 125 companies and organizations from across the health, travel, and technology sectors within weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Initiated by leaders from the <a href="https://id2020.org/overview">ID2020 Alliance</a>, a collaborative effort was launched to produce the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint. The Blueprint addresses – in considerable depth and detail – nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be reached:&nbsp;</p>  <p>Consistent User Experience</p>  <p>Security, Privacy, and Data Protection</p>  <p>Identity Binding</p>  <p>Standard Data Models and Elements</p>  <p>Credential Formats, Signatures, and Protocols&nbsp;</p>  <p>Paper Credentials</p>  <p>Rules Engines</p>  <p>Trust Registries</p>  <p>Governance and Trust Frameworks</p>  <p>The nine drafting groups brought together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors, managed through a partnership with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> – a <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects">Linux Foundation project</a>.</p><p>On June 7th, 2021, GHPC announced the release of their eagerly-anticipated Blueprint in draft form [download <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/download/attachments/76241/GHPC%20Interoperability%20Blueprint_v1.0.0_June%207%202021.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1623073365535&amp;api=v2&amp;download=true">here</a>] for three weeks of stakeholder consultations and public comments. The primary intention of the announcement was to stimulate discussion at the <a href="https://www.g7uk.org/">G7 Summit</a>, which opens on Friday, June 11th, in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p><p>Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council at the Human Colossus Foundation, co-led the Standard Data Models and Elements drafting group, one of the nine interconnected GHPC drafting groups, to spearhead group recommendations on data elements, common models for data exchange, and semantic harmonization. The recommendations of that drafting group will help to enable data interoperability without putting any undue burden on existing health systems and workflows.&nbsp;</p><p>Key recommendations from the Standard Data Models and Elements drafting group include:</p>  <p>Data elements. The drafting group specified standard data elements for three COVID-19 credentials —vaccination, test, and recovery— based on the European Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/policy/network_en">eHealth Network</a> recommendations. The group also defined data elements for a standard travel pass consisting of name, date of birth, and an event-specific status indicator;&nbsp;</p>  <p>A common model for data exchange. To standardize and facilitate the exchange, sharing, and storing of data from multiple sources, the drafting group specified <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/">HL7 FHIR (release 4)</a> as a common data model for COVID-19 credentialing initiatives to promote interoperability between systems that encode healthcare data in different ways.; and</p>  <p>Semantic harmonization. The final group recommendation was <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/cjzegoi58xgpfzwxyrqlroy48dihwz">Overlays Capture Architecture</a> (OCA) as a solution for semantic harmonization between data models and data representation formats, devised explicitly for data object interoperability, acting as a catalyst for standardized credential issuance in multiple languages.</p>  <blockquote><p>“Digital health passes offer our best hope to safely, confidently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy – but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies. The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travellers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</p></blockquote><p>Dakota Gruener, Executive Director, ID2020</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


 <blockquote><p>“To allow international travel to resume safely, we must take every possible step to limit the spread of new Covid-19 variants. We urgently need an internationally-recognised system of health passes so that travellers can quickly and easily prove their health status, in a way that is secure and privacy-preserving. The Good Health Pass Collaborative is doing critical work to develop the standards we need to support this. Now political leaders need to lend their weight to this effort. The G7 group of nations should commit to establish a network of globally interoperable health passes, and set up the necessary working groups to deliver it.”</p></blockquote><p>Tony Blair, Executive Chairman of Tony Blair Institute for Global Change and Former UK Prime Minister</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


&nbsp;<p>Linux Foundation Public Health creates the Global COVID Certificate Network (GCCN) </p><p>[Official LFPH press release <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-creates-the-global-covid-certificate-network-gccn-301307874.html">here</a> | Official LFPH blog post <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/">here</a>]</p><p>To implement a subset of its recommendations, on June 8th, 2021, LFPH announced the launch of GCCN, a network of expert collaborators to provide technical implementation guidance to operationalize the Blueprint. GCCN will include a global directory of trust registries to enable cross-border certificate verification, and be a home for toolkits and community-managed support for those building and managing COVID certificate systems. This next phase of implementation will help governments and public health authorities (PHAs) to build interoperable solutions respecting privacy with the aim to reopen international borders.</p><p>GCCN will implement a technological framework in a bid to enable citizens to move safely and freely across borders during the global COVID pandemic. The defined infrastructure hopes to allow interoperable and trustworthy exchanges of COVID certificates between countries for safe travel.</p><p>To knit together all of the necessary components and gain sufficient momentum behind the launch of GCCN, the network partners have focused on alignment with the EU Member States and other key organizations implementing COVID systems for governments and industry alliances.</p><blockquote><p>“We are interested to learn about how LFPH is taking bold steps in creating the Global COVID Certificate Network in order to facilitate trust building and interoperability for safe borders reopening, since it still seems that there are many challenges and barriers to overcome, for example the need for a European eID agreement. The Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) Panel of the European Parliament (EP) is looking into the challenges that the pandemic has introduced, and also we explore potential technological solutions and their impact based on scientific data, credible sources of information and the respect of the European values. I look forward to the next steps of the LFPH that could provide us with more ideas and insights on strategies that enhance the use of a certificate in a safe way, and also to provide further technical options for the EU that could be adopted and could help and enable our system to work in a harmonised way. As soon as we achieve that, then we could immediately share the methodology to connect with the rest of the world and move to the new normal of our post COVID digital era, always in respect of the European charter for human rights and the regulation for privacy and personal data.”</p></blockquote><p>Eva Kaili, MEP and Chair of the STOA Panel of the European Parliament</p>








  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


&nbsp;<p>In this collaborative effort, <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/">The Human Colossus Foundation</a> brings its expertise in the domain of decentralized semantics. With the aim to help jurisdictional (and sectoral) governance authorities to reopen international borders while respecting citizen privacy rights, we will continue to offer consultancy and implementation guidance on decentralized technologies across the inputs, semantic, and governance domains.</p><blockquote><p>“A key consideration for international travel requirements is to enable the resolution of digital credentials in multiple languages. The Human Colossus Foundation will contribute to the Global COVID Certificate Network in the development of a transformation pipeline to enable semantic harmonization between the recommended HL7 FHIR (release 4) data model for data exchange and the implementation of OCA where linguistic overlays can support multi-language credentialing following the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a> standard."</p></blockquote><p>Paul Knowles, Head of the Advisory Council, Human Colossus Foundation</p>

<p>Blockchain Product Design = Design Thinking + Lean Startup + Agile</p>
<p>Blockchain Product Design is a method that combines three known and respected approaches to addressing each of these stages:</p>
<p>Design Thinking: empathize with users, define and ideate<br>
Lean Startup: turn ideas into business models and test if a market exists<br>
Agile: build and deliver product incrementally and faster through Agile processes.</p>
<p>Design Thinking (Problem/Solution fit)</p>
<p>Design Thinking is an interattive process in which we seek to understand the user’s problem, question assumptions, and redefine problems in order to create new Blockchain-based strategies and solutions. Unlike “Brainstorming”, Design Thinking promotes “Painstorming” to fully understand the user’s “pain” or problem.</p>
<p>The steps of Design Thinking are as follows:</p>
<p>Empathize with users.<br>
Define users’ needs, their problems.<br>
Ideate by questioning assumptions and creating innovative hypotheses.<br>
Develop a Blockchain Proof of Concept (POC) of these solutions.</p>
<p>Design Thinking is a user-centered approach to innovation to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.</p>
<p>Lean Startup (Product/Market fit)</p>
<p>Lean Startup is a methodology for business and product development that aims to shorten product development cycles and quickly discover whether a proposed business model is viable. This is achieved by adopting a combination of business hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.</p>
<p>The steps of Lean Startup are as follows:</p>
<p>Create a business model based on the Blockchain problem and solution.<br>
Test the solution and get feedback from customers.<br>
Move interactively from a POC to the Blockchain. Minimum Viable Product by listening to customer feedback.<br>
Understand if there is a market for this Blockchain Minimum Viable Product by finding paying customers/users.</p>
<p>Globally, 90% of startups fail (Forbes) and the main reason is market failure: “They make products no one wants”(Fortune). The Lean Startup methodology originated in Silicon Valley in the 1990s, but the use of the word “lean” has its roots in Toyota’s lean manufacturing system. Toyota’s lean manufacturing system was used to build things efficiently, but it doesn’t say what should be built.</p>
<p>Using the words of Eric Ries:</p>
<p>“Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and getting the desired product into the hands of customers faster. It is a principled approach to new product development.”</p>
<p>Agile (scale)</p>
<p>Agile is a scalable way of working, based on iterative development, incremental delivery and continuous re-evaluation of a product. Primarily used in software development, it is based on a clear idea of the product concept and its market. Unlike the idea of focusing on a set of features to be developed, Agile focuses on high-value features first.</p>
<p>Agile is about producing tangible, working results after each iteration. According to the twelve principles of the Agile Manifesto, “Working software is the primary measure of progress.”</p>

<p>Thank you to all Corporate members who voted in the new 2021 OpenID Foundation Corporate Member Representative election.</p>
<p>Each year, Corporate members of the OpenID Foundation elect a member to represent them on the board. <a href="https://openid.net/2021/02/09/2021-openid-foundation-board-update/">Ashish Jain was elected by Corporate members during the 2021 elections</a> that were conducted in January 2021. Ashish was at eBay at the time of his nomination and being elected but soon after left eBay and joined Arkose Labs at Chief Product Officer. Arkose Labs then joined the Foundation.</p>
<p>The Foundation’s bylaws Section 5.4(e) provides that&nbsp;vacancies&nbsp;in the Board of Directors “(e)&nbsp;of a corporate director&nbsp;due to the resignation&nbsp;… of such director,&nbsp;shall be filled in an election by the corporate members&nbsp;…”</p>
<p>Per the bylaws, the Foundation conducted a new election with a request for nominations. All Corporate members were eligible to nominate and vote for candidates with Ashish Jain and Dale Olds with VMware nominating themselves for this new election.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to welcome Ashish Jain, Chief Product Officer at Arkose Labs, to the Board as Corporate Member Representative. Ashish served on the Foundation board in the past and has been a contributor over the years.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Dale Olds of VMware, for his continued support of the Foundation and participating in this most recent election. Dale served as the Corporate Member Representative for the last few years and like so many in our community, I appreciate his contributions to the Foundation and the community at large.</p>
<p>I want to thank all Foundation board of directors for their service and contributions to the OpenID Foundation.</p>

 Good Health Pass Collaborative Releases Draft Blueprint for Digital Health Passes in Advance of G7&nbsp;Summit <p>In an effort to restore global travel and restart the global economy, the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> today announced the release of the eagerly-anticipated <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint</a>.</p><p>The Blueprint — released today in draft form for a three-week period of stakeholder consultations and public comment — is intended to stimulate discussion at the G7 Summit, which will open Friday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p><p>This announcement follows on the heels of a May 18 letter, sent by the Good Health Pass Collaborative to G7 leaders, urging them to adopt a statement of principles for digital health passes. The letter also called for the formation of a working group — composed of senior ministerial staff from G7, G20, and European Union health and transport ministries — with the task of reaching an international consensus on standards by July&nbsp;16.</p><p>Unprecedented global collaboration — between governments, nonprofits, universities, and the private sector — propelled the rapid development and distribution of highly effective COVID vaccines. A similar level of collaboration is urgently needed to ensure that verifiable digital health passes for international travel can be issued and universally accepted worldwide by airlines, border control agencies, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>Most governments already require proof of travelers’ COVID status — either through a recent negative test or, increasingly, proof of vaccination– as a precondition of entry. While dozens of solutions have been rushed to market to meet this growing demand, they vary greatly in the extent to which they protect user privacy and security and enable individuals to control access to their personal health information.</p><p>The absence of internationally recognized, consensus-based open standards — to which all solutions adhere — could leave individuals uncertain about the security and privacy of their data and even unsure of whether their health pass will be accepted for&nbsp;travel.</p><blockquote>“Digital health passes offer our best hope to safely, confidently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy — but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies,” said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travelers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</blockquote><p>Restoring international travel is vital to restarting the global economy. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that 61.6 million tourism-related jobs worldwide have been lost as a result of the pandemic. In 2020, travel and tourism contributions to global GDP decreased by 49.1%, a loss of $4.5 trillion (USD), nearly 18 times the impact experienced during the 2009 global financial crisis.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, it would take years to develop standards for digital health&nbsp;passes.</p><p>In February, <a href="http://id2020.org">ID2020</a> launched the Good Health Pass Collaborative, a multi-sector, global initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes and dramatically streamline the standards development process. Within weeks, the Collaborative grew from 25 partners to <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org">more than 125 companies and organizations</a> from across the health, travel, and technology sectors.</p><p>Nine “drafting groups”, bringing together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors were managed through a partnership with the Trust Over IP Foundation the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative and Linux Foundation Public Health — all projects of the Linux Foundation.</p><p>The resulting Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint addresses — in considerable depth and detail — nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be&nbsp;reached:</p>  Design principles  Creating a consistent user experience  Standard data models and&nbsp;elements  Credential formats, signatures, and exchange protocols  Security, privacy, and data protection  Trust registries  Rules engines  Identity binding (ensuring the authenticity of the&nbsp;holder)  Governance  <blockquote>“This draft blueprint is historic, both in its depth and breadth of proposed standards, as well as the number of expert volunteers who contributed their time to its development,’’ said Gruener. “When we partnered with the Trust Over IP Foundation, we committed to an open and inclusive process. Releasing the draft for public comment today takes that commitment a step further. We felt this was incredibly important, given the range of public and private entities expected to play a role in the issuance and acceptance of digital health passes and the need to build public trust and support their adoption.”</blockquote><p>The UK government — in its capacity as president of the G7 — has identified “leading the global recovery from coronavirus, while strengthening our resilience against further pandemic” as the highest policy priority for this 47th G7 Summit. International agreement on principles and standards for digital health passes is critical to achieving this policy priority.</p><p>About ID2020</p><p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonprofits, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting, and portable digital ID solutions.</p><p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual.</p><p><a href="http://www.id2020.org">www.id2020.org</a></p>

<p>In an eﬀort to restore global travel and restart the global economy, the <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative </a>today announced the release of the eagerly-anticipated Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p>
<p>The Blueprint – released today in draft form for a three-week period of stakeholder consultations and public comment – is intended to stimulate discussion at the G7 Summit, which will open Friday in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, UK.</p>
<p>This announcement follows on a May 18 letter, sent by the Good Health Pass Collaborative to G7 leaders, urging them to adopt a statement of principles for digital health passes. The letter also called for the formation of a working group – composed of senior ministerial staﬀ from G7, G20, and European Union health and transport ministries – with the task of reaching international consensus on standards by July 16.</p>
<p>Unprecedented global collaboration – between governments, nonproﬁts, universities, and the private sector – propelled the rapid development and distribution of highly eﬀective COVID vaccines. A similar level of collaboration is urgently needed to ensure that veriﬁable digital health passes for international travel can be issued and universally accepted worldwide by airlines, border control agencies, and others.</p>
<p>Most governments already require proof of travelers’ COVID status – either through a recent negative test or, increasingly, proof of vaccination– as a precondition of entry. While dozens of solutions have been rushed to market to meet this growing demand, they vary greatly in the extent to which they protect user privacy and security and enable individuals to control access to their personal health information.</p>
<p>The absence of internationally recognized, consensus-based open standards – to which all solutions adhere – could leave individuals uncertain about the security and privacy of their data and even unsure of whether their health pass will be accepted for travel.</p>
<p>“Digital health passes oﬀer our best hope to safely, conﬁdently, and promptly restore global travel and restart the global economy – but only if they are widely trusted and adopted by the public and universally accepted by airlines and border control agencies,” said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “The standards proposed in the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint will make it possible for digital health pass systems around the world to be interoperable with one another, thus creating a trusted, convenient, and seamless experience for travelers as well as for airlines, airports, and border control agencies.”</p>

In 2020, travel and tourism contributions to global GDP decreased by 49.1%, a loss of $4.5 trillion (USD), nearly 18 times the impact experienced during the 2009 global ﬁnancial crisis.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, it would take years to develop standards for digital health passes.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020 </a>launched the Good Health Pass Collaborative, a multi-sector, global initiative to establish guiding principles for digital health passes and dramatically streamline the standards development process. Within weeks, the Collaborative grew from 25 partners to <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">more</a> <a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">than 125 companies and organizations </a>from across the health, travel, and technology sectors.</p>
<p>Nine “drafting groups”, bringing together more than 120 experts from the health, travel, and technology sectors were managed through a partnership with the Trust Over IP Foundation the Covid-19 Credentials Initiative and Linux Foundation Public Health – all projects of the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>The resulting Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint addresses – in considerable depth and detail – nine technical and interoperability challenges around which global consensus must be reached:</p>
 
 Design principles 
 Creating a consistent user experience 
 Standard data models and elements 
 Credential formats, signatures, and exchange protocols 
 Security, privacy, and data protection 
 Trust registries 
 Rules engines 
 Identity binding (ensuring the authenticity of the holder) 
 Governance 
 
<p>“This draft blueprint is historic, both in its depth and breadth of proposed standards, as well as the number of expert volunteers who contributed their time to its development,” said Gruener. “When we partnered with the Trust Over IP Foundation, we committed to an open and inclusive process. Releasing the draft for public comment today takes that commitment a step further. We felt this was incredibly important, given the range of public and private entities expected to play a role in the issuance and acceptance of digital health passes and the need to build public trust and support their adoption.”</p>
<p>The UK government – in its capacity as president of the G7 – has identiﬁed “leading the global recovery from coronavirus, while strengthening our resilience against further pandemic” as the highest policy priority for this 47th G7 Summit. International agreement on principles and standards for digital health passes are critical to achieving this policy priority.</p>
<p>About ID2020</p>
<p>ID2020 is a global public-private partnership that harnesses the collective power of nonproﬁts, corporations, and governments to promote the adoption and implementation of user-managed, privacy-protecting and portable digital ID solutions.</p>
<p>By developing and applying rigorous technical standards to certify identity solutions, providing advisory services and implementing pilot programs, and advocating for the ethical implementation of digital ID, ID2020 is strengthening social and economic development globally. Alliance partners are committed to a future in which all of the world’s seven billion people can fully exercise their basic human rights, while ensuring data remains private and in the hands of the individual. <a href="http://www.id2020.org/">www.id2020.org</a></p>

 Wallet Security WG begins its work 
<p>After a long process of finding leadership, hammering out a charter, and defining an optimistic scope, the new transatlantic leadership is hammering out a tentative work plan and scope reductions to line up all the ducks.  Public meetings have begun this week to include the whole working group in this discussion about deliverables and timelines. Stay tuned and register for the <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/wallet-security">mailing list</a>.</p>
 First public meeting of the Cryptography WG approaches 
<p>A younger group with a narrower scope has, in parallel, also been forming around cryptographic primitives and dependency analysis. Leadership has already been selected by consensus and the charter is being fine-tuned-- a charter DocuSign and a scheduling doodle might be ready for interested parties as soon as time of press for the next newsletter. Join the mailing <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/crypto-wg">list</a> in the meantime if specifying cryptographic primitives across different tooling stacks sounds like a priority for your organization.</p>

 New Special Work Item Calls
 
 <a>DID Registration</a> Work Item Call - Wednesdays 1000 ET 
 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver">Universal Resolver</a> Work Item Call - Wednesdays 1300 ET 
 
 
 Persistence and versioning of JSON-LD contexts, and implications on Linked Data Signatures. 
 Data structures and other topics in the CCG's Universal Wallet Interop <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/#Data%20Model">specification</a>.

 <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-registrar">UNIVERSAL REGISTRAR</a> - An Overview
 
 Issue: Onboarding/getting access to a DID registry is usually DID-registry-specific. 
 Proposals:
 
 Consider the most frequent flows:
 
 Redirect to a webpage (authentication or other operations are performed outside the wallet) 
 Authentication via API (some existing Universal Registrar drivers support this) 
 
 
 Proposal should work for most DID methods (e.g., did:web, Sovrin, sidetree). 
 A more detailed compatibility analysis is required. 
 
 
 Outcomes: Proposals will be further analysed and discussed in the Universal Registration call. Issues will be opened in the Universal Registration repository 
 Discussions about:
 
 <a href="https://github.com/gataca-io/gataca-did-method">Gataca's DID method</a>. 
 Historical resolution &amp; different properties/categories of methods WRT historical options.

   Integrated crypto payments and digital marketing services for small businesses is the key platform to grow Scotland's digital economy.

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/tag/blockchain/"></a>A headline theme for building Scotland into a world leading digital nation is the development of it’s ‘cryptocurrency ecosystem’. 
 This refers not only to the adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but also the development of the new ventures and products that build upon it to achieve innovative new business models. 
<p>The basic concept is eloquently explained by Anthony Pompliano.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wigz8z6Vm3U">this discussion</a>, from 9m:50s, he describes a tiered financial system that builds upon gold as the foundation asset at level one, the issuing of cash money based on its value at level two, and then an increasing sophistication of electronic use of money at levels three and above.</p>
<p>He states that the cryptocurrency world is in the process of creating an equivalent system, where Bitcoin functions as the level one asset, aka “digital gold”, and we’ll see a comparable services ecosystem build upon it through layers two and above.</p>
<p>Vendor technologies like <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/introducing-the-hiro-platform">Hiro</a> demonstrate a great example of this effect, providing the tools to build upon this layer with new applications, with major market innovations like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-plans-to-explore-applications-it-can-build-on-top-of-cbdcs">Mastercard planning</a> to build upon CBDCs, like launching like a&nbsp;<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/mastercard-gemini-winklevoss-launch-crypto-bitcoin-rewards-card-digital-summer-2021-4-1030353514">crypto rewards card</a>, a great example of a level three service.</p>
<p>In China they are already active and the competitive repercussions are becoming evident. As the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-chinese-banks-promote-cbdc-over-local-payment-firms-for-shopping-festival">Cointelegraph reports</a> the banks are promoting the CBDC, the ‘digital yuan’, over the incumbent payment providers like Alipay and WeChat Pay. JD.com has started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/jd-pays-staff-digital-yuan/">paying staff</a> in the digital yuan.</p>
 Open Banking 
<p>As we consider the dynamics of building a Scottish crypto ecosystem a key industry trend to factor in is Open Banking. This is a <a href="https://digitalscot.net/open-banking-scotlands-global-opportunity/">global market opportunity</a> for Scotland.</p>
<p>Matthew Enubuje <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-hidden-war-for-fintech-millennials-open-banking-vs-crypto-928a86273f4a">provides a helpful overview</a> of where the two sectors overlap, and the potential for their synergy.</p>
<p>He makes the key point that reflects the insights described by Anthony Pompliano, that where the Blockchain industry has excelled at the level one core digital asset infrastructure, they haven’t been as progressive in terms of developing the higher layer of interconnecting, value adding apps. Open Banking has.</p>
<p>The advantages of crypto over Open Banking are mainly those to do with circumventing the banking system and the technological features of the Blockchain – The decentralized control of assets by users themselves not banks, and the transparent integrity of the transactions.</p>
<p>He describes the opportunity for the crypto industry being to basically expand to the higher levels of the ecosystem introduced in this article, citing examples such as <a href="https://nexo.io/">Nexo</a>, a crypto lending platform with&nbsp;no credit checks and instant credit lines, and where their revenue comes from their 5.9% interest on loans.</p>
<p>This adds equity to their crypto as it can be used to get a loan and by users holding it for long periods, they receive 30% dividends and this offsets the demand to supply ratio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Matthew suggests a few other examples of this ecosystem, such as <a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a>, a crypto company distributing hotspot devices and people earn their crypto when they use it, and the mobile app&nbsp;<a href="https://emma-app.com/">Emma&nbsp;</a>— it lets you connect to your bank accounts and crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>The killer innovation central to both trends is interoperability. Open Banking is achieved through API-based data flow between banks and apps, and for crypto cross-chain integration is the holy grail of its next major phase of evolution. The CoinTelegraph explores this in detail <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-interoperability-evolves-from-blockchain-bridges-to-defi-transfers">here</a>, with major innovations setting out to address the challenge including <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cosmos-set-to-take-lead-in-blockchain-interoperability-with-februarys-stargate-release">Cosmos</a>.</p>
 Building Back Better – Digitizing Scotland’s SMEs 
<p>So in practical terms what does this mean for Scotland, how should we act to exploit their trend and opportunity?</p>
<p>To answer this question we can consider other strategic objectives, with the most notable being to ‘Digitize Scotland’s SMEs’ – To better enable Scotland’s small businesses to make use of technology to grow their business, especially so after the pandemic.</p>
<p>This provides a very practical lens to view the above market insights; in short the ecosystem will be most effective when it produces these types of tools. For example early adopters of crypto payments in Scotland include the Aberdeen <a href="https://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2021/05/04/first-scottish-craft-beer-company-to-accept-cryptocurrency-payments-food-and-drink-news-scotland/">Taproom</a>, an Edinburgh <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/scottish-music-school-now-supports-crypto-payments-for-tuition/">School of Music</a> and a <a href="https://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/business/consumer/falkirk-cafe-among-first-in-scotland-to-accept-cryptocurrency-payments-3192051">Falkirk cafe</a>.</p>
<p>Scotland’s startups making possible this type of service are thus the essential foundation, highlighting ventures like Zumo, who have launched innovations like a <a href="https://www.insider.co.uk/news/edinburgh-fintech-launches-pay-crypto-24090015">virtual payment card</a>.</p>
<p>To the point of this article what’s really key is&nbsp;their <a href="https://developers.zumo.money/">Developers SDK</a>. Accepting payments is just the building block, as highlighted above the real secret sauce for what will be of great value to SMEs is the increasingly sophisticated functionality that builds upon this, in a way that truly supports and enables the growth of their business, such as a loyalty rewards scheme for example. Zumo’s SDK would enable other digital entrepreneurs to create these types of solutions.</p>
<p>With this type of functionality in mind other Scottish startups to highlight include <a href="https://stampede.ai/">Stampede</a>. While not a crypto company they are a great example of a provider of technology to Scottish SMEs, in the hospitality sector, to help them grow their business, via functionality such as a <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/wifi/#portal">Wifi portal</a>, <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/automations/#campaigns">email and SMS marketing</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://stampede.ai/how-it-works/gifting/#gifting">digital gift cards</a>.</p>
<p>Given their type of client would include the Aberdeen Taproom mentioned, the most powerful accelerant of Scotland’s ecosystem is the integration of these capabilities, one that combines crypto payments with these digital marketing services, so that Scotland’s SMEs have access to a one stop shop for easily adopting the full suite.</p>
<p>This is the most effective route to achieving the goal of Scotland becoming a world leading digital nation – Scotland’s SMEs are the backbone of its economy, and empowering them to adopt the latest technologies that can grow their business, via utilizing local Scottish tech startups, creates a rising tide that floats all boats multiplying effect.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The number one topic at the heart of the Scottish Independence debate is what currency would be used. 
 This <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/snp-must-rethink-its-economic-model-independent-scotland/">OpenDemocracy article</a> sets the scene through a critical analysis of the SNP’s Growth Commission plans, being especially harsh of their currency strategy. 
<p>Thought leaders pioneering alternative ideas in Scotland include Tim Rideout, heading up the <a href="https://www.reservebank.scot/">ReserveBank.scot initiative</a>, Common Weal who have published <a href="https://commonweal.scot/policy-library/how-make-currency-practical-guide">this paper</a> on how to make a Scottish currency, <a href="https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2020/12/04/why-is-scotland-still-debating-whether-it-will-need-its-own-currency-when-independent-when-the-answer-is-so-glaringly-obviously-that-it-will/">Richard Murphy</a> and <a href="https://www.modernmoney.scot/">Modern Money Scotland</a>.</p>
<p>See all of them together discussing the topic on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lzxjVs810Y">this panel discussion webinar</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Pioneering the Future of Money 
<p>Rather than this being a weak point for the Independence argument, the smart move is to seize it as the moment for global technology leadership it represents, an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone – One being the need for a currency, the second being the aspiration to become a world leading digital nation.</p>
<p>A key trend to highlight are “CBDCs” –&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency">Central Bank Digital Currencies</a>, the full blown digitization of national currencies, which is the grand prize of this space and given Scotland’s history of pioneering financial innovations including founding banks et al, presents us with a unique window to lead the trend globally.</p>
<p>It’s a behemoth of a worldwide opportunity now taking shape – In the USA former CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/35528/digital-dollar-project-names-advisory-group">set up a not-for-profit</a>&nbsp;called the Digital Dollar Foundation, to pioneer the creation of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC).&nbsp;In his presidency campaign Michael Bloomberg&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-presidential-contender-michael-bloomberg-proposes-clear-regulatory-framework-for-crypto">proposed creating a regulatory framework</a>&nbsp;for cryptocurrencies in a new financial regulation plan.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum says it’s time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/why-its-time-to-take-central-banks-digital-currencies-seriously/">take them seriously</a>, CNBC explores&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/central-banks-lay-out-a-framework-for-digital-currencies.html">what they would look like</a>, the US Federal Reserve published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/central-bank-digital-currency-a-literature-review-20201109.htm">a literature review</a>, the IMF a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2020/11/20/Legal-Aspects-of-Central-Bank-Digital-Currency-Central-Bank-and-Monetary-Law-Considerations-49827">set of considerations</a>&nbsp;for their use and Brookings a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/07/23/design-choices-for-central-bank-digital-currency/">set of design options</a>. The Bank of England offers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2020/central-bank-digital-currency-opportunities-challenges-and-design-discussion-paper">this discussion paper</a>&nbsp;to explore the topic in detail and HSBC comments on them&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hsbc.com/insight/topics/central-banks-develop-digital-currencies">here</a>.</p>
<p>Early pioneers include&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-swiss-snb-currency-digital/swiss-central-bank-says-wholesale-digital-currency-trial-a-success-idUKKBN28D1N5">Switzerland</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ghanas-central-bank-confirms-its-still-looking-to-pilot-a-digital-currency">Ghana</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/marshall-islands-seeks-to-establish-a-self-sovereign-identity-with-new-blockchain-based-currency">Marshall Islands</a>&nbsp;seeking to blaze the trail, and China has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-12-01/in-depth-chinas-digital-currency-ambitions-lead-the-world-101634550.html">ambitions to lead the world</a>&nbsp;in this field.</p>
<p>There are concerns and critics of course. Coin Telegraph writes that they have the&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-have-the-power-to-upend-global-finance">potential to upend global finance</a>, and also that they are&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-digital-currencies-are-dead-in-the-water">dead in the water</a>, and the Economist asks if&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/05/will-central-bank-digital-currencies-break-the-banking-system">they will break the banking system</a>.</p>
 “Programmable Money” 
<p>Furthermore the real magic lies in the concept of ‘Smart Money’ aka Programmable Money.&nbsp;This is not just about the straight digitization of money as we understand it, but an entire transformation of how money ‘works’.</p>
<p>As the term suggests it refers to creating an intrinsic intelligence for money.&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2020/09/16/programmable-money-crypto-tokens">Reporting on IBM</a>&nbsp;being awarded a patent for a “bespoke programmable crypto token,” Cointelegraph explores how specific functionality can be programmed into the behaviour of digital monies.</p>
<p>The LSE explores the idea, asking ‘<a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2020/09/14/do-we-need-programmable-money/">Do we need programmable money</a>?’, where they define it in terms of both Open Banking and crypto:</p>
<p>“In non-crypto fintech, ‘programmable money’ seems to refer to leveraging open banking APIs to build new, automated use-cases over legacy bank payment infrastructure but in our crypto world, the ‘programmable money’ refers to digital cash hosted on a blockchain, where cash can be placed under the control of a smart contract.”</p>
<p>A key standard that could make it possible is ‘DAML’, a programming language for creating Blockchain smart contracts that run across multiple infrastructure options. DigitalAsset is the world’s expert on this and explore the trend in more detail in <a href="https://daml.com/daml-driven/why-daml-is-great-to-represent-digital-currency/">this series of blogs</a>.</p>
<p>Not only does this provide the technology to digitally enable currencies as they behave now, but to make possible a future of Programmable Money, where a variety of behaviours and actions can be coded into the flow of money not possible with physical currency.</p>
<p>A Canadian visionary in this field is Alex Tapscott.&nbsp;Indeed he defines it as the wholesale reinvention of capital, a journey he foresees in his 2016 presentation ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=WnEYakUxsHU">Blockchain is Eating Wall Street</a>‘.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Digital assets are smart and programmable. Let’s say you’re sending money to your kid studying in college. You can now program the money to only work at certain retailers like Walmart and Whole Foods, rather than the Ontario Cannabis Store or LCBO.</p>
<p>By rethinking capital, we can reimagine markets, money and finance. Entire swaths of the financial services industry currently worth trillions of dollars — banking, payments and even money itself — will be questioned, challenged and upended in the years to come.”</p>

<p>Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) welcomes the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, City of Toronto, Deloitte, the Province of Quebec, and VISA as members.</p>



<p>Toronto, June 1, 2021 — Governments and businesses across Canada are embracing the opportunities presented by digital ID to deliver secure, trusted and privacy-enhancing digital services to enable Canadians to transact efficiently and securely online. As Canada’s community of public and private sector digital ID leaders, the DIACC is pleased to welcome the <a href="https://cyber.gc.ca/en/">Canadian Centre for Cyber Security</a>, <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/">City of Toronto</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en.html">Deloitte</a>, the <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/">Province of Quebec</a>, and <a href="https://www.visa.ca/">VISA</a> as members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Today, more than ever before, our communities, our businesses, and our citizens are looking to the leaders within the DIACC to help deliver a robust, secure, trusted digital ID ecosystem that works for all Canadians. Our economy depends on it,” stated David Nikolejsin, Chair of the DIACC Board.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to welcome this new cohort of public and private sector members to the DIACC,” said Joni Brennan, DIACC President. “With over 100 members including the government of Canada, provincial governments, municipal governments, financial institutions, telcos, technology companies, consulting companies, SMEs, academic partners, international organizations, and nonprofits, the DIACC is Canada’s largest and most inclusive community of digital ID leaders.”</p>



<p>“When the DIACC began nearly a decade ago, it was a small group of passionate public and private sector organizations committed to unlocking economic opportunities for Canadian consumers and businesses while protecting and promoting Canadian values and perspectives in the digital economy,” said Eros Spadotto, EVP, Telus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Building on the vision of the founding members, the non-profit DIACC coalition has grown to over 100 private and public sector leaders who are working together towards establishing an interoperable ecosystem that Canadians can use with confidence,” added Robert Devries, Assistant Deputy Minister Platforms, Ontario Digital Service.</p>



<p>In 2020 the DIACC&nbsp; delivered on that vision with the launch of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/2020/09/15/newly-launched-digital-id-framework-to-begin-testing-in-canada/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a>™, a robust, privacy-enhancing trust framework shaped by Canadian values that permits trusted digital identity and provides clear guidelines on digital interoperability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recent research by the DIACC underlines Canadians’ desire for, and expectation of secure, trusted and convenient digital transactions – a desire that has increased as a result of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“From receiving emergency pandemic benefits to ensuring health records are correct and helping children and youth with online education, there are many ways in which a secure digital ID is essential to the functioning of daily life during a pandemic – and beyond,” added CJ Ritchie, CIO of the Government of British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://diacc.ca/2021/02/16/covid-has-accelerated-canadians-demand-for-digital-id/">DIACC research</a>, the majority of Canadians believe it is important for federal and provincial governments to move quickly on enabling digital ID in a safe and secure manner, according to the survey. It also shows that collaboration between governments and the private sector continues to be considered the best approach to create a pan-Canadian digital ID framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the addition of these new members and increasing demand from Canadians, it is clear that there is no better time for governments and businesses to invest in making digital ID a national public policy priority.</p>



<p>ABOUT THE DIACC</p>



<p>The DIACC is a non-profit coalition of public and private sector leaders committed to developing a Canadian digital identification and authentication framework to enable Canada’s full and secure participation in the global digital economy. The DIACC was created as a result of the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review and members include representatives from both the federal and provincial levels of government as well as private sector leaders.</p>

<p>As Canada’s economy reopens and talk of requiring vaccination proof heats up, it is essential to remember that security and privacy are paramount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proof of vaccination, sometimes called “vaccine passports,” may provide a tool for accelerating economic recovery, and the validity of these proofs requires a safe and secure relationship to an identity behind it. Solving digital ID challenges with priority&nbsp; in a meaningful way is the most impactful way to empower people, prevent fraud, and privacy breaches as Canadians return to attending school in person, going to concerts, travelling, eating indoors in restaurants and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can no longer wait — it’s time for Canada to take leadership and get serious about solving digital identity or someone else outside of our country will.</p>



<p>As privacy commissioners across Canada have <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2021/nr-c_210519/">said</a>, “Privacy should be front and centre as governments and businesses consider COVID-19 vaccine passports as a tool to help Canadians return to normal life.”</p>



<p>Data minimization must be the standard, where TWO things are essential for a secure and smooth transition to our digital economy:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1) only share the necessary information to prove a user’s identity, and&nbsp;</p>



<p>2) only share the data needed to fulfill the transaction at hand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why, for 10 years, the DIACC has built up the important digital ID sector as the trusted voice for driving the public and private sector development of a Pan-Canadian Trust Framework, industry standards, policy advisory, and proof of concept initiatives that support the establishment and adoption of a fully digital, and privacy-respecting country that benefits Canadians.</p>



<p>Canadians and businesses need clarity and leadership from governments on implementing a safe and secure digital ID so that society and the economy can reopen more safely. A cohesive public and private sector approach&nbsp; is needed. And governments must make solving digital identity, with privacy and security, a stated priority now. Our country cannot afford to address digital identity as siloed and individual projects. Canada needs to take the lead by establishing Canadian principled solutions that will work at home and export our values around the world.</p>



<p>Implementing a digital identity ecosystem now will allow for a more effective transition to secure Canada’s full and beneficial participation in the digital economy, whether it’s introducing digital vaccine proofs, receiving government benefits, updating an immigration status, entering the workforce and more.</p>



<p>As Canada’s trusted voice on digital ID, the DIACC’s 100-plus members from both the private and public sectors have the business, legal, technical and deep real-world experience to continue spearheading the establishment of a digital identity ecosystem that is designed to benefit people.</p>



<p>While technologies for creating digital proofs of identity and vaccination (passports) are here now, residents and businesses need provincial and federal governments to take leadership by establishing clear policy and guidance for usage to ensure that no Canadians are left behind.</p>



<p>If Canadian governments prioritize the establishment&nbsp; of digital ID that works for people, governments, and the economy, then vaccine proofs (passports) and myriad&nbsp; other uses can be implemented with security and privacy embedded by design.</p>



<p>Digital ID is not about surveillance, tracking Canadians’ online activity, or data collection. It’s about empowering Canadians with the choice to safely share their existing credentials (eg: passports, driver’s licenses, health cards, citizenship cards) for digital transactions.</p>



<p>With digital identity done right, a vaccine proof (passport) would allow Canadians to securely prove who they are, verify that they were vaccinated, and have a digital credential to use in any instance that requires it — all in a safe and secure way that does not divulge any other private health record.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our digital future and economic recovery rests on getting digital ID right.</p>



<p>About the Author:</p>



<p>Joni Brennan is the President of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) and builds on 15 plus years of experience in Digital Identity innovations and standards development. She helps DIACC to fulfill its vision of unlocking interoperability of public and private sector capabilities through the establishment of an identity trust framework that will grow Canada’s economy.</p>

 <a href="http://digitalnation.scot"></a>The objective of our <a href="https://digitalscot.net/library/digital-nation/">Digital Nation Action Plan</a> is to identify the individual entrepreneurs visions for how to achieve a world leading Scottish digital nation, and aggregate these into one overall action plan. 
<p>On <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6L5Nf6ipWAAID1hdwOVoc5">The Crypto Standard podcast</a> they interview Nick Jones of <a href="https://www.zumo.money/">Zumo</a>, exploring the details of their exciting venture pioneering a cryptocurrency payments app.</p>
<p>Concluding the interview Jordan highlights how Wyoming is becoming a crypto and blockchain global hub, and asks if Scotland could replicate a similar success.</p>
<p>Nick believes this is entirely doable, given how Scotland is a small, relatively cash rich country with highly educated people, and with many pressing social inequality issues to address could act as an incredible ‘sandbox’ for cultivating innovative applications of the technology that leverage Scotland’s <a href="https://www.zumo.money/blog/how-scotland-liberated-smart-money">deep legacy of financial expertise</a>.</p>
<p>To crystallize a strategy to unify Scotland’s many different initiatives and assets around a single vision of making Scotland the Blockchain Capital of Europe, Nick quantifies the end result through stating key metrics such as having 10 of the top 50 startups, three relevant university courses and a £500m venture fund for supporting the ecosystem.</p>
 “Weak on Blockchain” 
<p>The nature of the challenge is very succinctly captured by Andrew Noble of Par Equity in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/6-investors-and-founders-forecast-hockey-stick-growth-for-edinburghs-startup-scene/">this TechCrunch artlcle</a>. While reporting on the general success of Scotland’s startup scene in his analysis he comments that Scotland is “weak on Blockchain”.</p>
<p>He’s not wrong. Scotland has a handful of great Blockchain startups like Zumo, Siccar and Appii, but to Nick’s point we’re well short of how many there should be, there’s no real funding initiatives to address this and adoption in key ‘big lever’ sectors like Government is non existent.&nbsp;Therefore the essence of our Action Plan should be to address exactly this.</p>
<p>A keystone foundation is regulation and legislation, the right approach could either inhibit innovation or unlock an unparalleled scale of economic growth. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/proposed-legislation-in-germany-could-allow-425b-to-flow-into-crypto-report">Coindesk reports</a>&nbsp;a new German law could theoretically bring as much as €350 billion (~$425 billion) of institutional investment into their cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://billatnapier.medium.com/we-need-a-blockchain-act-for-every-country-7ae10f36b3c4">this blog</a> Bill Buchanan describes how countries should legislate a Blockchain Act, emulating pioneers like <a href="https://www.regierung.li/en/press-releases/212310">Liechtenstein</a>, providing the legal framework to truly achieve a wholly digital nation.</p>
 The Tokenization of Everything 
<p>Legislation is a slow moving process outwith our control, so the second, more important foundation is simply to drive large scale adoption, an effect that can be characterized as “The Tokenization of Everything”.</p>
<p>Despite our claims of living in a digital society the reality is that so much of our economy is still paper-based, from mortgages to opening a bank account requiring the endless shuffling of paper and the centuries old practice of ‘wet’ signatures or what Bill describes as ‘fake digital’, the practice of visually emulating these via tools like Docusign.&nbsp;Instead he defines that:</p>
<p>“We need to move into a world which properly replaces paper, and moves towards crypto-assets and digital signing with private keys.”</p>
<p>The digitization of all documents and processes via the Blockchain would give rise to what Bill describes as ‘The Token Economy’:</p>
<p>“But some countries are now defining the required legal infrastructure around blockchain, and finding ways to integrate into their existing legal frameworks, and also provided increased trust in the new economy — the token economy.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p>“The key requirement is for national regulation infrastructure and which builds on a total anonymous distributed ledger infrastructure, as well as mapping trusted identities into a regulation infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Demonstrating the potential Scotland has to not only adopt but also pioneer this massive trend is local startup <a href="https://digitalscot.net/directory/listing/blockchain-technology-partners/">Blockchain Technology Partners</a>, who specializes in the ‘smart contracts’ that Bill defines as the linchpin to this new digital universe. They also envisage the complete digitization of all facets of our economy, describing ‘<a href="https://interwork.org/towards-the-tokenization-of-everything/">The Tokenization of Everything</a>‘.</p>
<p>As the title suggests this refers to an evolution where every asset with inherent value will eventually be represented by a cryptographic token on a Blockchain.</p>
 Scaling Scotland’s Blockchain Ecosystem 
<p>Nick offers an ideal starting point for a Digital Nation Action Plan – A big audacious ambition and clear metrics for quantifying when it is achieved.</p>
<p>By incorporating the equivalent views from other Scottish tech entrepreneurs we can refine a detailed strategy and set of steps for truly realizing the goal of building a world leading Scottish digital nation.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="http://digitalgovernment.scot"></a>The core principle of Government as a Platform is that a common foundation makes possible multiple different services that share this capability, to avoid reinventing the wheel for repeated functions like authentication and data sharing. 
<p>With these building blocks in place developers are then freed to concentrate on building the apps that more quickly deliver real business value.</p>
 Vaccination Passports 
<p>A great example of the need for this rapid approach is ‘Covid Vaccination Passports’. Clearly there has been a requirement for a quick response to critical public health needs, and one that utilizes existing government systems so that there is a complete integrity of the data produced.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/21/1015353/covid-vaccine-passport-digital-immunity-record/">MIT asks</a> if you will have to carry this on your phone, where it might function like an actual passport, being shown as you arrive at airports, and could also act like a work authorization at your job, or a pass to get into restaurants, bars, and shopping malls.</p>
<p>Highlighting the type of issues that need addressed such as a <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/travelers-using-counterfeit-covid-test-results">booming black market</a> in fake test results that is diminishing trust in printed records and driving demand for cheat-proof digital documents, they define the medical and technology challenges and nature of this opportunity:</p>
<p>“There are a lot of players in the field, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson-health/health-pass-puts-privacy-first/">IBM</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://thecommonsproject.org/">the Commons Project</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">Covid Credentials Initiative</a>. </p>
<p>They’re coming at the problem from different angles but are ultimately chasing the same goal: let people share required information about their health, while protecting other private information. Yet it’s still too early to rely on any of these for a fast and widespread solution.”</p>
<p>Many governments, as well as airlines and other businesses are trialing or in talks to build “health pass” apps, which let users ask participating labs and health systems to send authenticated test results and other data straight to the app, bypassing verification concerns.</p>
 Scotland’s Opportunity – A Digital Healthcare Ecosystem 
<p>To begin zeroing in on the specific opportunity for Scotland, we can first identify the core technology challenge:</p>
<blockquote><p>Connecting any systems across borders means navigating a patchwork of languages, databases, and privacy laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>This highlights the work of Scotland’s <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/about/">NDS team</a>, who are building the ‘<a href="https://digitalscot.net/nes-digital-service-platform/">National Digital Platform</a>‘, the technical architecture which ensures that key things are only done in one way across Scotland such as how people are identified and where clinical data is stored.</p>
<p>As they explain <a href="https://nds.nhs.scot/blog/the-national-clinical-data-store/">here</a>, their National Clinical Data Store (NCDS) is storing vaccinations data and being made accessible to healthcare staff, via their <a href="https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/42708/turas-vaccination-management-tool">VMT app</a>.</p>
<p>“Under the bonnet, the VMT sends copies of the records of immunisations to the&nbsp;NCDS. For those that may be interested, this is achieved using a “FHIR API” based on the&nbsp;<a title="Opens new window" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core">UK FHIR Core</a>&nbsp;Immunisation Profile. A FHIR API is essentially an industry standard way of sharing digital health data.&nbsp;The&nbsp;NCDS can then&nbsp;securely share citizens’ immunisation history records to other services, again using a FHIR API.”</p>
<p>As we’ll explore in the upcoming and future webinars, Scotland’s opportunity is to build upon this core innovation through a collaborating community, a Digital Healthcare Ecosystem, to flesh it out in multiple directions including ways to expand user uptake and to enable new scenarios for how users interact with and update data.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant when we consider the broader context of Scotland’s overall digital agenda. In their just released digital strategy, the Scottish Government describes a key objective of:</p>
<p>“Adopt a common approach to online identity where personal data is controlled by the individual.”</p>
<p>This highlights a couple of key vendor solutions:</p>
 
 Appii – Appii has developed their <a href="https://appii.io/health-passport/">Health Passport</a>, a service that verifies your identify through a selfie photo, is populated through recording your test result at one of their partner sites (eg. Lloyds Pharmacy) and provides a digital certification. 
 Digi.me – Digi.me is a specialist in general data sharing services and have developed a number of apps that build on this capability, including a <a href="https://digi.me/covid19/">Covid-19 solution</a>. 
 
<p>What all of this highlights is the importance of the platform approach. A Covid certification service is just one of the many apps governments need to deploy, and each and every one will feature repeated requirements to verify the identity of users and share data across multiple systems.</p>
<p>Furthermore this should feed an innovation ecosystem, where for example the NDS National Clinical Data Store is a data set securely exposed to third party developers so that they can create new apps that leverage the data in new ways, for scenarios like Covid 19 as just one of many that will be required on an ongoing basis. Vendors like Appii and Digi.me would be ideal for this type of accelerated app innovation.</p>

  <p>By March 31, 2022, the Global LEI System will have implemented three new Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) policies to further increase the level of open, standardized, and high-quality legal entity reference data available to users.</p>
<p>From March 1, 2022, all GLEIF services will accept and display data in new Common Data File (CDF) formats in line with the new policies. Public users of the Global LEI System will therefore need to be able to process data in the new format from this date onwards. The month of March will be used as a transition period during which all LEI issuing organizations will migrate to the new formats and perform testing to ensure smooth operations. During this month, therefore, public users of Global LEI System should prepare to support both formats when performing LEI data analysis. This blog outlines the preparatory steps public users are required to take and provides links to more detailed reference information.</p>
<p>Details of the new policies</p>
<p>The new policies apply to:</p>
 
 Legal Entity Events: Specifies events that alter the entity, the relationship data of a legal entity, or result in the retirement and/or creation of LEIs.  
 Fund Relationships: Introduces three new distinct relationship types that can be collected for funds.  
 General Government Entities: Allows certain legal entities to be classified as Government Entities or International Organizations.  
 
<p>How to prepare for the new policies</p>
<p>The following users must take action to implement the updated file formats to ensure uninterrupted access to LEI data beyond March 1, 2022:</p>
 
 All users of the GLEIF Concatenated files 
 All users of the Golden Copy and Delta files 
 All users who access the content of the Golden Copy files via the GLEIF API 
 
<p>GLEIF has published further technical details, example files and additional documentation specifying the transition steps and the impact on associated data <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/common-data-file-format/upcoming-versions">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additional support</p>
<p>Following March 31, 2022, GLEIF anticipates a period of up to one year before the Global LEI System will be fully populated with information on Legal Entity Events, Fund Relationships and Government Entities. Data is generally collected at the time of new LEI issuance or existing LEI renewal.</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional support ahead of the March 1 deadline, please email GLEIF: <a href="mailto:info@gleif.org">info@gleif.org</a>.</p>

<p>Razia joined the Women in Identity team early in 2021, helping to co-ordinate our sponsorship programme.</p>
<p></p>
 Tell us about your job and what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>My journey originally started with a degree in Cognitive Science and I wanted to incorporate ‘diverse thinking’ in my daily working life. In 2019 I decided to take a step back from corporate life. After a year travelling across the USA and Asia and I took the decision to retrain decided as a life coach.</p>
<p>With my new-found skillset, I learned how to tap into my blind spots, focussing on understanding the difference between means goals and end goals.</p>
<p>I worked hard.</p>
<p>But I spent little time with family and friends.</p>
<p>My work-life balance wasn’t particularly healthy – even though I was accomplishing the goals I had set for myself.</p>
<p>I was not showing up in the best version of myself.</p>
<p>I realised I needed to be a part of something more meaningful. Something that meant I was contributing towards the bigger things in life.</p>
<p>I had given over years of my life in trying to attain fulfilment by having money in my bank account. I could buy what I wanted, had great job titles so I was generally seen as successful. I realised I was pursuing a need to be recognized – for my work on this project or that initiative. These are the values I grew up with; the values I thought I needed in order to be viewed as “successful”.</p>
<p>During my travels, I took time to understand what I really wanted – namely to show up with unique ideas that would really contribute to making a difference – not just having a smart job title. I wanted to travel more and spend genuine, quality, time getting to know my friends and family again. &nbsp;I decided to start connecting with people who have really inspired me and in late 2019 launched my first podcast.</p>
<p>I now work with non-profit organizations that are passionate about making a real difference. I feel like I work within several communities, each one driving change around the diversity and inclusion agenda. It’s why I wanted to get involved with Women in Identity and I joined the volunteer team earlier this year.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>I always worked very hard, putting in the hours, but later in my career I realized that hard work has very little to do with success.</p>
<p>I recognized the importance of learning to slow down. I have worked with FTSE 100 companies to Silicon Valley start-up and – honestly – I now realise how important it is to never stop learning. I have volunteered with many different organizations, simply because it taught me so many things outside my experience.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>To tell myself every day that I have a unique combination of infinite potential and divine possibilities. There is no one else exactly like me so if I don’t show up for myself, I can’t expect others to do so.</p>
<p>The second biggest lesson for me was outgrowing the things I originally wanted and learning the art of “surrender”.&nbsp; I believe we need to have goals but also to keep a sense of what it means to keep learning, keep growing. &nbsp;an entrepreneurial vision. If your business or you fail in a particular role, the real question to ask yourself is: “did I grow?” The jobs I do are simply a means to me achieving my bigger goal: to keep on growing.</p>
 What would be your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>&nbsp;People have been treated badly throughout history due to organizations having policies and practices that have disadvantaged people. I would like our leaders to make self-reflection a fundamental part of management and leadership training.</p>
<p>If organisations within the Identity space want to create environments that are truly free of racism and sexism, they need to look to hire people from different genders, faiths and races, different educational and economic backgrounds. This will help eliminate the stereotyping that we all fall foul of – and stop us building computer programs that perpetuate them.</p>
<p>Many organisations understand that having women in leadership groups increases productivity by 40%. We need to continue this momentum so we can finally stop having to find statistics to justify what should be a no-brainer!</p>
 Why does diversity matter to you? 
<p>Diversity means accepting an individual’s differences, creating a judgement-free environment where EVERYONE is comfortable talking about things, sharing opinions openly. For me, diversity is about having diverse thinking.</p>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? 
<p>I would like to recommend <a href="https://www.vishen.com/">Vishen Lakhiani’s</a> work at Mindvalley. I love listening to his podcast and all the speakers he brings from different backgrounds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reading-wise, I would recommend Rebel Ideas by Matthew Syed. It’s a great read for anyone looking to understand more about diverse thinking.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>&nbsp;Read more, take off the pressure and have fun!</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people who bring out the best in you or inspire you.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that “entrepreneurs don’t confront the world; they create and change the world. When you have real conviction, you have the power, literally, to change the world.’</p>
<p>I now take this with me into every aspect of my life.</p>

Ceramic, the decentralized network for data stream processing, now supports NEA…  NEAR Forumjlwaugh    </a> Blockchain, Data &amp; Identity: a full stack for Web3 developers <p>NEAR Protocol offers developers the most scalable and dev-friendly infrastructure for building decentralized apps and services. Great Web3 and DeFi apps require more than a smart contract platform. They also need sophisticated, scalable and dependable data management infrastructure. Ceramic provides advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. It is also the foundation for <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX</a>, Web3's first cross-chain identity model.</p><p>Now that NEAR and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem   Ceramic now supports NEAR wallets <p>Starting today, developers building applications on NEAR can easily add support for Ceramic and IDX in their application with a seamless user experience. NEAR key pairs have been added as a supported signing and <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains">authentication method</a> for Ceramic's data streams, so users can now perform transactions on Ceramic with their existing NEAR wallets.</p><p>Developers have already begun to combine these two networks to create applications like NEAR Personas:</p> NEAR: Easy to build on &amp; easy to use <p><a href="https://near.org">NEAR Protocol</a> is a Proof-of-Stake, climate-neutral, layer one blockchain protocol and smart contract platform. Developer experience and end-user accessibility are the top priorities for NEAR, all the way down to the protocol level. Developers can use familiar tools, such as Rust or AssemblyScript, to build on NEAR’s WASM-based runtime, and the application build/test/deploy cycle is much faster and simpler than on most networks––with fast finality and very low transaction fees (usually less than one cent).</p><p>NEAR’s unique contract-based account model provides the flexibility to onboard users to an application who either don’t hold NEAR tokens or have never interacted with a blockchain, a process that can take dozens of steps and fiat onramps with most other networks. Human-readable, named account addresses (i.e. ceramic.near) replace long, clunky hex strings and can support multiple names within a single public key. With progressive onboarding, the crypto elements of using decentralized apps on NEAR can be 100% abstracted away from the user and the complexities of gas fees, storage costs, seed phrases, and keys are obscured from their experience until they are ready to claim their wallet and hold their own tokens.</p> Ceramic: Decentralized data streams <p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">Ceramic's unique stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data model. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information. <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables. By making it easy to structure and associate data to user's personal index, IDX lets applications save, discover and route to users' data.</p><p>The IDX SDK makes it simple to manage users and deliver great data-driven experiences using the same NEAR keys and wallets as developers and users are already relying on. Users can also link multiple keys, from any wallet and multiple blockchains, to the same identity. This is essential to developers who want to serve users over time, as it enables key rotation, data interoperability across accounts, and rich cross-chain profiles, reputations and experiences (including 50,000+ profiles on Ethereum today).</p> Getting started with Ceramic on NEAR <p>NEAR is currently hosting an Open Web Community <a href="https://createbase.community/hackathon/">hackathon</a>! There is a prize for integrating Ceramic profiles with a NEAR Sputnik DAO.</p>  To install NEAR, follow their <a href="https://docs.near.org">documentation</a>.  To add IDX to your project, follow this <a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/">installation guide</a>.  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/">installation guide</a>.  Regardless of which option you choose, you should also select 3ID Connect as your DID wallet during the <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/">authentication</a> process which handles the integration with NEAR wallets.

  <p>This blog post summarizes the key highlights of the Digital Immunization Passport (DIP) project. We implemented and evaluated an end-to-end workflow for handling immunization information in a human-centric way, and we provided the necessary infrastructure for all participating stakeholders to demonstrated the functionality in real-world use cases: Yellow Fever and Tick-borne encephalitis vaccination.<br>
The project has received funding from <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">NGI_DAPSI</a> (DAPSI 1st open call), the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 871498.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus of this project is on Data Interoperability &amp; Compatibility through establishing interfaces between health industry and individuals as well as pushing forward on standardized interfaces for data stores. Additionally, we address Data Transparency (Usage Policies and Data Provenance in Semantic Containers) and Security &amp; Privacy (by applying blockchain technology and digital watermarking on data sharing). A key challenge in making institutional data available to individuals is authentication. In this project we demonstrated the use of biometric features to identify individuals and generate a unique identifier that can either be managed as a decentralized identifier (DID) or via a national Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p>
<p>The project team consisted of the partners OwnYourData (OYD) and the Human Colossus Foundation (HCF), who shared conceptual and development work. As a result the following deliverables were made available:</p>

 Rory Torres shares her experience as part of Berkman Klein’s latest global research&nbsp;sprint <p>In an increasingly digital world, our experiences online are shaped by data gathered and wielded to tailor experiences. But what control do users have over that data, where it goes, and how it is&nbsp;used?</p><p>Questions of control over personal data were a cross-cutting theme throughout a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-03/research-sprint-examines-digital-self-determination-increasingly-interconnected-world">Research Sprint</a> co-hosted by the <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu">Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalasiahub.org/">Digital Asia Hub</a>. The Sprint also examined other important dimensions of self-determination in the digitally networked world, for instance, self-expression and participation in civic life and the digital economy, or relationship-building and well-being, to name just a few application areas.</p><p>The three-month program for graduate students focused on digital self-determination spanning a range of geographies, backgrounds, and contexts. The cohort, who came from 21 countries across the globe, convened regularly to participate in critical discussions and create accessible educational resources — including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia page</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Digital_self-determination">Wikiversity Living Syllabus</a> — on the&nbsp;topic.</p>Mary Rhauline “Rory” Torres, Harvard Law LL.M. ’21 was a participant in a recent Research Sprint from the Berkman Klein Center. Courtesy&nbsp;image.<p>One participant, Mary Rhauline “Rory” Torres, Harvard Law LL.M. ’21, joined the sprint from Mangaldan, Pangasinan, in the Philippines. We spoke with Torres about her experience in the program, what she learned, and how it informed her&nbsp;work.</p> What motivated you to join the Research Sprint and explore digital self-determination? <p>I learned about the Research Sprint when Professor <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ugasser">Urs Gasser</a> posted it in his Comparative Digital Privacy course. The call to participate resonated with me because there was a huge surge of new Internet participants in South East Asia when the pandemic hit. That’s 40 million new users of the Internet who are basically opening up their lives to the digital world. It’s an exciting place, but also has threats and harms. Even those of us who have been connected for a while are still scrambling to find our place in the digital space. I thought learning about digital self-determination can help all of us make sense of our role in the Internet as individuals and as a community, and thrive in&nbsp;it.</p> How has your understanding of the concept changed or evolved over the past few&nbsp;months? <p>Prior to the Research Sprint, my understanding of digital self-determination was limited to empowering an individual to participate in a digital environment and being equipped to do so responsibly, much like digital citizenship. I didn’t realize how digital self-determination is a labyrinth until we started to talk about it with related concepts like digital rights, digital colonialism, informational self-determination; to situate it in various contexts like digital health, digital economy, digital information; and to ground it in principles that would realize self-determination, such as trustworthy data spaces. It’s all very interesting and&nbsp;complex!</p> The Research Sprint is interdisciplinary and international by design. What was that experience like working with graduate students around the world to explore digital self-determination? <p>The Sprint is composed of an amazing group of people from all over the world with so many diverse backgrounds. There are students studying psychology, communication, political science, social science, and culture. The diversity of language, culture, and studies makes the task of understanding digital self-determination challenging because we all have different contexts. But there’s also beauty in it because it allows us to find connections, confront ourselves with different, sometimes opposing perspectives, and accept and respect&nbsp;that.</p> Your cohort is coming together to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia entry</a> on digital self-determination. Could you explain the processes behind that task, and what you hope the impact is of the&nbsp;entry? <p>We started with gathering a bibliography of articles that relate to digital self-determination. Building on that bibliography, the group created an outline in a shared Google document. We’ve since then expanded that outline by communicating through Slack, gathered volunteers to write sections that are of interest to them, and some have met through Zoom or smaller chat groups to get feedback, do peer review, and make&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_self-determination">Wikipedia entry</a> is divided into three parts: first, an overview of the history of self-determination in philosophy, psychology, and its legal adaptations, and defining self-determination in the digital sphere; second, identifying practical elements that support the realization of digital self-determination, such as digital infrastructure, equal access, privacy protections; and third, current issues relevant to digital self-determination, including a discussion on regulation and legal frameworks, which I am contributing to.</p><p>Having a Wiki entry on digital self-determination is a big first step to bringing the principle out into the digital space, making it more accessible and understandable, and keeping in mind that the concept is a work in progress.</p> What was the most interesting topic you explored during the&nbsp;program? <p>The session on Information Diet was extremely interesting because it relates so well to our daily lives: living at a place and time where information seems to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. One of the first things I do in the morning is open my phone, read the “recommended stories” of the New York Times on my account, open the Telegram information group on the situation of COVID-19 in the Philippines, check my emails and I’m bombarded by the newsletters that I’ve subscribed to, and then there’s Facebook. There’s just so much information, so there’s this burden of having no excuse not to know about an important issue. And there’s so much disinformation, that filtering out reliable from unreliable content has become so overwhelming.</p><p>So I really loved Professor <a href="https://sarah.genner.cc/">Sarah Genner</a>’s presentation on Information Diet and what it means to be in the driver’s seat in the digital age and not the other way around and having an overview of how to disconnect, do a digital detox, and avoid digital distractions. While studying for my exams, I used the Pomodoro Technique and the amount of studying I was able to clock in was almost cathartic.</p> Was there a particular speaker that stood out to you, or sparked a new interest? <p>I was fascinated by Professor <a href="https://nishantshah.online/">Nishant Shah</a>’s talk on the formation of our identities in the digital age. He provoked a lot of questions on how an individual defines one’s identity through digital artifacts — that one may or may not have created or uploaded for oneself; how digital spaces may constrain our definition of ourselves in and out of cyberspace; and how do we preserve these identities — or do we even want&nbsp;to?</p> You host a blog about parenting. From your perspective, how should adults address digital self-determination with children? <p>In the same talk, Professor Shah’s example of his nephew’s thousands of photos in the cloud uploaded for him by his relatives resonated with me as a parent. As a mother of a four-year-old, it’s so difficult to restrain me from uploading pictures of my child — what Professor <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11018/Plunkett">Leah Plunkett</a> calls “Sharenthood.” Parents create digital footprints of our children and so much of their private moments are in the digital space already. But beyond the dangers of violating the privacy of children, the creation of this catalog of children’s lives online may limit their ability to define who they are, to reflect on their experiences, to associate objects to their memories, because so much has already been documented for&nbsp;them.</p><p>So when is digitization too much that it harms children’s self-determination — is a topic I want to explore further. It goes hand-in-hand with other parenting issues in the digital era, like safety. Parents should educate themselves about technology and how our children interact with it because it’s not going away and it plays a large role in how they define themselves and their realities. I personally recommend Professor Urs Gasser’s book “<a href="https://today.law.harvard.edu/the-connected-parent-offers-guidance-insight-into-digital-parenting/">The Connected Parent</a>” as a starting&nbsp;point.</p>Rory Torres with her daughter. Courtesy&nbsp;image. How did your studies as an LL.M. student at Harvard Law School — and your interests in tech and the law — inform or shape your perception of the&nbsp;program? <p>When we talk about law and technology, there’s always a discussion of seemingly competing but often interacting concepts: the individual and the collective, the private and the public, the offline and the online. As an LL.M. student, what I have realized in studying these concepts as they relate to technology is that technology is highly contextual and it is fast-changing, such that, as a student of the law, it is difficult to create a single universal approach to encourage innovation that would provide a positive impact to the world or to address the harms or threats that technology can bring. This is the attitude that I have brought with me to the Research Sprint, and it has helped me broaden my perspective and try to see self-determination from the lens of participants and speakers with various backgrounds and expertise.</p> How did participating in the Research Sprint inform your time at HLS and your future trajectory? <p>Finding my trajectory after HLS is an exercise of self-determination! At HLS, I curated my law and technology courses for business and technology, and Internet and society, because there’s always that tension between commercial interests and social issues. The Research Sprint in particular expanded my thinking beyond legal frameworks and allowed me to explore the field of social science and the Internet, and was especially inspired by Professor Lokman Tsui’s work on free expression, digital rights, and Internet policy in Asia. In relation to that, I’m also keen on exploring Privacy-by-Design and studying how to integrate digital self-determination into its principles, beyond respect for user privacy, and experimenting with startups on how to integrate Privacy-by-Design and digital self-determination as they develop their platforms.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/a-deep-dive-on-digital-self-determination-368c48d87705">A Deep-Dive on Digital Self-Determination</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>1.What is the mission and vision of Sterling Backcheck?</p>



<p>Sterling Backcheck’s mission is to provide the foundation of trust and safety for our clients so they can create great environments for their most essential resource, people. Sterling Backcheck’s vision is the world where verified identity information should be owned and accessible easily by the individual.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>So much of our lives is now in a digital format, both personally and professionally. We rely on technology to handle sensitive information, which, if not done correctly, can put us in jeopardy. Digital Identity is a crucial safeguard to preventing identity fraud, which could result in a significant damage to people’s life. Digital Identity is a key enabler to unlocking the next frontier of the digital economy. Through trustworthy Digital Identity, we can enable a safe digital future.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>The World Bank estimates that roughly 1 billion people lack an official foundational identification. Millions have forms of identification that cannot be reliably verified or authenticated, resulting in exclusion from economic opportunities. Our parent company, Sterling, has been working on the creation of a digital identity wallet to help address the challenges worldwide. By joining DIACC, Sterling Backcheck hopes to help bridge that gap and offer a platform for trustworthy ID verification.</p>



 <a href="https://www.sterlingbackcheck.ca/"></a> 



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada has always been the pioneer on the identity front. For example, unlike many other countries, ID verification is required before starting a background check in Canada. In addition, Canada has always emphasized the importance of data privacy and storage. Building on those principles, Canada is well positioned to lead the conversation on digital identity services.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>At Sterling Backcheck, we aspire to a vision that Digital identity verification should only have to occur once and personal identity verification should only be shared, when necessary and proportional to the need. Individuals and organizations should mutually benefit from digital identity innovation. While technology has created opportunities to enhance digital identity, we’ve also noticed examples of some migration away from sound identity verification practices. We see DIACC as an important vehicle to bolster and promulgate sound digital identity practices. We joined to help forward the mission of DIACC towards that goal.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Sterling Backcheck is a pioneer in background screening, having revolutionized the industry with eConsent, a fully online platform for collecting candidate consent prior to starting their check. Through our proactive and collaborative approach working with the federal authorities that govern our industry, we have continuously offered a safe and secure way for organizations to conduct background screening. We conduct over a million criminal record checks on behalf of thousands of employers annually. There is no question that our processes have been refined over the years. We’re always looking for ways to innovate and continue to offer best in class service to our clients.</p>

<p>MIT Technology Review Insights explores, in a new <a href="https://bit.ly/3u4ZbIj">report</a> released today, how a growing number of voices — including economists, lawyers, civil rights groups, and Omidyar Network — are constructing a new social contract between the tech industry and citizens. <a href="https://omidyar.com/omidyar_team/sushant-kumar/">Sushant Kumar</a>, a principal of responsible technology, reflects on the need and pathway for this paradigm shift in the forward of “Data fairness: A new social contact for the 21st century economy.”</p><p>Incentives drive behavior. Currently, tech giants are incentivized to collect as much data as possible so they can narrowly target advertising to consumers, which in turn, increases their earnings. Big tech does everything it can to increase users’ screen-time and engagement, all in service of data collection. And it’s working quite well for them. Facebook’s profits in the first quarter of 2021 nearly doubled and advertising revenue rose by 46% compared to last&nbsp;year.</p><p>But while these platforms are seeing record profits, it’s coming at the expense of other stakeholders in the system: government, communities, gig workers, and the users themselves. Government is losing out because these companies don’t pay their fair share of taxes in countries of operation, thereby constraining public investments. These platforms use extractive and intrusive ways to collect data, stripping communities and individuals of privacy and control. And Big Tech uses data to control their employees, especially gig workers, which leads to suppressed wages and deteriorating work conditions for people working in the gig&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Omidyar Network, a social change venture, believes we must learn how to <a href="https://omidyarnetwork.medium.com/why-we-invested-in-building-an-equitable-data-economy-98e8968b0dc6">balance the data economy</a> so that it is equitable for all stakeholders, not just serving the interests of the big tech giants. That’s why we’ve partnered with MIT Technology Review Insights. We wanted to have a better understanding of potential pathways to reimagine the data economy that is rife with systemic flaws. This <a href="https://bit.ly/3u4ZbIj">paper</a> is intended to share emerging ideas, spark debate, and solicit feedback.</p><p>This paper is informed by early scholarship from individuals and institutions that are investigating this issue. They have found three emerging pathways to reimagine the data economy. First, the essential infrastructure that enables a global, open internet must focus on generating public value rather than private profits. Second, governments will need a holistic approach to regulating the data economy. Traditional antitrust and privacy measures need to be complemented by data governance that creates necessary safeguards and room for innovative applications for data. Finally, the data economy needs mechanisms for participatory governance and practice-based intermediation approaches. This report provides examples from Estonia and Taiwan and shares the progress made by entrepreneurs in the field of data trusts and data collaboratives. These approaches can be strengthened with regulatory support and public&nbsp;funding.</p><p>We hope these pathways provoke a much needed reckoning of the data economy. As we continue our journey to reimagine the data economy, we invite you to join&nbsp;us.</p><p>We are grateful for our partnership with MIT Technology Review Insights for its in-depth exploration into the data economy, and our many partners, including The Rockefeller Foundation, that share our commitment to building a more equitable data&nbsp;economy.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/the-push-for-fairness-equity-and-safeguards-in-the-data-economy-2dfa58dc0e48">The push for fairness, equity, and safeguards in the data economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;Tell us about your day – what gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;I am the Head of Financial Crime for a credit card company. I am also studying for a PhD in Criminal Justice Studies, looking at the role of insider fraudsters within business.</p>
<p>In my spare time I run STUC (Stammerers Through University Consultancy), an initiative which collaborates with universities nationwide offering better support for students and staff who stammer.</p>
<p>I’m really fascinated by the world of financial crime and how to prevent it. No two days are ever the same because the fraud landscape is continually changing.</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Employment-wise, I graduated with a French degree from the University of Warwick in 2014 and landed a job at Amazon working as a bilingual fraud investigations specialist. They hired me for my language skills and trained me in fraud detection and prevention on the job. From that point, I was hooked. I subsequently worked in the financial crime sector at Cifas, World First and, currently, Jaja Finance. I also completed a MSc in Counter Fraud &amp; Counter Corruption Studies before starting on my PhD. I wanted to have a combination of both professional and academic background in my line of work.</p>
<blockquote>
 Allow everyone to be themselves and work in a way that suits them. Your teams will feel more valued and much more loyal 
</blockquote>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;I’d say it is that the person I was when I started my first graduate job in 2014 is completely different to who I am now. I used to be shy, naïve, desperate to please and anxious of making the tiniest of mistakes. Now I am so much more confident, much less anxious. I understand that you can’t please everyone and that making mistakes is part of how you learn.</p>
<p>I’ve also learned that whilst having a great manager is invaluable to aid your personal and professional development, having not-so-great managers will teach you just as much.</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What would you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity and inclusion should be at the forefront of everything you do, as well as instilling a culture that promotes acceptance and versatility. Trying to mould people to fit a certain type of employee will only deter them and staff turnover will be high. If you allow everyone to be themselves and work in a way that suits them, they will feel more valued and will show loyalty.WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you?</p>
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity is a necessity for the progression, learning and development of both individuals and businesses.</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members and why? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;I always used to try too hard to people-please. I’d obsess over what people thought of me, and regularly put myself in uncomfortable situations under the belief that it would help me be liked. So my recommendation would be The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k by Sarah Knight!</p>
 WiD&nbsp; &nbsp;What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>CN&nbsp; &nbsp;Your stammer doesn’t define your success. One day you’ll decide that you can’t substitute words anymore and that if you stammer, so what? People may not understand it, they may not react in a way you like, but you’ll rise above it and will be able to live the life you want – because you’ll learn that your words are just as important as everyone else’s.</p>

 Tell us about your role and what gets you out of bed in the morning 
<p>Functionally, I support when / where / why / how to integrate digital technologies (and partners, service providers) into resource constrained contexts, primarily for purposes of humanitarian response. Most recently, I’ve been focused on supporting large-scale humanitarian cash transfer programmes, as well as supporting essential work in mobile health, agriculture, nutrition and supply chain programs.</p>
<p>I love helping others to make informed decisions around what will be the most impactful technologies, partnerships etc. and I typically serve as a bridge between technologists and non-technologists. I suppose I’m a kind of trusted broker and often my role is hidden.&nbsp; Slowly, I think people are starting to realize this can be integral to the success of a large scale tech project and I love the feeling that my role is so connected to the success of projects that have such an impact on fellow human beings.</p>
<p>I also love learning how people are bending simple technologies for their own needs, in seemingly “less developed” locations or within “complex crises.” I’d much rather keep tabs on pastoralists use of SMS or small business owners workarounds for digital payments than reading the latest news on TechCrunch.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Luck, curiosity and cautiously stumbling along unexpected pathways. I’m fairly up front about what I know and what I don’t know. This results in a lot of leaning in on others to help develop the situational awareness we need to piece together the best outcomes re digital integrations.</p>
<p>More specifically, my interest in the world of “impactful tech” was sparked when I spent a very brief time in Haiti a few days after the 2010 earthquake. Basic ICT and mobile technology was accessible to many and I was fascinated how it became an invaluable tool, updating (OpenStreet) maps to allow for better co-ordination of logistics etc.. I’ve basically followed that curiosity ever since.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
 
 Trust is key. 
 Technology / ICT is an industry. Regardless of goodwill intent, this should never be forgotten. 
 “Being an expert” is very relative. It’s been quite fascinating to observe the quick ascent of experts in “emerging technologies” (e.g. AI, ML, blockchain / digital ID) and how they will “most definitely” impact “the unbanked” or other demographics in the developing world. All I can say is it seems there are a lot of experts who understand technology and its potential. But I believe there are far fewer who can navigate how to make it all work sustainably in a new context, with new populations. 
 
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
 
 START educating people on what actually makes a recognized identity. What are the fundamental building blocks? Which public policies and stakeholders / authorities should be involved? 
 STOP selling pipe dreams based solely on product designs. No ID app or platform will hold meaning unless the right stakeholders (and regulators) are engaged and on board. Thankfully we are seeing a reduction in Marketing campaign that promote “digital ID for all refugees” or the like. 
 CONTINUE promoting standards that uphold interoperability. Continue to educate governments on what makes a good public technology / societal platform, as well as share successes of large-scale (and govt led) technology initiatives. Digital ID is the backbone of a new age of digital governance. Ot needs to be treated as more than just a pilot project, dependent on archaic RFP / tender processes. 
 
 What does diversity mean to you?&nbsp;&nbsp;* 
<blockquote>
 Without diversity, my perspectives on life would be much less interesting (or balanced) !! 
</blockquote>
 What book, film or piece of art would you recommend to fellow WiD members? 
<p>My book would be: Fake Like Me, by Barbara Bourland.&nbsp; Full disclosure ….. the author is a friend! But it’s a fun read for summer that’s ostensibly a murder mystery based in an artists’ colony. Ultimately, it’s also a witty introspection into identity and how easy it is to create (and destroy) it.</p>
<p>Art – <a href="https://artscoops.com/">https://artscoops.com/ </a>&nbsp;I know it’s not a single piece, I know, but it’s a great place to keep revisiting you’re wanting to support artists from the Middle East.</p>
 
 Finally, what advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>“You won’t end up in Law School. Though maybe don’t tell Mom just yet!!”</p>

<p>Developers building multi-chain applications have a powerful new combination to work with, as Ceramic now supports Moonbeam applications. &nbsp;Moonbeam offers developers an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot, providing an easy path to a multi-chain implementation. Ceramic adds support for advanced data management and cross-chain identity. Together, this enables developers and users to depend on the same accounts and wallets to manage transactions, identities, and data across Ethereum and Polkadot applications. </p> A full stack for cross-chain applications <p>Since Moonbeam uses the same keypairs and wallets as Ethereum, signing and<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains"> </a>authentication for Ceramic's data streams is also supported out of the box. Now that Moonbeam and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem  <p>"Moonbeam devs and users will now be able to easily implement Ceramic's streaming data and cross-chain identity protocols due to the same keys and wallets being utilized that developers and users are already familiar with," says Nate Hamilton, Director of Business Development at Moonbeam. </p><blockquote>The Ceramic and Moonbeam teams look towards the same goal: proving the best-in-class user experience</blockquote><p>Currently, Moonbase Alpha, the Moonbeam TestNet, has been added as a supported chain. Users can now perform transactions on Ceramic and Moonbase Alpha with their existing wallets. Currently, Moonbeam is compatible with MetaMask and MathWallet.</p> About Moonbeam:  <p>Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network that makes it easy to build natively interoperable applications. This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam will benefit from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. Currently, in active development by PureStake, Moonbeam is expected to reach MainNet by mid-2021. </p><p>Learn more: <a href="https://moonbeam.network/?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=news&amp;utm_campaign=announcement&amp;utm_content=subscan">https://moonbeam.network/</a>.</p> About Ceramic <p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more.</p><p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/#streams">Ceramic's stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information. <a href="http://idx.xyz">IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables. By making it easy to structure and associate data to a user's personal index, IDX lets applications save, discover and route to users' data.</p><p>The IDX SDK makes it simple to manage users and deliver great data-driven experiences using the same keys and wallets as developers and users are already relying on. Users can also link multiple keys, from any wallet and multiple blockchains, to the same identity. This is essential to developers who want to serve users over time, as it enables key rotation, data interoperability across accounts, and rich cross-chain profiles, reputations and experiences (including 50,000+ profiles on Ethereum today).</p> Getting started with Ceramic and Moonbeam   To get started on Moonbeam visit their <a href="https://docs.moonbeam.network/">documentation site</a>  To add IDX to your project, follow this<a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>.

 <a href="http://digitalgovernment.scot"></a>In the <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/files/ash/files/300871_hvd_ash_digital_trans_1.pdf">Harvard white paper</a> on Digital Government Transformation Richard Pope provides a working definition of ‘GaaP’ – Government as a Platform. 
 “GaaP should reorganize the work of government around a network of shared APIs and components, open-standards and canonical datasets, so that civil servants, businesses, and others can deliver radically better services to the public more safely, efficiently, and accountably.” 
<p>He explores the topic through a summary round up of how this approach has been pioneered and adopted in countries like India, Estonia and the UK.</p>
<p>Our white paper builds on this, providing detailed blueprint analysis of GaaP implementations across the world.</p>
 #LegoGovernment – Plug and Play Service Design 
<p>GaaP is such a powerful approach because it address the root issue that inhibits integrated Government services.</p>
<p>Like all large enterprise organizations Governments are structured via rigidly delineated departments and agencies, and typically deploy their own dedicated IT for only their business processes, creating isolated silos. The DWP develops their own standalone IT systems, Tax and Healthcare does the same, … and so on.</p>
<p>As the Harvard paper describes:</p>
<p>“There is a lot of duplication in government. Generally, departments and agencies are vertically integrated, with each running its own version of a system (a public website, a payment gateway, a printing service, an address lookup, etc.) that’s similar but not identical to all the others. Platforms have been cited as a way to remove that duplication and break down organizational silos.</p>
<p>Siloed approaches to transformation don’t work,” <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/03/29/government-as-a-platform-the-next-phase-of-digital-transformation/">Mike Bracken wrote in 2015</a>. “Reinventing the wheel every single time we build a service has led to far too much duplication and waste. That’s not good enough.”</p>
<p>This is a critical point for those working in public sector service design. When we consider how services are actually delivered we see that the workflow processes that enable them cut across these silos, as illustrated through this simple example:</p>
<p>This sets the scene for the concept of “Lego Government”. Rather than the traditional approach of building Government services via dedicated line of business applications, they are created via coupling together modular components.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/features/inside-dwp%E2%80%99s-digital-coronavirus-response-%E2%80%93-apis-reuse-and-micro-services">This PublicTechnology interview</a>&nbsp;explores in detail how the DWP are working with APIs. For example when the NHS undertakes a real-time check for prescription charge exemption they call the DWP passport benefit API which validates the enquiry. They also perform this check for the Department for Education for free school meals entitlement and for local authorities for the disabled Blue Badge award.</p>
<p>They make the critical point that they endevour to reuse existing APIs wherever possible, and where they don’t they develop them via ‘<a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/news/how-microservices-empowered-uks-dwp-to-pivot-during-covid-19/elsewhere-web/2020/08/04">microservices</a>‘ – Small snippets of code intended only for this purpose. This enables very rapid solutioning, only four weeks in some cases.</p>
<p>Underpinning the business logic and service design layer the core technology architecture is the API Gateway platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the DWP describes:</p>
<p>“Once we identified – or built – the API that met the requirement, we deployed it onto our current shared API Gateway which was already hosted in our internet-facing cloud. This meant that all the infrastructure was already in place so, once the API was tested and proven to be suitable, it could be deployed really easily through the existing shared infrastructure. Historically, the process of building the underlying infrastructure could take months; we deployed new APIs, or extended throughput on existing APIs within two days. This would not have been possible without the API Library or the shared API Gateway.”</p>
<p>Hosting their API gateway in a cloud environment allowed the team to scale up in near real-time, after completing assessment of forecasted API volumes. This microservices approach will build the pathway towards the future, with the hope that eventually they will be able to “join up services across government and one initiative is that we’re creating a central cross-government API Registry that will enable us to share what APIs we already have available, as well as being able to see what APIs other government departments have available.”</p>

<p>By Rae Rivera, Ph.D., Director of Certification, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance today&nbsp; introduced a significant update to its Metadata Service (MDS). The service provides information about the certification status of authenticators, authenticator capabilities, and any known security issues. The FIDO MDS provides organizations deploying FIDO servers with a centralized and trusted source of information about FIDO authenticators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MDS is a web-based repository where vendors can publish metadata about their certified FIDO authenticators. Relying parties use this information&nbsp; to validate authenticator attestation and prove the authenticity of the device model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With over 100 authenticator products on the market today, and demand for strong authentication on the rise, the need for an easy-to-use repository to load and view FIDO Certified authenticators has grown in importance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just last week, the Biden administration mandated multi-factor authentication for all government agencies to thwart phishing attempts and protect against account takeover.&nbsp; Governments and other regulated industries such as banking and healthcare especially need to know that authenticators being used to access their systems are genuine and meet certain requirements, including FIDO Certification status, compliance and other organizational requirements. The new features in the FIDO MDS allow organizations to more quickly and easily verify the attributes of the FIDO Authenticators being used to log in to their web services and applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s news is significant in several areas:</p>



  The new MDS has a more efficient and effective user interface that greatly simplifies the uploading and publishing of metadata.&nbsp;  There is a simplified API for relying parties to download metadata.  Metadata updates are now available daily instead of monthly, which ensures relying parties have access to the most up-to-date information.  The new MDS data format is now a single JSON structure, making it more compatible with standard web development tools. The new MDS format uses human-readable strings instead of numerical values, making it easier to read and understand.  The MDS data is now linked to the FIDO Certification program, which will ensure the reliability of the validity of metadata of FIDO Certified products.&nbsp;  The service now uses cloud caching to provide high availability and download performance.&nbsp;

	<p>On May 6, 2021, two days after the Me2B Alliance published our report on&nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/school-mobile-apps-student-data-sharing-behavior/">data sharing in school utility apps,</a>&nbsp;Google issued a “<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">pre-announcement”</a>&nbsp;describing major improvements to app labeling in the Android app store:&nbsp;</p>
<p>We work closely with developers to keep Google Play a <a href="https://www.android.com/safety/">safe</a>, trusted space for billions of people to enjoy the latest Android apps. Today,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;pre-announcing an upcoming safety section in Google Play that will help people understand the data an app collects or shares, if that data is secured, and additional details that impact privacy and security.<br>
[Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html</a>&nbsp;]&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement signals a serious intention to not only catch up to Apple’s privacy label, but surpass it, by introducing independent validation of the Android app privacy information.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the announcement, the official policy will be published in Q3 2021, and by Q2 2022,&nbsp;all&nbsp;apps in the Google Play store will need to provide the new “safety section” information.  Details on the new “safety section” are where the rubber meets the road, and as we noted in our report, there currently isn’t adequate privacy or safety labeling for apps. Nevertheless, we’re encouraged by the new policy, and hope that Google’s new safety section includes SDKs by name and owner.</p>
<p>[Source:&nbsp; <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html</a>&nbsp;]&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement also makes clear that the new “safety section” will be independently audited, though unclear if that will take effect in Q2 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Me2B Alliance currently performs independent audits of apps and websites and looks forward to learning more about Google’s independent app auditing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But why wait until next year when you can get your app or website audited by us today? &nbsp;<a href="https://me2ba.org/services/">Contact us</a>&nbsp;to get started.</p>

  Being able to prove one’s identity is critical in modern society. This is 
no less the case for people being served by humanitarian organizations. 
Indeed, those without official identification are among the most 
vulnerable. While previous solutions to this challenge have relied on 
traditional means, these are not ideal, especially in the context of the 
current COVID-19 pandemic.

            <p>Oldoniyro, Kenya 2018: In a field pilot utilizing cash assistance and blockchain technology conducted by the Kenya Red Cross and IFRC, it was recognized that lack of official ID was a hindrance to receiving assistance. In the published <a href="https://preparecenter.org/resource/blockchain-open-loop-cash-transfer-pilot-project/">learning review</a> it was noted that 25% of the Kenya Red Cross’ caseload have no official IDs, highlighting the need to address the issue of identities. </p><p>Photo credit: Kenya Red Cross</p>
          
        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>In disaster and crisis situations, members of affected communities who do not have an officially recognized form of identification (ID) <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22297">can face barriers to receiving aid</a>. Without ID, people made vulnerable by their situations cannot prove who they are, making it impossible for aid agencies to “know their customer” – often a pre-requisite for delivering services in an accountable way. While these challenges can sometimes be overcome, for instance through trusted proxies who do have an ID, such analogue solutions are not ideal.</p><p>Through a series of expert interviews and case studies of existing projects, a new report written by <a href="http://www.octd.co.uk">Oxford Centre for Technology and Development</a>, commissioned by IFRC, and supported by the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">DIGID </a>consortium (Norwegian Red Cross, Norwegian Refugee Council, Norwegian Church Aid, Save the Children Norway), <a href="https://hiplatform.org/s/Digital-IdentityAn-Analysis-for-the-Humanitarian-Sector-Final.pdf">Digital Identity: An Analysis for the Humanitarian Sector</a> looks at the opportunities offered by digital identity technologies in humanitarian contexts, but also the risks. The report lists technical, ethical and sustainability aspects of digital ID solutions for organizations looking to explore, learn, and invest in such solutions. </p><p>For affected communities, obtaining a digital ID issued by humanitarian organizations can make it much easier (or indeed possible in the first place) to access services, including cash and voucher assistance, in multiple ways. First, they can use the digital ID to prove their identity where this was not previously possible due to a lack of official ID. Second, they can store certain attributes or credentials digitally, allowing them to have portable access to information such as training or education certificates, health records or legal records that might otherwise be left behind or destroyed when a disaster hits. Third, they can choose to reveal only relevant pieces of information instead of all their digital wallet’s contents.</p>


  <blockquote>
    “Without ID, people made vulnerable by their situations cannot prove who they are, making it impossible for aid agencies to “know their customer” – often a pre-requisite for delivering services in an accountable way.”
  </blockquote>
  

<p>The report points out that in an ideal world, digital ID technology would be “interoperable” throughout the sector whereby different humanitarian organizations would be able to recognize digital ID credentials, check the issuer, and extract only the data that is being shared by the owner of the digital ID. In this way, members of affected communities could avoid having to register repeatedly (and potentially having to relive trauma as they recount their story), better preserving their dignity.</p><p>Meanwhile, the report finds that aid organizations would also benefit from avoiding such repeat registration as their process could be made more time- and cost-efficient by deploying digital ID systems. Another advantage of an interoperable solution would be that trust and collaboration between aid organizations would be enhanced. The DIGID consortium was established for this very purpose: to see how different agencies can work together to best deliver services instead of developing siloed systems.</p><p>But the report also discusses challenges to the successful implementation of digital IDs and makes recommendations to address these: </p>  <p>Developing and rolling out a solution has a considerable cost, in terms of both money and time, including the need to upskill staff and volunteers. </p>  <p>Concerns around data privacy must also be addressed to maintain trust between organizations and the communities they serve. </p>  <p>Digital ID solutions depend on certain levels of literacy and access to technology and devices that can be variable and limited in crisis-affected communities.</p>  <p>Despite these difficulties, the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/s/Digital-IdentityAn-Analysis-for-the-Humanitarian-Sector-Final.pdf">report </a>offers hope that digital IDs will come to form an integral part of delivering humanitarian services, including cash and voucher assistance. In a rapidly evolving ecosystem of assistance and technology, humanitarian actors must involve themselves in the process from the outset, or risk having to play catch-up in an environment over which they have little or no control. </p><p>The DIGID consortium also held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjL1MOv7_Rc">webinar</a> introducing this report, as part of <a href="https://solferinoacademy.com/ifrc-data-digital-week-2021/">Data and Digital Week in April 2021</a>.</p><p><a href="https://hiplatform.org/blog/2021/5/19/digital-ids-in-the-humanitarian-sector-whats-the-big-deal">Permalink</a></p><p></p>

 Energy Web and Energy Peace Partners Announce Peace Renewable Energy Credit (P-REC) Digital Marketplace Platform <p>Zug, Switzerland and Sausalito, Calif. — 19 May 2021 — Today, Energy Web and <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/mission">Energy Peace Partners</a> (EPP) announced a new partnership to develop a digital marketplace platform to accelerate the development of renewable energy projects in fragile, energy-poor countries. EPP leverages climate finance solutions to promote peace and development by extending the renewable energy revolution to some of the planet’s most vulnerable populations. EPP developed the <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/prec">Peace Renewable Energy Credit</a> (P-REC), which certifies the social co-benefits of renewable energy in addition to renewables’ traditional environmental benefits.</p><p>An energy attribute certificate (EAC) — including renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the United States and guarantees of origin (GOs) in the EU — is an internationally-traded virtual commodity that represents 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of renewable energy generated. P-RECs are issued under the I-REC Standard, the EAC standard in 40+ developing countries, and are issued as I-RECs with additional social co-benefits from new projects in fragile, energy-poor regions. To date, EPP has been authorized as the country issuer of P-RECs and I-RECs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan. The first-ever P-REC transaction occurred in the DRC in 2020 through a <a href="https://www.energypeacepartners.com/blog/announcing-the-first-sale-of-p-recs">groundbreaking collaboration</a> between Microsoft, Nuru, 3Degrees (an Energy Web member), and&nbsp;EPP.</p><p>The digital marketplace platform will leverage the <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a> open-source software development toolkit, harmonize with <a href="https://www.irecstandard.org/">The IREC Standard</a>, and be prepared to integrate with <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, an application to find and digitally source verified, emissions-free renewable energy globally. Simply put, the platform will lead to the development of a digital P-REC purchase option for renewable energy buyers, including individuals, that want to support the development of high-impact renewable energy projects for communities where these projects are installed.</p><p>The platform will help EPP market P-REC projects, increase demand among a wider set of corporate and individual buyers, scale up the global P-REC market, and facilitate P-REC transactions in a streamlined way. For Energy Web, this partnership will generate new open-source functionality for EW Origin to support digitized EAC “forward agreements” that enable buyers to easily commit to supporting additional renewable energy facilities, which in turn helps reduce the upfront costs of new facilities and improve financing terms.</p><p>“This is an incredibly exciting partnership and project,” said Sherwin Das, Managing Director of EPP. “Together we’re bringing a cutting-edge, digital solution that will contribute to scaling up the market for P-RECs and, in doing so, unlock more renewable energy investment in high-impact projects around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>“We’re proud to partner with EPP on this renewables marketplace,” added Doug Miller, global markets lead for Energy Web. “This partnership represents Energy Web’s first engagement with projects in Africa and a breakthrough opportunity to introduce digital tools that make it easy for local communities to attract renewable energy buyers who can help expand clean energy access and related social co-benefits in a frictionless way. This partnership will also result in a new standardized digital approach to renewable energy forward agreements that we think will serve as an attractive product for renewable energy buyers that want to support additional products outside of Africa, yet are simpler to implement than power purchase agreements, especially in regulated markets like most I-REC markets.”</p><p>Both EPP and I-REC Standard are also advisors to EW Zero, which in December <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-awarded-good-energies-foundation-grant-for-new-global-renewables-marketplace-794eaa7e14e0">received a grant</a> from the Good Energies Foundation to commercialize the platform. For the EPP P-REC marketplace, the joint team expects to complete an initial proof of concept (POC) by the end of&nbsp;2021.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>About Energy Peace Partners<br>The mission of Energy Peace Partners (EPP) is peace and stability for all, powered by renewable energy.

<p>May 7, 2021</p>



<p>Re: A little-known Trans-Canada digital identity regime in the works, in whose interest? by Ken Rubin, The Hill Times, May 3, 2021.</p>



<p>Dear Editor,&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his column, “A little-known Trans-Canada digital identity regime in the works, in whose interest?”, Ken Rubin inaccurately writes that “On the legislative front, business-backed groups like the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada are calling for revamping Canada’s outdated public-sector Privacy Act to allow for a more permissive legal regime that clears the way for digital IDs and one-stop digitized government services. … Canadian governments need to hit ‘pause’ and rethink their digital identity scheme and digital legislation which are pushing sufficient and secure privacy protection largely aside.”</p>



<p>The Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital ID ecosystem that will enable Canada’s full and beneficial participation in the global digital economy.</p>



<p>The DIACC has more than 100 members spanning several sectors including public policy leaders and chief information officers from the federal and provincial governments, networks for payments and for identity verification, technology service providers, strategy and integration experts and financial institutions.</p>



<p>The DIACC fully shares the author’s concern for Canadian’s privacy. This concern is why, for 10 years, the DIACC has built up this important sector as the trusted voice for driving the development of a pan-Canadian trust framework, standards, and initiatives that support the establishment of a fully digital, and privacy-respecting country that Canadians want. DIACC prioritizes a federated approach to work in alignment with Canada’s federal, provincial, territorial, and Indigienous governments. This approach does not support linking of identities, rather, it leverages and extends Privacy by Design principles to enable Canadians to choose which identity credentials they wish to use respecting diversity and promoting inclusion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://diacc.ca/2021/02/16/covid-has-accelerated-canadians-demand-for-digital-id/">recent research</a>, the majority of Canadians believe it is important for federal and provincial governments to move quickly on enabling digital ID in a safe and secure manner. It also shows that collaboration between governments and the private sector continues to be considered the best approach to create a pan-Canadian digital ID framework.</p>



<p>In today’s digital economy, and as the pandemic has made clear, Canadians should be empowered to give informed consent for its use across multiple platforms and in economic areas where proving identity is crucial for secure transactions.</p>



<p>Establishing digital ID that works for Canadians is not about creating one identity to be used for surveillance or tracking. It’s about using the credentials that Canadians already have offline (eg: passports, driver’s licenses, health cards, citizenship cards, bank cards, student cards); having those credentials securely issued digitally; and being able to use them for digital transactions&nbsp; —&nbsp; from opening a bank account from the comfort of home, to accessing medical records, to receiving government benefits quickly and easily.</p>



<p>When it comes to legislation, there is no clear policy directive in C-11 that allows Canadians to understand what they can expect in terms of accessing the data the public services have about them. This is why it’s essential for the federal government to empower Canadians to be able to use the credentials associated with them in a modern digital economy, with security and privacy. If Canada is going to be a modern digital society and economy, Canadians must understand what they can expect about data that exists about them in both the public and private sectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canadian governments should not ‘hit pause’ on digital ID, they should be investing in truly unlocking digital. Investing in digital ID not only makes economic sense but also establishes digital tools to support societal trust, provides security, strengthens privacy, and mitigates fraud. This is a win for all.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Joni Brennan<br>President, Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada</p>

<p>Owning and accessing an official proof of identity <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/10/12/11-billion-invisible-people-without-id-are-priority-for-new-high-level-advisory-council-on-identification-for-development">remains a challenge for over 1 billion people in the world.</a> This lack of documented identity disproportionately affects marginalized groups like women and ethnic minorities, especially in developing nations where barriers exist to the issuing of basic credentials like birth certificates or national identity documents. Without a functional identity, marginalized communities remain unable to take advantage of key financial, educational, and political resources the digital world can provide. This disparity is a primary focus for the global community. The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals even enumerated <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">Goal 16.9</a> with a specific target: By 2030, providing legal identity for all, including birth registration. If even basic analog identifiers are out of the reach of people across the globe, then digital identity proves nearly impossible for them to obtain. Though Canada remains a leader in digital identity, challenges remain with complete integration of marginalized communities into their developed digital identity ecosystems. This post stands to outline the global problem, and provide insight into a global solution framework which could possibly be applied to the Canadian context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A gender divide in digital access has been prevalent for decades, and has widened over the past years between developed and developing countries. Roughly 330 million fewer women than men have access to a smartphone and the mobile internet. <a href="http://www.oecd.org/digital/bridging-the-digital-gender-divide.pdf">They are 26% less likely to own a mobile device, and in South Asia and Africa those proportions stand at 70% and 34% respectively.</a> Without access to the mobile internet and the ability to affirm their digital identity, people are left unable to utilize key resources that could help sustain them and their families. These resources could include access to financial accounts, employment opportunities, microfinance applications, digital platforms to create independent income, public health and healthcare initiatives, and the breadth of the Internet as a place to gain knowledge and skills. With ready access to these digital platforms, marginalized communities can find financial stability and health resources that will improve their quality of life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Economic development organizations such as the World Bank are developing strategies to introduce Digital ID frameworks to its member countries. The World Bank’s Identity for Development (<a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/370121518449921710/Guidelines-for-ID4D-Diagnostics.pdf">ID4D</a>) Diagnostics provides a possible methodology to identify ways to improve identity management systems around the world. Inclusion is a key priority for ID4D, with a focus on systems with high levels of coverage and access. The universality of coverage is defined in both longitudinal and latitudinal terms. Longitudinal coverage spans the lifetime of an individual, while latitudinal coverage refers to the breadth of society the system covers. Accessibility requires the removal of barriers to usage and disparities in the availability of information and technology. ID4D stresses the importance of “inclusion by design”, tasking system builders to communicate with marginalized communities to see where legal, social, and economic gaps may exist to avoid further exacerbating them. According to ID4D, these identity systems should also possess a high level of interoperability. Interoperable systems are more efficient, both in time and money, and allow for integration across multiple platforms. It also suggests using open standards, rather than proprietary technology, which foster innovation in the system and encourage technological advances to be made.</p>



<p>Does the way that ID4D is applied in developing nations provide any lessons for how a developed country can better serve its marginalized communities? Do other solution frameworks exist to map a developed digital identity ecosystem for gaps in coverage and access? By asking these questions, we begin a conversation that will result in improving identity access for all. When connected to a digital identity, marginalized communities are able to take advantage of a wealth of resources that can improve their financial, social, and political standing. In turn, this supports sustainable growth in their home country and contributes to a system where all can benefit.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/tag/blockchain/"></a>This video is about, why and how China decided to go digital. What is the Digital Yuan? How does the Digital Currency work? Is DCEP a cryptocurrency? Is the digital Yuan blockchain based? 
 Video Summary 
<p>The nature of money is something that the average person living a thousand or one hundred or maybe even ten years ago spent a very little time thinking about outside of a few major economic crashes.</p>
<p>Money was a relatively constant and predictable thing in our lives, but in the last decade or so, the very nature of it has started to change with digital payments, mobile wallets, cryptocurrency and most recently the first ever attempt at a real digital currency by a major economy. The Chinese government started rolling out its digital Yuan, officially called the DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) and small pilot projects last year.</p>
<p>China started talking about its own digital currency in 2013 for the first time the same year, WeChat, the country’s most popular messaging and social app, launched its mobile wallet, following in the footsteps of Alibaba Alipay. Alibaba’s Alipay was launched in February 2004.</p>
<p>Four years after that is in 2009 Bitcoin was launched. At first, the new digital currency seemed like little more than a side project of the government going through a couple of years of relatively slow research and development phase. But their focus started intensifying dramatically around 2017, leading to the first public trials in 2020 spending for Chinese cities and hundreds of merchants. And the timing of this increased interest is no coincidence.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, Bitcoin hit its first real peak in valuation, creating widespread awareness for cryptocurrency around the world. In 2018, Facebook announced Libra with bold ambitions to create a cross-border currency for its over two billion users during this year’s mobile wallet exploded in popularity and China online lending through Internet companies ballooned to huge proportions in the country.</p>
<p>And the United States government launched its trade war against China, which increased the risk of financial sanctions. Within the span of just a few years, the entire Chinese monetary system, including its currency and its traditional banking sector, started facing major threats from both inside and outside of the country. Domestically, Tencent and Alibaba, China’s two largest tech companies, started to gobble up the entire finance industry of the country.</p>
<p>Their respective mobile wallets came to dominate the category, and mobile payments skyrocketed in popularity to mind blowing 32 percent of all sales in the country, leading to many merchants simply stopping to accept other payment methods, including cash or credit cards completely. Given their incredible growth, the two are now on a path to swallow up almost all payment in the country within just a few years.</p>
<p>And these two giants were increasingly starting to strike exclusivity deals with more and more merchants, meaning that consumers even now often have no choice but to use their services. Not only that, most giants and group especially also got heavily involved in offering other financial services like loans or insurances on the backs of their wallets. The group has an incredibly detailed picture of its users, including how they make and spend money both online and offline.</p>
<p>Combining financial services with e-commerce and social media profiles in real time create such strong synergies that traditional institutions simply cannot compete with them. And to top things off, a few months back, Jack Ma from the Alibaba Group even expressed in his now infamous speech that he thought the law’s traditional financial institutions have to operate under strict rules on the amount of cash banks have to keep in reserves in order to avoid potential bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Chinese government was also becoming increasingly wary internationally. In 2019, vice president of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, explained why he thought the country needed an alternative to the SWIFT system. SWIFT is an organization that handles the communication for the majority of international bank transfers. Basically, most of the time somebody wants to make an international transaction. They send the message to SWIFT, who processes it and sends it to the right recipient.</p>
<p>The system is slow and ancient and the organization does most of its processing in Europe and the U.S. and the U.S. in particular has used Swift in the past to spy on transactions using the NSA. It has ceased transactions between citizens of third-party countries like Germany and Denmark that it had deemed unlawful. China, especially since the start of its trade war with the United States, sees its reliance on the swift system as a major source of danger for its sovereignty and thinks that the system could be used to essentially cut it out of the international financial world altogether.</p>
<p>And finally, China also started getting increasingly nervous about crypto currencies, as on the long term, those could potentially replace the Yuan altogether, leaving no control over its currency in the government’s hand at all. It has banned cryptocurrency exchanges and then the cryptocurrency themselves from being used as money to pay for things in the country. A couple of years down the line, cryptocurrency could become a real danger to their control over the economy.</p>
<p>China decided to turn to the digital yuan project, among other things, starting with its most urgent domestic priorities. It designed the DCEP to specifically combat mobile wallets by giving it not only the convenience of those wallets, but also many of the characteristics of a national currency like the regular Yuan. Digital Yuan is issued by the People’s Bank of China and can be withdrawn by them as well. The value of the two are designed to match. They are supposed to be freely exchangeable. Interestingly, the DCEP is also supposed to be usable even without an Internet connection, just like cash. So two users in a remote part of the country could transact on their phones and their transactions would sync back up once they got online again.</p>
<p>And importantly, the DCEP is also designed to be a legal tender again, just like a cash, meaning that, legally speaking, everybody taking digital payments into the country would have to accept it as a payment method. Once it rolls out a policy. There is no doubt specifically aimed at breaking up the quasi monopolies and which they have built over the years. And DCP intends to be just as convenient to the end user as existing mobile wallets as well. So users could get a mobile wallet from a number of approved financial institutions like banks.</p>
<p>They would sign up for an account with a phone number and then they would pay by scanning QR codes via NFC, etc.. The big difference, of course, is that it’s not Alibaba or WeChat processing the day to day transactions, but the banks, many of which are state owned and all of which are closely regulated.</p>
<p>Jack Ma disappeared from public life completely for over two months. Already, it seems clear that the government prefers to deal with the traditional finance players over the tech companies. Now, these banks will then all have to periodically report all DCEP transactions back to the government, which means the government will be able to see all transactions in the system. It could trace each one back to real human existence or phone numbers are legally required to be tied to real identities in China. It could create similarly detailed profiles of its citizens based on their shopping habits that currently WeChat and Alibaba can. It could simply directly give citizens with a DCEP wallet, money, safe or tax returns or unemployment benefits or whatever.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the first pilot programs for the currency have started in the country. Citizens don’t particularly seem to care about it, since it doesn’t seem to do functionally anything new over their existing mobile wallets already. The Chinese government theoretically has plenty of unfair advantages over commercial players. While the DCEP cuts out Swift as a middleman, which is indeed important for China, it simply adds the Chinese government as an even more powerful overlord there.</p>
<p>Instead, in its current form, the DCEB is a fully centralized system. For example, the Chinese government on its own can monitor all transactions and it can basically create and destroy money across users wallets as it pleases. While this might work domestically for its own citizens and companies, but any major country would accept doing serious business over it in its current form. International payments and decentralization for now are a big question mark.</p>
<p>The Bahamas and Cambodia technically both beat China by launching their respective digital currencies called the Sand Dollar &amp; Bakong. The Cambodian currency is even block chain based unlike China. Sand dollar might just be the coolest official currency name ever.</p>
<p>The most interesting and definitely most unfortunate example of a country trying and failing to launch a state issued cryptocurrency has to be Venezuela and it is called the Petro. It was announced in 2017 as an alternative currency backed by the country’s vast oil and mineral reserves. While the country’s regular currency was going through some of the world’s worst hyperinflation, it sadly didn’t work.</p>

				 <p>Over the past years, the question of how we can protect our identity in the world of online has been getting more heated. The Self-Sovereign Identity paradigm stepped in with the idea itself, that everyone should be in charge of their own digital personal information, and that it is the data owner who should decide on how this data is being used and by whom.</p>
<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) promises to empower European citizens with new means to manage privacy, to eliminate logins, and to enjoy much faster and safer electronic transactions via the internet as well as in real life.</p>
<p>Strengthening internet trustworthiness with electronic identities is also the aim of eSSIF-Lab, which has just launched its Second Business-oriented Open Call on 7 May 2021.</p>
<p></p> 
			   
				
				
				  2nd Business-oriented Open Call 
<p>This call is open&nbsp;for proposals to develop and demonstrate SSI working solutions for a real-world, domain-oriented problem or opportunity, in prioritized eSSIF-Lab areas (Health Tech, e-Government and Education), or in the Open Disruptive Innovation track (which is covering innovative bottom-up projects out of these verticals).</p>
<p>Proposed solutions must be commercial, competitive and sector-specific SSI applications for products and services. They are expected to leverage on the added value that previously developed functionalities within the eSSIF-Lab, to include the issuing, exchange and consumption of SSI credentials as a core element and to have high technology and investment readiness levels.</p>
<p>The proposals selected in the Second Business-oriented Call will be invited to join an 8-month acceleration programme, including business and technical support to integrate eSSIF-Lab and other SSI technology with market propositions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Who can apply? 
					  
 
 
<p>This call targets SMEs (including startups), not-for-profit entities (such as foundations or associations), or collaborative initiatives (as micro-consortia of these entities), registered in a Member State of the EU or in a H2020 associated country.</p>
<p>Deadline: 7th of July 2021, at 17:00 (Brussels Local Time).</p>
<p>Funding: up to 106,000 € per project (for those best in class).</p>

				  Infrastructure-oriented Open Call 
<p>Remember that also the Infrastructure-oriented Open Call of eSSIF-Lab is still ongoing and that the deadline to submit applications has been extended. This call looks for&nbsp;open source technical enhancements and extensions for eSSIF-Lab Framework which fall within the SSI concept (i.e. technologies which allow individuals to control their electronic identities and guard their privacy).</p>
<p>Open source SSI components developed as a result of this open call will be applied by other participants in eSSIF-Lab and, hence, applicants shall be willing and able to work in an agile way with lots of communication and interaction with other participants in the eSSIF-Lab ecosystem.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 
					 Who can apply?

<p>This month I’d like to focus on an important announcement regarding New Zealand’s Digital Identity Trust Framework that the Minister David Clark, who is both the Minister for Commerce and Consumer Affairs as well as Digital Economy and Communications, made at the last DINZ event held in Wellington.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firstly, Minister Clark, who also chairs the the new Digital Ministers’ Group, talked to us about the Digital Strategy for Aotearoa and it’s three pillars:Mahi tika (trust)Mahi tahi (inclusion)Mahi ake (growth).Mahi Tika is viewed as being critical for government and businesses as we build confidence in new processes and technology. With Mahi Tahi there is a need to make sure we bring everyone along on this digital journey. And Mahi Ake is about ensuring that New Zealand is well positioned to reap the rewards of being a digital nation and securing a bigger piece of the global pie.</p>



<p>Minister Clark&nbsp; went on to talk about the Government’s work on digital identity and he articulated how it is a crucial enabler to these three strategic pillars. He then announced that the Government has approved proposals to establish a Digital Identity Trust Framework in law.</p>



<p>He stated that the Government is committed to enhancing trust and confidence in how organisations handle personal and business identity information, that the legislation will ensure that everyone is clear on their rights and obligations and that the framework will give the tech sector a solid reference for how they can innovate and grow.</p>



<p>He also made it clear that there is a commitment to ensuring that the digital identity system reflects Māori perspectives, and that officials are engaging extensively with iwi to deliver this framework in a way that supports tikanga Māori.</p>



<p>He concluded by stating that a trusted modern digital identity system will help grow our digital economy, transform government services and ensure all New Zealanders can take part in the digital world. Here’s some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/688093/govt-ploughs-ahead-digital-identity-trust-framework-legislation/">press coverage</a>&nbsp;on Minister Clark’s announcement.</p>



<p>The announcement was followed by a lively Q&amp;A session during which Ann-Marie Cavanagh who has dual hats as Deputy Chief Executive Digital Public Service, and Deputy Government Chief Digital Officer, and Alan Bell, the Executive Director, Digital Identity took a range of questions from the floor.</p>



<p>For me there were a few key takeaways:&nbsp;The government seems to be taking development of the digital sector seriously as a key element in making New Zealand a more secure and prosperous place.&nbsp;There is an emerging strategy to assist and hopefully accelerate that developmentDigital identity is a central component of both the government’s digital strategy and in the development of our digital sector overall.&nbsp;DINZ and its members can play a pivotal role in achieving these goalsThere’s a shed load of work to do to get there!We had hoped to repeat the event on 5th of May in Auckland, but for a number of reasons that is now happening on 3rd June. Whilst there is quite a gap between the two events, both Ann-Marie Cavanagh and Alan Bell will be at the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/new-zealands-digital-identity-trust-framework-department-of-internal-affairs/">Auckland event</a>&nbsp;and this presents an awesome opportunity for those working in the digital identity space to spend some time with a couple of people who will be central to the role government plays in this space. We look forward to seeing many of you there,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/event/new-zealands-digital-identity-trust-framework-department-of-internal-affairs/">ensure you register</a>&nbsp;to secure your place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>



<p>Michael Murphy<br>Executive Director</p>

<p><a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, the decentralized network for data stream processing, and <a href="https://idx.xyz/">IDX</a>, Web3's first cross-chain identity model, are now integrated with Avalanche. Starting today, developers and users have a new, powerful way to manage identities and dynamic off-chain data in their applications.<a href="https://ceramic.network"></a></p><p>Ceramic provides developers with database-like functionality for storing all kinds of dynamic, mutable content. This finally gives developers a Web3 native way to add critical features like rich identities (profiles, reputation, social graphs), user-generated content (posts, interactions), dynamic application-data, and much more. </p><p>Developers building applications on Avalanche can easily add support for Ceramic and IDX in their application with a seamless user experience. Avalanche key pairs have been added as a supported signing and<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/#currently-supported-blockchains"> authentication method</a> for Ceramic's data streams, so users can now perform transactions on Ceramic with their existing Avalanche wallets.</p> Blockchain, Data &amp; Identity: a full stack for Web3 developers <p>Avalanche offers developers the most scalable infrastructure for building decentralized apps and services. It is the first decentralized smart contracts platform built for the scale of global finance, with near-instant transaction finality. Ethereum developers can quickly build on Avalanche as Solidity works out-of-the-box.</p><p>Great Web3 and DeFi apps require more than a smart contract platform, however. They also need sophisticated, scalable and dependable data management infrastructure.</p><p>Ceramic provides advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. Now that Avalanche and Ceramic can easily be used together, developers can:</p>  Build data-rich user experiences and social features on fully decentralized tech  Give users cloud-like backup, sync and recovery without running a centralized server  Publish content on the open web without the need to anchor IPFS hashes on-chain  Leverage interoperable profiles, social graphs and reputations across the Web3 ecosystem  <p><a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">Ceramic's unique stream-based architecture</a> is designed for web-scale volume and latency and to handle any type of data model. Built on top of open standards including IPFS, libp2p, and DIDs and compatible with any raw storage protocol like Filecoin or Arweave, all information stored on Ceramic exists within a permissionless cross-chain network that lets developers tap into an ever growing library of identities and data while using their preferred stack.</p> IDX: Cross-chain identity and user-centric data <p>Identity is the first use case enabled by Ceramic's building blocks for open source information.<a href="http://idx.xyz"> IDX (identity index)</a> is a cross-chain identity protocol that inherits Ceramic's properties to provide developers with a user-centric replacement for server-siloed user tables. By making it easy to structure and associate data to user's personal index, IDX lets applications save, discover and route to users' data.</p><p>The IDX SDK makes it simple to manage users and deliver great data-driven experiences using the same keys and wallets as developers and users are already relying on. Users can also link multiple keys, from any wallet and multiple blockchains, to the same identity. This is essential to developers who want to serve users over time, as it enables key rotation, data interoperability across accounts, and rich cross-chain profiles, reputations and experiences (including 50,000+ profiles on Ethereum today).</p> Getting started with Ceramic on Avalanche   To install Avalanche, follow this quickstart guide for <a href="https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/nodes-and-staking/run-avalanche-node">running an avalanche node</a>  To add IDX to your project, follow this<a href="https://developers.idx.xyz/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  To use Ceramic for streams without IDX, follow this<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/installation/"> installation guide</a>  Regardless of which option you choose, you should also select 3ID Connect as your DID wallet during the<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/"> authentication</a> process which handles the integration with Avalanche wallets  For questions or support, join the<a href="https://chat.ceramic.network"> Ceramic Discord</a> and the Avalanche discord    About Avalanche <p>Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem.

<p>In the last year, Blockchain Commons has produced a large collection of specifications, reference libraries, architectures, and reference utilities meant to improve blockchain infrastructure by enabling interoperability among Bitcoin wallets — and in the future, other cryptocurrency applications, such as Ethereum wallets, and other cryptography programs, such as chat systems, key management programs, and more.</p>

<p>So, what do Blockchain Commons’ technologies do? We’ve just released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">a Technology Overview video</a> that discuses the concepts and foundations underlying our work and also highlights many of our most important technological releases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY"></a></p>

<p>As the video notes, our work is built on a considerable volume of existing literature. We work with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m56s">entropy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m39s">seeds</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m45s">keys</a> and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=6m34s">airgaps</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=5m12s">multisigs</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m6s">secure storage</a> to ensure robust key creation, safe key usage, and responsible key management. We also build on crucial technological foundations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m13s">CBOR</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m37s">CRC-32</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=14m53s">Fountain Codes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=8m15s">QRs</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=12m55s">SHA-256</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=13m36s">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a>.</p>

<p>This results in a number of core Blockchain Commons technologies:
</p>
 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=16m21s">Bytewords</a> are a text-encoding method for binary data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=19m58s">Uniform Resources</a> support self-describing data that can be used interoperably. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=24m55s">LifeHash</a> allows for graphical recognition of seeds, keys, and other data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=26m52s">SSKR</a> provides new libraries and methodologies for sharding secrets. 
   The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=28m46s">Torgap</a> architecture creates security by partitioning blockchain services. 
 

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">Technology Overview video</a> discusses all of this and more.</p>

<p>We are also continuing to produce documents of use for the entire blockchain community, with our newest tutorials offering more depth on how to use the technologies highlighted in this video. That begins with some just-published developer-focused documents that expand on the overview of Uniform Resources (URs) found in the video. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources: An Overview</a> explains how URs are put together, and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-2-keys.md">A Guide to Using URs for Key Material</a> looks at <code>ur:crypto-seed</code>, <code>ur:crypto-bip39</code>, and <code>ur:crypto-hdkey</code> as three different ways to transmit key material in a standardized, typed format. (We have more UR docs planned on SSKRs, PSBTs, and our new request and response system.)</p>

<p>The specifications, architectures, references, and documents that we’re creating at Blockchain Commons are all meant to improve interoperability among many different vendors, to support the creation of wallets (and future cryptography applications) that enable independence, security, and resilience for their users. We’ve been working with an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> to create these various technologies. If you’re designing blockchain applications of your own, we hope you’ll view the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">video</a> to see how some of our technologies can help you.</p>

<p>You can also support the continued development of technologies like these, meant to support the entire community by becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor at GitHub</a> or by making a one-time donation <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">at our BTCPay</a>.</p>

<p>Federal agencies should choose FIDO as they seek to comply with the new Executive Order that requires the implementation of multi-factor authentication within the next 180 days.</p>



<p>By: Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and Chief Marketing Officer, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>In the face of recent attacks that have exposed areas of weakness in critical U.S. infrastructure assets, President Biden signed a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order Wednesday to help bolster the nation’s cybersecurity</a>.</p>



<p>There have been a number of high profile attacks against critical American infrastructure in recent months, including the Solarwinds supply chain attack that exposed much of the government to potential risk. Top of mind in recent days is the ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline, which significantly impacted the flow of refined oil across America. These attacks expose the vulnerability of critical infrastructure in the United States, and the Biden Administration is issuing federal directives that will minimize or eliminate risk.</p>



<p>A key part of the Executive Order is a requirement that agencies adopt multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent possible. Federal Civilian Branch Agencies will have 180 days to comply with the Executive Order and will need to report on progress every 60 days until adoption is complete. If for some reason agencies cannot fully adopt MFA and encryption within 180 days, they must report to Secretary of Homeland Security through the Director of CISA, the Director of OMB, and the APNSA with a rationale for not meeting the deadline.</p>



<p>At the FIDO Alliance, we welcome today’s directive from the Biden Administration and applaud its focus on the importance of multi-factor authentication. What’s notable about this Executive Order is that the White House is prioritizing MFA everywhere, rather than limiting MFA to the PIV/PKI platform that agencies have depended on for more than 15 years. Today’s Executive Order marks an important step forward, in that it makes clear the priority is protecting every account with MFA — without mandating any specific technology. This is a notable shift, because we know that the weakest forms of MFA can still stop some attacks where passwords are the attack vector. We also know that FIDO Authentication is the only standards-based alternative to PIV for those applications that need protection against phishing attacks. This Executive Order opens the door for agencies to deploy FIDO Authentication — something we’ve heard they’ve wanted to do but have held back as use of any non-PIV authentication has not been permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time the U.S Government has advocated for the use of MFA and strong encryption. In an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Insights_Actions_to_Counter_Email-Based_Attacks_on_Election-Related_S508C.pdf">advisory</a> issued by CISA in September 2020 on election security, the government agency noted that the majority of cyber-espionage incidents are enabled by phishing, and FIDO security keys are the only form of MFA that offer protection from phishing attacks 100% of the time.</p>



<p>In fact, the U.S. Government hasn’t just been advocating for the use of strong authentication with FIDO, it has actually already been implementing it since at least 2018 on the <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> portal. With <a href="http://login.gov">login.gov</a> the U.S. Government is already offering a secure approach to help citizens and agencies to securely access Federal resources. In June 2019, the FIDO Alliance hosted a <a href="http://www.apple.com">webinar</a> detailing the deployment case study for login.gov, which is now even more timely with the need for agencies to adopt strong authentication in the next 180 days.</p>



<p>Since its inception, the FIDO Alliance has been bringing industry partners together, including every major operating system vendor as well as technology and consumer service providers across all industry verticals including financial services, ecommerce and government. All those diverse groups have been working together in common purpose to standardize strong authentication. Billions of devices around the world today can support FIDO Authentication and are ready to play their part in ensuring a strong authentication future. The fact that most major cloud providers, device manufacturers and browser vendors all ship with support for FIDO means that agencies can easily leverage MFA that is built in, rather than other products that need to be “bolted on.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there is one thing that the recent spate of attacks has served to once again remind us, it’s that the private sector and public sector need strong security measures to protect critical infrastructure — and the FIDO Alliance believes this begins with authentication.</p>



<p>We urge government agencies to adopt only the strongest forms of MFA when complying with this directive. The FIDO Alliance and its members stand ready to serve and help agencies with the education, resources and tools to implement strong authentication to help reduce risk and improve the cybersecurity posture of the U.S. Government.</p>

Schema.org will integrate feedback into its <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/blob/main/docs/validator.md">draft</a> documentation and add it more explicitly to the Schema.org website for the next official release.  <br>  SDTT is a tool from Google which began life as the&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2010/09/rich-snippets-testing-tool-improvements">Rich Snippets Testing Tool </a>back in 2010. Last year Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/07/rich-results-test-out-of-beta">announced plans</a> to migrate from SDTT to successor tooling, the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results">Rich Results Test</a>, alongside plans to "deprecate the Structured Data Testing Tool". The newer Google tooling is focused on helping publishers who are targeting specific schema.org-powered <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery">searc</a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/#">h features</a> offered by Google, and for these purposes is a huge improvement as it contextualizes many warnings and errors to a specific target application. <br>  However, many publishers had also appreciated SDTT as a powerful and general purpose structured data validator. Headlines such as "<a href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-deprecate-the-structured-data-testing-tool-29737.html">Google Structured Data Testing Tool Going Away; SEOs Are Not Happy</a>" captured something of the mood.  <br>  Schema.org started out written only in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microdata_(HTML)">Microdata</a>, before embracing&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/11/using-rdfa-11-lite-with-schemaorg.html">RDFa 1.1 Lite</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2013/06/schemaorg-and-json-ld.html">JSON-LD 1.0</a>. There are now huge amounts of Schema.org data in all of these formats and more (see&nbsp;<a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/#results-2020-1">webdatacommons</a>&nbsp;report). Schema.org endorsed these multiple encodings, because they can each meet different needs and constraints experienced by publishers. The new validator will check all of these formats.  <br>   Amongst all this complexity, it is important to remind ourselves of the importance of simplicity and usability of Schema.org markup for its founding purpose: machine-readable summaries of ordinary web page content. Markup that - when well-formed - helps real people find jobs, educational opportunities, images they can <a href="https://iptc.org/news/schema-org-update-for-better-mapping-to-iptc-photo-metadata/">re-use</a>, learn from fact checkers or find a recipe to cook for dinner.  <br>  This is the focus of the new Schema Markup Validator (SMV). It is simpler than its predecessor SDTT because it is dedicated to checking that you're using JSON-LD, RDFa and Microdata in widely understood ways, and to warning you if you are using Schema.org types and properties in unusual combinations. It does not try to check your content against the information needs of specific services, tools or products (a topic deserving its own blog post). But it will help you understand whether or not your data expresses what you hope it expresses, and to reflect the essence of your structured data back in an intuitive way that reflects its underlying meaning.   <br>  The <a href="http://validator.schema.org">validator.schema.org</a>&nbsp;service&nbsp;is powered by Google's general infrastructure for working with structured data, and is provided to the Schema.org project as a Google-hosted tool. We are also happy to note that many other schema.org-oriented validators are available, both commercial (e.g. <a href="https://yandex.com/support/webmaster/yandex-indexing/validator.html">Yandex's</a>) and opensource. For example, the <a href="http://linter.structured-data.org/">Structured Data Linter,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/playground/">JSON-LD Playground</a>, <a href="https://github.com/semantifyit/sdo-check/">SDO-Check</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/schemarama/">Schemarama</a>&nbsp;tools. We hope that the new Schema Markup Validator will stimulate collaboration among tool makers to improve consistency and developer experience for all those working on systems that consume Schema.org data.&nbsp;  <br>  Please share any feedback with the Schema.org community via <a href="https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2790">Github</a>, Twitter (#schemasmv), or the Schema.org W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg/">community group</a>.

This agreement signifies the commitment of both organizations to mutual cooperation and recognition for each other’s mandates. Sovrin and ToIP intend to work together toward advancing the infrastructure and governance required for digital trust and digital identity ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“By signing this Letter Agreement, Sovrin and ToIP are excited to take a step further to support the need and importance of our separate but interrelated mandates to benefit people and organizations across all social and economic sectors through secure digital identity ecosystems based on verifiable credentials and SSI,” said Chris Raczkowski, Chairman of Board of Trustees, Sovrin Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the agreement, each organization will assign one member to act as a liaison to coordinate and maintain lines of communication, attend plenary sessions, and provide periodic updates to the Sovrin Board of Trustees and ToIP Steering Committee. They will also seek opportunities proactively to exchange information, participate in discussions of shared interest, promote the value of each other’s work through joint announcements and media products, as well as collaborate to achieve their respective mandates.</p>



<p>Sovrin and ToIP both operate in a manner that respects open licensing, open source code and open standards. The organizations agree that their open, public materials will be available for reference (with attribution) by the other.</p>



<p>“ToIP and Sovrin each offer something unique to the market. Our members already collaborate together informally on many topics. Signing this agreement makes our work together more visible and open. It will create new opportunities to collaborate on challenges that affect every layer of our trust model,”&nbsp; said John Jordan, Executive Director of Trust over IP Foundation. “By working together, we want to help solve interoperability problems more quickly and support the adoption of digital trust ecosystems more widely.””&nbsp;</p>

  What is the mission and vision of BlueShore Financial?  



<p>BlueShore Financial’s mission: “Passionately improving our clients’ financial well-being in an interconnected, digital world.”</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Trustworthy digital identity is&nbsp;critical to enable the continued&nbsp;development of a robust digital economy in Canada, and the potential direct and indirect benefits that come with it for all Canadians. Furthermore, lack of&nbsp; a common trusted digital identity approach could result in a patchwork of various digital ID schemes, which would not only cause confusion for Canadians (and thus much slower adoption), but also create easy targets for cyber criminals.</p>



<p>From a financial industry perspective, a trustworthy digital ID is a critical component to successfully implement Open Banking, one of the globally accepted key trends in banking.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Two of the&nbsp;most populous&nbsp;countries in the world have established digital IDs: India with its government issued Unique ID (UID) number—or Aadhaar—identity program, and China with its digital identify provided by Ant Financial. These two countries are most populous with emerging economies. To remain a global player, Canada has to be able to compete with the likes of India and China when it comes to technology-savviness</p>



 <a href="https://www.blueshorefinancial.com/"></a> 



<p>Several other countries now have national digital identify programs and while these programs may not be perfect, they are evolving – Canada needs to do the same. Canada needs to start with a digital identity program, and then use an agile and iterative approach to evolve and keep up with new technologies as well as consumer needs and demands. Since Canada is somewhat late to the game, Canada can learn from the experience of other countries in both technology implementations and consumer rollout, which I know DIACC and its members from across the spectrum of government, finance, healthcare, telco, retail, auditors, etc., are discussing and working through DIACC Pan-Canadian Trusted Framework approach.</p>



<p>BlueShore addresses the challenges in two ways:</p>



<p>I.&nbsp;Internally we see digital identity as a core component of our digital transformation journey.</p>



<p>II. Broadly, digital identity is part of our conversations from Open Banking, to Payments Modernization to Data Privacy.&nbsp;We also work closely and in a “spirit of partnership” with our core technology partners.</p>



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada has a role to play as a G7 member to show digital leadership with respect to developing and launching a national digital identity program. Not only would this provide opportunities for Canadian businesses, but it would also demonstrate a model of how government and industries are able to work together to provide a key digital tool for Canadian consumers.</p>



<p>5. Why did your organization join the DIACC?</p>



<p>BlueShore saw the work DIACC and&nbsp;its members were doing defining, creating and building a national digital identity framework. It was this framework approach that attracted our attention to bolster our digital transformation&nbsp;work.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>BlueShore Financial is a boutique financial institution providing a full range of personal and business banking, wealth management, insurance and commercial lending solutions.

  What is the mission and vision of Yubico?  



<p>Yubico was founded in Sweden with the mission to protect all internet citizens, making secure login easy and available to everyone.</p>



<p>2. Why is trustworthy digital identity critical for existing and emerging markets?</p>



<p>Stolen credentials are a top online security risk for individuals and companies. Breaches cause severe financial, brand, and personal impact. It’s critical that people, and organizations, have access to solutions for all their different requirements.</p>



<p>3. How will digital identity transform the Canadian and global economy? How does your organization address challenges associated with this transformation?</p>



<p>Digital identity is critical for citizens, governments, and the private sector. As our lives move more and more online, our ability to identify ourselves in a secure, easy way will be key in order to access government systems, banking, and interact with goods and services providers.</p>



 <a href="https://www.yubico.com/"></a> 



<p>4. What role does Canada have to play as a leader in this space?</p>



<p>Canada has the opportunity to be a world leader in the digital identity space. Our emergence as a highly desirable destination for up-and-coming tech companies, along with the coinciding tech talent, places Canada in a unique position.&nbsp;In order to capitalize on&nbsp;Canada’s emergence, it will require a strong partnership between the private and public sectors to help enable citizens, clients, and employees to have a safe online experience. Organizations like the DIACC are paramount in bringing together the key stakeholders to help achieve this shared goal that will truly benefit every Canadian.</p>



<p>5. Why did Yubico join the DIACC?</p>



<p>Yubico has been a leader and innovator in the authentication space for over a decade. In 2020 Yubico decided to put its first sales and technical resources in Canada due to the growing demand for our products. DIACC has a reputation for bringing together like-minded organizations and people that share a vision of improved digital identity.</p>



<p>6. What else should we know about your organization?</p>



<p>Yubico pioneered the design of the first one-time password authenticator to work with a simple touch and with no client software, and we made it compatible with the open authentication standard OATH. We then further secured and simplified the PIV smart card standard by adding touch-to-sign and built-in attestation. Yubico collaborated with Google and Microsoft to co-create the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) and FIDO2 open authentication standards. Our work has contributed to open identity standards organizations W3C, IETF, FIDO Alliance and OpenID.</p>

 A Deep Dive into Five&nbsp;Laws <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/44595d5b-5150-4b26-9c39-be4361d73c7a">Photo</a> by: Mike Licht. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>In March 2021 Russia used the latest in a series of newly passed Internet laws for the <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news73464.htm">first time</a>. The ‘sovereign’ 2019 law was used to throttle Twitter’s speed by 50% on desktops and by 100% on mobile phones. This move was triggered by Twitter’s <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2021/03/10/russia-slows-twitter-over-failure-to-remove-content-they-say-is-illegal">non-action</a> in deleting content considered illegal by the Roskomnadzor (RKN), Russia’s federal authority overseeing online and media content. This illegal content included the Twitter accounts of several government critics, such as Mihkail Khodorkovsky. This government action was legitimized through the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50259597">Sovereign Internet law of 2019</a>, which empowers the RKN to respond through appropriate measures to “security threats to the Internet’s functioning inside Russia” such as “changing the configuration/routes of communications/telecommunications.”</p><p>Over the past few years, the Russian Parliament has passed <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/11/01/russias-sovereign-internet-law-comes-into-force-a68002">over fifty pieces of legislation</a> in an attempt to further control and hegemonize the Russian Internet infrastructure, both internally and externally. While the official justification for these laws is to create a more ‘reliable’ internet, in actuality, some of these laws have provided nearly unfettered freedom to the government to preemptively block and filter content and independently — without relying on Internet intermediaries, or on securing prior judicial sanctions.</p><p>This article hopes to shed light on the top five most important of these laws or combination of laws and their consequential effect in crippling Russian democracy, freedom of speech, and privacy&nbsp;rights.</p> Number 1: Laws mandating identification and de-anonymization <p>A <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/addwork/scans.nsf/ID/B6DD5C7F">2017 law</a> and the following <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201811060001?index=2&amp;rangeSize=1?index=2&amp;rangeSize=1">government regulation in 2018</a>, have effectively eliminated any means for Russian citizens to raise their concerns with the government anonymously without the fear of facing backlash. The law has mandated that every user of an online application which can be used for “receiving, transferring, delivering or processing users’ electronic messages on the internet” has to link their account with a registered mobile number so that they can be identified and tracked if need be. Non-compliance by platforms leads to an imposition of a fine amounting to USD 82 for individuals, USD 800 for officials, and USD 16,500 for companies. Per the law, non-compliance may also lead to the blocking of the platform in Russian territory. It is a small respite that at the moment, these laws are only applicable to online messaging platforms, relieving other OSPs from the compulsory linking of accounts for the time&nbsp;being.</p><p>Further, the 2018 regulation, which is yet to be implemented, requires such online messaging applications have to partner with mobile operators to ensure that the latter are willing to confirm the identity of any of its users within twenty minutes of such information being sought. As with most other laws discussed in this article, the penalty for non-compliance is the blocking of the online&nbsp;service.</p><p>This law hits at the heart of an important way in which online communication can foster open dialogue — the ability to stay anonymous, especially when showing dissent. It would also have a major impact on citizens’ ability to express their <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_148270/3d0cac60971a511280cbba229d9b6329c07731f7/">religion</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/09/russia-escalating-persecution-jehovahs-witnesses">faith</a>, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/russian-constitution-change-ends-hopes-gay-marriage-n1233639">sexuality</a>, which have long been penalized by the Russian government.</p> Number 2: The double-edged sword of content moderation laws <p>In 2013, the <a href="https://wilmap.law.stanford.edu/entries/federal-law-no-398-fz-amending-federal-law-information-information-technologies-and">Logovoy Law</a> was passed, which empowered government officials to block content ‘calling for unsanctioned public events that disturb public order’ within 24 hours and without a court order. In 2019, another <a href="https://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/1058572-7">draft law</a>, yet to be passed, would give Russian authorities the ability to block websites that censor Russian state media content. Ironically, the reason that the bill provides for this is that such websites violate Russian citizens’ right to access information.</p><p>In 2019, <a href="https://wilmap.law.stanford.edu/entries/federal-law-no-31-fz-amending-article-153-federal-law-information-information-technologies">four sets of laws</a> were passed that have had the cumulative effect of prohibiting the dissemination of “fake news” and news that is deemed “disrespectful” to the state and government officials. The RKN has the authority to delete such information with immediate effect. The stipulated fine for non-removal amounts to USD 6,400 for individuals and up to USD 24,000 for companies. Repeat offenders “disrespecting” the state could also be imprisoned for up to fifteen days. As a brief aside, the term “disrespectful” being used as a measure for potential jail time brings to mind a 2014 <a href="https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/">judgment</a> of the Indian Supreme Court that held the word “annoyance”, in the same context and for similar penalties, as vague and overbroad.</p><p>In 2020, the <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_372647/">Federal law N482-FZ</a> was passed, which was a sophisticated version of the 2019 draft law discussed above. It essentially penalized OSPs such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter for censoring Russian state media content. For context, there has been substantial research to show that Russian state media spreads disinformation among its citizens and globally. For instance, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/70/5/623/5912109">this</a> paper highlights how RT (formerly, Russia Today) is an “opportunistic channel that is used as an instrument of state defense policy to meddle in the politics of other states”. However, if any of the tech giants censor content like RT’s, they can now be fined or potentially blocked.</p><p>Finally, in January 2021, the Russian parliament has started <a href="https://ria.ru/20210125/blokirovka-1594461448.html">working on a draft law</a> to fine social media for “illegally blocking users”. This move seems to be a consequence of the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">ban</a> on USA former President Donald Trump’s Twitter&nbsp;account.</p> Number 3: Surveillance through laws on forced Data Retention and Data Localisation <p>The 2016 “Yarovaya amendments”, which have been named after their primary author and member of the State Duma (Russian Parliament’s legislative wing), Irina Yarovaya, provides for compulsory retention of all communications for six months. This includes text messages, voice messages, images, and videos. In addition, it also provides that the metadata that marks the location, timestamp, sender, and receiver of the messages, be retained for three years. The amendments also mandate that this data be stored on Russian territory and that the government be given unfettered access to this data without any prior judicial sanction. Since 2016, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook have been penalized for non-compliance. While Twitter and Facebook were <a href="https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/02/13/russian-court-fines-twitter-62-840-dollars-for-refusing-to-localize-user-data">fined</a> approximately USD 50,000 each, the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/17/russia-blocks-access-to-linkedin-over-foreign-held-data">blocked</a> LinkedIn from the Russian territory entirely. Further, in 2019, the fines for non-compliance with data storage requirements have been <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/09/02/fsb-prikaz432-site-dok.html">increased to USD&nbsp;78,000</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the amendments <a href="https://rg.ru/2016/09/02/fsb-prikaz432-site-dok.html">make way</a> for ‘back door’ access to all such data by requiring companies to provide the government with ‘any information necessary’ to decode electronic messages. This drastically weakens the security of such information and weakens encryption measures.</p><p>The Yarovaya amendments requirement to provide a direct and unrestricted back door to access data, coupled with the compulsion to not only localize data but also to retain it for long periods of time effectively means that every conversation/post/discussion can potentially be served on a platter to the Russian government. This is a sticky situation for all involved, but especially for human rights activists, political rights activists, and journalists, such as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/30/kremlin-may-be-slowly-killing-alexei-navalny-prison-world-must-not-let-it-happen/">Alexei Navalny</a>, who will be acutely aware that their conversations and metadata, oftentimes confidential, are exposed to the domestic intelligence agencies. This hampers their ability to work and engage in very important and democratic dialogue&nbsp;freely.</p><p>The full implications of such a law were on display in April last year, when the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/04/13/telegram-loses-free-expression-battle-russian-authorities">RKN blocked Telegram</a>, a messaging app with over 10 million Russian users, for refusing to provide encryption keys to the government. RKN also ordered the <a href="https://usher2.club/en/">blocking of over 18 million IP addresses</a>, used by Telegram to operate in Russia. This led to chaos and affected many legitimate online services including maps, airline booking, and online shopping, among&nbsp;others.</p> Number 4: Laws Banning IP addresses and regulating VPNs and&nbsp;Proxys <p>The various pieces of legislation discussed in this article have been further bolstered by a <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2018/06/05/gosduma-vvela-shtrafy-za-narushenie-zakona-ob-anonimayzerah">2017 law</a> that imposes fines on Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for allowing users access to content banned by Russian authorities or for providing guidance to access such content. In a<a href="https://rg.ru/2017/07/30/fz276-site-dok.html"> bill introduced in 2018</a>, a fine of USD 9,000 was stipulated for non-compliance. This 2018 bill was a result of the above-mentioned ‘Telegram blocking’ incident, after which many <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/39035/">Russians turned to VPNs</a> to be able to continue&nbsp;business</p><p>Further, a <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2019/03/28/roskomnadzor-vpervye-potreboval-ot-vpn-servisov-podklyuchitsya-k-reestru-zapreschennyh-saytov">2019 regulation</a> now requires that VPNs and search engine platforms stay updated with a list of blocked websites maintained by the federal government and on the basis of this list, block access to those websites on their platform.</p> Number 5: Law creating an independent Russian Internet Infrastructure <p>The crown for the most restrictive law proposed by the Russian parliament arguably goes to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50259597">Sovereign Internet Law of 2019</a>. It seems that the Russian government fully understands and fears the extent to which online foreign threats are able to impact domestic outcomes (wonder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/russian-election-hacking">why</a>!). Under the garb of ensuring cybersecurity and preventing the Russian territory from such threats, the Sovereign Internet Law has the effect of putting the entire Russian internet infrastructure in a bubble of sorts. The law legitimizes the ‘<a href="https://medium.com/enrique-dans/understanding-the-splinternet-can-the-world-ever-be-truly-global-97262a60678c">splinternet</a>’ within Russian territory — it provides that at any time that the Russian government sees the need to cut off Russia from the rest of the world, it can take control of this bubble and isolate it from the rest of the world wide web and the global Internet infrastructure.</p><p>While on paper, such a national Internet infrastructure is a reasonable backup plan for “emergencies” to combat any foreign threats, it is left entirely up to the officials to decide what would qualify as such a threat. Hence, the effect of this law will be a complete transfer of control to the Russian government over all aspects of the internet, both content and infrastructure, including, of course, the power to trigger internet shutdowns and removing any content that is deemed undesirable, without any prior judicial authorization.</p><p>This is the first global attempt of its kind. Even China has a firewall that filters parts of the Internet but does not create a separate infrastructure of a ‘national’ Internet. Moreover, China’s introduction to the Internet from the very beginning had been controlled, unlike Russia, which has freely provided Internet access to its citizens over the past few decades. This is an additional reason why the ‘internet bubble’ that the Russian government seeks to create may be a problematic endeavor.</p><p>Even though the law imposes compulsory installation of certain technical equipment and procedures for all OSPs, including deep packet inspections, to enable the “Russian Bubble” infrastructure, technologists also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775366588/russian-law-takes-effect-that-gives-government-sweeping-power-over-internet">argue that this may be technically impossible</a>, somewhat like a situation where one expects the first floor of a building to be filled up with water without the ground floor receiving any water influx at&nbsp;all.</p> Taking stock of this cautionary tale <p>Russia has some of the most disproportionate laws for Internet regulation in the world and maybe that helps explain why it continues to remain ‘<a href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores">not free</a>’ as per Freedom House’s World Freedom Index 2021. In the same vein, in June 2020, the European Court of Human Rights <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#%7B">found</a> in four separate cases brought against Russia by local media outlets and OSPs that blocking entire websites violates the owners’ right to impart information and the public’s right to receive it. Despite this, Russia has, yet again, threatened to ban Twitter in March&nbsp;2021.</p><p>For Russian citizens, Russia’s web of Internet laws is broken and continues to be one of the most disproportionately restrictive in the world. Moving forward, it is imperative that laws restricting a citizens’ right to freedom of speech and/or their right to privacy be weighed against the important and age-old principles carved under human rights instruments such as the <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights </a>and the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>.

 Until AI has completely eliminated human biases, can its results be considered any more trustworthy than a&nbsp;human’s? <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59202267@N08/39225139155">Photo</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/59202267@N08">Electronic_Frontier_Foundation</a>: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;atype=rich">CC BY&nbsp;2.0</a><p>Facial recognition technology is becoming more powerful and more ubiquitous seemingly every day. In January 2021, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79310-1">study</a> found that a facial recognition algorithm could be better at deducing a person’s political orientation than a human judgment or a personality test. Similarly, earlier this week, the Dubai airport rolled out technology through which an <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/middle-east/the-future-is-coming-at-dubai-airport-passengers-identity-confirmed-by-iris-scans-20210308-p578mx.html">iris-scanner would verify one’s identity</a> and eliminate the need for any human interaction when entering or exiting the&nbsp;country.</p><p>The use of facial recognition by law enforcement agencies has become common practice, despite increasing reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html">false arrests</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html">jail time</a>. While there are various downsides to facial recognition technology being used at all, including fears of mass surveillance and invasion of privacy, there are flaws within facial recognition technologies themselves that lead to inaccurate results. One such major challenge for this still-burgeoning technology is gender-based inaccuracies.</p><p>Research has indicated that women are 18% more likely to be misidentified through facial recognition than men. One line of <a href="https://medium.com/@Joy.Buolamwini/response-racial-and-gender-bias-in-amazon-rekognition-commercial-ai-system-for-analyzing-faces-a289222eeced">research found that</a> while Amazon’s Rekognition software’s ability to recognize white women’s faces was down to 92.9%, a darker-skinned woman’s recognition would only be 68.9% accurate. Similarly, a study conducted at the University of Washington revealed that a facial recognition tool was <a href="http://markyatskar.com//publications/bias.pdf">68% more likely to predict that an image of a person cooking in the kitchen is that of a woman</a>. These are clear patterns exhibiting sexism in AI and the use of such technologies for law enforcement is likely to disproportionately affect marginalized groups of people, including genders other than male and&nbsp;female.</p><p>It is true that once a leap in technology has been made, hoping to be able to wipe it off the face of the earth may be a little like trying to put a genie back in a bottle. A more probable step in the right direction could be to first, feed representative and better data sets to AIs, and second, deploy the technology only with substantial democratic oversight.</p><p>Data scientists at the MIT Media Lab have <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212">noted</a> that in the instances where they have trained AI with more diverse data, the accuracy of the results has been less discriminatory and accurate. Hence, presenting AI with a diverse representation of datasets for it to learn from would be a great start in reversing the prevalent biases. Additionally, these technologies would also benefit if the providers of the facial recognition software are transparent about its underlying workings.</p><p>This transparency, if accompanied with democratic oversight regarding the application, could potentially aim at striking a better balance as to when, where, how and to what end facial recognition may be used. For example, such oversight could be in the form of regulations that set an industry standard that an AI must meet before its commercial application. However, regardless of how many leaps facial recognition takes in the coming years, a serious, deliberate discussion is necessary for determining whether facial recognition should be used by law enforcement at all. This is because the consequences of error are so grave. The European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/artificial-intelligence">will release </a>its first legislative proposal later this year and it will be interesting to see how the proposal will attempt to regulate AI application.</p><p>Former UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye’s <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/un-special-rapporteur-report-artificial-intelligence-impact-human-rights/">warning</a> that AI will enforce bias is more pertinent now than ever before. However, until the day that AI has completely eliminated human biases, can its results be considered any more trustworthy than a&nbsp;human’s?</p><p>About the author: <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/shreya-tewari">Shreya</a> is an Employee Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center, where she works on the Lumen Project.

 Steering Committee Elections - nominate now 
<p>We made a quick <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/nominations-for-the-steering-committee-election-now-open/">explainer</a> on our blog to clear up the procedure in anticipation of next month's elections.<br>

 DIF Grants 
<p>The DIF has officially launched a lightweight mini-grant program so that members (or the Steering Committee itself) can directly and transparently incentivize community contributions like editorship of a spec or implementations of specs. For more information, see our <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/introducing-dif-grants/">new blog</a>.</p>
 Killer Whale Jello Bowl Death Match Redux: The Reckoning 
<p>At #IIW32, a mammoth and consequential conversation spanned 4 intense, jam-packed sessions and set new highs for IIW session-name silliness culminating in a massive interoperability watershed and widespread buy-in from many communities! The details of what gets built are being worked out in a <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-presentation-exchange">new work item</a> of the Claims &amp; Credentials WG, building on the recent donation to DIF of the Bloom WACI extension to Presentation Exchange. The goal is both a minimum viable implementable spec for cross-stack credential exchange ("v0.1 scope"), and a longer-term commitment to a more fully-featured iteration of the same spec ("v1 scope"). Stay tuned!</p>

Read the first post in this series, “An Introduction to Ideas, Rules, and Power and How They Shape Our Democracy and Economy”&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-an-introduction-to-ideas-rules-and-power-and-how-they-shape-our-4df8017b23de">here</a>.</p><p>By Audrey Stienon, Analyst, Reimagining Capitalism</p><p>The current&nbsp;context</p><p>Last summer, the protests and demonstrations that erupted across the country in response to the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and too many others prompted many funders, including Omidyar Network, to think more critically about our role within a system that perpetuates racial injustice. We wanted to determine ways in which we could use our power and privilege to contribute to dismantling white supremacy (you can read more about our commitments <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/dream-we-did-act-we-must-a-commitment-to-action-c06781f244da">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/an-investment-in-justice-bad462284f27">here</a>).</p><p>While criminal justice and policing reform is not one of our focus areas at Omidyar Network, there is a close link between economic injustice and racial violence, which is why we called out the need to build an explicitly anti-racist and inclusive economy as the second pillar upholding our <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Guide-Design_V12_JTB05_interactive-1.pdf">reimagined vision for capitalism.</a> It is impossible to build a more just and equitable economy without directly addressing the ways in which our existing economy was intentionally designed to uphold white supremacy by excluding people from opportunities to participate fully in markets based on their race — not to mention gender, class, nationality, disability, and other forms of human diversity.</p><p>Our conviction in the necessity of this pillar has only been compounded by the evidence of the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>In the six weeks that it has taken to write and edit this piece, there have been two mass shootings in Atlanta and Indianapolis that targeted Asian Americans. Police officers killed 20-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/daunte-wright-death-minnesota.html">Daunte Wright</a> in Minnesota, 13-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/us/adam-toledo-chicago-police-shooting.html">Adam Toledo</a> in Chicago, and 16-year-old <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/us/makhia-bryant.html">Ma’Khia Bryant</a> in Ohio. A ceaseless drumbeat of violence and trauma continue unabated, with only a glimmer of accountability in the trial and <a href="https://omidyar.com/statement-from-omidyar-network-on-derek-chauvin-verdict-the-first-step-to-justice/">conviction of Derek Chauvin</a> for the murder of George&nbsp;Floyd.</p><p>Meanwhile, the pandemic has exposed the extent to which the prejudices of the past remain embedded in the institutions and systems that we rely on today — to disastrous effect.</p><p>During the initial wave of the pandemic, many spoke of COVID as a great equalizer — a universal threat indifferent to our race, nationality, or class. Yet it quickly became clear that, although the virus itself cannot discriminate, our healthcare and economic structures certainly can and do. Every aspect of the pandemic and our healthcare response was impacted by race. The virus itself spread more quickly in communities of color, and took a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/racial-ethnic-disparities/disparities-illness.html">greater toll</a> on welfare and lives. Meanwhile, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-neighborhoods-access-covid-19-testing-sites-analysis/story?id=71884719">COVID tests</a> and <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200716.620294/full/">lifesaving PPE</a> were more readily available in white neighborhoods at the beginning of the pandemic — and many of these inequities persist.</p><p>The effects of the economic recession are similarly shaped by race. As new data from our recent <a href="https://www.gallup.com/education/267590/great-jobs-report.aspx">Great Jobs survey with Gallup confirms</a>, Black, Latinx, and Asian-American and Pacific Islander workers are <a href="https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-Frontline-Workers.pdf">over-represented in essential, frontline industries</a> such as health care, transportation, and retail, causing them to face greater risk of COVID exposure. Even as our economy has inched toward recovery, Black and Latinx workers, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/black-and-hispanic-women-arent-sharing-in-the-job-market-recovery.html">and especially women</a>, are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-unemployment-race/gap-in-u-s-black-and-white-unemployment-rates-is-widest-in-five-years-idUSKBN2431X7">regaining their jobs much more slowly than their white counterparts</a>. Meanwhile, women, <a href="https://nwlc.org/resources/all-of-the-jobs-lost-in-december-were-womens-jobs/">and especially women of color</a>, were both more likely to lose their job or find it necessary to dedicate their time exclusively to unpaid care work, <a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/covid-19-widens-gender-gap-labor-force-participation">erasing decades of gains in women’s labor force participation</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/10/30/492582/covid-19-sent-womens-workforce-progress-backward/">wages</a>.</p><p>These inequalities were not inevitable. Rather, this uneven toll stands as a physical manifestation of our history, etched into our society with every job, home, and life lost. An enduring lesson from this pandemic must be that, even when we face a threat like a virus that cannot intentionally discriminate between us, the institutional and cultural legacies that we have inherited from past efforts to purposefully divide us will ensure that our experiences are unequal and&nbsp;unjust.</p><p>A long legacy of exclusion</p><p>This persistence of social disparities should surprise no one, since intentional exclusion has long been the norm in the United States. For centuries, the power to shape our laws, government, markets, culture, and biases has been restricted by race, gender, and class. Varied forms of exclusion — from slavery and disenfranchisement to imprisonment, institutionalization, and deportation — have been justified by those in power (predominantly white men) in order to concentrate the benefits of American prosperity into their own hands. Acts — and threats — of physical violence against people of color have played a central role in upholding this dynamic, echoes of which we have seen play out in the violent snapshots of police brutality across the country&nbsp;today.</p><p>America’s history of racial exclusion has been integral to shaping our economy, denying people of color the opportunity to profit and accumulate wealth from their own contributions to our economy. The earliest form of American capitalism was one that enriched white Americans who stole land from Native Americans and labor from enslaved Black people. Later iterations of our economy not only permitted racial discrimination, but also exempted employers in sectors with a majority Black or Latinx labor force (namely agriculture, hospitality, and domestic services) from legal requirements to provide a minimum wage, workplace protections, and benefits. Meanwhile, developers, city planners, and the real estate industry redlined Black families into homes and communities with limited job opportunities, few financial service providers, and failing infrastructure. All of these systems were created with the intent of perpetuating white economic supremacy, and, in many cases, remain the foundation of the economy we experience today.</p><p>These patterns of economic marginalization and exploitation are crucial to maintaining power imbalances. Robbing people of the ability to accumulate wealth is tantamount to robbing them of the ability to accumulate power. After all, people without savings find it more difficult to change jobs, to choose where or with whom to live, or <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2015/01/08/the-politics-of-financial-insecurity-a-democratic-tilt-undercut-by-low-participation/">to contribute time and money to politics.</a> And those robbed of their wealth have less to pass on to their children, thereby perpetuating this theft of opportunity across generations.</p><p>In recent decades, efforts to intentionally exclude people of color, and especially Black Americans, from participating in the markets and accumulating wealth and power may have been less overt, but not less effective. For the past fifty years, we have relied on markets to solve our social problems, even though markets are mechanisms in which people with existing wealth and assets use investments to gain even more wealth and assets. Superimposed over an unequal society, free markets can only exacerbate those inequalities. Meanwhile, many of those in power have worked to weaken the very institutions — government, labor unions, our social safety net — that could mitigate these market imbalances.</p><p>Supporting organizations working to build an anti-racist economy</p><p>Omidyar Network is committed to building an economy that is explicitly anti-racist and inclusive. An economy which simultaneously rejects the justifications for racism and consciously works to remove the structures of our society that perpetuate racial injustice. We are working toward a society where everyone has the power and ability to live the life of their choosing — free to choose their job, choose where they will live, choose how to invest their time and resources, and choose who represents them in government.</p><p>A first step toward achieving this vision is to correct the power imbalances that prevent people of color from have a voice in how the economy impacts them. That’s why we support <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/">Action Center on Race and the Economy (ACRE)</a>, an organization that provides support to groups on the ground campaigning for structural change of, and increased accountability from, the financial sector. ACRE helps grassroots organizations identify the ways in which the financial sector contributes to such challenges as <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/issues/health-care/">healthcare</a>, housing, the <a href="https://fuelingthefire.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PWF_fossilfuelreport_WEB.pdf">environment</a>, and <a href="https://acrecampaigns.org/issues/policing-and-incarceration/">policing and incarceration</a>. During the pandemic, ACRE was part of a coalition that supported the <a href="https://westriketogether.org/">We Strike Together campaign</a>, using rent and mortgage strikes to secure relief for renters during the&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://communitychange.org/">Community Change</a>, represents networks of local organizations building power with people of color so they have a say in policies that impact their lives. Its <a href="https://communitychange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CC_Path-to-Power-2019-doc.pdf">strategy</a> includes efforts to strengthen organizing infrastructure in communities of color, and to increase their influence and develop new models of sustainable, volunteer-led community organizations.</p><p>A second task is to address the ways that existing economic rules perpetuate exclusion, either by changing policies or finding innovative ways to work around an unjust system. One of our partners, <a href="https://www.domesticworkers.org/">National Domestic Workers Alliance</a>(NDWA), advocates on behalf of the 2.5 million nannies, house cleaners, and care workers across the country, most of whom are women, especially Black, Latinx, Native, and Asian American Pacific Island women. During the pandemic, NDWA <a href="https://domesticworkers.org/coronavirus-care-fund">distributed $400 in emergency support</a> to more than 40,000 domestic workers who had lost their jobs during the lockdowns, and helped successfully advocate for the American Jobs Plan to include a $400 billion dollar investment in care&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>Finally, we must weed out and uproot all remaining vestiges of the ideas used to justify exclusion and division, and help new ideas take root. That’s why we support the work of academics, researchers, and other movement and thought leaders who study the stratifications of our economy and propose pathways forward. Most notably, we have worked closely with Professor <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/milano/faculty/darrick-hamilton/">Darrick Hamilton</a> of The New School, a leading economist whose work explores the ways that existing systems perpetuate racial inequality and offers proposals — such as baby bonds or a federal job guarantee — to make the future economy more equitable. We also support the work of <a href="https://www.demos.org/">Demos</a>, a think tank for race-forward progressive policy ideas and an advocacy network that aims to increase the power that communities of color have over economic decisions. It has, for example, designed a platform of policies for <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/economic-justice/climate-equity">equitably addressing the climate crisis</a> and expanding the availability of <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/economic-justice/debt-free-college">debt-free college</a>. Demos is also releasing a number of <a href="https://www.demos.org/our-issues/covid-19-racial-justice">policy proposals to ensure that our pandemic recovery brings us closer to a more democratic and inclusive economy</a>. We believe it is imperative that these ideas are not cordoned off in think tanks or academic institutions, but rather shaped in partnership with those communities that are most impacted — building a ladder from the grassroots all the way up the ivory&nbsp;tower.</p><p>Far from being a time of solidarity and common endurance, this past year exposed a whole host of enduring racial injustices. Our institutions, built on foundations of intentional exclusion, deepened and perpetuated divisions built on old biases and hatreds, that have been nourished for centuries. However, even as the country witnessed the devastation of the pandemic — layered over the continued translation of hate into outright violence against people of color — many responded by joining the movement for racial&nbsp;justice.</p><p>The incredible work of our Reimagining Capitalism grantees is setting a course to build power with communities of color, rewrite the rules that have privileged white and wealthy people for so long, and reshape our ideas of racial justice and&nbsp;equity.</p><p>As America rebuilds, it is the mutual responsibility of funders to be anti-racist in rectifying the consequences of centuries of systemic racism that have robbed communities of color of their wealth, power, and rights, and to ensure that the economic system that is rebuilt supports an inclusive society in which everyone can live with dignity and&nbsp;thrive.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/reimagining-capitalism-series-building-an-anti-racist-and-inclusive-economy-36fc79ab5cbc">Reimagining Capitalism Series: Building an Anti-Racist and Inclusive Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Conformance Testing for Measurable Goals</p><p>[Written in consultation with the Interoperability Working Group chairs]</p><p>A recurring topic in the Interoperability Working Group is that of defining short-, medium- and long-term goals or “targets” for interoperability. The topic comes up again every few months, and each time it does, the chairs try to tackle it head-on for a full meeting or two, some emails, and various off-line discussions, but doing so never seems to arrive at a satisfactory or definitive answer. Each time, what feels a Herculean outlay of effort only gets us a tentative resolution, as if we’d deflected a debt collector with a minimum payment. Dear reader, we would like to refinance, or at least restructure, this debt to our community!</p><p>In this <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/setting-interoperability-targets-2/">two-part</a> overview of our goals for 2021, we would like to survey the landscape of “provable,” testable interoperability targets and give some guidance on what we would like to see happen next in the testable interop world. Then, in a companion article, we will lay out clear proposal for parallel, distributed work on multiple fronts, such that progress can be distributed across various subcommunities and hubs of open cooperation, each reasonably confident that they are helping the big picture by “zooming in” on one set of problems. &nbsp;</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@christopherphigh">Christopher Paul High</a> A seemingly uncontroversial target state <p>Interoperation is a deceptively transparent etymology: any two things that perform a function are inter-operating if they can perform their operation together and mutually. Two fax machines interoperate if one sends a fax and the other receives it, which is a far more impressive feat if the two machines in question were designed and built by different companies on different continents, fifteen years apart. This is the kind of target state people usually have in mind when they imagine interoperability for an emerging technology.</p><p>This everyday example glosses over a lot of complexity and history, however. Standards bodies had already specified exact definitions of how the “handshake” is established between two unfamiliar fax machines before either model of fax machine was a twinkle in a design team’s eye. In addition to all the plodding, iterative standardization, there has also been a lot of economic trial and error and dead-ends we never heard about. &nbsp;Even acceptable margins of error and variance from the standards have been prototyped, refined, socialized, and normalized, such that generations of fax machines have taken them to heart, while entire factories have been set up to produce standard components like white-label fax chips and fax boards that can be used by many competing brands. On a software level, both design teams probably recycled some of the same libraries and low-level code, whether open-source or licensed.</p><p>Decomposing this example into its requirements at various levels shows how many interdependent and complex subsystems have to achieve internal maturity and sustainable relationships. A time-honored strategy is to treat each of these subsystems in a distinct, parallel maturation process and combine them gradually over time. The goal, after all, is not a working whole, but a working ecosystem. &nbsp;Architectural alternatives, for example, have to be debated carefully, particularly for disruptive and emerging technologies that redistribute power within business processes or ecosystems. Sharing (or better yet, responsibly open-sourcing and governing) common software libraries and low-level hardware specifications is often a “stitch in time” that saves nine later stitches, since it gives coordinators a stable baseline to work from, sooner.</p><p>Naturally, from even fifty or a hundred organizations committed to this target state, a thousand different (mostly sensible) strategies can arise. “How to proceed?” becomes a far-from-trivial question, even when all parties share many common goals and incentives. For instance, almost everyone:</p>  Wants to grow the pie of adoption and market interest  Holds privacy and decentralization as paramount commitments  Strives to avoid repeating the mistakes and assumptions of previous generations of internet technology  <p>And yet, all the same… both strategic and tactical differences arise, threatening to entrench themselves into camps or even schools of thought. How to achieve the same functional consensus on strategy as we have on principles? Our thesis here is that our short-term roadmaps need testable, provable alignment goals that we can all agree on for our little communities and networks of technological thinking to converge gradually. Simply put, we need a few checkpoints and short-term goals, towards which we can all work together.</p> Today’s test suites and interoperability profiles <p>Perhaps the biggest differences turn out not to be about target state or principles, but about what exactly “conformance” means relative to what has already been specified and standardized. Namely, the core specifications for DIDs and VCs are both data models written in the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C), which put protocols out of scope. This stems partly from the decisions of the groups convened in the W3C, and partly from a classic division of labor in the internet standards world between W3C, which traditionally governs the data models of web browser and servers, &nbsp;and a distinct group, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p><p>VCs were specified first, with a preference (but not a requirement) for DIDs, with exact parameters for DIDs and DID systems deferred to a separate data model. &nbsp;Then, to accommodate entrenched and seemingly irreconcilable ideas about how DIDs could best be expressed, the DID data model was made less representationally-explicit and turned into an abstract data model. This shift to a representation-agnostic definition of DIDs, combined with the still-tentative and somewhat representation-specific communication and signing protocols defined to date, makes truly agnostic and cross-community data model conformance somewhat difficult to test. This holds back interoperability (and objective claims to conformance)!</p> W3C: Testing the core specifications <p>The only test suite associated with the core W3C specifications is the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/tree/main/packages/vc-http-api-test-server">VC-HTTP-API test suite </a>for VC data model conformance and the fledgling <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-test-suite/">DID-core test suite</a>, both worked on in the W3C-CCG. The former tests implementations of VC-handling systems against some pre-established sample data and test scripts through a deliberately generalized API interface that strives to be minimally opinionated with respect to context- and implementation-specific questions like API authentication. The latter is still taking shape, given that the DID spec has been very unstable in the home stretch of its editorial process arriving at CR this last week.</p><p>The VC-HTTP-API interface, specified collectively by the first <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/svip">SVIP</a> funding cycle cohort for use in real-world VC systems, has been used in some contexts as a de facto general-purpose architecture profile, even if it is very open-ended on many architectural details traditionally specified in government or compliance profiles. &nbsp;Its authors and editors did not intend it to be the general-purpose profile for the VC data model generally, but in the absence of comparable alternatives, it is sometimes taken as one; it has perhaps taken on more of a definitive role than originally intended. </p><p>Following the second iteration of the SVIP program and the expansion of the cohort, the API and its test suite are poised to accrue features and coverage to make it more useful outside of its original context. Core participants have established a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/">weekly public call</a> at the CCG and a lively re-scoping/documentation process is currently underway to match the documentation and rationale documents to the diversity of contexts deploying the API.</p> Aries: End-to-end conformance testing <p>Other profiles, like the Aries interoperability profile, serve an important role, but it would be misleading to call it a VC data model test suite-- it is more like an end-to-end test harness for showing successful implementation of the Aries protocols and architecture. Here “interoperability” means interoperability with other Aries systems, and conformance with the shared Aries interpretation of the standard VC data model and the protocols this community has defined on the basis of that interpretation. </p><p>Many matters specified by the W3C data model are abstracted out or addressed by shared libraries in Ursa, so its scope is not exactly coterminous with the W3C data model. Instead, the Aries interoperability profile has its own infrastructural focus, which focuses on scaling the privacy guarantees of blockchain-based ZKP systems. In many ways, this focus complements rather than supplants that of the W3C test suites. </p><p>Many of the trickiest questions on which SSI systems differ are rooted in what the Aries and Trust-over-IP communities conceptualize as “<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack">layer 2</a>,” the connective infrastructural building-blocks connecting end-users to VCs and DIDs. As more and more features get added to be testable across language implementations, and as feature-parity is achieved with other systems (such as <a href="https://youtu.be/LC0OXAir3Qw">support for LD VCs</a>), the case for productive complementarity and deep interoperability gets easier and easier to make.</p> The first wave of local profiles and guidelines <p>Other specifications for decentralized-identity APIs and wallets, modelled on that W3C CCG and/or extending the work of Aries-based infrastructures, are starting to crop up around the world. &nbsp;So far these have all arisen out of ambitious government-funded programs to build infrastructure, often with an eye to local governance or healthy competition. Canada and the European Commission are the most high-profile ones to date, building on earlier work in Spain, the UK, and elsewhere; Germany and other countries funding next-generation trust frameworks may soon follow suit. </p><p>It is important, however, to avoid framing these tentative, sometimes cautious attempts at bridging status quo and new models as universal standards. If anything, these frameworks tend to come with major caveats and maturity disclaimers, on top of having carefully narrowed scopes. &nbsp;After all, they are generally the work of experienced regulators, inheriting decades of work exploring identity and infrastructural technologies through a patchwork of requirements and local profiles that tend to align over time. If they are designed with enough circumspection and dialogue, conformance with one should never make conformance with another impossible. (The authors would here like to extend heartfelt sympathy to all DIF members currently trying to conform to multiple of these at once!) </p><p>These profiles test concrete and specific interpretations of a shared data model that provide a testing benchmark for regulatory “green lighting” of specific implementations and perhaps even whole frameworks. Particularly when they specify best practices or requirements for security and API design, they create testable standardization by making explicit their opinions and assumptions about:</p>  approved cryptography,  auditing capabilities,  privacy requirements, and  API access/authentication   <p>These will probably always differ and make a universal abstraction impossible; and that’s not a bad thing! These requirements are always going to be specific to each regulatory context, and without them, innovation (and large-scale investment) are endangered by regulatory uncertainty. Navigating these multiple profiles is going to be a challenge in the coming years, as more of them come online and their differences come into relief as a stumbling block for widely-interoperable protocols with potentially global reach. </p><p>The Interoperability working group will be tracking them and providing guidance and documentation where possible. Importantly, though, there is a new DIF Working Group coming soon, the Wallet Security WG, which will dive deeper into these profiles and requirements, benefiting from a narrow scope and IPR protection, allowing them to speak more bluntly about the above-mentioned details. </p>

 A progress update on implementing decentralized SLAs and the EWT Escrow&nbsp;Model <p>At the end of February our CEO Walter Kok laid out the concept of a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/its-coming-quality-of-service-guarantees-for-decentralized-technologies-c0e133ebe644">decentralized SLA </a>and how it will form the basis of a new type of service-level agreement (SLA) for enterprises and vendors alike. Unlike a traditional, bilateral SLA, a DSLA approach is inherently distributed and establishes multilateral trust that the services will be delivered according to the agreement. This new type of business and technical architecture will enable very transparent reporting on the actual, real-world service&nbsp;quality.</p><p>We see the DSLA as an important aspect of the Utility Layer of the Energy Web tech stack. The Utility Layer comprises a variety of ‘digital machinery’ (i.e., services) that power the dApps running on the Energy Web Chain. That’s why we unveiled the <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/the-energy-transition-is-at-stake-ec9f4ececd85">EWT Escrow Model</a>, as a way to unlock the full potential of the Energy Web tech stack to achieve the delivery of a decentralized service operation and its objectives. The EWT Escrow Model allows for both Providers (i.e., vendors providing Utility Layer services) and Patrons (e.g., community members who may stake some amount of EWT in support).</p><p>The entire process leverages <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-switchboard/">EW Switchboard</a> to manage DIDs and roles for Customers, Providers, and&nbsp;Patrons.</p><p>Our goal is to launch the first Utility Layer services, complete with escrow and subscriptions, in production by Q3 2021. Between then and now, we’re aiming for a several key milestones, including: a) an alpha release on our testnet, Volta (this is when Patrons will be able to test an early version of the Escrow Model); b) a beta release on the Energy Web Chain; and c) scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.</p><p>If you’ve watched our pipeline of major announcements and initiatives in recent weeks and months, you know that the Energy Web team and the broader ecosystem have been incredibly busy. But we’ve also been making progress on the EWT Escrow Model, and are excited to share this update with&nbsp;you.</p><p>SPOILER ALERT: DEAR PATRONS AND PROVIDERS, STAKING IS STILL COMING AND Q3 IS STILL A REALISTIC TARGET.</p> We finalized the architecture, designed the UI, and got the resources (almost) in&nbsp;place… <p>The picture below lays out the architecture of the decentralized service operations. It breaks down into four important blocks: 1) Customer Tasks (consuming the service, in green), 2) Provider Tasks (delivering the service, in yellow), 3) The Watchtower (monitoring and reporting on the service operations, in red), and 4) Governance Tasks (smart contracts executing the DSLAs, in&nbsp;blue).</p><p>And yes, there at the top are the Patrons, who can stake together with their service provider of choice. Let’s get into a little bit more&nbsp;detail.</p> THE SERVICE PROVIDER AND THE&nbsp;PATRON <p>Service Providers (“Providers”) are organizations that operate Utility Layer service nodes. In order to become a qualified Provider, an organization must pass a basic KYC check and deposit a minimum balance of EWT into an escrow smart contract for a multi-year period. Once qualified, Providers can launch service nodes by depositing an incremental amount of EWT in escrow and claim they are ready to deliver the service. The Watchtower will validate the claim (more on the Watchtower below). The following animation shows the User Interface we have developed so far to onboard Service Providers and&nbsp;Patrons:</p><p>To meet the minimum escrow balance requirement, Providers can either acquire the necessary EWT themselves or accept EWT from external Patrons in the wider community. As long as Providers deliver services in accordance with the prescribed rules, they will earn a stable income on their deposited EWT.</p> THE CUSTOMER <p>Customers follow an onboarding process similar to that of Providers. We want the system to be trustless, so the Providers (and Patrons) need to be assured that the Customer will pay for the service once it has been delivered. So basically, they put their pre-payments into escrow, too. Once the Customer claims that they are ready to consume services, the Watchtower will also validate this claim. The following animation shows the user interface we have developed so far to onboard customers and how they can choose the services and SLAs they want to&nbsp;consume:</p> THE WATCHTOWER AND GOVERNANCE TASKS <p>The Watchtower will be a similar decentralized architecture as the one we deploy for the validators of the Energy Web Chain. Watchtower nodes will also follow the Proof-of-Authority consensus algorithm. They are trusted entities, similar to our validators (we expect a subset of our validators to also run a Watchtower node).</p><p>Each Watchtower will validate the claim of readiness from both Provider and Customer and individually report on it. The smart contract (part of the governance tasks) will move both to the operational status when there is consensus amongst the Watchtowers. The services are now ready to be delivered and consumed and all the Watchtowers will start to monitor the actual performance. When it is their turn, they will measure and publish their results individually. Again, the consensus algorithm will ensure a decision of the actual performance for the interval, taking all scores into&nbsp;account.</p><p>We expect that these intervals will aggregate to a daily / weekly Service Level Score. Then depending on the Service Level Agreement, the payment / slashing logic will kick in. The necessary evidence will be stored on the Energy Web Chain so that at any time it can be accessed (taking into account privacy preserving requirements, etc.).</p> So what can you expect&nbsp;next.. <p>Looking ahead at the coming months, we’re forging ahead with the schedule we laid out in the original EWT Escrow Model&nbsp;article:</p>  In May 2021, we will conduct an alpha release of escrow and subscription tools on our testnet Volta. This is when our Patrons will be able to early test the staking&nbsp;feature.  In June and July 2021, we will conduct a beta release of escrow and service components on the Energy Web Chain (EWC), with an initial cohort of Service Providers from the EWC validator community.  Throughout the remainder of the year, we will focus on scaling the Utility Layer service network, onboarding additional Providers and Patrons from the wider Energy Web community, adding new Utility Layer services, and integrating the escrow and subscription models with exchanges and other external systems to make it even easier to participate.  <p>Expect to continue to hear from Energy Web over the coming months. If you have questions or ideas, drop us a note in the comments below! To stay up to date with the latest information, follow us on Twitter or join our Telegram community.</p><p>The EWT Escrow Model is closer than ever to becoming a reality — including the 10–20% return on deposited EWT we mentioned when we first announced the Escrow Model. We are now seeing a convergence of positive developments: major projects deploying on the Energy Web tech stack in partnership with our members, a robust community around EWT, and a stronger-than-ever appetite for digital solutions that address the urgent climate challenge. We continue to act our way into new thinking&nbsp;indeed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/acting-our-way-into-new-thinking-85fb79b1970a">Acting our way into new thinking…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland—29 April 2021 — Today Energy Web announced that the <a href="https://shareandcharge.com/">Share&amp;Charge Foundation</a> has become a part of the global nonprofit. In March 2020, Share&amp;Charge <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/share-charge-foundation-launches-open-charging-network-on-energy-web-chain-84af7f6f5b3c">launched its Open Charging Network</a> (OCN) on the Energy Web Chain. Share&amp;Charge’s OCN is a decentralized e-roaming solution for seamless electric vehicle (EV) charging across different charge point networks. Today’s announcement makes the Share&amp;Charge team an extension of Energy Web’s core team, while the OCN becomes more tightly integrated with the EW tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>“In the global energy transition, EVs are one of the fastest-growing segments, with customers investing trillions in all-electric cars and trucks, while automakers, charge point operators, and utilities are investing heavily in charging infrastructure,” explained Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of Energy Web. “EVs sit at the intersection of several major use cases for open-source digital technology like the Energy Web tech stack. Giving EVs self-sovereign identities enables them to easily and efficiently register in energy markets to provide services to grid operators. They’re a major new source of demand for renewable energy. And it will become increasingly important to track their batteries throughout their lifecycle, in alignment with regulations around the world. Bringing Share&amp;Charge into the Energy Web family better prepares us to support the coming e-mobility future.”</p><p>Share&amp;Charge will continue to operate as an independent brand, although it will now do so in closer alignment with the Energy Web team and strategy. “This is an exciting transition for Share&amp;Charge and we are happy to be joining forces with EW,” said Dietrich Sümmermann, chair of the Share&amp;Charge Foundation board. “As more and more companies join Energy Web and its global ecosystem, we stand ready to support seamless e-roaming as EVs become the dominant form of mobility in the decades&nbsp;ahead.”</p><p>Energy Web is working together with the OCN community through already-established channels — both supporting the current OCN and the development of a DID-based OCN 2.0. Stay tuned for more on this&nbsp;front.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/share-charge-becomes-a-part-of-energy-web-33fbffc5f3a4">Share&amp;Charge Becomes a Part of Energy Web</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Lightweight micro-grants to further the DIF mission <br></p><p>DIF is kicking off a program to administer narrowly-scoped financial support for community initiatives, ranging in format from grants to more competitive implementation bounties, hackathon-style open collaborations, and security reviews. Although the complexity and number of stakeholders involved will naturally vary, all of these bounties will all be structured around public “challenges” that directly reward efforts helpful to the community as a whole. </p><p>Each of these challenges will culminate in a library-, repository-, or narrow specification-sized donation that closes interoperability gaps, generates usable documentation, or solving other tooling and data problems that move the decentralized identity needle. These could be signature suites, libraries, toolkits, or even detailed tutorials and implementation guides. </p><p>Prompts for whitepapers or non-normative implementation guides are harder to define in testable terms, but still welcome; one way of defining them is by listing a significant, finite set of input documents (such as specifications and regulatory profiles) and defining success as simple, useful documentation incorporates all their prescriptions and limitations.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jchatelain">Julien Chatelain</a><p>To make the awarding of these grants as objective and non-controversial as possible, we will be administering them in the form of technically-specified “challenges” that break down into specific, testable criteria. Submissions will be defined as donations to DIF that meet some or all of the criteria of a given challenge; the Technical Steering Committee will administer the adjudication of testing submissions against challenges.</p><p>Grant money can be offered directly from DIF’s budget by decision of the DIF’s governing board (the Steering Committee) and/or offered by a member company and approved by the SC. The donator of the grant funds can choose a specific WG or combination of WGs to specify and fine-tune the challenge. These WGs work with the Technical Steering Committee to ratify successful completion and authorize release of funds once a conforming donation has been received.</p> FAQ for DIF Grants:  Who can offer a Grant?<br>
Any DIF member and/or the DIF Steering Committee can offer a grant (or matching funds) as long as the scope of the challenge benefits the entire DIF community. DIF SC will review grant requests before the challenge is prepared and published. 
Who writes the challenge?<br>
Grants challenges are written by the chairs and/or the members of the WG chosen by the donors to administer the grant. The WG is responsible for writing a challenge acceptable to the SC and the grantor. WG chairs should submit the challenge at least one week before the deadline for Grantor approval (aka “go/no go decision”), to allow for fine-tuning or negotiation of terms.
What makes a good challenge?<br>
A good challenge is testable to make the decision about its success objective rather than subjective, and it should include its own testable definition of success and, where appropriate, usable test fixtures.<br><br>
<p>A good challenge also serves the broader community equally (for instance, not just JWT-, LD-, or Aries-based systems). A challenge should not favor any given commercial product (or infrastructure such as specific blockchains) substantially over others, and care should be taken to think through what the “equivalences” or counterparties are if a challenge comes from a specific community, credential format, etc.</p>
 Who can submit and who reviews it?<br>
Participation is open for the broad community (no prior DIF membership is required), but submissions will only be considered upon donation to the challenge-owning DIF WG. The donation should be “clean IP,” i.e. comprised entirely of IP generated by the donator(s), and the challenge owner may also impose some limitations on external dependencies. 
Is there a minimum and maximum donation size that DIF will administer as a grant?<br>
For now, DIF has decided not to use this structure for grants under 1000U$. DIF cannot manage grants of over 50,000K U$ at this time.
How is/are winner(s) selected?<br>
Each challenge can specify the relationship between testable criteria and winner(s).  The template for challenge authors specifies a few common patterns, i.e., pre-approved grantee(s), bounty-style competition, and sponsored lead/editor for an open work item.<br><br>
Payment is handled through a contract signed with JDF. 
 Checklist for defining a good challenge:  
 Define the solution to the challenge as simply as possible, ideally in one noun phrase, i.e.
 
 “A lossless, general-purpose translator between DID Document representations”, 
 “A sample implementation that reimplements DIDComm access via Bluetooth in a second major language,” or 
 “A specification for how EDVs could be accessed over NFT written by someone with broad NFT and security experience” 
 
 
 Consider redundancy of effort - Do people apply with an idea and get approved to execute (i.e., “grant”), working in reasonable confidence of post-success payment if they meet the deadline? Or do they compete with unknown number of other teams, only applying to get paid after completion? It is recommended that challenge owners decide early between these three modes of operation:
 
 “mini-grant” mode: applicants get pre-approved before beginning work and work privately until donating 
 “Work item” mode: applicants get pre-approved to lead a public work item at DIF, which may accept volunteer contributions from other DIF members. Work should be donated even if the challenge is not completed or is completed sooner by another party. 
 “Open participation” mode, aka implementation bounty: anyone can work privately and successful donation(s) get(s) the award. 
 
 
 A good challenge should not be met merely by addressing known bugs, repackaging prior art, superficial/minor bugs, etc. 
 Where in the interoperability WG’s map of implementer decisions does the challenge “live” and which sections does it directly affect? Answering this question may help argue for direct or indirect benefits to the whole community. 
 How familiar are the authors of the challenge with that specific problem space, in and outside of decentralized identity? Have experts been consulted from outside the WG, or better yet, outside of the decentralized identity community?
 
 How evenly distributed would the benefits be? Please consider (and write out) how various subcommunities (i.e., Aries-based solutions, JWT-/JSON-based solutions, and LD-based solutions) would benefit from this solution. If the benefits would be unevenly distributed, consider adding an additional challenge criterion (perhaps even awardable separately) for extending extra benefits to the least-served community, such as an implementation guide, @Context file, vocabulary to aid translation, etc. 
 
 
 Define criteria for success, ideally testable ones to minimize the subjective judgments to be made by the TSC.
 
 If possible, include dummy data and other test vectors. 
 Securing formal review by an outsider with specified qualities or experience can be written in as a success criteria or payment trigger. 
 Vaguely-worded requirements of “originality” are hard to assess, but negative requirements like “MUST/SHOULD not re-implement existing solutions linked from the reference section of this spec” can help make sure requirements clear to all involved.

<p>The Validation Agent Framework empowers FIs to leverage their know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulated business as usual onboarding processes, to obtain an LEI for their customers when verifying a client’s identity during initial onboarding or during a standard client refresh update. As a result, FIs acting as Validation Agents save time and cost while enhancing their client onboarding experience by removing the duplication of data validation processes. </p>
<p>By becoming Validation Agents financial institutions can also streamline, accelerate and diversify their use of the LEI, and ensure their autonomy as they look to digitize their business processes. </p>
<p>GLEIF signed JP Morgan as its first Validation Agent at the end of 2020 and is continuing to invite FIs to participate in the Framework’s trial phase and establish first-mover status in the market. </p>
<p>GLEIF is working to standardize the trial engagement process, but also acknowledges that every FI employs its own processes and departmental functions differently. This is why GLEIF is committed to working with each triallist individually to explore and define the Validation Agent role ‘in context’, and to ensure the Global LEI System continues to meet the sector’s needs. </p>
<p>The trial process is comprised of seven steps, as illustrated in the graphic below. </p>

<p>To provide more detail around what this process entails, our latest eBook details what FIs can expect at each stage of this trial, the benefits they can look to enjoy working as part of the Framework and answers some frequently asked questions. </p>

 On a Digital Scotland webinar Chris Torres of the <a href="https://tourismmarketing.agency/">Tourism Marketing Agency</a> shared insights on how to leverage Facebook ads to&nbsp;stand out from the crowd. 
 What are the Facebook Ads? 
<p>Facebook ads are paid messages from businesses that are written in their voice and help reach the people who matter most to them. Advertisers create campaigns that have specific goals, which we call advertising objectives and they create ads within those campaigns to help them reach those objectives.</p>
<p>Facebook Advertising is now one of the most effective tools out there to grow your business, create loyal customers, and generate leads and sales. It helps marketers increase visibility for their ads, build brand awareness.</p>
 Video Summary 
<p>In this video Chris will give insights into how a person can make his/her brand stand out from the crowd why a person should change their perspective away from running a tourism business.</p>
<p>Firstly, he starts with customer journey. The three main parts of the journey is usually the dreaming the planning and the booking. The dreaming phase helps with the planning and the purchase and booking. The funnel works through different stages such as –</p>
 
 Brand Awareness Ad 
 Free Value Ad 
 Trust Ad 
 Sales Ad 
 
<p>The purpose of brand awareness ad is to drive targeted traffic to the website and raise brand awareness. The purpose of free value ad is to target people who landed on that landing page and in this instance, they want them to download a free cookbook that this company has created. Another purpose is to offer value in exchange for their email address.</p>
<p>It targets visitors to the website. The purpose of trust ad is to continue value to the customer and build trust in the brand with small videos. It mainly targets the visitors who have downloaded the guide from the website.</p>
<p>The purpose of sale ad is to continue value to the customer and build trust in your brand with a 30 sec video from a guide or carousel image. It targets the visitors who downloaded the guide and past visitors. The overall daily budget for per day is 20-25 pounds.</p>
<p>One of the quick tips to attract audience is to use square images or videos. This helps the ads stand out more. An Irish Tourism company used various technics to attract the American audience to visit a particular spot in Ireland, where a portion of the shooting of Star Wars occurred.</p>
<p>Cool Travel Iceland a tour agency used a video which cost almost $60 to attract the audience. They were pretty successful in this. In the whole campaign it was over a month or two the whole campaigns have produced over 300 leads close to 400 and all from our 30 pounds ads and that’s how an effective video can be made. For Facebook campaign a video can be made without breaking a bank.</p>
<p>The videos are important because it builds the brand reputation, lasting relationships and users actually love to watch them. The 79% of the travellers search for Youtube videos before planning the tour. Consumers process information with videos 60,000 times faster than written form. The videos can be made within budget by using Iphone or GoPro with Karma Grip.</p>
<p>There are many free tools to edit or improve the videos. Creating professional videos for promotion or for attracting audience is very easy in a modern day. To have a successful campaign all the above-mentioned requirements should be fulfilled.</p>

   The history of the ultimate digital disruptor - Napster.

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/category/digital-disruptors/"></a>In the ’90s, it was a great time to be in the music business. Things were booming. And as a result, there were expensive parties, big launches. That was part of the culture. 
<p>This was the era of NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys. This was the era where a single hit could sell 10 million albums plus. Artists were just printing money. Artists had the great sales of CDs over that period dwarfing whatever had happened in the industry before. The profits coming in were massive. It was a hell of a lot of fun.</p>
 Birth of the MP3 
<p>We really didn’t foresee the change in the technology. We’ll be telling you tonight about a method of compressing audio data called MP3. And that was the end of everything we know. The birth of the MP3 was a seminal moment for all of media and entertainment. It would completely change the music industry. It opened up people’s minds to what the future would be.</p>
<p>The music industry is not viable. Movies, books, television, nothing creative had any value then. The music industry simply did not embrace the magnitude of the change and it failed. You can’t fight progress. You can’t fight technology. The MP3 totally changed people’s relationship to the internet, to culture, to how society works. It’s a fact that was so much bigger than just the music industry.</p>
<p>The story of the MP3 really begins in West Germany back then in the early ’80s and even late ’70s. People started trying to compress music. Dieter Seitzer was a visionary who came up with the MP3. He was seeing the original digitization of music with a compact disc and thinking, instead of manufacturing millions upon millions of plastic discs, why don’t we store all the data in one centralized computer and then stream it to people in their homes. So, he applied for a patent to use the phone system to transmit music. In 1982, that’s when they had this idea. But they had a huge problem.</p>
<p>The compact disc took about a million bytes of information to store one second of audio. And the pipe they were trying to send it through, the telephone, could only do about 128,000 bytes. For this to work, they somehow had to magically shrink the size of the compact disc by 90% or more. The patent examiner looked at it and said, “No, it’s not possible.” Essentially, almost everyone thought this was impossible.</p>
<p>There’s no way to do this. But around 1987 or 1988, Dieter Seitzer’s brilliant graduate student, Brandenburg, made a breakthrough by taking advantage of this sort of obscure academic discipline – Psychoacoustics (the study of how the ear perceives sound).</p>
 The Era of Peer to Peer 
<p>By 1998, the pirates found out that music can be listened free of cost in computer. Dan Tsurif was the early mp3 pirate. He was the founder of mp3 piracy group known as ‘Audiopunks’. This group specialized in everything from punk rock, to ska, to hardcore and heavy metal. They had downloaders from Indonesia, Japan, or Russia and many more countries. People were downloading from his group. This wasn’t called piracy in that time but rather it was file sharing</p>
<p>The latest advance, called MP3, comes via the internet. It was the future of music and audio. There were millions of people out there who not only understand what digital downloading technology is about, but who use it daily to great personal advantage. There wasn’t any panic in the industry in the early days.</p>
<p>Some people took this thread as an opportunity. People used to call it the celestial jukebox. Celestial jukebox was a theoretical construct at the time. Every song ever made was going to be in the cloud ,and would be instantaneously available to anyone on the planet simply by pressing a button on your gizmo. But the industry really did not embrace that opportunity.</p>
<p>But there was an awareness that the digital revolution was coming and anybody who was in a senior position had to say how do we make this work for us? They began trying to find a way to legitimately sell music on the internet. ‘What systems do we develop? How do we deal with how we sell it? How do you price it?’ these questions were in the mind of music company owner. Sony Music said they will the first major recording company to sell new releases through the internet. These virtual singles will be released at the same time as CDs go into the stores.</p>
<p>When the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) came, it changed everything. In 1999, observing the file sharing system as good, Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker created Napster.</p>
<p>Now at the time, there were all these MP3 files being created, but there was no sort of central index where people could go download them easily. Shawn Fanning thought of creating a technology that could connect peer to peer server and could download music. Parker’s role was essentially the face of the organization. Fanning wrote the code. Fanning kind of did all the technical and computer side stuff. He wrote all the codes.</p>
<p>If you typed any artist’s song in the Napster, you will get the song instantly. It was by far the fastest way to download music from the internet. It allows anyone to copy thousands of musical selections for free. And it’s spread so quickly that it’s clogging computer networks on hundreds of campuses. So, this became hugely popular overnight basically. It was really one of the first viral apps.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/category/technology-futures/"></a>One of the most profound visions for our technology future is ‘the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a>‘. 
<p>This is explained by Marko Balabanovic in his article <a href="https://medium.com/digital-catapult/who-will-own-the-metaverse-48c2912d7aae">Who Will Own the Metaverse</a>:</p>
<p>“a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet”.</p>
<p>Marko explores the background, industry applications and technology stack that makes up this exciting evolution.</p>
<p>It’s also called the ‘<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/18/the-ar-cloud-will-infuse-meaning-into-every-object-in-the-real-world/">AR Cloud</a>‘, “a persistent 3D digital copy of the real world to enable sharing of AR experiences across multiple users and devices” that will ‘infuse meaning into every object in the real world’. VentureBeat offers <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/09/a-primer-on-the-metaverse-the-next-iteration-of-the-internet/">this primer</a>, describing it as the next version of the Internet, with massive implications for every industry such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjwjomAPMlw">movies</a>.</p>
 Human Co-Experience – Building the Metaverse 
<p>Another vision of the Metaverse is shared by David Baszucki, Founder and CEO and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/28/roblox-guide-children-gaming-platform-developer-minecraft-fortnite">Roblox</a>, a popular game creation site where users design and upload their own games as well as play other games in a multiplayer environment.</p>
<p>Speaking at the 2020 <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/">Roblox Developers Conference</a> David gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G00GlCJc0mU">this presentation</a>. From 16m:20s David shares the ultimate vision of Roblox, to realize the concept of the Metaverse fantasized about for years by the sci-fi community and more recently by the tech industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Roblox team envisage very fun, large-scale participation scenarios, like a medieval battle with 50,000 players attacking a destructible castle. They’re starting to pioneer the first building blocks of this through hosting their town hall meetings virtually on Roblox.</p>
<p>Key technology innovations to simulate the real world include great avatars and the ability to simulate how the real world sounds. For example being able to whisper to the person next to you while you can still hear the loud speaker announcements, what they call ‘spatial audio’.</p>
<p>Another example demonstrating the concept is their&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/04/one-world-together-home-virtual-concert/">One World virtual concert</a>, and given the global pandemic it’s likely to prove a hugely popular trend, another great opportunity for their developers.</p>
 Somnium Space 
<p>Another venture pioneering the concept is <a href="https://somniumspace.com/">Somnium Space</a>, an open-source social VR world powered by blockchain and shaped entirely by its users, allowing them to buy digital land where they can build VR homes and buildings.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://vrscout.com/news/somnium-space-social-vr-ethereum-blockchain/">VR Scout reported</a> in Feb 2020 the platform announced the launch of&nbsp;Somnium 2.0, a new update that promises to move us closer to a true&nbsp;Ready Player One&nbsp;virtual experience.</p>
<p>“Imagine standing on the top of the highest mountain inside of a virtual mountain looking down to see thousands of users exploring the world beneath in real-time; unlike a majority of multiplayer VR games where players are divided into sub servers and mirrored instanced rooms, Somnium 2.0 actually hosts all its players in a single massive world.”</p>

 Futuristic technologies like Augmented Reality can be applied in a practical way to boost success for Scottish businesses. Tourism is a great example. 
  Enhancing the experience with these types of exciting innovations will draw in even greater visitor numbers and continue the massive economic success of this industry. 
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/tourist-attractions-are-being-transformed-by-immersive-experiences-some-lessons-from-scotland-110860">This Conversation article</a> comments on the details of this economic success and the critical role immersive experiences can play in facilitating this boost.</p>
<p>Simple examples include&nbsp;AR tourism guides, such as this one for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_RppvB4rDo">Inverness Castle</a>, and for <a href="https://thelochsidepress.com/2019/04/19/augmented-reality-is-a-world-first-for-tourist-guide/">Loch Lomond</a> they inserted ‘Zapcodes’ into the local guide magazine, to trigger AR links that enhance the printed word with a virtual experience.&nbsp;You can <a href="https://www.scotsmagazine.com/articles/discover-fife-augmented-reality/">discover Fife</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FOSIT_cMCk">discover the Highlands via AR</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 Smartify 
<p>Another great example is described in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19241367.castle-first-scottish-landmark-sign-app-tours/">this recent news</a>, about Blair Castle adopting the <a href="https://about.smartify.org/">Smartify</a> app. Via easy-to-use interfaces and well designed technology available as a native and web app, the Smartify guide allows visitors to follow their own interests and curated tours, with additional features such as e-commerce, targeted push notifications and donations.</p>
<p>Other Scottish venues adopting Smartify include the National Galleries of Scotland. The Smartify <a href="https://about.smartify.org/case-studies/national-galleries-of-scotland-ray-harryhausen-exhibition">case study</a> explains how the venue employed the app for their <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/ray-harryhausen-titan-cinema-virtual-exhibition-experience">Ray Harryhausen exhibition</a>, to offer visitors a fun (and COVID-safe) experience on site, as well as access from home.</p>
<p>With Smartify already used by the museum across the permanent collection, staff were keen to use the platform to deliver an audio tour safely to visitors’ own smartphones without the need for rented devices or touch screens. They also wanted to provide teaser content and came up with the idea of re-animating one of Harryhausen’s famous skeletons from Clash of the Titans in Augmented Reality.</p>
<p>They worked with Scottish animation agency <a href="https://www.playdead.tv/">Playdead</a> to develop an AR animation of the famous skeletons from Clash of the Titans. Visitors on site could scan the original skeleton model and watch it come to life again, while audiences at home could also play with the AR animation.</p>
<p></p>
 Virtual Treasure Hunts 
<p>For more advanced and engaging experience the technology can be combined with features like ‘Gamification’, to enable super fun activities like Virtual Treasure Hunts. As the Conversation article highlights:</p>
<p>“It’s the sort of immersive experience that many tourist attractions want to have these days. At the <a href="http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk/">Burns Birthplace Museum</a>&nbsp;in Ayrshire, dedicated to Robert Burns, visitors can download an app aimed at children called the&nbsp;<a href="https://digit.fyi/augmented-reality-scottish-attractions/">Mighty Mission Trail</a>. It sends them on a virtual treasure hunt throughout the site and surroundings.”</p>
<p>This highlights the other types of technologies that can be called into play. For example <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/14/google-maps-gaming-platform-expands-after-a-year-of-success-stories/">Google Maps Gaming</a> provides a capability for making more use of location data in mobile games, the Pokemon Go type, that can ‘can unlock augmented reality and social gameplay, can increase engagement and retention, and can help bring new life to games that were originally designed without a location component.’</p>
<p>This is complimented by their general capabilities for improving navigation, such as <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/02/11/google-maps-ar-navigation/">AR Navigation</a> and harnessing AI for <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/using-global-localization-to-improve.html">Global Navigation</a>, helping you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWbY5jdJnHg">better navigate cities</a>.</p>
<p>These various innovations provide the building blocks for creating any type of highly immersive, highly engaging experience, that better enables visitors to explore and enjoy attractions, with the ability to ‘gamify’ the experience of particular value for those looking to attract children and young families.</p>
<p>In general this barely scratches the surface of the staggering scale of opportunity this technology trend offers Scotland. From Oil &amp; Gas through Telemedicine and Digital Tourism, Augmented Reality can enable a myriad of transformative industry solutions, each with valuable local application and also huge global export potential.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

 What do you do and what is it about your job that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
<p>There are so many things about my job that gets me out of bed in th morning. First, I love that I have the opportunity to solve for a trustworthy, informed and transparent way to control our personal information. We need a simple digital identity in so many facets of our digital lives and it’s sorely lacking. Second, I love knowing that I’m contributing to a safer digital future for my children and the next generation. Finally, and most importantly, I love the people I get to share the experience with – the team at IDENTOS, our customers and the identity community continues to humble me.</p>
 How did you get to where you are today? 
<p>Hmm. Hard to say. Where am I today? I am a daughter, a sister, a mom, a tech professional and very grateful for it all. I don’t know how I got here since most of this was likely already planned before my time… but for the moments I had the opportunity to make a choice, I would say that I’ve arrived here thanks to having trust in myself and others who wanted the best for me.</p>
 What is the most important lesson you have learned along the way? 
<p>The most important lesson is to really take stock of the people we interact with, especially the people who share in the same vision and are doing their best to create a better future. The more human and connected we are, the better our solutions will be.</p>
 What’s your pitch to CEOs in the identity space? What do you suggest they START / STOP / CONTINUE doing and why? 
<p>Keeping this focused on identity, I’d say:</p>
 
 START joining other innovators in your community and offer to work on complementary identity projects 
 STOP asking for input from the same groups or people. Surround yourself with different voices and perspectives. 
 CONTINUE bringing your best in identity solutions to build a privacy-respecting, sustainable digital future for citizens, patients, students, parents, children, et al. 
 
 In one sentence, why does diversity matter to you? 
<blockquote><p>Solutions will fall flat unless we can recognize our blind spots.</p></blockquote>
 What book/film/piece of art would you recommend to your fellow members? Why? 
<p>In a field that is dreaming up the future, it probably comes as no surprise that I like to spend a lot of time with movies that have done the same. Aside from diversity, Sci-fi movies also have the power to offer different perspectives. Flicks like Gattaca, Ai, Hunger Games, Battlestar Galactica, West World all have an identity component in the plot that’s interesting to observe. I love the impact it has on the characters’ quality of life, not to mention the freedoms and liberties of some.</p>
 What advice would you give to the teenage ‘you’? 
<p>As a teenager, I was full of big dreams and wanted to fulfill them all. Personally, this caused a lot of stress, and after a while it also didn’t leave a lot of room for connecting with the people and things I cared most for. If I had the opportunity, I’d tell my teenage self:&nbsp; “Continue to dream big and have a compass, but don’t be so hard on yourself. Instead, do your best with what you have while giving yourself space to do the things you find most fulfilling.”</p>

 Sovrin releases two new Guardianship Credentials papers at Internet Identity Workshop&nbsp;#32 <p>In December 2019 the Sovrin Guardianship Task Force released a whitepaper titled “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Guardianship-Whitepaper2.pdf">On Guardianship in Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.” This groundbreaking paper explored guardianship in the context of SSI, and provided two use cases: one for a refugee, Mya, and one for an elderly living with dementia, Jamie. (Watch the video illustration of these two use cases at the end of this article.)</p><p>Recognising the need to develop the work beyond the whitepaper, the Sovrin Foundation chartered a <a href="https://guardianshipwg.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GWG/overview?homepageId=229378">Sovrin Guardianship Working Group</a> (SGWG) in December 2019. Two key documents were identified as outputs for the working group: a Technical Requirements for Guardianship and Implementation Guidelines. After more than a year of hard work, the two papers were completed and will be publicly presented and released at the Sovrin’s breakout session at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) #32 during April 20–22,&nbsp;2021.</p><blockquote>“When we started the work on defining technical requirements for guardianship in early 2020, we viewed the task as relatively simple. ‘All’ we had to do was extract the guardianship requirements from the use cases in the previous whitepaper… It turned out that this view was optimistic,” said John Phillips, one of the authors and Chairs of SGWG in Asia Pacific. “We found that the gap between the two use cases in the whitepaper and technical requirements was too broad. So we realised we needed to revisit our thinking. We needed a conceptual bridge, a ‘mental model’ to understand Guardianship broadly so we could write appropriately narrow technical requirements. The lesson we have (re)learnt in our journey is that, before you can describe something in simple terms, you need to make sure you have a broad and deep enough understanding of the&nbsp;topic.”</blockquote><p>The first paper is called the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vBePVx8n3MRDWcePkwVDya9ab4BHEyU_/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines</a> and its purpose is to provide readers with the background they need to implement IT systems that support various kinds of guardianship. In particular, it focuses on what they need to know when using Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised Identifiers, the building blocks of a SSI framework within the frameworks of <a href="https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-governance-framework/">Sovrin Governance</a> and <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a>&nbsp;(ToIP).</p><p>This paper is intended for all people interested in the design, build and operation of a Guardianship implementation using an SSI framework. It outlines the conceptual framework for Guardianship and provides implementation guidelines. The document introduces and uses a mental model to help understand the interplay and relationships of the key entities and actors involved in the establishment, running and ending of a Guardianship Arrangement.</p><p>While this document provides background explanations of the thinking that led to the technical requirements guidelines, it does not mandate or warrant specific rules for the implementation of Guardianship as these should be Jurisdiction specific, which is defined by the mental model in the document.</p><p>The second paper is called <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M21PznPAd0H6z1t4ODl-jiEoXZjEhwcb/view?usp=sharing">Guardianship Credentials Technical Requirements</a> which was developed by the technical requirements working group within the SGWG. The purpose of this document is twofold: i) provide principles under which guardianship scenario designs and requirements are considered and defined; and ii) provide technical requirements for SSI solutions that offer the capability of guardianship.</p><p>The intended audience for this document includes: i) individuals looking to understand how guardianship should be implemented for their use case; ii) SSI solution designers that require guardianship to support the use of VCs in their specific use case; iii) readers who want to understand how Guardianship can work in an SSI&nbsp;context.</p><p>The requirements described in this paper, together with other SSI standardization, describe when an SSI solution offers the capability of guardianship. In this case, the requirements are mainly for the technical building blocks that live in the bottom three layers of the Technical “Stack” of the Sovrin/ToIP framework. The mental model, however, is also relevant for the top layer (ecosystem), as guardianship is intricately linked to what we will be defining as Jurisdictions, and this enables human governance to be applied to the first three&nbsp;layers.</p><p>This document should be read in conjunction with the Sovrin Guardianship Credentials Implementation Guidelines mentioned above. In particular, readers who are looking to understand the thinking behind these requirements are encouraged to refer to the Implementation Guidelines.</p><p>These two papers are the first public release of implementation guidelines and technical requirements for guardianship in the context of SSI. There are sections at the end of the documents that propose areas of future work, and it is expected that these two documents will be updated as technology evolves and open discussion and decision areas are resolved.</p><p>Download the two papers&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QivpMOIYu0ry-LMfyh5b2pU7eG_SjimJ?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #1— Mya (a refugee&nbsp;girl)</p><p>Sovrin Guardianship Use Case #2 — Jamie (an elderly living with dementia)</p><p>Video credit: John&nbsp;Phillips</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://sovrin.org/a-deeper-understanding-of-implementing-guardianship/">https://sovrin.org</a> on April 22,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>This all-volunteer Sovrin Guardianship Working Group is open to anyone with a genuine interest in and willingness to contribute to digital guardianship.

<p>The first Earth Day — held April 22, 1970 — is considered the birth of the modern environmental movement. More than half a century later, it has taken on renewed focus amidst the climate crisis. Here at Energy Web, we are developing open-source digital infrastructure to accelerate the low-carbon energy transition and expand access to clean energy markets for all. Here are five specific ways we — the Energy Web team, Energy Web members, and the broader Energy Web ecosystem — are working together to speed global decarbonization.</p> 1. Supporting flexibility markets, making it possible for DERs to help balance renewable grids <p>Distributed energy resources (DERs) — from batteries and electric vehicles to “behind the meter’ devices like smart thermostats — are fast becoming crucial components of increasingly decentralized and dynamic power grids that are running on growing amounts of renewable energy. Such DERs can play a valuable role providing grid services, such as helping to balance supply and demand in flexibility markets. Thus we believe it is essential to make it easy for DERs to enroll, participate, and get compensation for delivered grid services. This is why we built and keep advancing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-flex/">Energy Web Flex</a> as a software development toolkit that grid operators <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/austrian-power-grid-and-energy-web-foundation-launch-proof-of-concept-to-use-distributed-energy-d9a378f5f5ee">like Austrian Power Grid</a> can use to tap into the full potential of DERs at the lowest administrative cost possible.</p> 2. Digitizing renewable energy markets, making it faster and easier to source renewables <p>We are building open-source tools to help buyers more easily achieve their proof-of-impact needs and companies around the globe launch user-friendly, digitized renewable energy market platforms. For example, <a href="https://energyweb.org/technology/toolkits/ew-origin/">Energy Web Origin</a> is a software development toolkit we built and continue advancing that digitizes the entire energy attribute certificate lifecycle — from certificate issuance to trading and cancellations/claims — for any clean energy market. We are also working directly with various companies around the world to help them use EW Origin to launch their own digitized renewable energy marketplace platforms across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. In addition, Energy Web is developing <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/applications/ew-zero/">Energy Web Zero</a>, a renewable energy search-and-match engine that helps buyers discover all available renewable energy products and make direct purchases from platforms (like those built with EW Origin). Think Skyscanner or Kayak.com meets renewable energy&nbsp;markets.</p> 3. Enabling lifecycle asset tracking, such as batteries, as part of a circular green&nbsp;economy <p>We know that it is important to understand and track the environmental impacts of all energy devices — from batteries to solar panels and wind turbines — from cradle to grave. This lifecycle tracking is also part of major legislation such as the European Green Deal, not to mention major movements such as the circular economy. Energy Web is leveraging our tech stack and developing tools that companies are using to bring solutions to the market, such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/bebat-launches-easybat-an-open-source-decentralized-solution-for-battery-lifecycle-management-281f2ace61e9">our work with BeBat and Fluvius in Belgium to support EasyBat</a>. EasyBat makes it possible to holistically manage customer-owned batteries (both private &amp; professional use) participating in Belgian electricity markets, including legal takeback obligations and/or extended producers responsibility (EPR) of battery manufacturers.</p> 4. Advancing the Crypto Climate Accord to decarbonize an entire&nbsp;sector <p>We spearheaded the Crypto Climate Accord (CCA) earlier this month in partnership with RMI and the Alliance for Innovative Regulation (AIR) to decarbonize the global crypto and blockchain industry. We are excited to drive it forward with a fast-growing community of <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc/crypto-climate-accord-adds-over-a-dozen-new-supporters-in-two-weeks-since-launch-52dccc7c10a2">now 40 CCA Supporters</a>. More importantly, we have already started identifying, defining, and developing a <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/making-crypto-green-with-energy-web-zero-301cf4a979e5">fast-emerging suite of open-source solutions</a> to help decarbonize crypto. If your company can help us advance solutions in this area, we encourage you to become a CCA Supporter. For more frequent updates on progress related to the CCA, check out the new <a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoClimAcc">CCA&nbsp;Medium</a>.</p> 5. Fostering interoperability of digital twins across tech and&nbsp;markets <p>Historically, power grids and electricity markets — and the technologies used to run them — were heavily fragmented and siloed. Important was locked away in proprietary systems. Customer enrollment in various utility programs, such as selling surplus solar energy to a grid operator or participating in a demand response program, was cumbersome and duplicative. Even worse, customer devices in some cases were prohibited from providing services in certain electricity markets, even if they technologically were able to do so. But those metaphorical walls are coming down, with new regulations such as <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/ferc-order-2222-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity-for-decentralized-technologies-to-accelerate-the-c35cf41527cb">FERC Order 2222 in the United States</a> and a focus on customer-centric market design in the EU. The key to unlocking this new potential is with digital twins and ‘passports’ anchored to the Energy Web&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>This is just a snapshot of all the leading-edge work happening at Energy Web and among our global member community.

  <p>Significant advances are taking place right now in China relative to LEI adoption. Regulatory authorities within the region are proactively driving LEI usage and have set ambitious plans for substantial near-term increases in LEI volume. </p>
<p>For those who missed it, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) published an LEI implementation roadmap at the end of 2020, which looks ahead to 2022. This roadmap is part of the ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative, which is described in the following way on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative">Wikipedia</a>: ‘[…] incorporated into the Constitution of China in 2017. The Chinese government calls the initiative "a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future."’ The roadmap unveils national plans to increase LEI issuance by a minimum of 170% between the end of 2020 (there were 37,000 active LEIs) and the end of 2022 (the target is a minimum LEI volume of 100,000). </p>
<p>In a separate but complementary development, just this month GLEIF has welcomed the news that the Chinese Financial Certification Authority (CFCA) has launched the first commercial demo of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. CFCA has simultaneously become the first Certification Authority to assume a Validation Agent role within the Global LEI System. This innovation from CFCA shows a further commitment from the Chinese market, this time to facilitating and promoting LEI issuance in digital certificates. It is hoped that CFCA’s early mover status on this front will act as a catalyst for other similar demos to emerge. </p>
<p>The combined sum of these two initiatives is significant. It shows an advanced level of proactivity from regulatory authorities within the region, which is driving LEI issuance to support financial services and banking ecosystems, simplify international trade and enhance digital identity across the region. </p>
<p>Understandably, GLEIF advocates these steps being taken to advance LEI adoption across China and applauds the foresight and proactivity of regulators. A commitment to boosting LEI issuance across such a vast region, will not only deliver benefits to Chinese market participants, but has the potential to motivate regulators across other countries and regions to follow suit. GLEIF certainly hopes that this is the case. </p>
<p>A more detailed summary of each initiative is given below.</p>
<p>China’s LEI Implementation Roadmap: 2020-2022</p>
<p>In Q4 2020, four financial regulators in China released a report detailing a roadmap for LEI implementation. The four organizations involved were: PBOC, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). </p>
<p>The report, which is published in Chinese on the PBOC <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4142052/index.html">website</a>, outlines the general objective of the roadmap and details key LEI implementation milestones over the next two years. </p>
<p>As stated in a Regulation Asia <a href="https://www.regulationasia.com/pboc-publishes-roadmap-for-full-lei-adoption-in-china/">article</a>,  the intention of wide LEI implementation in China is to help the country connect with the international market, support China’s bid to open up its financial sector, and facilitate cross-border trade and financial transactions.</p>
<p>In line with a translation from the report on the PBOC website, GLEIF understands that the general objective of the roadmap is to establish a comprehensive LEI usage policy system across China’s financial system in line with international standards by the end of 2022. It envisions that the LEI will become an assisting tool for financial management authorities to maintain financial stability and implement financial supervision. It will become an important means for financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions to carry out customer identification of legal persons involved in cross-border transactions. It will also become a corporate passport.  </p>
<p>This is in line with the PBOC’s role as a member of the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC). The ROC aims to promote the broad public interests to improve the quality of data used in financial data reporting, improving the ability to monitor financial risk, and lowering regulatory reporting costs through the harmonization of these standards across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>A number of phase objectives are then outlined for Chinese authorities: </p>
 
 By end of 2020: total LEI volume in China mainland to reach 30,000, covering all financial institutions, member institutions of financial infrastructure and industry associations, and listed companies in China. Proposed LEI application rules in scenarios such as RMB cross-border payments, digital RMB cross-border business, qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) and RMB qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII) access, derivatives trading, securities trading, and listed company supervision. Establish a mechanism for mapping and updating LEI with the codes of financial institutions, unified social credit codes, and codes of information systems related to major financial infrastructure. 
 By end of 2021: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 50,000, with a focus on improving coverage among importers and exporters, trading enterprises, and non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Proposed LEI application rules in areas such as the financial market transaction reporting system, credit rating, and application of special institutional codes by overseas institutions. Launch and operate the cross-border legal person information service and digital authentication platform to provide value-added LEI-based data services to financial management departments, financial infrastructure, financial industry associations and financial institutions. 
 By end of 2022: total LEI volume in China mainland reaches 100,000. Continued improvements in coverage among non-financial enterprises involved in cross-border transactions. Use LEI in scenarios such as digital identification of cross-border legal persons. Establish a mechanism for commercially sustainable operation of LEI.   
 
<p><br>
CFCA Paves the Way for Increased LEI Usage in Mass Market Digital Identity Products </p>
<p>CFCA has launched the first commercial demonstration of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. It has also become the first Certification Authority to act as a Validation Agent in the Global LEI System, streamlining LEI issuance with digital ID product and service provision.</p>
<p>These developments by CFCA follow the recent launch of the GLEIF CA Stakeholder Group, created as a platform for GLEIF to collaborate with CAs and Trust Service Providers (TSPs) on the coordination and promotion of a global approach to LEI usage across digital identity products. CFCA’s advances are significant because they are the earliest reported successes aligned to the direction of this industry initiative, which is aimed at achieving a critical mass of LEIs embedded within digital certificates. </p>
<p>Stephan Wolf, CEO of GLEIF comments: “This progress by CFCA on both fronts is very welcome as it moves us one step closer to broad LEI usage in digital certificates globally. Realizing the goal of universal LEI usage in digital identity products will be an important step in enhancing trust and creating innovation opportunities across private sector digital identity management applications. Digital certificates linked by an LEI to verified, regularly updated and freely available entity reference data held within the Global LEI System are easier to manage, aggregate and maintain. The result will be significant efficiencies and far less complexity for certificate owners and the provision of greater transparency for all users of the internet and participants within digital exchanges.” </p>

<br></p>
<p>The ‘LEI Lightbulb Blog Series’ from GLEIF aims to shine a light on the breadth of acceptance and advocacy for the LEI across the public and private sectors, geographies and use cases by highlighting which industry leaders, authorities and organizations are supportive of the LEI and for what purpose. By demonstrating how success derived from strong regulatory roots is giving rise to a ground swell of champions for further LEI regulation and voluntary LEI adoption across new and emerging applications, GLEIF hopes to educate on both the current and future potential value that ‘one global identity’ can deliver for businesses, regardless of sector, world-wide.</p>

<p>Eleven months after Derek Chauvin stole George Floyd’s final breaths, jurors took less than 11 hours to find Chauvin guilty on all three counts. The jury’s verdict shows that sometimes — but too rarely — justice can prevail, and it is very welcome, given the long history of acquittals that come before&nbsp;it.</p><p>It does not, however, bring George Floyd back to life, nor the dozens of other unarmed Black and Brown people who have been killed by the police since May 25, 2020. Since the trial began, police have killed at least 64 people, more than half of whom were Black or Latinx. Just 10 miles from the courthouse, Daunte Wright was shot dead, and across the Great Lakes in Chicago, police took the life of 13-year-old Adam Toledo in&nbsp;Chicago.</p><p>So, while we can briefly exhale today, we know there is so much work that remains to be done to build toward a more just system overall, so that outcomes like today’s are less exceptional.</p><p>Listening to the testimony during the trial reopened painful wounds that have been inflicted relentlessly since our country was founded and reflects the continued need for deep systemic change in our society. We know it won’t happen overnight, nor clearly in just one year, but it must happen. As George Floyd’s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, said, “Floyd was one man. George Floyd is a movement.”</p><p>And at Omidyar Network, while criminal justice reform is not one of our focus areas, there is a close link between economic injustice and racial violence. And between those two areas and true democracy. We know we will not bring about the kind of world we aspire to unless and until Black people are no longer trapped by systems that were intentionally created to lock them into poverty and strip them of voice and opportunity.</p><p>Last summer, we once again began a national racial justice reckoning, we looked deeply at our own systems and policies. We committed to become an anti-racist organization, and while we know we still have quite a long journey, we have taken the first of many steps. We gave more than $1 million to organizations fighting to protect and advance Black lives and another $4 million to organizations looking to reimagine our economy through a racial justice lens. Again, these are the first of many steps we are taking to live up to our commitment and we know there is so much more we can and must do until Black Lives&nbsp;Matter.</p><p>As Ibram X. Kendi wrote in How to Be Anti-Racist, “After taking this grueling journey to the dirt road of anti-racism, humanity can come upon the clearing of a potential future: an antiracist world in all its imperfect beauty. It can become real if we focus on power instead of people, if we focus on changing policy instead of groups of people. It’s possible if we overcome our cynicism about the permanence of&nbsp;racism.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/statement-from-omidyar-network-on-derek-chauvin-verdict-the-first-step-to-justice-f28ec7673805">Statement from Omidyar Network on Derek Chauvin Verdict: The First Step to Justice</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As we continue our pandemic journey that is 2021, more and more people are getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Once vaccinated, people are (finally!) able to do more “in the real world.” However, in some cases such as international travel, there is a need to prove that you have been vaccinated before you can participate. In the past, that proof has been accomplished in the form of the paper World Health Organization Carte Jaune/Yellow Card. But in our 21st century pandemic, a handwritten paper document is not particularly trusted. It’s just too easy to buy or make your own. The sudden, urgent need to be able to prove health information in a safe, privacy-preserving and secure way has brought the spotlight on the concept of verifiable credentials and, for Hyperledger, on the three identity-focused projects in the community, Indy (a distributed ledger for identity), Aries (data exchange protocols and implementations of agents for people, organizations and things), and Ursa (a cryptographic library underlying Indy and Aries).</p>



<p>While people understand that paper credentials are insufficient and that a trusted digital solution is needed, they don’t understand why verifiable credentials, or more generally, identity, works extremely well with distributed ledger technology (DLT)—a distributed database spread across multiple nodes, of which blockchain is an example. To be clear from the start, it is not to put the credentials on a public ledger so everyone can see them! We’ll reiterate that a lot in this post. No private data ever goes on the blockchain!!!</p>



<p>To understand why DLT is useful for identity, we need to go back to the basics—paper credentials, how that model has worked for 1000s of years, and how the use of DLTs with verifiable credentials allows us to transition the great parts—security and privacy—of that model to the digital age.</p>
<p><br>Since as far back as 450BC, people have used paper credentials to enable trusted identity. Legend has it that King Artixerxes of the Persian Empire signed and gave Nehemiah a paper “safe transit” authorization that he used in travels across the empire. People have been using such documents ever since. In technical terms, a credential is an attestation of qualification, competence, or authority issued to an entity (e.g., an individual or organization) by a third party with a relevant or de facto authority or assumed competence to do so. Examples of credentials issued to people include a driver’s license, a passport, an academic degree, proof-of-vaccination and so on. Credentials are also issued to companies, such as business registrations, building permits, and even health inspection certifications.</p>
<p>



</p>


<p>Examples of Paper Credentials<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a></p>

A typical paper credential, say a driver’s license, is issued by a government authority (an issuer) after you prove to them who you are (usually in person using your passport or birth certificate) and that you are qualified to drive. You then hold this credential (usually in your wallet) and can use it elsewhere whenever you want—for example, to rent a car, to open a bank account or in a bar to show that you are old enough to drink. When you do that, you’re proving (or presenting) the credential to the verifier. The verifier inspects the physical document to decide if it is valid for the business purpose at hand. Note that in verifying the paper credential, the verifier does not call the issuer of the document. The transaction is only between the holder and the verifier. Further, it is the holder’s choice whether they want to share the piece of paper. If they want, they can keep it to themselves.

<p>The Paper Credential Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a></p>
<p>Verification in the paper credential model (ideally) proves:</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 Who issued the credential.&nbsp; 
 That the credential was issued to the entity presenting it. 
 That the claims have not been altered. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>The caveat “ideally” is included because of the real possibility of forgery in the use of paper credentials. Back to our “proof-of-vaccination” problem.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the good parts of the paper credential model are retained in the verifiable credentials model. With verifiable credentials:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>



</p>
 
 An authority decides you are eligible to receive a credential and issues you one. 
 You hold your credential in your (digital) wallet—it does not go on the distributed ledger! 
 At some point, a verifier asks you to prove the claims from one or more credentials. 
 If you decide to share your data with the verifier, you provide a verifiable presentation to the verifier, proving the same three things as with the paper credentials. 
 Plus: You may be able to prove one more thing—that the issued credentials have not been revoked. 
 
<p>As we’ll see, verifiable credentials and presentations are not simple documents that anyone can create. They are cryptographically constructed so that a presentation of the claims within a credential proves four attributes:</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Who issued the credential–their identifier is part of the credential and they signed the credential.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Who holds the credential–there is a cryptographic binding to the prover. 
 The claims have not been altered–they were signed at the time of issuance. 
 The credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>Unlike a paper credential, those four attributes are evaluated not based on the judgment and expertise of the person looking at the credential, but rather by machine using cryptographic algorithms that are extremely difficult to forge. Like the paper credential, the verifier does not go back to the issuer to ask about the credential being presented. Only the prover and verifier, the participants in the interaction, need to know about the presentation. So where do the prover and verifier get the information they need for their transaction? We’re just getting to that…</p>
<p>



</p>
<p><br>The Verifiable Credentials Model<br>By Peter Stokyo, <a href="mailto:peter.stoyko@elanica.com">peter.stoyko@elanica.com</a>, Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Compared to the paper credentials model, verifiable credentials are far more secure. When the cryptographic verification succeeds, the verifier can be certain of the validity of the data—those four attributes stemming from verifying the presentation. They are left only with the same question that paper credentials have—do I trust the issuer enough</p>
<p>So where does the DLT fit in?</p>
<p>Three of the four things that the verifier has to prove (listed above) involves published data from the issuer that has to be available in some trusted, public distributed place, a place that is not controlled by a central authority (hmm…sounds like a DLT!). In Indy and Aries, data published to a DLT is used to verify the credential without having to check with the issuer. In particular:</p>
 
 The verifier has to know who issued the credential based on an identifier and cryptographic signature. From the presentation, it gets an identifier for the issuer, looks it up on a DLT to get a public key associated with the issuer to verify the signature in the presentation. Thus, the identity of the issuer is known. 
 The verifier has to verify that the claims data has not been altered by verifying a cryptographic signature across the data. Based on an identifier for the type of credential, the verifier gets from a DLT a set of public keys and verifies the signatures. Thus, the verifier knows no one has tampered with the claims data. 
 The issuer periodically updates a revocation registry on a DLT indicating the credentials that have been revoked. If the holder’s credential is revoked, they are unable to create a proof of non-revocation (yes, that’s a double negative…). If the holder can generate that proof, the verifier can check it. Thus, the verifier knows the credential has not been revoked. 
 
<p>



</p>
<p>The fourth attribute (the binding of the credential to the holder) in Indy is done using some privacy-preserving cryptographic magic (called a Zero Knowledge Proof) that prevents having a unique identifier for the holder or credential being given to the verifier. Thus, no PII is needed for sharing trusted data.</p>
<p>So why DLT? First, we can get the good parts of paper credentials—private transactions between holders and verifiers and no callback to the issuer. Second, the issuer gets a trusted, open and transparent way to publish the cryptographic material needed for those private holder-verifier transactions. Third, there is no need to have a “Trusted Third Party” participating in the interactions.</p>
<p>And did I mention, no private data goes on the DLT!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>



</p>
<p>Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa are enabling this approach to “self-sovereign identity” in a big way,&nbsp; bringing about a new layer of trust on the Internet that will let us preserve our privacy and give us control over our identity and data—where it belongs. There is a lot to learn. If you’re curious, a great place to start is this <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-hyperledger-sovereign-identity-blockchain-solutions-indy-aries-and-ursa">Linux Foundation edX course</a>.</p>

Andrew has worked tirelessly over the last two and a half years to ensure we are working towards a world where people can safely express their identity to fully participate in the digital economy and society overall.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Good luck Andrew and all the best. E te rangatira, tēnā rawa atu koe. Kia pai te haere<br>&nbsp;<br>I’d also like to reflect a little on why I feel so privileged to have been offered the opportunity to take up this role.<br>&nbsp;<br>Clearly, we are living in an age of unprecedented advances across a broad range of technologies, not just in digital but in biotech, in engineering, in pharmaceuticals, in energy, in advanced materials, in 3-D printing, in nanotech, in robotics; the list is a very long one!<br>&nbsp;<br>If you are familiar with work from the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.information-age.com/technology-converting-scarce-abundance-peter-diamandis-123483251/">Peter Diamandis</a>&nbsp;(co-founder of Singularity University and X-Prize), Jeremy Rifkin (of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thezeromarginalcostsociety.com/">the zero marginal cost society</a>&nbsp;fame) and&nbsp;<a href="https://salimismail.com/">Salim Ismail</a>&nbsp;(author of Exponential Organisations) you will be aware that they evangelise a coming age of abundance, driven by the mass adoption of these advancing technologies.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, anyone who’s read or listened to Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee around what they call&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/the-great-decoupling">The Great Decoupling</a>, will be aware that access to this abundance has not been equitable to date, and that the technology-driven rise in labour productivity seen in the last few years has not been matched by an equivalent rise in prosperity for the majority of people.<br>&nbsp;<br>To me it is very clear that equitable access to technology is&nbsp;the&nbsp;key driver in ensuring that the benefits of a tech-driven age of abundance can be provided to all people, not just the lucky few. It is also very clear to me that digital identity is at the very heart of ensuring that equitable access.</p>



<p>Ngā Mihi,</p>

<p>The DIF Steering Committee has approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. Here is a snapshot of the four companies and four implementations that stretched and built the specification.</p> Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity <p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, “v1” so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p> What exactly is a “Sidetree”? <p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains — but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF&nbsp;members.</p> The team that delivered the specification <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA,&nbsp;USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in&nbsp;DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON,&nbsp;Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX,&nbsp;USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global/">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New&nbsp;Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p> The first generation of Sidetree&nbsp;Systems <p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION&nbsp;nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION&nbsp;node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION&nbsp;network.   What’s next for&nbsp;Sidetree <p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given&nbsp;type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">Sidetree Protocol reaches V1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      <p>The structural properties of object capability systems favor modularity in code design and ensure reliable encapsulation in code implementation.</p>

      <p>These structural properties facilitate the analysis of some security properties of an object-capability program or operating system. Some of these – in particular, information flow properties – can be analyzed at the level of object references and connectivity, independent of any knowledge or analysis of the code that determines the behavior of the objects. As a consequence, these security properties can be established and maintained in the presence of new objects that contain unknown and possibly malicious code.</p>

      <p>The capability model is, in a sense, the object model taken to its logical extreme. Where object programmers seek modularity – a decrease in the dependencies between separately thought-out units – capability programmers seek security, recognizing that required trust is a form of dependency. Object programmers wish to guard against bugs: a bug in module A should not propagate to module B. Capability programmers wish to guard against malice. However, if B is designed to be invulnerable to A’s malice, it is likely also invulnerable to A’s bugs.</p>

      <p>Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data (ZCAP-LD for short) provides a secure way for linked data systems to grant and express authority utilizing the object capability model. Capabilities are represented as linked data objects which are signed with Linked Data Proofs. ZCAP-LD supports delegating authority to other entities on the network by chaining together capability documents. “Caveats” may be attached to capability documents which may be used to restrict the scope of their use, for example to restrict the actions which may be used or providing a mechanism by which the capability may be later revoked.</p>

         A Java Program object reference is a capability, it allows for actions on the subject (the object instance). 
         A stronger implementation of object capabilities involves a digital certificate issued by a public key, for a resource with a set of supported methods:<br>

      <p>Object capabilities (ocaps) are increasingly recognized as an important tool for achieving the goals of self-sovereign identity.

      <p>Considering different models for handling identity information allows reconciliation, and creates opportunities to address primary use cases across paradigms, increasing overall strength and security of a solution.<br>
[…]<br>
In the Object Capabilities model, authorization is managed by creating, sharing, attenuating, and using “capabilities” instead of, for example, access control lists. If you have a valid “capability”, you have the authorization. Like a car key, Object Capabilities may be used no matter who you are. This model shifts the burden of identification from error-prone correlations to directly work with individuals’ actual capabilities.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/draft-documents/smarm.md">Smart signatures</a> are desirable, but how to implement them? We need a language that is powerful and flexible enough to meet our needs while safe and bounded to run while remaining simple enough to feasibly implement.</p>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_programming_language">Scheme</a> is a turing-complete language with a (at least stated) fondness for minimalism. Unfortunately Scheme on its own is neither “safe” nor (necessarily) deterministic. Thankfully we can get the properties we want through:</p>

       
         Making object capabilities a core part of the language. Specifically, <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/pubs/secureos/secureos.html">Jonathan Rees’ “W7 security kernel”</a> demonstrates that a pure lexically scoped environment is itself an appropritate substrate for object capabilities. 
         Restricting space and time precisely in a way that is deterministic and reproducible. 
         Removing sources of external side effects.

    <blockquote>
      <p>Identity Hubs as currently proposed in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) are a subset of a general Decentralized Identifier (DID) based user-controlled agent, based on ACLs rather than an object-capabilities (ocap) architecture.  The current approach has both security and scalability issues. Transitioning the Hubs design to an ocap model can be achieved by introducing an UMA authorization server as the control endpoint. This avoids creating confused-deputy security issues and expands scale by enabling the hub to delegate access to resources not stored in the hub itself.</p>

      <p>Linked Data Signatures enable a method of asserting the integrity of linked data documents that are passed throughout the web.

      <p>Immunity credentials can allow those who are not COVID-positive to return to daily in-person routines, travel or going back to work, providing evidence that they are low-risk of transmitting the COVID-19 virus. This could be accomplished through a national digital identification system that monitors and tracks the health status of its citizens. The details of how digital immunity credentials would be implemented are still up in the air, but may include important features such as the ability to share results remotely, interoperability across systems, proof of authenticity and the potential for individuals to have full ownership over their health data.</p>

      <p>We are all painfully aware of the economic and social restrictions imparted on us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to reopen offices, restaurants, local private and public facilities — and most importantly, international borders — will likely require a flexible, interoperable, and ubiquitous system that preserves individual agency and privacy. The COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) focuses its efforts on supporting technology projects that work to meet these requirements through the utilization of W3C compliant ‘Verifiable Credentials (VCs)’, a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.</p>

      <p>When the COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) was formed in April 2020, we were a self-organizing group of companies and individuals, held together by a few mailing lists and working groups, to explore how Verifiable Credentials (VCs), an open standard and an emerging technology, could be used for the public health crisis unfolding with COVID-19. Recognizing our limits early on as an informal group, we quickly pivoted from developing a solution together to supporting each other to build for their local contexts. Over the course of nine months, we have seen over 20 projects present their work to the CCI community and developed an MVP governance framework that can be adapted to specific COVID-19 use cases.</p>

      <p>Drummond Reed, Steering Committee Member, Trust-over-IP-Foundation, comments: “The vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world because it is the hallmark of authenticity for a legal entity of any kind. The family of digital credentials in the GLEIF vLEI Governance Framework can serve as a chain of trust for anyone needing to verify the legal identity of an organization or of a person legally acting on that organization’s behalf. The demand this will create for LEIs — and the impact it will have on adoption of self-sovereign identity — cannot be overestimated.

I must also point out that though this blog is written through the lens of my journey, my learning isn’t mine alone — it is greatly informed by so many people, disciplines and research and I am grateful to the countless people that have gracefully shared their knowledge and wisdom so that we might collectively grow together.</p><blockquote>“Who and what gets fixed in place to enable progress? What social groups are classified, corralled, coerced and capitalized upon so others are free to tinker, experiment and engineer the future?” Ruha&nbsp;Benjamin</blockquote><p>I started off my exploration with this hypothesis: Can humanitarian digital policy be decolonized?</p><p>I started with this, as I’ve often argued that the humanitarian aid system perpetuates hierarchical, patriarchal, hegemonic views of what ‘development’ and ‘progress’ looks like, ignoring other world-views, and underlying systemic and structural pillars of inequality and bias. As the humanitarian aid system increasingly intersects with technology systems developed in the context of Western capitalism and in small pockets of privileged power, I have not been alone in raising concerns on the implications of collision of two systems that are fundamentally patriarchal and hegemonic on those that are minoritized in the Global&nbsp;South.</p><p>To put in context, the range of digital or technology systems that humanitarian actors engage with is incredibly wide. This can range from (as a snapshot):</p>  Systems used to support the coordination of aid efforts — for example, biometric digital identities with refugee assistance programs or earth observing technology in disaster&nbsp;relief  Digital platforms or digital transformation with partners — for example, e-government services that link social protection and citizen&nbsp;welfare  Technology innovations to support affected populations access to aid — for example, ICTs, apps, digital ledgers, hardware and many&nbsp;others  <p>Even what we constitute as ‘humanitarian’ has shades of grey — whether it’s at the pointy end of a crisis, to support during peacetime. The wide array of aid provision does not easily exist within the carefully designed terminology found in textbooks and political resolutions.</p><p>Additionally, who works on technology or digital innovations within humanitarian institutions is wildly divergent — mostly within institutions innovation labs, or within digital or thematic teams — then deployed to the global south for implementation or testing (the notion of testing on vulnerable groups is already contentious and has its own set of critiques).</p><p>The diversity of use cases, contexts, stakeholders and owners does have one common thread however. As humanitarian organisations do not tend to traditionally have the requisite digital or technology expertise in-house, they partner externally to achieve their aims. And this is the sticking point — it easily falls into expertise and partnerships that predominantly come from small communities of public-private, technology partners, and academic institutions from the global north. What this does (whether implicitly or unconsciously) is to reinforce a dominant, hegemonic narrative that&nbsp;assumes:</p>  The experiences of global civil society and its actors, is homogeneous  The singular ‘Silicon Valley’ values that underpin such digital policies are the ones that all people aspire to, regardless of where they live or their cultural, societal, economic, geographic bearings  Power dynamics will continue to be affirmed in the hands of those that currently hold it without considering the cascading impacts of those policy decisions on those that are most going to be affected by&nbsp;it  <p>The appropriateness and impacts of digital technologies and AI within aid systems is still being discovered and understood. An incredible amount of work has gone into establishing data governance guidance and data protection protocols but not as much into broader policy governing the deployment and use of these technologies sector wide. Often they are siloed into communities or thematic areas of work, or perhaps resulting in codes of conduct — but not systematically looking at a sector wide approach that interrogates whether the use of these technologies paradoxically expose, mitigate or expand harm on often marginalised, minoritised constituents AND whether the digital futures we are chasing merely replicate or reinforce existing or past inequalities?.</p><blockquote>“..the relationship between tech industries and those populations who are outside their ambit of power — women, populations in the Global South, including black, Indigenous and Latinx communities in North America, immigrants in Europe — is a colonial one” Sareetyta Amrute, Data and&nbsp;Society</blockquote><p>So, could humanitarian actors play a more intentional role in designing just and equitable digital futures? Could we in fact, unshackle ourselves from our neo-colonial humanitarian mental models, and push back against the hierarchies of techno-chauvinism and meritocracy? Could we use this moment in time to design worlds that don’t imagine some figures, especially populations in the Global South — to merely be passive beneficiaries and outside of the borders of expertise we seek? Could we invert the pathways of tech colonialism in the aid&nbsp;sector?</p><p>As I started my exploration, I realised that my original hypothesis needed more rigour. There were tensions inherent in my original starting point. Firstly, what in fact constitutes digital policy? For whom? For what purpose? What influence does policy have in fact over systems? Different actors have their own policy making instruments — that are incumbent on different leverage points that service multiple agendas. Considering the multiplicity of use cases, actors, and contexts — what I was softly heading to was the governance of the deployment and use of digital systems and technologies within the aid sector. Notwithstanding the work in data governance and data protection in aid, there are still gaps in governance in terms of how and when we deploy tech innovation, the digital systems we are creating and supporting to create, supply chains that we are a part of, due diligence processes, accountability and risk ownership, and many other elements. In addition to this, are questions of immunity (traditionally, humanitarian organisations do not go beyond the individual institutional governance mechanisms, that often are bordered by the institution’s immunity); and appropriateness of the technology innovations we&nbsp;deploy.</p><p>How then do we design digital governance systems that speak to these complex, intertwined issues? Instead of merely looking at digital governance in terms of control, could weaving in feminist and decolonial approaches help us liberate our digital futures so that it is a space of safety, of humanity — for those whom we are meant to support? Are these approaches ways in which we can design new forms of digital humanism?</p><blockquote>“We could build systems for durability, but instead some dipshits told you we needed to move fast and break things” Audrey&nbsp;Watters</blockquote><p>Could a digital governance approach consider questions like the following:</p>  How then do we go beyond what we are merely legally required to do versus what is right to do? And importantly, are humanitarian actors willing to go beyond their immunity?  How do we extend digital governance to go beyond the fortresses of individual institutions to a multi-actor, sector wide approach that is emergent and iterative?  Can and should governance systems help users realize and/or amplify their rights and in fact use it as a way to hold humanitarian actors to&nbsp;account?  How might governance systems actually flatten power in decision&nbsp;making  Can governance systems help us monitor our accountability to our promises to affected populations?  Who has the power to draw the conclusions from assessments done?  Just because we *can* deploy a specific asset or tech, *should*&nbsp;we?  How do we increase percentage of risk/harm that gets absolved by humanitarian institutions rather than that risk/harm being pushed further down the chain to affected populations?  How might we incentivise governance systems to do the right&nbsp;thing?  <p>Digital technologies and AI mask ideologies of power, and are wed to a market ideology of dominance. To intentionally carve a different type of ideology would require governance systems that are informed by different knowledge sources into decision making. That prioritise those that are most impacted by or are on the receiving end of that initiative, rather than cantering donor or aid institutions privileges. Good digital governance in the vein that this research is pursuing then, must disrupt the idea of ‘solutionism’, must also critique the systems in which that technology is being deployed and the impacts of that deployment — now and into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>And this is when my hypothesis started to fork out. Where I originally thought to use elements of futures methodologies to analyse future states and imaginaries of what we might collectively desire, I realised this was not enough for the rigour of what is needed to be achieved. What I have learned in my practice of strategic foresight within systems and institutional transformation is that the facilitation of the method does not automatically result in a change in policy and/or strategic decision making. And that is because the application of insights isn’t weaved into and within how change actually occurs. Often in humanitarian/development work, we are fire-fighting the now — the problem right in front of us. We design solutions and interventions aimed to problem solving what is immediately in front of us without necessarily assessing three&nbsp;things:</p>  The complexity of the system in which that issue&nbsp;lives  Just as rights are not static, neither is harm. What is the current and future theory of harm that might arise out of that solution/intervention  What might be the impact of the solution/intervention on future generations and on our&nbsp;planet  Who holds the fiduciary duty to future digital selves of affected populations?  <p>I now radically pursue the idea of foresight within ethics systems to inform governance. Can we consider the ethics of intervention through the lens of constraining future good and mitigating future bad? Might this in fact be where it can add rigour and&nbsp;value?</p><blockquote>“Our radical imagination is a tool for decolonization, for reclaiming our right to shape our lived reality.” ― Adrienne Maree&nbsp;Brown</blockquote><p>Lastly, I realised that my focus on decolonisation was somewhat, and honestly — skewed.</p><p>Decolonisation is the process of undoing and giving up social and economic power, and restoring what has been taken away in the past, which arguably includes reparations. As Eve Tuck and Wayne Yang argue — decolonisation is also not a metaphor for diversity and inclusion nor is it a replacement for social justice efforts. Would the efforts of humanitarian aid ever include reparations? Could we ethically profess to even do so? We often argue that for the humanitarian system to change, it would involve giving up the status quo that we have a strangle-hold on. However, could this ever be achieved through the result of this one approach/framework? Am I being authentic, am I being honest if I were to declare it so? The answer was&nbsp;no.</p><p>What I was unpacking in actuality, was the notion of decoloniality — an aspiration to restore, renew, elevate, rediscover, acknowledge and validate the multiplicity of lives, lived-experiences, culture and knowledge of indigenous people, people of colour, and colonised people as well as to decenter hetere/cis-normativity, gender hierarchies and racial privilege. I think of this as how do we exist in plurality — in a multiverse so to speak. And to include this in governance, not as a tokenistic or virtue-signalling flag, but rather to help us consider different lenses, perspectives, sources of truth in even how we think about what is right, what is fair and what is just. How might decolonial and feminist approaches help us reframe our starting points and in fact influence governance design? This isn’t about just getting different under-represented groups around the table, but rather how might we shift the knowledge and experiences we draw from in the very design and decision making of policy and governance frames. It is to ensure that we are considering the multiplicity of ways in which issues of rights, privacy and agency are understood and experienced the world over, and not imposing just one or a narrow valued judgement on these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Through applying a decolonial lens to governance, might we in fact be able to intentionally design for equity rather than for privilege?</p><blockquote>“Decolonisation, expressed by your lips, differs from the decolonisation that comes from within, as a revolutionary concept that speaks about rehumanization — a fundamental planetary project” — Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni</blockquote><p>Thus, I am gently landing on Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance. An emergent process that is grounded in the following hypothesis: How do we not lock people into future harm, indebtedness or future inequity? It seeks to help start answering the questions unearthed through the journey thus far. Importantly, its primacy is to shift the focus of current humanitarian digital efforts that prioritise the problem solving of now, to one that aims to mitigate future harm and inequity. It aims at not binding nor narrowing the governance actions of humanitarian actors to merely their institutional legal liabilities and privileges but rather allows self-regulation for a shared responsibility for our collective futures across all actors and constituents in the aid&nbsp;sector.</p><p>The Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance is a framework that&nbsp;is:</p>  Multi-Dimensional (intentionally includes plurality of perspectives affected populations, minoritized groups, humanitarian and tech governance actors, activists, and ethicists)  Rigorously analyses future harms and impacts on future generations  Interrogates who absorbs future&nbsp;harm  Grounded in the rights and equity of impacted minoritized people  Is emergent and acts as a compass (not a checkbox)  <p>I see it visualised in three&nbsp;weaves:</p><p>And how we might judge this? Though not complete, perhaps some questions we might weave into that could&nbsp;include:</p><p>1. For the improvements it makes relative to what is&nbsp;replaced</p><p>2. For its understanding and active management of unintended consequences</p><p>3. For its mitigation and absorption of current and future&nbsp;harm</p><p>4. For its ability to cultivate an evolved awareness of rights, accountability and collective humanity</p><p>And that is where I am up to. This is a journey that isn’t complete by any measure. In fact, this framework must never be complete. It must never be static. The complexities we are dealing with are continuously evolving, and our commons have irrevocably shifted. We must unpack decades of mental models and behaviours as the range of choices about the type of futures we want to inhabit — has expanded exponentially, and the choices we make now will decide our collective fates.</p><p>To design more flourishing and liberated futures for all, we must uncover the plurality that is available to all of us, to frame how we see the&nbsp;world.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/decolonial-humanitarian-digital-governance-48b35b05b110">Decolonial Humanitarian Digital Governance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Between Games and Apocalyptic Robots: Considering Near-Term Social Risks of Reinforcement Learning  An increasingly popular branch of Machine Learning challenges current approaches to algorithmic governance. <p>With many of us stuck at home this past year, we’ve seen a surge in the popularity of video games. That trend hasn’t been limited to humans. DeepMind and Google AI both released results from their Atari playing AIs, which have taught themselves to play over fifty Atari games from scratch, with no provided rules or guidelines. The unique thing about these new results is how general the AI agent is. While previous efforts have achieved human performance on the games they were trained to play, DeepMind’s new AI Agent, MuZero could teach itself to beat humans at Atari games it had never encountered in under a day. If this reminds you of AlphaZero which taught itself to play Go then Chess well enough to outperform world champions, that’s because it demonstrates an advance in the same suite of algorithms, a class of machine learning called Reinforcement Learning&nbsp;(RL).</p><p>While traditional machine learning parses out its model of the world (typically a small world pertaining only to the problem it’s designed to solve) from swathes of data, RL is real-time observation based. This means RL learns its model primarily through trial and error interactions with its environment, not by pulling out correlations from data representing a historical snapshot of it. In the RL framework, each interaction with the environment is an opportunity to build towards an overarching goal, referred to as a reward. An RL agent is trained to make a sequence of decisions on how to interact with its environment that will ultimately maximize its reward (i.e. help it win the&nbsp;game).</p><p>This unique iterative learning paradigm allows the AI model to change and adapt to its environment, making RL an attractive solution for open-ended, real-world problem-solving. It also makes it a leading candidate for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and has some researchers concerned about the rise of truly autonomous AI that does not align with human values. Nick Bostrom first posed what is now the canonical example of this risk among AI Safety researchers — a paperclip robot with one goal: optimize the production efficiency of paperclips. With no other specifications, the agent quickly drifts from optimizing its own paperclip factory to commandeering food production supply chains for the paperclip making cause. It proceeds to place paperclips above all other human needs until all that’s left of the world is a barren wasteland covered end to end with unused paper clips. The takeaway? Extremely literal problem solving combined with inaccurate problem definition can lead to bad outcomes.</p><p>This rogue AGI (albeit in more high-stakes incarnations like weapons management) is the type of harm usually thought of when trying to make RL safe in the context of society. However, between an autonomous agent teaching itself games in the virtual world and an intelligent but misguided AI putting humanity in existential risk lay a multitude of sociotechnical concerns. As RL is being rolled out in domains ranging from social media to medicine and education, it’s time we seriously think about these near-term risks.</p><p>How the paperclip problem will play out in the near term is likely to be rather subtle. For example, medical treatment protocols are currently popular candidates for RL modeling; they involve a series of decisions (which treatment options to try) with uncertain outcomes (different options work better for different people) that all connect to the eventual outcome (patient health). One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lIr8rgo5zE&amp;ab_channel=TEDxTalks">such study</a> tried to identify the best treatment decisions to avoid sepsis in ICU patients based off of multitudes of data, including medical histories, clinical charts and doctor’s notes. Their first iteration was an astounding success. With very high accuracy, it identified treatment paths that resulted in patient death. However, upon further examination and consultation with clinicians it turned out that though the agent had been allowed to learn from a plethora of potentially relevant treatment considerations, it had latched onto only one main indicator for death — whether or not a chaplain was called. The goal of the system was to flag treatment paths that led to deaths, and in a very literal sense that’s what it did. Clinicians only called a chaplain when a patient presented as close to&nbsp;death.</p><p>You’ll notice that in this example, the incredibly literal yet unhelpful solution the RL agent was taking was discovered by the researchers. This is no accident. The field of modern medicine is built around the reality that connections between treatment and outcomes typically have no known causal explanations. Aspirin, for example, was used as an anti-inflammatory for over seventy years before we had any insight into why it worked. This lack of causal understanding is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">intellectual debt</a>; if we can’t describe why something works, we may not be able to predict when or how it will fail. Medicine has grown around this fundamental uncertainty. Through strict codes of ethics, industry standards, and regulatory infrastructure (i.e. clinical trials), the field has developed the scaffolding to minimize the accompanying harms. RL systems aiming to help with diagnosis and treatment have to develop within this infrastructure. Compliance with the machinery medicine has around intellectual debt is more likely to result in slow and steady progress, without colossal misalignment. This same level of oversight does not apply to fields like social media, the potential harms of which are hard to pin down and which have virtually no regulatory scaffolding in&nbsp;place.</p><p>We may have already experienced some of the early harms of RL based algorithms in complex domains. In 2018 YouTube engineers released a paper describing an RL addition to their recommendation algorithm that increased daily watch time by 6 million hours in the beta testing phase. Meanwhile, anecdotal accounts of radicalization through YouTube rabbit holes of increasingly conspiratorial content (e.g., NYTimes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html">reporting</a> on YouTube’s role in empowering Brazil’s far right) were on the rise. While it is impossible to know exactly which algorithms powered the platform’s recommendations at the time, this rabbit hole effect would be a natural result of an RL algorithm trying to maximize view time by nudging users towards increasingly addictive content.</p><p>In the near future, dynamic manipulation of this sort may end up at odds with established protections under the law. For example, Facebook has recently been put under scrutiny by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18286660/facebook-hud-housing-discrimination-case-section-230-legal-defense">discriminatory housing advertisements</a>. The HUD suit alleges that even without explicit targeting filters that amount to the exclusion of protected groups, its algorithms are likely to hide ads from ‘users whom the system determines are unlikely to engage with the ad, even if the advertiser explicitly wants to reach those users.’ Given the types of (non-RL) ML algorithms FB currently uses in advertising, proving this disparate impact would be a matter of examining the data and features used to train the algorithm. While the current lack of transparency makes this challenging, it is fundamentally possible to roll out benchmarks capable of flagging such discrimination.</p><p>If advertising were instead powered by RL, benchmarks would not be enough. An RL advertising algorithm tasked with ensuring it does not discriminate against protected classes, could easily end up making it look as though it were not discriminating instead. If the RL agent were optimized for profit and the practice of discrimination was profitable, the RL agent would be incentivized to find loopholes under which it could circumvent protections. Just like in the sepsis treatment case, the system is likely to find a shortcut towards reaching its objective, only in this case the lack of regulatory scaffolding makes it unlikely this failure will be picked up. The propensity of RL to adapt to meet metrics, while skirting over intent, will make it challenging to tag such undesirable behavior. This situation is further complicated by our heavy reliance on ‘data’ as a means to flag potential bias in ML&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Unlike RL, traditional machine learning is innately static; it takes in loads of data, parses it for correlations, and outputs a model. Once a system has been trained, updating it to accommodate a new environment or changes to the status quo requires repeating most or all of that initial training with updated data. Even for firms that have the computing power to make such retraining seamless, the reliance on data has allowed an ‘in’ for transparency. The saying goes, machine learning is like money laundering for bias. If an ML system is trained using biased or unrepresentative data, its model of the world will reflect that. In traditional machine learning, we can at least follow the marked bills and point out when an ML system is going to be prone to discrimination by examining its training data. We may even be able to preprocess the data before training the system in an attempt to preemptively correct for&nbsp;bias.</p><p>Since RL is generally real-time observation-based rather than training data-based, this ‘follow-the-data’ approach to algorithmic oversight does not apply. There is no controlled input data to help us anticipate or correct for where an RL system can go wrong before we set it loose in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In certain domains, this lack of data-born insight may not be too problematic. The more we can specify what the moving parts of a given application are and the ways in which they may fail–be it through an understanding of the domain or regulatory scaffolding–the safer it is for us to use RL. DeepMind’s use of RL to lower the energy costs of its computing centers, a process ultimately governed by the laws of physics, deserves less scrutiny than the RL based K-12 curriculum generator Google’s Ed Chi views as a near-term goal of the field. The harder it is to describe what success looks like within a given domain, the more prone to bad outcomes it is. This is true of all ML systems, but even more crucial for RL systems that cannot be meaningfully validated ahead of use. As regulators, we need to think about which domains need more regulatory scaffolding to minimize the fallout from our intellectual debt, while allowing for the immense promise of algorithms that can learn from their mistakes.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/between-games-and-apocalyptic-robots-considering-near-term-societal-risks-of-reinforcement-35ec5af8f04a">Between Games and Apocalyptic Robots: Considering Near-Term Societal Risks of Reinforcement…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Hyperledger Ursa is a shared cryptographic library, it enables implementations to avoid duplicating other cryptographic work and hopefully increase security in the process. The library is an opt-in repository (for Hyperledger and non Hyperledger projects) to place and use crypto. Hyperledger Ursa consists of sub-projects, which are cohesive implementations of cryptographic code or interfaces to cry

 Manifesto 
<p><a href="https://id2020.org/manifesto">The Alliance Manifesto</a></p>
 
   The ability to prove one’s identity is a fundamental and universal human right. 
   We live in a digital era. Individuals need a trusted, verifiable way to prove who they are, both in the physical world and online. 
   Over 1 billion people worldwide are unable to prove their identity through any recognized means. As such, they are without the protection of law, and are unable to access basic services, participate as a citizen or voter, or transact in the modern economy. Most of those affected are children and adolescents, and many are refugees, forcibly displaced, or stateless persons. 
   For some, including refugees, the stateless, and other marginalized groups, reliance on national identification systems isn’t possible. This may be due to exclusion, inaccessibility, or risk, or because the credentials they do hold are not broadly recognized. While we support efforts to expand access to national identity programs, we believe it is imperative to complement such efforts by providing an alternative to individuals lacking safe and reliable access to state-based systems. 
   We believe that individuals must have control over their own digital identities, including how personal data is collected, used, and shared. Everyone should be able to assert their identity across institutional and national borders, and across time. Privacy, portability, and persistence are necessary for digital identity to meaningfully empower and protect individuals. 
   Digital identity carries significant risk if not thoughtfully designed and carefully implemented. We do not underestimate the risks of data misuse and abuse, particularly when digital identity systems are designed as large, centralized databases. 
   Technical design can mitigate some of the risks of digital identity. Emerging technology — for example, cryptographically secure, decentralized systems — could provide greater privacy protection for users, while also allowing for portability and verifiability. But widespread agreement on principles, technical design patterns, and interoperability standards is needed for decentralized digital identities to be trusted and recognized. 
   This “better” model of digital identity will not emerge spontaneously. In order for digital identities to be broadly trusted and recognized, we need sustained and transparent collaboration aligned around these shared principles, along with supporting regulatory and policy frameworks. 
   ID2020 Alliance partners jointly define functional requirements, influencing the course of technical innovation and providing a route to technical interoperability, and therefore trust and recognition. 
   The ID2020 Alliance recognizes that taking these ideas to scale requires a robust evidence base, which will inform advocacy and policy. As such, ID2020 Alliance-supported pilots are designed around a common monitoring and evaluation framework.

 Introduction 
<p>Financial-grade API&nbsp;(FAPI) is a technical specification that&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">Financial-grade API Working Group</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>&nbsp;has developed. It uses&nbsp;OAuth 2.0&nbsp;and&nbsp;OpenID Connect&nbsp;(OIDC) as its base and defines additional technical requirements for the financial industry and other industries that require higher API security.</p>

 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 OpenID Foundation Working Groups and Financial-grade API Stack
 History 
<p>Implementer’s Draft 1&nbsp;— The initial version of the FAPI specification was published in 2017. The version is called Implementer’s Draft 1 (ID1).</p>
<p>Implementer’sDraft 2&nbsp;— The second version was published in October, 2018. The version is called Implementer’s Draft 2 (ID2). In this version, the FAPI specification was renamed from “Financial API” to “Financial-grade API” for wider adoption across various industries.</p>
<p>Final Version — The final version was published in March, 2021. In this version, the main two parts of the FAPI specification, “Part 1: Read-Only Security Profile” and “Part 2: Read and Write API Security Profile”, were renamed to “Part 1: Baseline Security Profile” and “Part 2: Advanced Security Profile”, respectively.</p>
<p>FAPI 2.0&nbsp;— The FAPI WG has started to discuss the next version of the FAPI specification, which is called “FAPI 2.0”. The&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>&nbsp;published on March 31, 2021 (<a href="https://openid.net/2021/03/31/picking-up-speed-on-the-fapi-roadmap-from-the-fapi-rw-implementers-draft-2-to-fapi-1-0-advanced-final/">announcement</a>) mentions FAPI 2.0. Authlete is mentioned in the answer to the question “Are there FAPI 2.0 implementations?” because Authlete has already implemented new technical components of FAPI 2.0 such as&nbsp;PAR&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>),&nbsp;RAR&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>) and&nbsp;DPoP&nbsp;(<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-dpop/">OAuth 2.0 Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer</a>).</p>

 Prior Knowledge 
 Basic Specifications 
<p>The format of the FAPI specification is a terse list of technical requirements, so the document is not long. In exchange, a lot of prior knowledge is required to read it smoothly. Especially, you have to learn&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>&nbsp;(the core of OAuth 2.0) and&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</a>&nbsp;(the core of OpenID Connect) by heart.</p>
<p>In addition, because specifications related to JWT (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515">JWS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516">JWE</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JWK</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">JWA</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>) are prior knowledge to understand OIDC Core, they are of course prior knowledge to read the FAPI specification. Therefore, you need to understand them perfectly.</p>

 Mutual TLS 
<p>In general, “Mutual TLS” means that a client is also required to present its X.509 certificate in a TLS connection. However, in the context of FAPI, Mutual TLS means the following two which are defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>” (MTLS).</p>
 
 OAuth client authentication using a client certificate 
 Tokens bound to a client certificate 
 
 OAuth Client Authentication using a Client Certificate 
<p>When a&nbsp;confidential client&nbsp;(RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">2. Client Types</a>) accesses a token endpoint (RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2">3.2. Token Endpoint</a>),&nbsp;client authentication&nbsp;(RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3">2.3. Client Authentication</a>) is required. Client authentication is a process where a client application proves it has its confidential authentication information.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication at Token Endpoint
<p>There are several ways for client authentication. The following are client authentication methods listed in OIDC Core,&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication">9. Client Authentication</a>&nbsp;(except&nbsp;<code>none</code>).</p>
 
 <code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;— Basic Authentication using a pair of client ID and client secret 
 <code>client_secret_post</code>&nbsp;— Embedding a pair of client ID and client secret in a request body 
 <code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;— Passing a JWT signed by a key based on a client secret with a symmetric algorithm 
 <code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;— Passing a JWT signed by a private key with an asymmetric algorithm 
 
<p>In&nbsp;<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code>, a client application directly shows the server its client secret to prove that it has the confidential information.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Client Authentication using Basic Authentication
<p>In&nbsp;<code>client_secret_jwt</code>, a client application indirectly proves that it has the client secret by signing a JWT with the client secret and passing the JWT to the server. On the other hand, in&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>, signing is performed with an asymmetric private key and the server verifies the signature with the public key corresponding to the private key.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Client Authentication using JWT
<p>Apart from the above, “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-for-oauth-client">2. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>&nbsp;introduces new client authentication methods below.</p>
 
 <code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;— Utilizing a PKI client certificate used in a TLS connection 
 <code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;— Utilizing a self-signed client certificate used in a TLS connection 
 
<p>These two utilize the client certificate used in a TLS connection between the client and the token endpoint for client authentication.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Certificate for Client Authentication
<p>In&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>, the PKI client certificate used in a TLS connection established between a client and a server is used for client authentication. The server verifies the client certificate (this should be done even in a context irrelevant to OAuth) and then checks whether the Subject Distinguished Name or Subject Alternative Name matches the pre-registered one. For this process, client applications that want to use&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;for client authentication must register Subject Distinguished Name or Subject Alternative Name into the server in advance. The specification newly defines the following client metadata for this purpose (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-client-registration-metadata">2.1.2 Client Registration Metadata</a>).</p>
 
 <code>tls_client_auth_subject_dn</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_dns</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_uri</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_ip</code> 
 <code>tls_client_auth_san_email</code> 
 
<p>In&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>, a self-signed client certificate is used instead of a PKI client certificate. To use this client authentication method, client applications have to register a self-signed client certificate into the server in advance.</p>
<p>The following table is the list of client authentication methods mentioned in the FAPI specification.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods
<p>For detailed explanation about client authentication, please read “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/oauth-2-0-client-authentication-4b5f929305d4">OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication</a>”. Also, if you are not familiar with X.509 certificate, please read “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/illustrated-x-509-certificate-84aece2c5c2e">Illustrated X.509 Certificate</a>”.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 X.509 Certificate Chain

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 X.509 Certificate in PEM Format
 Certificate-Bound Tokens 
<p>Once a traditional access token is leaked, an attacker can access APIs with the access token. Traditional access tokens are just like a train ticket which anyone can use once it is stolen.</p>
<p>An idea to mitigate this vulnerability is to check whether the API caller bringing an access token matches the legitimate holder of the access token when an API call is made. This is just like the boarding procedure for international flights where passengers are required to show not only a plane ticket but also their passport.</p>
<p>This idea is called “Proof of Possession” (PoP) and FAPI lists “Mutual TLS” as an only possible option of PoP ( — in the previous versions (ID1 &amp; ID2), “Token Binding” was mentioned as a PoP mechanim but it was dropped by the final version). In this context, “Mutual TLS” means the specification defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica">3. Mutual-TLS Client Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>.</p>
<p>Because Mutual TLS has several meanings as explained above and I actually experienced a problematic conversation like below,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: The API management solution of your company does not support Mutual TLS (as a PoP mechanism).<br>
The company: Not correct. Our solution supports Mutual TLS (because it can be configured to request a client certificate for TLS communication).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve personally decided to call Mutual TLS as a PoP mechanism “Certificate Binding”. This naming is not so bad (at least for me) because it sounds symmetrical to Token Binding and because actual implementations will eventually become just binding a certificate to an access token and won’t care whether the certificate has been extracted from a mutual TLS connection or has come from somewhere else.</p>
<p>In an implementation of Certificate Binding, when the token endpoint of an authorization server issues an access token, it calculates the hash value of the client certificate presented by the client application in the TLS connection and remembers the binding between the access token and the hash value (or embeds the hash value into the access token if the implementation of the access token is a self-contained JWT). When the client application accesses an API of the target resource server, it uses the same client certificate that was previously used in the communication with the token endpoint. The implementation of the API extracts an access token and a client certificate from the request, calculates the hash value of the client certificate and checks the hash value matches the one that is associated with the access token. If they match, the API implementation accepts the request. If not, it rejects the request.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Certificate Binding
<p>It is relatively easy to implement Certificate Binding because it can be implemented only if the client certificate is accessible. On the other hand, Token Binding is relatively hard because it is necessary to modify multiple layers such as TLS layer and HTTP layer. In addition, the future is uncertain as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5097603234529280">Chrome has removed the Token Binding feature</a>&nbsp;although the community strongly tried to urge Chrome team to rethink it (“<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/OkdLUyYmY1E">Intent to Remove: Token Binding</a>”). However, anyway, related specifications were promoted to RFCs at the beginning of October, 2018.</p>
 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8471">RFC 8471&nbsp;</a>— The Token Binding Protocol Version 1.0 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8472">RFC 8472</a>&nbsp;— Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extension for Token Binding Protocol Negotiation 
 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8473">RFC 8473</a>&nbsp;— Token Binding over HTTP 
 
<p>“<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-token-binding/?include_text=1">OAuth 2.0 Token Binding</a>” (its status is “expired”) is a specification that defines rules to apply Token Binding to OAuth 2.0 tokens based on the specifications listed above.</p>
<p>NOTE: The final version of the FAPI specification dropped Token Binding due to its unlikeliness of future availability.</p>
 JARM 
<p>JARM&nbsp;is a new specification which was approved at the same timing with FAPI Implementer’s Draft 2. JARM is referred to in FAPI Part 2.</p>
 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-jarm-ID1.html">Financial-grade API: JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM)</a> 
 
<p>The specification defines new values for the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter as shown below.</p>
 
 <code>query.jwt</code> 
 <code>fragment.jwt</code> 
 <code>form_post.jwt</code> 
 <code>jwt</code> 
 
<p>If one of the above is specified, response parameters of an authorization response are packed into a JWT and the JWT is returned as the value of a single&nbsp;<code>response</code>&nbsp;response parameter.</p>
<p>For example, a traditional authorization response in the authorization code flow looks like below.&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;response parameters are included separately.</p>
 HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.com/callback?code={CODE}&amp;state={STATE} 
<p>On the other hand, if&nbsp;<code>response_mode=query.jwt</code>&nbsp;is added to an authorization request, the authorization response will become like below.</p>
 HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://client.com/callback?response={JWT} 

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 JARM example
<p>Because the JWT is signed by a key of the server, a client can confirm that the response has not been tampered by verifying the signature of the JWT.</p>
<p>Client Metadata for JARM</p>
<p>Before using JARM, client applications have to set a value to the&nbsp;<code>authorization_signed_response_alg</code>&nbsp;metadata in advance. The metadata represents an algorithm for signature of response JWTs. If the value of the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter is&nbsp;<code>*.jwt</code>&nbsp;although the metadata is not set, the authorization request fails because the specification requires response JWTs be always signed.</p>
<p>To encrypt response JWTs, algorithms have to be set in advance to the&nbsp;<code>authorization_encrypted_response_alg</code>&nbsp;metadata and the&nbsp;<code>authorization_encrypted_response_enc</code>&nbsp;metadata. To use an asymmetric algorithm, configuration about client’s public key is necessary, too.</p>
<p>The screenshot below is client-side settings for JARM in Authlete’s web console that is provided for client management.</p>

<p>Server Metadata for JARM</p>
<p>Discovery information of authorization servers that support JARM includes one or more of&nbsp;<code>query.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>fragment.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>form_post.jwt</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>&nbsp;in the list of supported response modes (<code>response_modes_supported</code>). Also, discovery information includes the following metadata related to algorithms used for response JWTs.</p>

 Part 1: Baseline 
<p>As introduction of prior knowledge was done, let’s start the main part of this article. To begin with, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html">Part 1</a>” which defines baseline security profile.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Authorization Server 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization server</a>” in “Part 1” lists requirements for authorization server. Let’s take a look one by one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 1.</p>
<p>shall support confidential clients;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 2.</p>
<p>should support public clients;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of “confidential clients” and “public clients” is described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">2.1. Client Types</a>” of RFC 6749. I don’t explain the difference between the client types here as it is prior knowledge for those who read the FAPI specification. However, the relationship between client types and OAuth 2.0 flows is often misunderstood even by those who are familiar with OAuth 2.0. It is only the combination of a “public client” and “client credentials flow” that RFC 6749 explicitly prohibits. Other combinations are allowed. Without this understanding, you would misread the FAPI specification.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Combinations of Flow and Client Type (RFC 6749)
<p>Just FYI. It is confidential clients only that are allowed to make backchannel authentication requests which are defined in CIBA.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Combinations of Flow and Client Type (CIBA)
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 3.</p>
<p>shall provide a client secret that adheres to the requirements in section 16.19 of OIDC if a symmetric key is used;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC Core states that a value calculated based on a client secret must be used as the shared key when a symmetric algorithm is used for signing and encryption. If the entropy of the client secret is lower than the one required by the algorithm, the strength of the algorithm is weakened. Therefore, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SymmetricKeyEntropy">16.19. Symmetric Key Entropy</a>” requires that client secrets have entropy strong enough for used algorithms. For example, when&nbsp;<code>HS256</code>&nbsp;(HMAC using SHA-256) is used for signing algorithm of ID tokens, client secrets must have 256-bit entropy at minimum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 4.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the confidential client using one of the following methods:</p>
<p>1. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication as specified in section 2 of MTLS;</p>
<p>2.<code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that&nbsp;<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code> defined in RFC 6749 are not allowed as client authentication methods at the token endpoint.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods allowed in FAPI Part 1
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 5.</p>
<p>shall require and use a key of size 2048 bits or larger for RSA algorithms;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 6.</p>
<p>shall require and use a key of size 160 bits or larger for elliptic curve algorithms;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, when&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;is used as client authentication method and RSA is used for signing the JWT, the key size must be 2048 or bigger. Likewise, when an elliptic curve algorithm is used, the key size must be 160 at minimum.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 7.</p>
<p>shall require RFC7636 with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is required to implement RFC 7636 (PKCE) which is a countermeasure for “authorization code interception attack”.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authorization Code Interception Attack
<p>RFC 7636 has added&nbsp;<code>code_challenge</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method</code>&nbsp;request parameters to the authorization request and&nbsp;<code>code_verifier</code>&nbsp;request parameter to the token request. Because the default value of&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>plain</code>, authorization requests that comply with FAPI must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>&nbsp;explicitly.</p>
<p>See “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/pkce/">Proof Key for Code Exchange (RFC 7636)</a>” for details about PKCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 8.</p>
<p>shall require redirect URIs to be pre-registered;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, registration of redirect URIs is not required under some conditions. For FAPI, registration of redirect URIs is always required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 9.</p>
<p>shall require the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter in the authorization request;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter of an authorization request can be omitted under some conditions. For FAPI, the request parameter must be always included. OIDC has the same requirement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 10.</p>
<p>shall require the value of&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;to exactly match one of the pre-registered redirect URIs;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an authorization server checks whether the value of the&nbsp;<code>redirect_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter matches a pre-registered one, the rule described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6">6. Normalization and Comparison</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>&nbsp;(Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax) is applied unless the pre-registered one is an absolute URI. On the other hand, FAPI (and OIDC also) requires that simple string comparison be always used to check whether the redirect URIs match.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 11.</p>
<p>shall require user authentication to an appropriate Level of Assurance for the operations the client will be authorized to perform on behalf of the user;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is required that user authentication performed during authorization process satisfy an appropriate level of assurance. ID1 and ID2 required LoA (Level of Assurance) 2, which is defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.1254">X.1254</a>&nbsp;(Entity authentication assurance framework. However, the Final version made the requirement more abstract (= changed the requirement from “LoA2” to “appropriate LoA”).</p>
<p>FYI: The following is the definition of LoA 2 described in “6.2 Level of assurance 2 (LoA2)” of X.1254.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At LoA2, there is some confidence in the claimed or asserted identity of the entity. This LoA is used when moderate risk is associated with erroneous authentication. Single-factor authentication is acceptable. Successful authentication shall be dependent upon the entity proving, through a secure authentication protocol, that the entity has control of the credential. Controls should be in place to reduce the effectiveness of eavesdroppers and online guessing attacks. Controls shall be in place to protect against attacks on stored credentials.</p>
<p>For example, a service provider might operate a website that enables its customers to change their address of record. The transaction in which a beneficiary changes an address of record may be considered an LoA2 authentication transaction, as the transaction may involve a moderate risk of inconvenience. Since official notices regarding payment amounts, account status, and records of changes are usually sent to the beneficiary’s address of record, the transaction additionally entails moderate risk of unauthorized release of PII. As a result, the service provider should obtain at least some authentication assurance before allowing this transaction to take place.</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 12.</p>
<p>shall require explicit approval by the user to authorize the requested scope if it has not been previously authorized;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 13.</p>
<p>shall reject an authorization code (Section 1.3.1 of RFC6749) if it has been previously used;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prohibiting reuse of authorization codes and ensuring that authorization codes have never been used previously are different things. If the current implementation of an authorization server uses randomly-generated strings as authorization codes and removes them from the database after they are used, the authorization codes have to be kept in the database even after they are used just only for the verification. If strings that represent authorization codes are generated randomly with high enough entropy, it is wasteful to keep authorization codes in the database even after their use. A certain famous engineer says&nbsp;“Most implementations prevent reuse of authorization codes by deleting corresponding database records and don’t check if they have been used previously, and such implementations are sufficient enough.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 14.</p>
<p>shall return token responses that conform to Section 4.1.4 of RFC6749;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a FAPI-specific requirement. Every authorization server implementation that claims it supports OAuth 2.0 must conform to&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.4">Section 4.1.4</a>&nbsp;of RFC 6749.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 15.</p>
<p>shall return the list of granted scopes with the issued access token if the request was passed in the front channel and was not integrity protected;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;response parameter can be omitted unless requested scopes and granted ones are different (RFC 6749,&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-5.1">5.1. Successful Response</a>). In FAPI, the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;response parameter is required (even if the requested scopes and granted ones are equal) if the authorization request is passed in the front channel and is not integrity protected.</p>
<p>“Integrity protected” here means that a Request Object (OIDC Core&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">Section 6</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq/">JAR</a>) is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 16.</p>
<p>shall provide non-guessable access tokens, authorization codes, and refresh token (where applicable), with sufficient entropy such that the probability of an attacker guessing the generated token is computationally infeasible as per RFC 6749 Section 10.10;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ID2 requires that access tokens have a minimum of 128 bits of entropy, but the Final version avoids mentioning the exact size of the minimum entropy and just says “sufficient entropy”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 17.</p>
<p>should clearly identify the details of the grant to the user during authorization as in 16.18 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose that a client application requests&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope. A typical authorization page will tell the user just that the client application is requesting the&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope. However, recent regulations in financial industries require that details be explained to the user. For example, information about the purpose of the&nbsp;<code>payment</code>&nbsp;scope, the amount of money transferred, and so on. Generally speaking, recent regulations require that grant be more specific.</p>
<p>UK Open Banking has invented “Lodging Intent” for the purpose. In the mechanism, (a) a client application registers details of grant it wants into an authorization server in advance, (b) the authorization server issues an intent ID that represents the registered details, and (c) the client makes an authorization request with the intent ID. As a result, the authorization server can generate an authorization page which includes the details of the authorization request.</p>
<p>To make the lodging intent pattern available as standards, OpenID Foundation has developed two separate specifications; “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” (PAR) and “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>” (RAR). These specifications will be mentioned again later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 18.</p>
<p>should provide a mechanism for the end-user to revoke access tokens and refresh tokens granted to a client as in 16.18 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that,&nbsp;if the format of access tokens is self-contained-type (e.g. JWT), the access tokens cannot be revoked&nbsp;unless the system implements and operates a mechanism like&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">CRL</a>&nbsp;(Certificate Revocation List) or&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP</a>&nbsp;(Online Certificate Status Protocol) of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI</a>&nbsp;(Public Key Infrastructure). If the system does not provide such mechanism, it means that the system has decided to give up revocation of access tokens. In this case, the duration of access tokens must be short enough to mitigate damage of access token leakage. See “<a href="https://medium.com/@darutk/oauth-access-token-implementation-30c2e8b90ff0">OAuth Access Token Implementation</a>” for further discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 19.</p>
<p>shall return an&nbsp;<code>invalid_client</code>&nbsp;error as defined in 5.2 of RFC6749 when mis-matched client identifiers were provided through the client authentication methods that permits sending the client identifier in more than one way;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FAPI Part 1 requires MTLS (<code>tls_client_auth</code>,&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>) or JWT (<code>client_secret_jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>) for client authentication.</p>
<p>MTLS uses a client certificate but a certificate does not include the client identifier of the client which tries to authenticate itself with the certificate. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter needs to be given explicitly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, JWT-based client authentication methods present a JWT as the value of the&nbsp;<code>client_assertion</code>&nbsp;request parameter and the JWT contains the client identifier as the value of the&nbsp;<code>iss</code>&nbsp;claim. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter is not necessary. In addition, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523">RFC 7523</a>, 3. and OIDC Core, 9., the&nbsp;<code>sub</code> claim also holds the client identifier when a JWT is used for client authentication.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWT-based Client Authentication and Client Identifiers
<p>In MTLS, it is only the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter that represents a client identifier. On the other hand, in JWT-based client authentication, both the&nbsp;<code>iss</code>&nbsp;claim and the&nbsp;<code>sub</code>&nbsp;claim hold a client identifier. The values of the claims must match. Also, if the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;request parameter is redundantly given although JWT-based client authentication is used, the value of the request parameter must match the client identifier, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 20.</p>
<p>shall require redirect URIs to use the&nbsp;<code>https</code>&nbsp;scheme;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence added by FAPI Implementer’s Draft 2 is short but has a big impact. Because of this sentence, developers&nbsp;cannot use custom schemes in FAPI&nbsp;any more. To process redirection on client side only without preparing an external Web server, developers have to use the method described in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.2">7.2. Claimed “https” Scheme URI Redirection</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212">BCP 212</a>&nbsp;(OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 21.</p>
<p>should issue access tokens with a lifetime of under 10 minutes unless the tokens are sender-constrained; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the FAPI Final version. “sender-constrained” here means that access tokens have to be bound to a client certificate (MTLS).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 22.</p>
<p>shall support OIDD, may support RFC8414 and shall not distribute discovery metadata (such as the authorization endpoint) by any other means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the FAPI Final version. OIDD here is short for “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</a>”. Therefore, authorization servers for FAPI must implement a “discovery endpoint” which is defined in OIDD&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig">Section 4</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier</p>
<p>Further, if it is desired to provide the authenticated user’s identifier to the client in the token response, the authorization server:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 5.2.2.1. lists requirements that an authorization server must follow when the authenticated user’s identifier is requested. In other words, when an ID token is requested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the authentication request as in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a>” of OIDC Core is the definition of a request to an authorization endpoint in the context of OpenID Connect. RFC 6749 calls a request to an authorization endpoint “authorization request”. OIDC Core calls it “authentication request”. Aside from the names, considering that the specification of an authorization endpoint is the main part of OIDC Core, the FAPI’s requirement is almost equal to stating&nbsp;“shall support OIDC Core”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 2.</p>
<p>shall perform the authentication request verification as in Section 3.1.2.2 of OIDC;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 3.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the user as in Section 3.1.2.2 and 3.1.2.3 of OIDC;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 4.</p>
<p>shall provide the authentication response as in Section 3.1.2.4 and 3.1.2.5 of OIDC depending on the outcome of the authentication;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 5.</p>
<p>shall perform the token request verification as in Section 3.1.3.2 of OIDC; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.1. Returning authenticated user’s identifier, 6.</p>
<p>shall issue an ID Token in the token response when&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;was included in the requested&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;as in Section 3.1.3.3 of OIDC with its&nbsp;<code>sub</code>&nbsp;value corresponding to the authenticated user and optional&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;value in ID Token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary of the requirements above is&nbsp;“shall follow OIDC Core specification.”&nbsp;Nothing special for FAPI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.2. Client requesting openid scope</p>
<p>If the client requests the&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;scope, the authorization server</p>
<p>1. shall require the&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC in the authentication request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">Section 3.1.2.1</a>&nbsp;(Authorization Code Flow) states that&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;is optional. On the other hand, OIDC&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitAuthRequest">Section 3.2.2.1</a>&nbsp;(Implicit Flow) states that&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;is mandatory.</p>
<p>The FAPI requirement above requires&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;even in the authorization code flow if&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is included in&nbsp;<code>scope</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.2.3. Clients not requesting openid scope</p>
<p>If the client does not requests the&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;scope, the authorization server</p>
<p>1. shall require the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 4 of RFC6749</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RFC 6749, the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter is optional. FAPI makes the parameter mandatory when&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is not included in&nbsp;<code>scope</code>.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Public Client 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#public-client">5.2.3. Public client</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for public clients. Let’s take a look one by one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support RFC7636;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>RFC 7636 is PKCE.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 2.</p>
<p>shall use&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method for the RFC7636;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means&nbsp;“an authorization request must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 3.</p>
<p>shall use separate and distinct redirect URI for each authorization server that it talks to;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 4.</p>
<p>shall store the redirect URI value in the resource owner’s user-agents (such as browser) session and compare it with the redirect URI that the authorization response was received at, where, if the URIs do not match, the client shall terminate the process with error;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements are so clear that further explanation is not needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 5.</p>
<p>(withdrawn); and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“(withdrawn)” here indicates that the requirement which existed in the previous FAPI versions has been withdrawn. You’ll see more “withdrawn”s in following sections, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 6.</p>
<p>shall implement an effective CSRF protection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In normal cases, CSRF protection is implemented on server side. What is CSRF protection as a requirement for public clients? This is CSRF protection for redirect URIs. The following is an excerpt from “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12">10.12. Cross-Site Request Forgery</a>” of RFC 6749.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client MUST implement CSRF protection for its redirection URI. This is typically accomplished by requiring any request sent to the redirection URI endpoint to include a value that binds the request to the user-agent’s authenticated state (e.g., a hash of the session cookie used to authenticate the user-agent). The client SHOULD utilize the “state” request parameter to deliver this value to the authorization server when making an authorization request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the requirements from “Public client, 1” to “Public client, 6”, “if it is desired to obtain a persistent identifier of the authenticated user”, that is, if an ID token is requested, an authorization request by a public client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 7.</p>
<p>shall include&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;value; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 8.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>nonce</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of OIDC in the authentication request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, “If&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;is not in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;value”, an authorization request by a public client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 9.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter defined in section 4.1.1 of RFC6749;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 10.</p>
<p>shall verify that the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;received in the token response is either an exact match, or contains a subset of the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;sent in the authorization request; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.3. Public client, 11.</p>
<p>shall only use Authorization Server metadata obtained from the metadata document published by the Authorization Server at its well known endpoint as defined in OIDD or RFC 8414.</p>
</blockquote>
 Part 1: Requirements for Confidential Client 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#confidential-client">5.2.4. Confidential client</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for confidential clients. The requirements are positioned as additions to the requirements for public clients. Therefore, confidential clients must follow not only the requirements in 5.2.4 but also the requirements in 5.2.3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the following methods to authenticate against the token endpoint:</p>
<p>1. Mutual TLS for OAuth Client Authentication as specified in Section 2 of MTLS, and</p>
<p>2.<code>client_secret_jwt</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in Section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that client authentication methods defined in RFC 6749 (<code>client_secret_basic</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>client_secret_post</code>) cannot be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 2.</p>
<p>shall use RSA keys with a minimum 2048 bits if using RSA cryptography;</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 3.</p>
<p>shall use elliptic curve keys with a minimum of 160 bits if using Elliptic Curve cryptography; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 5.2.4. Confidential client, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that its client secret has a minimum of 128 bits if using symmetric key cryptography.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements apply when encrypted JWTs are used.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Protected Resources 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#protected-resources-provisions">6.2.1. Protected resources provisions</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for protected resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 1.</p>
<p>shall support the use of the HTTP GET method as in Section 4.3.1 of RFC7231;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 2.</p>
<p>shall accept access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, protected resource endpoints must support HTTP&nbsp;<code>GET</code>&nbsp;method and be able to accept an access token in the format of&nbsp;<code>Authorization: Bearer&nbsp;{AccessToken}</code>.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Request to Protected Resource Endpoint
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 3.</p>
<p>shall not accept access tokens in the query parameters stated in Section 2.3 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, protected resource endpoints must not accept a query parameter in the format of&nbsp;<code>access_token={AccessToken}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that the access token is neither expired nor revoked;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 5.</p>
<p>shall verify that the scope associated with the access token authorizes access to the resource it is representing;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 6.</p>
<p>shall identify the associated entity to the access token;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 7.</p>
<p>shall only return the resource identified by the combination of the entity implicit in the access and the granted scope and otherwise return errors as in Section 3.1 of RFC6750;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are general steps of access token verification that protected resource endpoints are expected to take.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1">3.1. Error Codes</a>” of RFC 6750 defines three error codes. They are&nbsp;<code>invalid_request</code>,&nbsp;<code>invalid_token</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>insufficient_scope</code>. One point those who are not familiar with RFC 6750 may feel strange is that an error code is embedded not in the response body but in the&nbsp;<code>WWW-Authenticate</code> HTTP header.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 RFC 6750 Error Response
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 8.</p>
<p>shall encode the response in UTF-8 if applicable;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 9.</p>
<p>shall send the&nbsp;<code>Content-type</code>&nbsp;HTTP header&nbsp;<code>Content-Type: application/json;&nbsp;</code>if applicable;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Protected resource endpoints in FAPI are expected to return their responses in JSON format.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 10.</p>
<p>shall send the server date in HTTP&nbsp;<code>Date</code>&nbsp;header as in Section 7.1.1.2 of RFC7231;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The format of&nbsp;<code>Date</code>&nbsp;header is defined in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1">7.1.1.1. Date/Time Formats</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231">RFC 7231</a>. Below is an example.</p>
 Date: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT 
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 11.</p>
<p>shall set the response header&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;to the value received from the corresponding FAPI client request header or to a RFC4122 UUID value if the request header was not provided to track the interaction, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a</code>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a requirement specific to FAPI. Responses from FAPI protected resource endpoints must include an&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;header.</p>
<p>When an incoming request has&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>, the same value of the header must be included in the response. Otherwise, the protected resource endpoint must generate a new value for&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 12.</p>
<p>shall log the value of&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;in the log entry; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also specific to FAPI. This requirement doesn’t have any impact on request and response formats, but this can make it easy to correlate server-side logs and client-side logs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 13.</p>
<p>shall not reject requests with a&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address</code>&nbsp;header containing a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.1. Protected resource provisions, 14.</p>
<p>should support the use of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and or other methods as appropriate to enable JavaScript clients to access the endpoint if it decides to provide access to JavaScript clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if a protected resource endpoint wants to allow JavaScript clients to access it from anywhere, the endpoint should include an&nbsp;<code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>&nbsp;header in responses.</p>
 Part 1: Requirements for Clients to Protected Resources 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#client-provisions">6.2.2. Client provisions</a>” of “Part 1” lists requirements for clients to follow in accessing protected resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 1.</p>
<p>shall send access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage RFC6750; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, clients send an access token in the format of&nbsp;<code>Authorization: Bearer&nbsp;{AccessToken}</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 2.</p>
<p>(withdrawn);</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 3.</p>
<p>may send the last time the customer logged into the client in the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-auth-date</code>&nbsp;header where the value is supplied as a HTTP-date as in Section 7.1.1.1 of RFC7231, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-auth-date: Tue, 11 Sep 2012 19:43:31 GMT</code>;</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 4.</p>
<p>may send the customer’s IP address if this data is available in the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address</code>&nbsp;header, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address: 2001:DB8::1893:25c8:1946</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-customer-ip-address: 198.51.100.119</code>; and</p>
<p>Part 1: 6.2.2. Client provisions, 5.</p>
<p>may send the&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id</code>&nbsp;request header, in which case the value shall be a RFC4122 UUID to the server to help correlate log entries between client and server, e.g.,&nbsp;<code>x-fapi-interaction-id: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are FAPI-specific HTTP headers. It is up to clients whether to send the headers or not.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 FAPI-specific HTTP Headers
 Part 1: Security Considerations 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-1-1_0-final.html#security-considerations">7. Security considerations</a>” of “Part 1” lists security considerations. Summary is as follows.</p>
<p>7.1.&nbsp;— Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp195">BCP 195</a>. Use TLS 1.2 or newer. Follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125">RFC 6125</a>.</p>
<p>7.2.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t authenticate authorization request and response.</p>
<p>7.3.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t assure message integrity of authorization request.</p>
<p>7.4.1.&nbsp;— Part 1 doesn’t discuss encryption of authorization request.</p>
<p>7.4.2.&nbsp;— Be careful not to leak information through logs.</p>
<p>7.4.3.&nbsp;— Be careful not to leak information through referrer. Make duration of access tokens short.</p>
<p>7.5.&nbsp;— Native applications shall follow&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212">BCP 212</a>&nbsp;but must not support “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.1">Private-Use URI Scheme Redirection</a>” and “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.3">Loopback Interface Redirection</a>”. They must use&nbsp;<code>https</code>&nbsp;for the scheme of redirect URI as introduced in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp212#section-7.2">Claimed https Scheme URI Redirection</a>”.</p>
<p>7.6.&nbsp;— Both FAPI implementation and underlying OAuth/OIDC implementation must be complete and correct. See&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/certification/">OpenID Certification</a>.</p>
<p>7.7.&nbsp;— Use a separate&nbsp;<code>issuer</code>&nbsp;per brand if multiple brands need to be supported.</p>
<p>“Part 2” provides solutions for security considerations listed in “Part 1”, for example, by making “request object” mandatory. “Part 2” is recommended when higher security than “Part 1” is needed.</p>
 
 
 
 Part 2: Advanced 
 
 
 
<p>Next, let’s read “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html">Part 2</a>” which defines advanced security profile.</p>
 Detached Signature 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#id-token-as-detached-signature">5.1.1. ID Token as Detached Signature</a>” of “Part 2” states that it uses “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken">ID token</a>” as “detached signature”.</p>
<p>An ID token is signed by an authorization server, so even if an attacker tampered the content of the ID token, it could be detected. A client application that has received an ID token can confirm that the ID token has not been tampered by verifying the signature of the ID token.</p>
<p>If an authorization server embeds hash values of response parameters (such as&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>state</code>) into an ID token, a client application can confirm that the values of the response parameters have not been tampered by computing hash values of the response parameter values and comparing them to the hash values embedded in the ID token. In the context, the ID token is regarded as a detached signature.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 ID Token as Detached Signature
<p>For the&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;response parameter that represents an authorization code,&nbsp;<code>c_hash</code>&nbsp;has already been defined in OIDC Core as a claim that represents the hash value of&nbsp;<code>code</code>. Likewise,&nbsp;<code>at_hash</code>&nbsp;has been defined as a claim that represents the hash value of&nbsp;<code>access_token</code>.</p>
<p>What is missing is a claim that represents the hash value of the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;response parameter. So, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#id-token-as-detached-signature">5.1.1. ID Token as Detached Signature</a>” defines&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;for that purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>s_hash<br>
State hash value. Its value is the base64url encoding of the left-most half of the hash of the octets of the ASCII representation of the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value, where the hash algorithm used is the hash algorithm used in the&nbsp;<code>alg</code>&nbsp;header parameter of the ID Token’s JOSE header. For instance, if the&nbsp;<code>alg</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>HS512</code>, hash the state value with SHA-512, then take the left-most 256 bits and base64url encode them. The&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;value is a case sensitive string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because “Part 2” uses ID tokens as detached signatures, even if client applications don’t need ID tokens in their application layer, they have to send authorization requests that require an ID token. To be exact, they have to include&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter. This is the reason that the second requirement in “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization Server</a>” is saying&nbsp;“shall require the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;values&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>”.</p>
<p>However, since Implementer’s Draft 2,&nbsp;ID tokens don’t have to be used as detached signatures when JARM is used. It is because the entire set of response parameters is packed into a JWT.</p>
 Part 2: Requirements for Authorization Server 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#authorization-server">5.2.2. Authorization server</a>” of “Part 2” lists requirements for authorization server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 1.</p>
<p>shall require a JWS signed JWT request object passed by value with the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or by reference with the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameters are defined in “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests">6. Passing Request Parameters as JWTs</a>” of OIDC Core. To use these parameters, the first step is&nbsp;to pack request parameters into a JWT. This JWT is called “request object”. An authorization request (1) passes the request object as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter directly or (2) puts the request object somewhere accessible from the authorization server and passes the URI pointing to the location as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code> parameter.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Passing a Request Object by Value
<p>Signing a request object is not mandatory in OIDC Core, but signing is mandatory in FAPI Part 2. If request objects are signed, authorization servers can confirm that the request parameters have not been tampered by verifying signatures of the request objects.</p>
<p>To be honest, what surprised me most when I read the FAPI specification for the first time (many years ago) is this requirement. It’s because I knew from my experience it is hard to implement the request object feature on authorization server side. As the feature is hard to implement and optional in OIDC, there are many authorization server implementations that claim they support OIDC but don’t support request object.&nbsp;Be careful not to choose an authorization server implementation that doesn’t support request object if you want to build a system that supports FAPI Part 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 2.</p>
<p>shall require</p>
<p>1. the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;values&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>, or</p>
<p>2. the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;in conjunction with the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use ID token as detached signature, even if an ID token is not needed in the application layer,&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;must be included in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter.</p>
<p>But, as mentioned in the previous section,&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;doesn’t have to be included in the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter when JARM is used. “When JARM is used” is, to be concrete, “when the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;request parameter is included and its value is one of&nbsp;<code>query.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>fragment.jwt</code>,&nbsp;<code>form_post.jwt</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>”.</p>
<p>NOTE: ID2 requires that&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;be either&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>code id_token token</code>&nbsp;when JARM is not used, but the Final version has removed&nbsp;<code>code id_token token</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 3.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 4.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 5.</p>
<p>shall only issue sender-constrained access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this clause was&nbsp;“shall only issue authorization code, access token, and refresh token that are holder of key bound;”. However, because the requirement was impractical, it was changed to the current one. See&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/202">FAPI Issue 202</a>&nbsp;for details if you are interested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 6.</p>
<p>shall support MTLS as mechanism for constraining the legitimate senders of access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this clause was&nbsp;“shall support [OAUTB] or [MTLS] as a holder of key mechanisms;”. However, OAUTB (Token Binding) was removed from the Final version due to its unlikeliness of future availability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 7.</p>
<p>(withdrawn);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 8.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 9.</p>
<p>(moved to 5.2.2.1);</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 10.</p>
<p>shall only use the parameters included in the signed request object passed via the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
<p>shall require that all parameters are present inside the signed request object passed in the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In ID2, this requirement was&nbsp;“shall require that all parameters are present inside the signed request object passed in the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter;”. The expression was changed but the point remains the same. A request object must include all request parameters to conform to FAPI Part 2.</p>
<p>This is different from OIDC Core which allows request parameters to be put inside or outside a request object and merges them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 11.</p>
<p>may support the pushed authorization request endpoint as described in PAR;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “pushed authorization request endpoint” is a new endpoint defined in “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-par/">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” (PAR). A client application can register an authorization request at the endpoint and obtain a&nbsp;Request URI&nbsp;which represents the registered authorization request. The client specifies the issued Request URI as the value of the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;request parameter when sending an authorization request to the authorization endpoint.</p>
<p>The following diagram excerpted from “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/illustrated-par-oauth-2-0-pushed-authorization-requests-652d71ed5cfb">Illustrated PAR: OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a>” shows the authorization code flow which utilizes the pushed authorization request endpoint.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authorization Code Flow with Pushed Authorization Request Endpoint
<p>HISTORY:&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-ID2.html#request-object-endpoint">The 7th section of ID2</a>&nbsp;showed an idea about pre-registration of an authorization request. The section named the endpoint for the pre-registration “request object endpoint”. The specification of PAR was developed based on the idea. As a result, the FAPI Final version has withdrawn the 7th section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 12.</p>
<p>(withdrawn)</p>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 13.</p>
<p>shall require the request object to contain an&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;claim that has a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OIDC Core does not require that request objects include the&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;claim. In contrast, FAPI Part 2 requires&nbsp;<code>exp</code>&nbsp;as a mandatory claim.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Final version has added a requirement&nbsp;“a lifetime of no longer than 60 minutes after the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim”. Because of this requirement, the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim has become mandatory.</p>
<p>The new requirement is a breaking change from a viewpoint of client applications because authorization servers now reject authorization requests whose request object does not include the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim. As a matter of fact, some test cases in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite">conformance suite</a>&nbsp;had to be updated for the new requirement.</p>
<p>Authorization server implementations may provide a mechanism to mitigate the impact of the breaking change. For example, Authlete has defined&nbsp;<code><a href="https://authlete.github.io/authlete-java-common/com/authlete/common/dto/Service.html#isNbfOptional--">Service.nbfOptional</a></code>&nbsp;flag that indicates whether the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code> claim in the request object is optional even when the authorization request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request. The value of the flag can be changed by “nbf Claim” in the Service Owner Console.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Service Configuration: nbf Claim
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 14.</p>
<p>shall authenticate the confidential client using one of the following methods (this overrides FAPI Security Profile 1.0 – Part 1: clause 5.2.2-4):</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<code>tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>self_signed_tls_client_auth</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 2 of MTLS, or</p>
<p>2.<code>private_key_jwt</code>&nbsp;as specified in section 9 of OIDC;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that&nbsp;<code>client_secret_jwt</code> is not allowed in Part 2. This is different from Part 1.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Client Authentication Methods in FAPI
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 15.</p>
<p>shall return the&nbsp;<code>aud</code>&nbsp;claim in the request object to be, or to be an array containing, the OP’s Issuer Identifier URL;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement was added by the Final version. Client applications have to put the&nbsp;<code>aud</code>&nbsp;claim in request objects. The value of&nbsp;“OP’s Issuer Identifier URL”&nbsp;can be found in the discovery document as the value of the&nbsp;<code>issuer</code>&nbsp;metadata (cf. OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0,&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata">3. OpenID Provider Metadata</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 16.</p>
<p>shall not support public clients;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement is a new one added by the Final version, but it is said that it has been logically impossible to support public clients in the context of FAPI Part 2 since older FAPI versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 17.</p>
<p>shall require the request object to contain an&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim that is no longer than 60 minutes in the past; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 13th requirement implies that the&nbsp;<code>nbf</code>&nbsp;claim is mandatory. This 17th requirement states it explicitly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2. Authorization server, 18.</p>
<p>shall require PAR requests, if supported, to use PKCE (RFC7636) with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“PAR” here is “OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature</p>
<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>value&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;is used, the authorization server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 5.2.2.1. lists requirements for authorization servers which are applied when an ID token is used as a detached signature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 1.</p>
<p>shall support OIDC;</p>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 2.</p>
<p>shall support signed ID Tokens;</p>
<p>5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 3.</p>
<p>should support signed and encrypted ID Tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a viewpoint of OIDC, these requirements are not new. By definition, ID tokens are always signed. Encryption of ID tokens is optional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 4.</p>
<p>shall return ID Token as a detached signature to the authorization response;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires that an authorization server issue an ID token, but because the condition written at the top of Section 5.2.2.1 requires that&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>&nbsp;be included in&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;and so an ID token is issued as a general consequence, this requirement doesn’t have to exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 5.</p>
<p>shall include state hash,&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>, in the ID Token to protect the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value if the client supplied a value for&nbsp;<code>state</code>.&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;may be omitted from the ID Token returned from the Token Endpoint when&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;is present in the ID Token returned from the Authorization Endpoint; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When JARM is used, this requirement doesn’t have to be followed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.2.1. ID Token as detached signature, 6.</p>
<p>should not return sensitive PII in the ID Token in the authorization response, but if it needs to, then it should encrypt the ID Token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PII is short for “Personally Identifiable Information”.</p>
<p>The feature of ID token encryption has existed since OIDC Core. When the encryption algorithm for ID tokens is an asymmetric one, the authorization server must either (1) manage public keys of client applications directly in its database or (2) fetch JWK Set documents from the locations pointed to by clients’&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;metadata and extract public keys from the documents.</p>
<p>For signing ID tokens, it is server-side keys only that an authorization server has to handle.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 ID Token Signing
<p>In contrast, if an authorization server wants to support encryption of ID tokens, the authorization server has to handle client-side keys, too.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 ID Token Encryption
<p>This is the reason that not a small number of authorization server implementations don’t support ID token encryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5.2.2.2. JARM</p>
<p>In addition, if the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>code</code>&nbsp;is used in conjunction with the&nbsp;<code>response_mode</code>&nbsp;value&nbsp;<code>jwt</code>, the authorization server</p>
<p>5.2.2.2. JARM, 1.</p>
<p>shall create JWT-secured authorization responses as specified in JARM, Section 4.3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clause does not include any FAPI-specific requirements. It just says that JARM implementations should function as the JARM specification requires.</p>
<p>When&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;does not contain&nbsp;<code>id_token</code>, no ID token is issued. Therefore, an ID token cannot be used as a detached signature. In this case, JARM has to be used to assure that the authorization response has not been tampered.</p>
 Part 2: Requirements for Confidential Client 
<p>The FAPI Final version has renamed Part 2: Section 5.2.3 from “Public client” to “Confidential client”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 1.</p>
<p>shall support MTLS as mechanism for sender-constrained access tokens;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, the authorization server must issue certificated-bound access tokens as defined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html#name-mutual-tls-client-certifica">Section 3</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 2.</p>
<p>shall include the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter as defined in Section 6 of OIDC in the authentication request;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As listed in the list of requirements for authorization servers, either the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter must be included. Note that OIDC Core says&nbsp;“If one of these parameters is used, the other MUST NOT be used in the same request.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 3.</p>
<p>shall ensure the Authorization Server has authenticated the user to an appropriate Level of Assurance for the client’s intended purpose;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement states just that the user shall be authenticated appropriately. The FAPI Final version removed the requirement&nbsp;“by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”&nbsp;which once existed in the clause.</p>
<p>HISTORY:</p>
<p>In ID2, this requirement was&nbsp;“shall request user authentication at LoA 3 or greater by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim as defined in section 5.5.1.1 of [OIDC];”.</p>
<p>When a client wants to require claims as essential ones, the&nbsp;<code>acr_values</code>&nbsp;request parameter cannot be used. Instead, a client must use the&nbsp;<code>claims</code>&nbsp;request parameter, pass JSON as its value, and include&nbsp;<code>{“essential":true}</code>&nbsp;inside the JSON. The following is an example of JSON that needs to be given as the value of the&nbsp;<code>claims</code>&nbsp;request parameter in order to mark&nbsp;<code>urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver</code> as an essential ACR.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 Claims for Essential ACR
<p>BTW, this requirement is loosened in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">UK Open Banking</a>&nbsp;which is based on FAPI Part 2. That is, clients don’t have to require ACRs as essential. Probably, it is not intentional. I guess that the snapshot of FAPI specification which was referred to when&nbsp;Open Banking Profile&nbsp;(OBP) was developed didn’t contain the sentence, “by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”.</p>
<p>The official Financial-grade API conformance test suite (<a href="https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite">conformance-suite</a>) developed and maintained by&nbsp;<a href="https://fintechlabs.io/">FinTechLabs.io</a>&nbsp;contains test cases for OBP. When FinTechLabs ran the OBP test cases using Authlete to test the test suite itself, they encountered an error. Because Authlete strictly follows FAPI specification, Authlete reported&nbsp;“<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim is not required as essential.”&nbsp;However, the expected behavior in the context of OBP is to ignore the FAPI requirement.</p>
<p>The right approach for the error was to amend OBP (to make OBP compliant with the latest FAPI specification). However, I was given explanation like&nbsp;“if the official conformance test suite did it, all the existing OBP implementations wouldn’t be able to pass the official tests. Changing the tests at this timing might cause delay in the officially-announced schedule of Open Banking.”</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to tweak Authlete and added OPEN_BANKING option in addition to FAPI option.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Supported Service Profiles (in Service Owner Console provided by Authlete)
<p>If OPEN_BANKING is enabled, Authlete dare not to check if the&nbsp;<code>acr</code> claim is required as essential even in the context of FAPI Part 2. The code snippet below is the actual implementation excerpted from Authlete’s source code.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Code to judge whether acr should be required as an essential claim
<p>As a result of this, Authlete is listed as a platform vendor that has passed “<a href="https://openbanking.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DZ/pages/126321042/Open+Banking+Security+Profile+Conformance">Open Banking Security Profile Conformance</a>”.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Authlete listed in Open Banking Security Profile Conformance
<p>~HISTORY END</p>
<p>However, again, the FAPI Final has removed the requirement&nbsp;“by requesting the&nbsp;<code>acr</code>&nbsp;claim as an essential claim”, so Authlete no longer checks whether ACRs are requested as essential ones. Therefore, the flag OPEN_BANKING is not meaningful any more.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If request parameters are all put into a request object, either the&nbsp;<code>request</code>&nbsp;parameter or the&nbsp;<code>request_uri</code>&nbsp;parameter is sufficient. However, if parameters that are mandatory in OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core (e.g.&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>) are omitted, the request is no longer compliant with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core. Therefore, parameters that are mandatory in OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Core must be put outside the request object duplicately even if they exist inside the request object.</p>
<p>The FAPI Final version has added a condition&nbsp;“if not using PAR”. This implies that the set of request parameters don’t have to be compliant with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC when PAR is used. This incompatibility comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq/">JWT Secured Authorization Request</a>&nbsp;(JAR). See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/implementers-note-about-jar-fff4cbd158fe">Implementer’s note about JAR (JWT Secured Authorization Request)</a>” for details.</p>

<p>The same requirement can be found in Section 5.2.2. Authorization server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 15.</p>
<p>shall use RFC7636 with&nbsp;<code>S256</code>&nbsp;as the code challenge method if using PAR; and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, an authorization request must include&nbsp;<code>code_challenge_method=S256</code>&nbsp;request parameter when PAR is used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3. Confidential client, 16.</p>
<p>shall additionally send a duplicate of the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;parameter/value using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax to the authorization endpoint, as required by Section 5 of JAR, if using PAR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PAR specification requires that authorization servers handle request objects based on the rules defined in JAR. The JAR specification has made the&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;request parameter optional, but the&nbsp;<code>client_id</code>&nbsp;remains mandatory. See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/implementers-note-about-jar-fff4cbd158fe">Implementer’s note about JAR (JWT Secured Authorization Request)</a>” for details.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Section 5.2.3.1. lists requirements for client applications which are applied when an ID token is used as a detached signature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 1.</p>
<p>shall include the value&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;into the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter in order to activate OIDC support;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a FAPI-specific requirement. OIDC Core requires that an OIDC request include&nbsp;<code>openid</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter. See the explanation about the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;parameter written in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest">Section 3.1.2.1. Authentication Request</a>&nbsp;in OIDC Core for details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 2.</p>
<p>shall require JWS signed ID Token be returned from endpoints;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing new from OIDC’s viewpoint. By definition, ID tokens are always signed. And when&nbsp;<code>response_type</code>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<code>code id_token</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;contains&nbsp;<code>openid</code>, both the authorization endpoint and the token endpoint return an ID token. See “<a href="https://darutk.medium.com/diagrams-of-all-the-openid-connect-flows-6968e3990660">Diagrams of All The OpenID Connect Flows</a>” for details about what the endpoints return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 3.</p>
<p>shall verify that the authorization response was not tampered using ID Token as the detached signature;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, client applications have to compute hash values of response parameters outside the issued ID token and compare the values to the hash values in the ID token.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 4.</p>
<p>shall verify that&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;value is equal to the value calculated from the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;value in the authorization response in addition to all the requirements in 3.3.2.12 of OIDC; and</p>
<p>NOTE: This enables the client to verify that the authorization response was not tampered with, using the ID Token as a detached signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requirement particularly mentions the&nbsp;<code>state</code>&nbsp;parameter and the&nbsp;<code>s_hash</code>&nbsp;claim in the ID token although they are just one of parameter/hash pairs that have to be considered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part 2: 5.2.3.1. ID Token as detached signature, 5.</p>
<p>shall support both signed and signed &amp; encrypted ID Tokens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By definition, ID tokens are always signed. When ID tokens are encrypted, the order of signing and encrypting is “sign then encrypt”. As a result, an encrypted ID token takes the form of “Nested JWT” as illustrated below.</p>

 Part 2: Security Considerations 
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#security-considerations">8. Security considerations</a>” of “Part 2” lists security considerations. Summary is as follows.</p>
<p>8.1&nbsp;— This specification references security considerations in&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10">Section 10</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819">RFC 6819</a>.</p>
<p>8.2&nbsp;— Protected resource endpoints shall accept only certificate-bound access tokens.</p>
<p>8.3.1&nbsp;— Clients should use a different redirect URI per authorization server.</p>
<p>8.3.2&nbsp;— Authorization codes and client secrets are passed to attackers if developers are deceived into using a fake token endpoint.</p>
<p>8.3.3&nbsp;— Hybrid flow or JARM can be used as a countermeasure for IdP mix-up attack.</p>
<p>8.3.4&nbsp;— (removed)</p>
<p>8.3.5&nbsp;— Because an access token is bound to an X.509 certificate, stolen access tokens cannot be used without corresponding certificates.</p>
<p>8.4.1&nbsp;— RFC 6749 doesn’t assure message integrity of authorization request and response.</p>
<p>8.4.2&nbsp;— Using request objects prevents authorization request parameter injection attack.</p>
<p>8.4.3&nbsp;— Using hybrid flow or JARM prevents authorization response parameter injection attack.</p>
<p>8.5&nbsp;— Cipher suites for TLS 1.2 are restricted.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#tls-considerations">8.5. TLS considerations</a>” of “Part 2” permits only the following cipher suites for TLS communication when the TLS version in use is below 1.3.</p>
<p><code>1. TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code></p>
<p><code>2. TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code></p>
<p><code>3. TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code></p>
<p><code>4. TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code></p>
<p>But, from a viewpoint of interoperability of web browsers, additional cipher suites allowed in the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp195">BCP 195</a>&nbsp;are permitted for authorization endpoints.</p>
<p>Because I couldn’t find any good reasons to exclude the following cipher suites,</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</code></p>
<p>6.<code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</code></p>
<p>I created&nbsp;<a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/216">Issue 216</a>&nbsp;(TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suites) to suggest adding them to the list of permitted cipher suites. 1 year and 4 months later, the issue was closed with the reason that FAPI now allows TLS 1.3.</p>
<p>8.6&nbsp;—&nbsp;<code>PS256</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ES256</code>&nbsp;only are allowed for JWS signature algorithm.</p>
<p>Signing algorithms of JWS are listed in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-3.1">3.1. “alg” (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for JWS</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">RFC 7518</a>&nbsp;(JSON Web Algorithms). Among the 13 algorithms, “<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0-final.html#algorithm-considerations">8.6. Algorithm considerations</a>” of “Part 2” permits&nbsp;<code>PS256</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ES256</code>&nbsp;only. The section explicitly states that RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (e.g.&nbsp;<code>RS256</code>) should not be used and&nbsp;<code>none</code> must not be used.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 JWS algorithms permitted by Financial-grade API, Part 2
<p>FYI: JWT is used at the following places in an authorization server implementation.</p>

 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 JWT Usage in Authorization Server Implementation
<p>8.6.1&nbsp;—&nbsp;<code>RSA1_5</code>&nbsp;encryption algorithm must not be used.</p>
<p>This requirement about encryption algorithms was added by the FAPI Final version. FAPI prohibits&nbsp;<code>RSA1_5</code>. The algorighm identifier is defined in “<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518#section-4.1">4.1. “alg” (Algorithm) Header Parameter Values for JWE</a>” of&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518">RFC 7518</a>&nbsp;(JSON Web Algorithms). The identifier represents RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5.</p>
<p>8.7&nbsp;— Use certified FAPI implementations.</p>
<p>8.8&nbsp;—Don’t allow privileged actions without an access token.</p>
<p>8.9&nbsp;— Keys for signature verification should be accessible via the&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>jwks</code>&nbsp;client metadata (cf.&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>) and the&nbsp;<code>jwks_uri</code>&nbsp;server metadata (cf.&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414">RFC 8414</a>).</p>
<p>8.10&nbsp;— A compromise of any client that shares the same key with other clients would result in a compromise of all the clients.</p>
<p>8.11&nbsp;— JWK sets should not contain multiple keys with the same&nbsp;<code>kid</code>, but other key attributes may be used to select one among multiple key candidates.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 FAPI implementation 
<p>This chapter picks up some topics related to FAPI implementation.</p>
 Baseline or Advanced? 
<p>When a client application requests an access token and accesses APIs with the access token, which security profile should apply, FAPI Part 1 or FAPI Part 2, or neither of them?</p>
<p>Some implementations may configure themselves statically and others may make the decision dynamically at runtime.&nbsp;The FAPI specification mentions nothing about how to determine which security profile should apply.</p>
<p>A simple approach would be&nbsp;“Regard all authorization requests as FAPI Part 2 requests.”&nbsp;Actually, UK Open Banking has adopted this approach. A hard-coded implementation like this may be acceptable if the system development is a one-time work.</p>
<p>However, this approach is not appropriate for a generic authorization server implementation. It’s because a hard-coded implementation hinders flexibility of system design too much. Therefore, in a generic implementation, it is better to judge dynamically at runtime whether an authorization request is for FAPI Part 1 or for FAPI Part 2 (or for normal OAuth 2.0 / OIDC).</p>
<p>If so, how to judge dynamically? The conclusion everyone will eventually reach after thinking will be just one. It is&nbsp;judged by checking the requested scopes.</p>
<p>(Note: Another possible way would be to utilize the&nbsp;<code>resource</code>&nbsp;request parameter defined in “<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html">RFC 8707 Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0</a>”.)</p>
<p>For example, (1) prepare scopes named&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>write</code>, (2) adopt a rule where the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope requires FAPI Part 1 requirements be satisfied and the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope requires FAPI Part 2 requirements be satisfied, and (3) implement APIs so that they interpret the scopes accordingly. If APIs are implemented in this way, the implementation of an authorization endpoint can change its behavior dynamically by (a) applying FAPI Part 2 requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter includes the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope, (b) applying FAPI Part 1 requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter does not include the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope but includes the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope, and (c) applying normal OAuth 2.0 and OIDC requirements when the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter includes neither the&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;scope nor the&nbsp;<code>write</code>&nbsp;scope.</p>
<p>How to implement the scope-based switch? For instance, one approach might be to regard scopes whose name starts with&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;as scopes for FAPI Part 1. However, this approach imposes heavy restrictions on scope names. If that is the case, what approach has Authlete adopted?</p>
<p>As the first step, Authlete implemented a generic mechanism to set arbitrary attributes to each scope. On the mechanism, Authlete treats the attribute name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;in a special way. An attribute having name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;and value&nbsp;<code>r</code>&nbsp;represents Read-Only (= Baseline). Likewise, an attribute having name&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;and value&nbsp;<code>rw</code>&nbsp;represents Read-and-Write (Advanced).</p>
<p>The web console for FAPI-aware Authlete (version 2.0+) provides UI for scope attributes. The screenshot below defines a scope named&nbsp;<code>read</code>&nbsp;with an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=r</code>.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Scope Settings for FAPI Read-Only
<p>Authlete’s&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.authlete.com/#auth-authorization-api">/auth/authorization API</a>&nbsp;that parses an authorization request checks scopes listed in the&nbsp;<code>scope</code>&nbsp;request parameter in the authorization request and regards the request as a request for FAPI Part 2 if the scope list includes a scope that has an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=rw</code>. If the scope list does not include any scope having an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=rw</code>&nbsp;but includes a scope having an attribute of&nbsp;<code>fapi=r</code>, the authorization request is regarded as a request for FAPI Part 1. In other cases, the authorization request is treated as a normal OAuth 2.0 / OIDC request.</p>
<p>NOTE: In ID2, the names of FAPI Part 1 and Part 2 were “Read-Only Security Profile” and “Read and Write Security Profile”. The FAPI Final verison renamed them to “Baseline Security Profile” and “Advanced Security Profile”. The values of&nbsp;<code>r</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>rw</code>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<code>fapi</code>&nbsp;attribute were determined based on the old names.</p>
 Mutual TLS 
<p>“Mutual TLS” has three meanings as listed below (as already explained previously).</p>
 
 TLS communication using a client certificate 
 Client authentication using a client certificate 
 Certificate binding 
 
<p>The first part is handled by API management solutions. On the other hand, the second and the third parts don’t necessarily have to be handled by the API management layer. Rather, a better system architecture would handle them in a different layer that is independent of the API management layer.</p>
<p>Because of its unique architecture, Authlete doesn’t take on any task in the API management layer. That is, Authlete does nothing for the first part. On the other hand, Authlete supports the second and the third parts. Thanks to this, with Authlete, systems can support MTLS (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8705.html">RFC 8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens</a>) required by FAPI on any API management solution that developers want to use. I actually tried MTLS on Amazon API Gateway and wrote an article titled “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/tutorial/financial_grade_apigateway/">Financial-grade Amazon API Gateway</a>” to explains how to achieve it.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Example of Component Deployment for MTLS on Amazon API Gateway
<p>Any API management solution can support MTLS by using Authlete as long as the solution provides a mechanism which enables developers to access the client certificate used in TLS communication.</p>
<p>Existing API management solutions may try to implement MTLS directly. However, it would take time, and above all, it is not a good system design to support the functionality directly in the API management layer. At the time of this writing, if you use an API management solution provided by one of giant cloud vendors, Authlete is the best answer for MTLS.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/hYhHan5FzlA">video</a>&nbsp;below is a session in “<a href="https://financial-api.net/en/">Financial APIs Workshop</a>” that took place in Tokyo on July 24, 2018. In the video,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinricher/">Justin Richer</a>, one of the most famous software engineers in the community and the author of “<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/oauth-2-in-action">OAuth 2 in Action</a>”, is explaining Authlete’s MTLS implementation.</p>
<p>The material and transcript of the presentation are available at “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/resources/videos/20180724/authlete-fapi-enhancements/">Authlete FAPI Enhancements</a>”.</p>
 Access Token Duration 
<p>This is not related to FAPI, but I explain this feature here because I’m often consulted about the feature in the context of Bank API by customers who want to make duration of access tokens for remittance shorter than that of access tokens for other purposes.</p>
<p>The functionality can be achieved by making access token duration shorter when an authorization request contains a scope for remittance. For example, if an API for remittance requires a scope named&nbsp;<code>remit</code>, the authorization server would shorten access token duration when an authorization request contains the scope.</p>
<p>Authlete supports the functionality by treating a scope attribute named&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;in a special way.</p>
<p>Authlete checks all scope attributes of requested scopes, picks up the smallest value among values of&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes, and uses it as the duration of an access token being issued. If none of the requested scopes has an&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attribute, Authlete uses the default value of access token duration set per authorization server instance. If the default value is smaller than the smallest value of&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes, the default value is used.</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows how to set&nbsp;<code>access_token.duration=300</code>as a scope attribute.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 Scope Settings for Access Token Duration
<p>Likewise, duration of refresh tokens can be set by utilizing&nbsp;<code>refresh_token.duration</code>&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>NOTE: Authlete 2.1 and newer versions support “access token duration per client”. See “<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/how-to-calculate-token-duration">How Authlete determines token duration</a>” on&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/">Authlete Knowledge Base</a>&nbsp;for details.</p>
 Access Token with Transaction Information 
<p>This feature is not related to FAPI, either, but I explain it here as I’m often consulted about it in the context of Bank API by customers who want to associate detailed transaction information with an access token. I hear that some regulations in Europe require an access token be issued per transaction under some conditions.</p>
<p>This functionality cannot be achieved by “scope attribute” which was explained in “Access Token Duration” because the functionality requires data be handled per access token, not per scope.</p>
<p>Since old days, Authlete has provided a mechanism to set arbitrary key-value pairs to an access token. This feature can be utilized to associate transaction information with an access token. Technical details about this feature are explained in “<a href="https://www.authlete.com/documents/definitive_guide/extra_properties">Extra Properties</a>”. See also “<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/en/s/oauth-and-openid-connect/a/extra-properties">How to add extra properties to an access token</a>” in&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.authlete.com/">Authlete Knowledge Base</a>.</p>
<p>However, note that it is not a smart way to associate detailed information such as amount of money with an access token directly. Instead, a recommended way is to (1) store detailed transaction information into another database and (2) associate the unique identifier of the database record with an access token.</p>
 Authorization Details 
<p>Since the version 2.2, Authlete supports “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-rar/">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>” (RAR). The standard specification adds a request/response parameter,&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>&nbsp;parameter is used to enable an access token to hold detailed information about authorization.&nbsp;For example, detailed information about payment such as “How much?”, “To whom?”, etc.</p>
<p>According to the specification, the&nbsp;<code>authorization_details</code>&nbsp;parameter can be used anywhere the&nbsp;<code>scope</code> parameter is used. For instance, (a) in the authorization request, (b) in the token response, (c) in the introspection response, and so on.</p>

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (a) authorization_details in Authorization Request (RAR Section 3)

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (b) authorization_details in Token Response (RAR Section 7)

 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 
 
 (c) authorization_details in Introspection Response (RAR Section 8.2)
<p>RAR is an open standard to describe details about authorization and tie the information to an access token. RAR is to be adopted as a component of FAPI 2.0 (cf. “Are there FAPI 2.0 implementations?” in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>).</p>
<p>Authlete’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authlete.com/developers/definitive_guide/extra_properties/">Extra Properties</a>&nbsp;can be used for the same purpose. One functional difference is that Extra Properties can choose to expose or hide extra properties. Hidden extra properties never appear in any OAuth/OIDC responses but can be retrieved by Authlete’s introspection API (<a href="http://docs.authlete.com/#auth-introspection-api">/auth/introspection API</a>). There are some use cases where you want to tie information to an access token but hide the information from the client application and the user. In such cases, Extra Properties is useful.</p>
 Finally 
<p>Thank you for reading this long post till the end.</p>
<p>Authlete has already supports the FAPI 1.0 Final version and known technical specifications of FAPI 2.0&nbsp;as mentioned in&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/faq/">FAPI FAQ</a>.

 Gordian Work 

<p>Our advances on Gordian were linked to a large-scale transition in the meaning of the Gordian system. Prior to 2021, we were offering a variety of applications, but we were simultaneously working with companies to create specifications. This created a real tension. Now that we’ve seen the beginnings of adoption of our best practices, we’ve been able to change the focus of our applications from being consumer-focused to being exemplars for other companies to study. In Q2, we expect this to mature into a Gordian Seal™ program that denotes companies who are producing products that follow the Gordian principles and our best practices. Like similar projects such as the FIDO Alliance, we expect the Gordian Seal to make it easier for everyone in the blockchain ecosystem to work together, creating  bizdev and interoperability opportunities.</p>

<p>Gordian Testing. Blockchain Commons now has three iOS reference apps available for public beta testing via Apple’s Testflight: <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/sJTaoUsM">Gordian Cosigner</a>, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/0LIl6H1h">Gordian Guardian</a>, and <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8">Guardian Wallet</a>. Wallet was our original app, recently updated to support the newest Lifehash and <code>crypto-request</code> features; Cosigner is the companion signing app that we introduced last quarter; and Guardian is our newest release, a key-storage tool for iOS. As reference apps, these projects are mainly meant as exemplars, demonstrating the best practices and principles suggested by the Gordian architecture as well as exemplifying how multiple apps can interact through Airgaps and Universal Resources (URs). See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TosqR8a2OXg">our video</a> for a real-life example of Gordian Cosigner, Guardian, and Wallet working together to securely create a multisig account and sign a PSBT, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> that demonstrates AirGap signing between LetheKit and Gordian Cosigner.</p>

<p>Independent Recovery. We are already working to split a new app, “Gordian Recovery”, off of Gordian Guardian. One of our best practices for the Gordian system demands that a user can recover funds from a Gordian-approved wallet even if the company producing it disappears. Gordian Recovery will provide one way to do so, allowing a user to independently use the app to recover and sweep funds held in a multisig wallet, no matter the status of the wallet manufacturer. At its debut, we expect Gordian Recovery to support at least three different companies with their own multisig hardware or software wallet systems. Generally, Guardian Recovery, like Gordian Cosigner, demonstrates how Blockchain Commons will interact with the wallet ecosystem by providing not just specifications, best practices, and references, but also complementary apps that can support third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Keytool Updates. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/keytool-cli">keytool CLI (command-line interface) app</a> also received major upgrades in Q1. We expanded it to support the new UR (Universal Resource) <code>crypto-request</code> and <code>crypto-response</code> features that add support for arbitrary requests. This is a first step in moving away from the <code>m/48'</code> derivation used by current hardware wallets for multisig, which often results in master or cosigner xpub reuse and thus a risk to privacy. This means that we now have the infrastructure to demonstrate different solutions to the problems of <code>m/48'</code>xpub reuse, but there’s still a lot of legacy use cases that need to be resolved. (We also reviewed one solution for the <code>m/48'</code> derivation problem and found it unnecessarily complex, so: onward.)</p>

<p>Lifehash Improvements. Most of the Gordian specifications that we’ve created while working with our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> focus on interoperability, particularly moving data across airgaps. Lifehash is something else: it’s a user-interface specification meant to give users trust in the continuity of cryptocurrency accounts without having to depend on reading text addresses, which aren’t user-intuitive. Instead, Lifehash creates unique, colored icons for each account that remain consistent over time. This quarter, we adjusted the colors used by Lifehash so that they look better in black &amp; white printing, and simultaneously experimented with dithering on the 200x200 LetheKit display, to ensure that we could display meaningful information on a worst-case small black &amp; white display.</p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p></p>

 

<p>Lethekit Updates. The DIY <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lethekit/">LetheKit</a> has been our prime reference for testing hardware implementations of our Gordian best practices. Not only did we test it out with dithered Lifehashes last quarter, but we also were able to use its display to test out animated QRs for transferring PSBTs. It worked! (Albeit, slowly.) See also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19GVOIZNedU">this video</a> of LetheKit exporting derived keys to Gordian Signer.</p>

<p>Gordian Adoption. Finally, as noted, we’re very happy to see continued adoption of Gordian. Last quarter, we talked about all of the software and library development being done by wallet companies. This quarter, we’re seeing more companies committing to including SSKRs (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction), URs (Universal Resources), and other Gordian features in their wallets. <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a> has been expanding its capabilities, while <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a> was the newest to announce their integration of some UR features, including animated PSBTs. Foundation and Sparrow have both been working with us for a while: we’re thrilled to see both hardware and software wallet companies incorporating Blockchain Commons specifications! We’re also aware of two more software-wallet companies who haven’t made announcements yet, and we’ve been extensively working with a third company to produce a Gordian-approved wallet that entirely matches our principles and best practices and adds on some great UI besides. We can now announce that third company is Bitmark …</p>

<p>Autonomy Architecting. Blockchain Commons has been working with Bitmark to design Autonomy, a bitcoin wallet and digital assets manager. Their goal is to make it easy for families to gain independence and preserve generational wealth. Autonomy combines a mobile app with your own dedicated full node running privately in the cloud. We used a partitioned architecture (keys across app+node) and a personal recovery network (using SSKR) to remove all single points of failure. When you transact, everything is multisig between your app and full node. Any single key can fail and you won’t lose your funds. Nothing else like this currently exists in the market.</p>

 Other Advances 

<p>Here’s some details on our other major projects:</p>

<p>Multisig Documents. This quarter, we released our first major expansion to our #SmartCustody tutorials since 2019: a 10,000-word document on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">Designing Multisig for Independence &amp; Resilience</a>. The state of multisig wasn’t sufficiently advanced to provide specific advice when we originally wrote #SmartCustody, so we’re now happy to include it by breaking down the design of multisig addresses into theoretical, transactional, operational, and functional elements and providing design patterns and examples to help you put those elements together. Want to know why Blockchain Commons is today focused on multisig technology and how to create them to meet your own needs? It’s all here.</p>

<p>DID Recommendation. We’ve been working with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a> since it was incubated at early <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting-the-Web-of-Trust workshops</a>, and co-authored by Blockchain Commons founder Christopher Allen. We’re thrilled that it’s now a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Candidate Recommendation</a>. There might still be revisions and new candidates, but this is the beginning of the last stage in creating an official internet standard for decentralized identity on the internet.</p>

<p>DID Method Expansion. Meanwhile, Blockchain Commons is doing its own work on DIDs, with a new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/did-method-onion">did:onion method implementation</a>. We’re happy to say that <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce Systems</a> is already considering it for their DID resolver. We’re also considering returning to work on our own <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">BTCR DID method</a>, which was one of the first DID methods, but has gotten somewhat out of date with recent updates to Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Apt Packages. We have produced apt packages for installing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli">seedtool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/keytool-cli">keytool</a> for use with Debian and Tails OSes. This is a first step in providing support tools for human-rights activists, which we expect to get more emphasis in our work in Q3.</p>

<p>Legislative Work. Finally, Christopher Allen’s work with legislatures multiplied last quarter. In Wyoming, he led efforts that resulted in the <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">Wyoming Digital Identity Act</a>, which includes a specific definition of digital identity that works toward the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">principles of self-sovereign identity</a>. Work on a private-key-protection bill was less successful, as it had to be withdrawn after being spoiled by an amendment. Christopher has also recently testified before legislatures in <a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/testimony/HIBL-3024-20210208-5787-F-ALLEN_CHRISTOPHER.pdf">North Dakota</a> and Nevada. This is all crucial work because actual engineering will ultimately be limited and directed by what states legislate, so we want to make sure the laws fit the technology and the needs of the individual.</p>

<p>Intern Search. We’re thrilled that our Summer 2021 internship program has been sponsored by the <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherA/status/1366880813845909506">Humans Rights Foundation</a>. We’ve thus put out <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/32">a call for interns</a>, and we’re expanding our usual development work to also include direct support for activists, who need help to maintain their privacy in potentially hostile regimes. However, to really support activists requires knowing what they need. So, we’re also considering working with interns to do research and conduct interviews to create user engagement models for activists. This would be similar to the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/amira.pdf">Amira model</a> from RWOT. If you are interested in having developers work with or mentor blockchain interns, want to suggest intern projects, or even have engineers who might be interested in working on Blockchain Commons projects briefly during the summer, <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">please mail us</a>.</p>

<p>Taproot &amp; Schnorr First Steps. We may see a major upgrade for Bitcoin as soon as this fall, if Speedy Trial is approved for Taproot and Schnorr. The first will increase privacy for #SmartCustody features such as timelocks and multisig, while the second will allow aggregated multisig, which offer several advantages over traditional ECDSA signatures. Our brand-new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign CLI</a> app provides the first experimental support for Schnorr signatures leveraging the Taproot/Schnorr BIPS, but independent from <code>bitcoind</code>. More to come as we ramp up to this expansion.</p>

 Supporting the Future 

<p>We’ve laid out our initial roadmap for the next two cycles of Blockchain Commons efforts, covering spring and summer. Important topics includes finalizing our Gordian Seal program, solving problems with xpub reuse in Bitcon multisig, supporting and advancing SSKR (Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction) for not just cryptographic seeds but other data, continuing to support and advance URs (Universal Resources) with encrypted and/or signed CBOR, and architecting a new QuickConnect 2.0 for initiating TorGap-based services between peers. If you’d like to know more about our roadmap, especially if you considering becoming a sustaining sponsor or to sponsor a specific project on our roadmap, please <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us directly</a>.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland — 13 April 2021 — Today Energy Web announced a new initiative, funded by a €1 million grant from Google.org’s Impact Challenge program, to provide a digital framework for coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) across the transmission and distribution market interface of Europe’s power grid. <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/who-we-are/what-is-climate-kic/">Climate-KIC</a>, the EU’s leading knowledge and innovation community focused on climate, helped to select winning grantees.</p><p>The initiative will leverage the open-source Energy Web stack to make it easy for prosumers and DERs to register and participate in local and regional energy markets. Working with mobile network operators, IoT service providers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and grid operators across Europe, the initiative will foster the procurement of flexibility services in a transparent, non-discriminatory, and market-based way, as prioritized by the <a href="https://acer.europa.eu/en/Electricity/CLEAN_ENERGY_PACKAGE">EU Clean Energy&nbsp;Package</a>.</p><p>Energy Web’s grant comes from the <a href="https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/climate2020">Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate</a>, which commits €10M to fund bold ideas that aim to use technology to accelerate Europe’s progress toward a greener, more-resilient future. It is expected to accelerate the strong momentum Energy Web has already generated working with European grid operators. This grant and initiative will build upon existing open-source software developed to support near-identical use cases with transmission system operators (TSOs) Austrian Power Grid, 50 Hertz, and Elia as well as distribution system operators (DSOs) Electra Caldense and Fluvius. The common theme across these projects is easing the digitization, registration, and participation of DERs in energy markets managed by both DSOs and TSOs. More recently, this same architecture underpinned <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/bebat-launches-easybat-an-open-source-decentralized-solution-for-battery-lifecycle-management-281f2ace61e9">EasyBat</a>, used to track the lifecycle of residential and commercial batteries in&nbsp;Belgium.</p><p>“This Google.org grant and the work it will fund supporting a pan-European electric flexibility market is the culmination of Energy Web’s mission to enable any customer and any asset to participate in any energy market,” explained Walter Kok, CEO of Energy Web. “We are able to harness the flexibility of prosumers to provide value throughout the electricity value chain to make DERs the backbone of the European&nbsp;grid.”</p><p>The initiative will focus on integrating the Energy Web stack with a number of electricity market participants, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Mobile Network Operators: in order to assign digital identities to all GSM-enabled energy assets via SIM&nbsp;cards.  IoT Service Providers: in order to co-develop SIM cards with electricity-sector roaming capabilities (i.e., independent of the Mobile Network Operator) that will allow energy assets to directly register with the Energy Web technology stack.  OEMs: in order to enable new generations of energy assets to directly embed an identity on the&nbsp;stack.  DSOs / TSOs: once integrated, DSOs will be able to tap into the flexible capacity of DERs connected to their networks and use them to procure flexibility. Likewise, TSOs will be able to simultaneously leverage DERs for regional / national markets in support of safer, greener, more-resilient electricity grids.  <p>Since it is common for Mobile Network Operators, IoT service providers, and payment solution providers to operate their own proprietary data systems and architectures, the project will ensure interoperability between these systems — including multiple blockchains — and the public Energy Web stack. Ultimately, at least 1 million DERs will integrate into electricity markets as part of the Google.org-funded project.</p><p>“We have received an overwhelming number of applications for our Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate,” said Rowan Barnett, head of Google.org in EMEA and APAC. “The Energy Web project is so exciting because it has tremendous transformative potential, not just for Europe, but for power grids around the world. We are catching a glimpse of the future electricity system — one that is inherently decentralized and democratized.”</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global, member-driven nonprofit accelerating the low-carbon, customer-centric energy transition by unleashing the potential of open-source, digital technologies. We enable any energy asset, owned by any customer, to participate in any energy market. The Energy Web Chain — the world’s first enterprise-grade, public blockchain tailored to the energy sector — anchors our tech stack. The Energy Web ecosystem comprises leading utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers, IoT / telecom leaders, and&nbsp;others.</p><p>For more, please visit <a href="https://energyweb.org.">https://energyweb.org.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/google-backs-energy-web-to-harmonize-low-carbon-electricity-markets-across-europe-204c18cd2f12">Google Backs Energy Web to Harmonize Low-Carbon Electricity Markets Across Europe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights">Energy Web Insights</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By David T. Hsu, Exploration &amp; Future Sensing, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">The PORTALS report</a>, in collaboration with Guild of Future Architects, flows from a yearlong process of imagining futures beyond the pandemic. <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">Download the full report&nbsp;here.</a> <p>It’s a warm spring day. Clouds hover over the horizon. The San Gabriel foothills smell of sage and soil after the rain. I feel my muscles begin to relax for the first time in a&nbsp;while.</p><p>I’m not alone. Though serious hurdles remain in the United States and globally, increasing numbers of American adults see hope on the horizon. A recurring Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-coronavirus-americans-hope-4bcc2761-82f0-43d0-b9eb-552f6a9ada71.html">poll</a> shows “hopeful” taking the lead over “stressed” and “frustrated” for the first time since the pandemic began. Roughly one-third of US adults have been vaccinated; the rest will be eligible by the end of April. Recent jobs reports show signs of an economy waking from hibernation. The American Rescue Plan and proposed American Jobs Plan would invest a combined $4 trillion in recovery and infrastructure.</p><p>These new possibilities bring a rush of questions. What does life look like after the pandemic for my community; my generation? How will we juggle work, education, and care to make ends meet? Whose lives and livelihoods are valued? After a year of isolation, where will we find belonging?</p><blockquote>When we look back on 2020, will we remember it as the year everything changed?</blockquote><p>“Disasters are extraordinarily generative,” Rebecca Solnit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/books/excerpt-paradise-built-in-hell.html">writes</a>, but “there is no simple formula for what arises: it has everything to do with who or what individuals or communities were before the disaster.”</p><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">Our new PORTALS report</a> imagines possible futures arising out of today’s disasters. It is the latest installment of the annual <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/trends-to-watch-in-2020-beyond-16d457bf6b48">Trends to Watch</a> series, curated by our Exploration and Future Sensing team to support Omidyar Network’s mission of reimagining systems to build more inclusive and equitable societies. Across our focus areas of <a href="https://omidyar.com/reimagining-capitalism/">Reimagining Capitalism</a>, <a href="https://omidyar.com/responsible-technology-2/">Responsible Technology</a>, and <a href="https://omidyar.com/pluralism/">Pluralism</a>, the work of “reimagining” requires that we interrogate our own assumptions about how systems need to change by <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/listening-to-the-future-5d709ea30d7d">listening to diverse viewpoints</a>.</p><p>Created in collaboration with <a href="https://futurearchitects.com/">Guild of Future Architects</a>, the 2021 report distills four open-ended provocations, designed to stir imagination and action, from a yearlong process of collective foresight. Between November 2019 and February 2021, the Guild invited 1,000 people to participate in a series of virtual sessions asking how systems that shape our daily lives could become more just and inclusive by 2036. A critical part of looking ahead was also looking back at how we arrived at today’s social, economic, and political realities.</p><p>Here are the provocations:</p>  What if shared well-being became the standard of success for our&nbsp;nations?  Are we ready to move from an era that rewards extraction to one that prioritizes regeneration?  How will we move from an era of destabilizing information into an age of trusted&nbsp;wisdom?  Can we dismantle industrial-age silos between work, home, education, play, and community?  <p>Each one pairs with a “Spectrum of Possibility” exercise to stir your own thinking about how imagined futures could become reality. Taken together, we hope that these provocations offer useful foundations for people working now to build tomorrow’s systems.</p> <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">Download the full report&nbsp;here</a>. <a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=5">What if shared well-being became the standard of success for our&nbsp;nations?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=14">Are we ready to move from an era that rewards extraction to one that prioritizes regeneration?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=23">How will we move from an era of destabilizing information into an age of trusted&nbsp;wisdom?</a><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf#page=32">Can we dismantle industrial-age silos between work, home, education, play, and community?</a><p><a href="https://omidyar.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portals-to-Beautiful-Futures-2021.pdf">The PORTALS report</a> is a collaboration between Omidyar Network and the Guild of Future Architects. It was envisioned and written by a diverse group of fellows, employees, and consultants, based upon foresight sessions convened by the Guild throughout 2020 involving 1,000+ participants.</p><p>Guild of Future Architects contributors include Sharon Chang, Kamal Sinclair, Rachel Yezbick, Sheena Matheiken, Jessica Clark, Tony Patrick, Amelia Winger-Bearskin, and Robert Sinclair.</p><p>Omidyar Network’s Exploration and Future Sensing team includes Eshanthi Ranasinghe, David Hsu, Julia Solano, and Nicole Allred.

 It was business as&nbsp;usual <p>‘’Human rights protected offline should also be protected online’’</p><p>This was the resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) — the <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/38/L.10/Rev.1">resolution</a> on “the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet” at the 38th Session of the Human Rights Council of July 2018 which affirmed what we all held sacrosanct — that digital rights are human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Internet and digital access have <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ITU_regional_global_Key_ICT_indicator_aggregates_Nov_2020.xlsx">deepened</a> across Africa in the past 20 years, in the process ushering in new vistas of human development. An important dimension of this development has been the expansion of new media, where new technologies such as social media have <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-new-media-platforms-have-become-powerful-across-africa-107294">given voices</a> to the hitherto voiceless and amplifying once stifled perspectives.</p><p>Given that the tight control many authoritarian regimes on the continent exercised relied on having a tight grip on public discourse, the Internet and the new media it spawned soon ran into <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37300272">cross hairs</a> with governments from Cairo to Cape Town. Africa has one of the most censored digital environments in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pushing back against this censorship is a community of digital rights defenders. A basic, yet important tool in their efforts to promote media freedom is <a href="https://rankingdigitalrights.org/2018/05/23/why-and-how-do-we-document-the-impact-of-rights-violations/">documentation</a>. In the aid of digital rights defenders everywhere, here’s a summary of some of the most important developments in digital rights in Africa in Q1&nbsp;2021.</p>Photo: <a href="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/human-humanity-silhouettes-camera-109103/">Pixabay</a> Internet shutdowns and website&nbsp;blocks <p>Sage-like, I had <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">written presciently</a> in the first week of January that it was not a matter of if, rather when Internet shutdowns will occur in 2021. Like clockwork, the first Internet <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/uganda-shuts-down-internet-during-presidential-election/av-56243961">shutdown</a> happened shortly later in Uganda on January 13 on the eve of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55649467">Presidential elections</a> which saw young activist Robert Kyagulanyi (aka Bobi Wine) challenge Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan President. The Internet shutdown was ordered by the government in retaliation for Facebook’s move to block a number of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-uganda-election-facebook-idUSKBN29G1H9">pro-government accounts</a>.</p><p>On November 4 2020, the Ethiopian government cut off <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/ethiopia-telephone-internet-services-tigray-2731442">telephone and Internet service</a> in the northern region of Tigray at the commencement of military offensive against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The restrictions on telephone and Internet service persisted into 2021. Curiously, numerous Twitter accounts <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/17/ethiopias-cracking-down-tigray-activists-are-spreading-news/">were created</a> elsewhere in the country in the following days to fill the information vacuum created in the Tigray&nbsp;region.</p><p>Following opposition protests after run-off elections in Niger on February 21, mobile Internet service providers <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/niger-election-internet-blackout/">disrupted service</a>. The election was won by Mohamed Bazoum, a former Interior Minister and candidate of the ruling party in the first <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56175439">democratic transition</a> in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>On March 5, Facebook, YouTube, and Whatsapp were <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/social-media-and-messaging-apps-disrupted-in-senegal-amid-political-unrest-eA1R5pBp">restricted</a> on the Orange/Sonatel network in Senegal following protests against the arrest of opposition politician Ousmane Sonko of the Pastef party. Ousmane Sonko had been earlier accused of rape — an allegation he claimed was <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/03/05/senegal-blocks-social-media/">politically motivated</a>.</p><p>On Election day March 21, there was a disruption to Internet connectivity in Congo. The election, won by incumbent President Dennis Sassou Nguesso who was seeking his fourth term in office, was marked by low <a href="https://www.africanews.com/2021/03/21/congo-election-low-voter-turn-out-internet-shutdown-mark-polls//">voter turn-out</a>. The major opponent to the incumbent Guy-Brice Parfait Kolélas died of Covid-19 on <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56474855">election day</a>, after being flown out to France for medical attention.</p><p>In January, People’s Gazette, a critical website in Nigeria, was <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2021/01/28/nigerian-government-blocks-peoples-gazette-website-over-critical-media-reports">blocked</a> ostensibly from orders from the Nigerian government following an <a href="https://www.gazettengr.com/atiku-rsf-global-rights-gatefield-others-condemn-nigerian-govts-blocking-of-peoples-gazette-website/">investigative report</a> about senior officials of the President.</p> Legal and Policy developments <p>In Kenya, the Finance Act of 2019 empowered the Kenya Revenue Authority to announce a Digital Services Tax in 2020. The tax came into <a href="https://home.kpmg/us/en/home/insights/2020/12/tnf-kenya-digital-services-tax-regulations-effective-date-2021.html#:~:text=Overview%20of%20the%20digital%20services,of%20the%20gross%20transaction%20value.&amp;text=The%20digital%20services%20tax%20will,services%20through%20a%20digital%20marketplace.">effect</a> on January 1 2021. The tax is 1.5% of the total value of business services <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-47639452?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_live&amp;ns_linkname=6006b04354a69202e80dcf9f%26Kenya%27s%20digital%20tax%20will%20%27undermine%20online%20businesses%27%262021-01-19T15%3A44%3A49.875Z&amp;ns_fee=0&amp;pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:f0b242e5-daae-48c4-b704-ae3e99075ddc&amp;pinned_post_asset_id=6006b04354a69202e80dcf9f&amp;pinned_post_type=share">rendered</a> through online platforms and is expected to hinder the development of online businesses.</p><p>Also in Kenya, the Statute Law Miscellaneous Amendment Act, an amendment to the Official Secrets Act, was signed on December 11 2020. According to AccessNow, it gives sweeping <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/kenya-right-to-privacy/">powers</a> to the Cabinet Secretary of Interior and Coordination of National Security to access data from any phone or computer.</p><p>In a landmark judgment in <a href="https://privacyinternational.org/news-analysis/4416/south-african-constitutional-court-declares-bulk-surveillance-powers-unlawful">favour</a> of privacy in February, South Africa’s Constitutional Court declared the bulk interception of communications by the country’s spy agencies unlawful. The case was based <a href="https://www.techfinancials.co.za/2021/02/15/top-court-ruling-on-south-africas-spy-law-is-a-victory-for-privacy-but-loopholes-remain/">on evidence</a> that the state spied on investigative journalist Stephen Patrick Sole of amaBhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism while communicating with a source. The applicants including amaBhungane Centre argued that the Regulation of Interception of Communications Act of 2002 (RICA) and the National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 1994 (NSIA) violate the right to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>In Uganda, the Tax Amendment Bills, 2021 is before Parliament for debate. If passed into law, will take effect from 1st July 2021. Among its goals are <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ug/Documents/tax/Uganda%20Draft%20Tax%20Amendment%20Bills%20Highlights%202021-2022.pdf?id=ke:2sm:3tw:4%23TaxAlert,%23Tax::6tax:20210401144115::4687826861:5&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_campaign=%23TaxAlert,%23Tax&amp;utm_content=tax&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;linkId=115105719">repealing</a> the top services (OTT) tax (reducing the rate of over the top tax from 20% to 12%) and introducing a new tax on internet&nbsp;data.</p><p>Zambia enacted a Cybersecurity and <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/acts/Act%20No.%202%20of%202021The%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Cyber%20Crimes.pdf">Cybercrime Act</a> which gives sweeping powers to the government to exercise greater control over social media and conduct communications surveillance without a court order. The Law has been quickly <a href="https://misa.org/news/zambias-newly-enacted-cybercrime-law-challenged-in-court/">challenged</a> in the High Court of Zambia by a coalition of civil society organizations who are praying the court to declare the law unconstitutional.</p> Arrests and detentions <p>In Zimbabwe Devine Panashe Maregere and his wife Vongai Nomatter Chiminya were both arrested in January for sending <a href="https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/africa/couple-detained-for-claiming-mnangagwa-died-of-covid-19-3272772">a message</a> on WhatsApp claiming that President Emmerson Mnangagwa had died of Covid-19. They were charged at Beitbridge magistrate court with publishing or communicating falsehoods.</p><p>On February 9 2021 Innocent Bahati, a poet and singer was <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/30/rwanda-arrests-prosecutions-over-youtube-posts">reported missing</a>. He was last seen a few prior in Nyanza, Southern Province. Innocent’s poems, which he recited in videos posted on YouTube, focused on issues such as poverty or criticism of the government, for which he had once been detained.</p> Countering Business as usual in Q2&nbsp;2021 <p>Why digital rights violations persist in the most brazen forms such as Internet shutdowns and clampdowns on freedom of expression in Africa has roots in the broader dysfunctional state of politics and society in general on the continent. We can only improve human rights standards when there has been a more fundamental change in the way our societies are run — which will include key institutional reforms in electoral democracy and economic justice. It is a campaign we’ve <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/internet-shutdowns-in-2021-c2a4e8dd4845">commenced</a> in Q1 2021 and will gladly continue in Q2&nbsp;2021.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/what-happened-with-digital-rights-in-africa-in-q1-2021-93a890cf3e2d">What happened with digital rights in Africa in Q1 2021?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center">Berkman Klein Center Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Scalable, Flexible Infrastructure for Decentralized Identity</p><p>This week, the DIF Steering Committee officially approved the first major release of the Sidetree Protocol specification, "v1" so to speak. This protocol has already been implemented, and four of its implementers have been collaborating intensively for over a year on expanding and extending this specification together.</p> What exactly is a “Sidetree”? <p>Sidetree is a protocol that extends “decentralized identifiers” (DIDs), one of the core building blocks of decentralized identity. &nbsp;Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable a person or entity to securely and directly “anchor” their data-sharing activities to a shared ledger, secured by cryptography. The first generation of DID systems accomplished this with a 1-to-1 relationship between “blockchain addresses” (cryptographic identities) and the more flexible, powerful addresses called DIDs. These latter functioned as privacy-preserving extensions of the blockchain addresses to which they were closely coupled. In this way, each DID effortlessly inherited the formidable security guarantees of those blockchains-- but in many cases, they also inherited scalability problems and economic models that were a bad fit for many DID use-cases.</p><p>Sidetree is a systematic, carefully-engineered protocol that loosens that coupling between anchor-points on a distributed data system (usually a blockchain) and the DID networks anchored to them. Crucially, it replaces the 1-to-1 relationship with a 1-to-many relationship, pooling resources and security guarantees. Depending on the use-case and implementation strategies chosen, the protocol can optimize for scalable performance, for developer-friendly ergonomics and SDKs, for the portability of DIDs and networks of DIDs across multiple anchoring systems, and even for high-availability in low-connectivity contexts where a global blockchain cannot be relied upon directly.</p><p>The name “sidetree” combines two hints as to its early technical inspirations and superpowers. Each Sidetree network functions as a kind of identity-specific “Layer 2” overlay network where participating nodes root aggregated operational data into transactions of the underlying chain. This mechanism has many high-level conceptual similarities with the “sidechains” of other “Layer 2” systems, such as the &nbsp;Lightning network running atop Bitcoin or state channel implementations on Ethereum. It also shares with merkle “trees” (and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/#further-resources">DAGs</a> like IPFS) the self-certifying property of content-addressability, a core building block of decentralized and distributed systems.</p><p>Leveraging concepts from sidechains and “Layer 2” network protocols, Sidetree was first <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-methods/blob/master/sidetrees/explainer.md">proposed</a> by Microsoft’s Daniel Buchner and has been incubated in the DIF community, evolving along the way with major contributions from a growing list of DIF members.</p> The team that delivered the specification <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ownyouridentity">Microsoft</a> (Redmond, WA, USA)<p>A global consumer and enterprise app, service, hardware, and cloud infrastructure provider whose mission is to empower every person to achieve more. Microsoft is proud to have worked on Sidetree and implemented the Sidetree protocol via its contributions to ION. As a key piece of infrastructure that is foundational to its Decentralized Identity work, Microsoft is committed to the continued development of Sidetree and ION in DIF.</p><a href="https://securekey.com/">SecureKey</a> (Toronto, ON, Canada)<p>SecureKey is a leading digital identity and authentication provider, and is a champion of the ecosystem approach to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. This ecosystem-first philosophy informs our investment in Sidetree as a protocol for extensibility and scalability, which can evolve its featureset, and its network model over time. &nbsp;Of particular technological interest to us is how Sidetree can be overlaid on a wide variety of ledger and propagation systems. This will enable identity systems that span many use cases and work across public blockchains, federation and witness protocols, and permissioned blockchains without being locked to any particular ledger technology.</p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute Industries</a> (Austin, TX, USA)<p>Transmute uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to secure critical trade data by digitizing key trade documents so that they’re traceable and verifiable anywhere in the world, easily accessible and selectively shareable, searchable and auditable, and impossible to forge or alter. Transmute contributed to Sidetree’s development because it leverages batch processing capabilities to achieve enterprise scale and retains maximum optionality for our customers, allowing their business to span many blockchains and trust frameworks. Transmute sees Sidetree-based networks as necessary for scaling up decentralized identity capabilities to a global enterprise scale, where thousands of verifiable transactions per second can be processed at an unbeatable price.</p><a href="https://mattr.global">MATTR Global</a> (Auckland, New Zealand)<p>Mattr works with communities and a growing network of companies to shift industries like digital identity towards a more equitable future, providing tools to support digital inclusion, privacy and end-user control. Sidetree represents a significant leap forward in thinking around how to create truly decentralized infrastructure for resilient identifiers. We welcome the agnostic and extensible approach not just to distributed ledgers but also to content addressable storage and other building-blocks of flexible infrastructure. We look forward to integrating many of the DID systems coming out of the Sidetree standardization effort.</p> The first generation of Sidetree Systems <p>Transmute maintains Sidetree ledger adapters for Ethereum, Amazon QLDB, Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric. We also support interoperability tests with DID Key, the Universal Wallet Interop Spec, the VC HTTP API, and Traceability Vocabulary. Transmute has built Sidetree.js, an implementation of the Sidetree protocol based on the DIF’s codebase that focuses on modularity: it is a Typescript monorepo where each component of a Sidetree node (Ledger, Content Addressable Storage, Cache database) can be substituted with different implementations that use a common interface.</p><p>SecureKey &nbsp;has created a ledger-agnostic <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-core-go">Go implementation</a> of Sidetree along with <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/orb">Orb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustbloc/sidetree-fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> variations built on top. The <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did:orb</a> method enables independent organizations to create decentralized identifiers that are propagated across a shared decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain. By extending Sidetree into a Fediverse of interconnected registries, Orb provides the foundation for building digital ecosystems on top of decentralized identifiers using a federated, replicated and scalable approach.</p><p>Microsoft is a primary contributor to <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">ION</a>, an open source, public, permissionless implementation of Sidetree on the Bitcoin ledger. There are several repositories and public utilities that make working with ION easier, including:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">ION GitHub repo</a>: the main repository for the code that powers ION nodes  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools">ION Tools</a>: JavaScript libraries for Node.js and browser environments that makes using DIDs and interacting with the ION network easier for web developers  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/install-guide/">ION Install Guide</a>: A step-by-step guide for installing an ION node  <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/explorer/">ION Explorer</a>: A graphical interface for viewing DIDs and auditing other data transactions published to the public ION network.   What's next for Sidetree  <p>One significant feature on the horizon is to add support for pruning of verbose lineage data (which is no longer needed to maintain the secure backbone of DIDs in a Sidetree implementation) at Sidetree’s anchor points. This addition will allow Sidetree-based networks to purge upwards of 95% of legacy operation data in a decentralized way that maintains all of the security guarantees the protocol currently makes.</p><p>Another near-future feature is the so-called “DID Type Table.” DIDs in various DID Method implementations may be typed to provide an indication as to what they DID might represent. The Sidetree WG will publish a table of types (not including human-centric types) that stand for organizations, machines, code packages, etc., which DID creators can use if they want to tag a DID with a given type.</p><p>The medium-term roadmap is up for discussion, so if you have ideas <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/sidetree.html">get involved</a>!</p>

<p>Digital health passes — often mischaracterized as “vaccine passports” in the popular press — are making headlines as a key component in the drive to restore global travel and restart the global economy after the massive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Enabling individuals to receive and selectively share proof-of-test, proof-of-vaccination, and proof-of-recovery with the highest standards for security, privacy and data protection will allow destination countries and travel systems worldwide to accept credentials from multiple market vendors. But concerns related to equity and access can only be addressed if these health pass implementations are designed to be interoperable.</p>



<p>As the leading global consortium for interoperable digital trust infrastructure, the ToIP Foundation has partnered with the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> –&nbsp;a project of <a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a> –&nbsp;to host a new Working Group focused on the core issues of interoperability, privacy, and equity for digital health passes. The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/pahttps://wiki.trustoverip.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=73790">Interoperability Working Group for Good Health Pass </a>consists of nine drafting groups, each focused on a specific interoperability challenge as defined in the<a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GHPC-Interoperability-Blueprint-Outline-v2.pdf"> Interoperability Blueprint Outline</a>.</p>



<p>“The Good Health Pass Collaborative is bringing people together to solve a set of problems that affect the entire world,” said John Jordan, executive director of the ToIP Foundation. “This ambitious effort uniquely aligns with the mission of ToIP because it requires interoperable digital credentials that can be accepted and verified anywhere they are needed. Getting this right, and doing so now, will not only make it safe for people to travel again, it will open the door for new tools and services that can solve other challenging problems that also require global-scale digital trust. For these reasons, ToIP is honored to contribute to this urgent global mission by hosting the Interoperability Working Group on behalf of the Good Health Pass Collaborative.”</p>



<p>Each drafting group, consisting of volunteer representatives from around the world representing the health, travel, technology, and policy sectors, will first conduct an intensive 30-day sprint to develop an initial set of draft recommendations. This will be followed by a second 30 day community and public review process to develop a final set of recommendations.</p>



<p>“Digital health passes –&nbsp;If properly designed and implemented –&nbsp;could offer a path to safely restore domestic and international travel, resume certain aspects of public life, and restart the global economy,“ said ID2020 executive director, Dakota Gruener. “Collaboration is critical at this juncture. Our organizations share a commitment to ensuring that digital health passes are designed and implemented in ways that serve the needs of the individuals and institutions that rely on them, while simultaneously protecting core values like privacy, civil liberties, and equity. ToIP has developed a powerful set of tools and models for digital trust frameworks, and we are delighted to be partnering with them in this critically important effort.”</p>



<p>The nine drafting groups collaborating within the new Working Group are:</p>



  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Paper+Based+Credentials+Drafting+Group">Paper Based Credentials</a> will define how a paper-based alternative can be created for any digital health pass so access will be available to all.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Consistent+User+Experience+Drafting+Group">Consistent User Experience</a> will specify the common elements required so that individuals can easily, intuitively, and safely use digital health pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Standard+Data+Models+and+Elements+Drafting+Group">Standard Data Models and Elements</a> will determine the core data items needed across all digital health pass implementations for both COVID-19 testing and vaccinations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Credential+Formats%2C+Signatures%2C+and+Exchange+Protocols+Drafting+Group">Credential Formats, Signatures, and Exchange Protocols</a> will specify the requirements for technical interoperability of Good Health Pass implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Security%2C+Privacy%2C+and+Data+Protection+Drafting+Group">Security, Privacy, and Data Protection</a> will define the safety requirements for Good Health Pass compliant implementations.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registries+Drafting+Group">Trust Registries</a> will specify how verifiers can confirm that a digital health pass has been issued by an authorized issuer.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Rules+Engines+Drafting+Group">Rules Engines</a> will define how digital health pass apps can access different sources of policy information to determine what test or vaccination status is needed for a specific usage scenario.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Identity+Binding+Drafting+Group">Identity Binding</a> will specify the options for verifying that the holder of a digital health pass is the individual who received the test or vaccination credential.  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Framework+Drafting+Group">Governance Framework</a> will define the overall set of policies that must be followed for an implementation to qualify as Good Health Pass compliant.  



<p>By adhering to the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint that will be synthesized from the outputs of these nine drafting groups, airlines, airports, hospitality industries, international customs officials and others will be able to process visitors easily without requiring additional unnecessary steps mandated by proprietary systems. Travelers will not be confused about which credential they need for each point of verification. Moreover, since individuals will be fully in control of their own personal data in credentials in their own wallets or devices, they can be confident that their private health data is not being tracked or misused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested organizations are invited to join the ToIP Foundation to participate directly in this new Working Group or in the public comment period in May. They are also encouraged to join the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> at ID2020 to participate in the construction, adoption, and advocacy of the Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint.</p>

<p>Ceramic is a public, permissionless, open source protocol that provides computation, state transformations, and consensus for all types of data structures stored on the decentralized web. Ceramic's stream processing enables developers to build with dynamic information without trusted database servers to create powerful, secure, trustless, censorship-resistant applications.</p><p>This overview introduces how:</p>  Decentralized content computation gives rise to a new era of open source information  Stream processing provides an appropriate framework for dynamic, decentralized content  You can use Ceramic to replace your database with a truly decentralized alternative  <p>To skip ahead and get started building, try <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> to demo Ceramic in a browser application, the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI, or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p><p>This post was originally published on the Ceramic documentation site. Contents here may fall out of date, but you can always find the most up to date version <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/overview/">here</a>.</p> The internet of open source information <p>At its core, the internet is a collection of applications running on stateful data sources – from identity systems and user tables to databases and feeds for storing all kinds of content generated by users, services, or machines.</p><p>Most of the information on today's internet is locked away on application-specific database servers designed to protect data as a proprietary resource. Acting as a trusted middleman, applications make it difficult and opaque for others to access this information by requiring explicit permissions, one-off API integrations, and trust that returned state is correct. This siloed and competitive environment results in more friction for developers and worse experiences for users.</p><p>Along other dimensions, the web has rapidly evolved into a more open source, composable, and collaborative ecosystem. We can observe this trend in open source software enabled by Git's distributed version control and in open source finance enabled by blockchain's double-spend protection. The same principles of open source have not yet been applied to content.</p><p>The next wave of transformative innovation will be in applying the same open source principles to the world's information, unlocking a universe of content that can be frictionlessly shared across application or organizational boundaries. Achieving this requires a decentralized computation network designed specifically for content with flexibility, scalability, and composability as first class requirements.</p> Decentralized content computation <p>Open sourcing the content layer for applications requires deploying information to a public, permissionless environment where files can be stored, computation can be performed, state can be tracked, and others can easily access content.</p><p>Advancements in other Web3 protocols have already achieved success in decentralized file storage. As a universal file system for the decentralized web, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> (including <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> and <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a>) provides an extremely flexible content naming and routing system. As a storage disk, durable persistence networks (such as <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>, and <a href="https://sia.tech/">Sia</a>) ensure that the content represented in IPFS files are persisted and kept available. This stack of Web3 protocols performs well for storing static files, but on its own lacks the computation and state management capacity for more advanced database-like features such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic. These are required to enable developers to build fully-featured decentralized applications.</p><p>Ceramic enables static files to be composed into higher-order mutable data structures, programmed to behave in any desired manner, and whose resulting state is stored and replicated across a decentralized network of nodes. Ceramic builds upon and extends the IPFS file system and underlying persistence networks, as well as other open standards in the decentralized ecosystem, with a general-purpose decentralized content computation substrate. Due to Ceramic's permissionless design and unified global network, anyone in the world can openly create, discover, query, and build upon existing data without needing to trust a centralized server, integrate one-off APIs, or worry if the state of information being returned is correct.</p> Streams <p>Ceramic's decentralized content computation network is modeled after various stream processing frameworks found in Web2. In these types of systems, events are ingested, processed as they arrive, and the resulting output is applied to a log. When queried and reduced, this log represents the current state of a piece of information. This is an appropriate framework for conceptualizing how dynamic information should be modeled on the decentralized web. Furthermore because the function that processes incoming events on any particular stream can be custom written with logic for any use case, it provides the general-purpose flexibility and extensibility needed to represent the diversity of information that may exist on the web.</p><p>On Ceramic, each piece of information is represented as an append-only log of commits, called a Stream. Each stream is a DAG stored in IPLD, with an immutable name called a StreamID, and a verifiable state called a StreamState. Streams are similar in concept to Git trees, and each stream can be thought of as its own blockchain, ledger, or event log.</p> StreamTypes <p>Each stream must specify a StreamType, which is the processing logic used by the particular stream. A StreamType is essentially a function that is executed by a Ceramic node upon receipt of a new commit to the stream that governs the stream's state transitions and resulting output. StreamTypes are responsible for enforcing all rules and logic for the stream, such as data structure, content format, authentication or access control, and consensus algorithm. If an update does not conform to the logic specified by the StreamType, the update is disregarded. After applying a valid commit to the stream, the resulting StreamState is broadcast out to the rest of the nodes on the Ceramic Network. Each of the other nodes that are also maintaining this stream will update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.</p><p>Ceramic's flexible StreamTypes framework enables developers to deploy any kind of information that conforms to any set of arbitrary rules as a stateful stream of events. Ceramic clients come pre-packaged with a standard set of StreamTypes that cover a wide range of common use cases, making it easy to get started building applications:</p>  Tile Document: a StreamType that stores a JSON document, providing similar functionality as a NoSQL document store. Tile Documents are frequently used as a database replacement for identity metadata (profiles, social graphs, reputation scores, linked social accounts), user-generated content (blog posts, social media, etc), indexes of other StreamIDs to form collections and user tables (IDX), DID documents, verifiable claims, and more. Tile Documents rely on DIDs for authentication and all valid updates to a stream must be signed by the DID that controls the stream.  CAIP-10 Link: a StreamType that stores a cryptographically verifiable proof that links a blockchain address to a DID. A DID can have an unlimited number of CAIP-10 Links that bind it to many different addresses on many different blockchain networks. CAIP-10 Links also rely on DIDs for authentication, same as the Tile Document.  Custom: You can implement your own StreamType and deploy it to your Ceramic node if the pre-packaged StreamTypes are not suitable for your use case.   Authentication <p>StreamTypes are able to specify their authentication requirements for how new data is authorized to be added to a particular stream. Different StreamTypes may choose to implement different authentication requirements. One of the most powerful and important authentication mechanisms that Ceramic StreamTypes support is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, the W3C standard for decentralized identifiers. DIDs are used by the default StreamTypes (Tile Documents and CAIP-10 Links).</p><p>DIDs provide a way to go from a globally-unique, platform-agnostic string identifier to a DID document containing public keys for signature verification and encryption. Ceramic is capable of supporting any DID method implementation. Below, find the DID methods that are currently supported by Ceramic:</p>  3ID DID Method: A DID method that uses Ceramic's Tile Document StreamType to represent a mutable DID document. 3IDs are typically used for end-user accounts. When 3IDs are used in conjunction with <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-20/CIP-20.md">3ID Keychain</a> (as is implemented in <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a>), a 3ID can easily be controlled with any number of blockchain accounts from any L1 or L2 network. This provides a way to unify a user's identity across all other platforms.  Key DID Method: A DID method statically generated from any Ed25519 key pair. Key DIDs are typically used for developer accounts. Key DID is lightweight, but the drawback is that its DID document is immutable and has no ability to rotate keys if it is compromised.  NFT DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for any NFT on any blockchain. The DID document is statically generated from on-chain data. The DID associated to the blockchain account of the asset's current owner (using CAIP-10 Links) is the only entity authorized to act on behalf of the NFT DID, authenticate in DID-based systems, and make updates to streams or other data owned by the NFT DID. When ownership of the NFT changes, so does the controller permissions.  Safe DID Method (coming soon): A DID method for a Gnosis Safe smart contract on any blockchain. Typically used for organizations, DAOs, and other multi-sig entities.   Ceramic Network <p>The Ceramic Network is a decentralized, worldwide network of nodes running the Ceramic protocol that communicate over a dedicated topic on the Libp2p peer-to-peer networking protocol. Ceramic is able to achieve maximum horizontal scalability, throughput, and performance due to its unique design.</p> Sharded execution environment <p>Unlike traditional blockchain systems where scalability is limited to a single global virtual execution environment (VM) and the state of a single ledger is shared between all nodes, each Ceramic node acts as an individual execution environment for performing computations and validating transactions on streams – there is no global ledger. This "built-in" execution sharding enables the Ceramic Network to scale horizontally to parallelize the processing of an increasing number of simultaneous stream transactions as the number of nodes on the network increases. Such a design is needed to handle the scale of the world's data, which is orders of magnitude greater than the throughput needed on a financial blockchain. Another benefit of this design is that a Ceramic node can perform stream transactions in an offline-first environment and then later sync updates with the rest of the network when it comes back online.</p> Global namespace <p>Since all nodes are part of the same Ceramic Network, every stream on Ceramic exists within a single global namespace where it can be accessed by any other node or referenced by any other stream. This creates a public data web of open source information.</p> Additional node responsibilities <p>In addition to executing stream transactions according to StreamType logic, Ceramic nodes also maintain a few other key responsibilities:</p>  StreamState storage: A Ceramic node only persists StreamStates for the streams it cares to keep around, a process called "pinning." Different nodes will maintain StreamStates for different streams, but multiple nodes can maintain the state of a single stream.  Commit log storage: A Ceramic node maintains a local copy of all commits to the streams it is pinning.  Persistence connectors: Ceramic nodes can optionally utilize an additional durable storage backend for backing up commits for streams it is pinning. This can be any of the persistence networks mentioned above, including Filecoin, Arweave, Sia, etc. (coming soon).  Query responses: Ceramic nodes respond to stream queries from clients. If the node has the stream pinned it will return the response; if not, it will ask the rest of the network for the stream over libp2p and then return the response.  Broadcasting transactions: When a Ceramic node successfully performs a transaction on a stream, it broadcasts this transaction out the rest of the network over libp2p so other nodes also pinning this stream can update their StreamState to reflect this new transaction.   Clients <p>Clients provide standard interfaces for performing transactions and queries on streams, and are installed into applications. Clients are also responsible for authenticating users and signing transactions.</p><p>Currently there are three clients for Ceramic. Additional client implementations can easily be developed in other programming languages:</p>  JS HTTP client: A lightweight JavaScript client which connects to a remote Ceramic node over HTTP. The JS HTTP client is recommended for application developers.  JS Core client: A JavaScript client which also includes a full Ceramic node. The JS Core client is for those who want the maximum decentralization of running the full Ceramic protocol directly in a browser application.  CLI: A command line interface for interacting with a Ceramic node.   Getting started  Try Ceramic <p>To experience how Ceramic works in a browser application, try the <a href="https://playground.ceramic.dev">Playground</a> app.</p> Installation <p>Getting started with Ceramic is simple. Visit the <a>Quick Start</a> guide to learn the basics using the Ceramic CLI or follow the <a>Installation</a> page to integrate Ceramic into your project.</p> Tools and services <p>In addition to various standards referenced throughout this document, the Ceramic community has already begun developing many different open source protocols, tools, and services that simplify the experience of developing on Ceramic. Here are a few notable examples:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect:</a> A authentication SDK for browser-based applications that allows your users to transact with Ceramic using their blockchain wallet.  <a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX:</a> A protocol for decentralized identity that allows a DID to aggregate an index of all their data from across all apps in one place. IDX enables user-centric data storage, discovery, and interoperability. It is effectively a decentralized, cross-platform user table. IDX can reference all data source types, including Ceramic streams and other peer-to-peer databases and files.  <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/identitylink-services">IdentityLink:</a> A service that issues verifiable claims which prove a DID owns various other Web2 social accounts such as Twitter, Github, Discord, Discourse, Telegram, Instagram, etc. Once issued, claims are stored in the DID's IDX.  <a href="https://tiles.ceramic.community/">Tiles:</a> An explorer for the Ceramic Network.  <a href="http://documint.net/">Documint:</a> A browser-based IDE for creating and editing streams.

				 <p>iGrant.io is an SSI enabled consented data exchange platform with auditable data agreements, helping organisations unlock the value of personal data.&nbsp;In the Automated Data Agreement (ADA) project, we accelerate SSI adoption by connecting Data Agreements to a legally endorsed Data Protection Impact Analysis (DPIA), automating the flow from DPIA to SSI workflow. This ensures that any company adopting SSI for data exchange has a highly auditable solution where any data agreement receipt can be substantiated by a code of conduct to the originating DPIA performed. </p>
<p>The project aims to standardize data agreement schemas and receipts (Consent being one type of data agreement) and a component that standardizes the process and decision tree to populate the verifiable credential and remove the pain point from organisations related to data regulatory compliance. In addition, it addresses the challenges with delegated consents. <br>The key value propositions offered by the iGrant.io platform are:</p>
 
 Automated compliance, by reducing the risk of non-compliance to data regulation when it comes to personal data usage, for example by linking Data Agreements to a legally endorsed DPIA process. 
 Improved access to high quality personal data by providing transparency and empowering users to control data usage. 
 SSI enabled personal data exchange where companies can leverage personal data assets legally for advanced personalisation. 
 End-user SDKs (e.g. Data Wallets, User preference center) that can be embedded into existing mobile applications and portals. 
 
<p>As a certified MyData Operator, iGrant.io also drives interoperability via the MyData community as well as Trust-Over-iP.</p>

 And nominations are now being accepted <p>DIF was established to represent our fast changing community and to create a safe space for the co-development of next-generation code and specifications. From the original handful of members 4 years ago, the foundation has grown to become an organization with over 200 member companies, representing thousands of PRs and a strong commitment to decentralizing identity software.</p><p>Since its inception, DIF has been primarily governed by a Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is a &nbsp;group of member representatives whom lead DIF, set strategy, assure the high quality of ratified work items, react to the community’s needs, among other decisions.</p>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/@element5digital">Element5digital</a><p>Over the last year, one of the main foci of the current Steering Committee has been restructuring itself to ensure it will represent the interests and diversity of its growing membership. Among the conclusions of this analysis was that a larger steering committee would garner more trust and visibility into DIF's internal governance as an organization. An operating addendum was adopted last month which formalizes procedures for periodic elections and distribution requirements. The following repackages those policies in the form of a Frequently Asked Questions document: for further clarification, see the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/c06c17bd2df58633eb74d9d5237281c79d9b676e/Org%20documents/Membership%20agreements/DIF%20Governance%20-%20Operating%20Addendum%20-%2020210304.pdf">addendum itself</a>.</p> 
    When are the dates and deadlines for this election cycle?
<br>  Announcement of election + Nomination starts - 8th April (Thu) 
 Last day for questions to candidates - 6th May (Thu) 
 Nomination Closes - 13th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot opens - 20th May (Thu) 
 SC ballot closes - 27th May (Thu) 
 New SC first meeting - 3rd June (Thu) 
 

    Who can be nominated and by whom?
    <br><p>Any individual who is active in DIF can nominate a DIF member to the Steering Committee, and/or get nominated for the Steering Committee by someone else. We recommend nominating members of the DIF community with high visibility and recognition, whether among DIF's membership or among the wider community. Only one individual can represent each DIF member organization, and there are distribution criteria to keep the Steering Committee balanced, but those considerations are applied *after* the election. This means that multiple colleagues from the same member organization can be nominated and accept that nomination, but only one of them can sit on the Steering Committee. The DIF membership includes Associate members, Contributors, individuals who signed a Feedback Agreement, and adjacent/partner organizations referred to as Liaisons (i.e. OIDF or Hyperledger).
    </p><p><br>
Nominations should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Nomination">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address.
</p><br> 

    How and when do nominated people become candidates?<br>
    <p>Nominees will be contacted by DIF staff and must accept the nomination before the nomination period closes. Along with confirmation that they would serve if elected, they also provide a short biography and an optional statement describing their interest in and qualifications for serving on the Committee.
Early nominations are encouraged.
</p>
<br>
    How do voting members select which candidates to support?<br>
    <p>DIF Staff will share this list of accepting nominees and their statements with the membership via Slack. Since all Associate Members are eligible for one vote, it is recommended that colleagues within one member company confer or discuss in backchannel before submitting a vote on behalf of their whole company.</p>
<br>
    How can interested DIF members ask questions of all the candidates to help them decide?<br>
    <p>    
    If there are specific issues of interest to all or most of the DIF membership, any DIF member (whether they work at an Associate Member organization or not) may send clear questions to DIF staff.  Nominees should send these questions to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Questions_for_the_candidates">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address, and a representative cross-section of these (lightly edited or unedited) will be compiled into a document sent to all nominees.
</p>
<br>
    Who votes and how?<br>
    <p>Only associate members can vote, and each votes as a whole on one ballot. This too is done as via email: ballots should be sent to the <a href="mailto:nominations@REMOVETHISidentity.foundation?subject=Ballot_for_NAME_OF_MEMBER_ORGANIZATION">nominations at identity.foundation</a> email address. These will be audited confidentially and not published in any way (not even as tallies). If one member organization accidentally votes more than once, DIF staff will reply to the emails to clarify the issue, so please use a monitored/normal email address in the organization's domain rather an personal accounts or "alts". All ballots are assumed to be collective/company-wide decisions even if multiple are received.</p>
<br>
    How many candidates can each associate member vote for?<br>
    <p>Each ballot should contain between 0 and X names, where X is the number of open seats.  Most elections, X should be between 4 and 6.  If less than X are named, the rest of the organization's votes are forfeited-- each vote counts singly.</p>
<br>
    When is the actual election period?<br>
    <p>DIF elections run for one week, from the distribution of the final list of candidates to one week later at midnight EST. In this election, those dates will be Thursday 20 May and Thursday 27 May, respectively. In the weeks leading up to 20 May, DIF staff will also contact all associate members to clarify any questions about the process and confirm the dates, the number of seats, the nominee statements, etc.</p>
<br>
    How often will the Steering Committee elections take place?<br>
    <p>They are expected to be annual, with 2-year terms to preserve continuity across elections.  If seats are unexpectedly made available between elections, they will stay open until the next election.</p>

Der Artikel ist auch auf <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/testing-self-sovereign-identity-with-the-lissi-demo-854e73d05aad">englisch</a> verfügbar.</p><p>Lissi bietet Institutionen und Endnutzern Software Anwendungen zum Austausch vertrauenswürdiger Informationen mit maximaler Datensouveränität. Wir bieten eine Demonstration für das <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS </a>/ <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">Android</a>) an, mit welcher du den Ablauf des Empfangens von Nachweisen und der Beantwortung von Informationsanfragen ausprobieren kannst.</p><p>Du kannst die <a href="https://lissi.id/demo">Demonstration hier testen</a>. Die Demo kann entweder auf dem Smartphone oder in einem Desktop-Browser am Computer geöffnet werden. Wir empfehlen die Verwendung des Lissi Wallets für ein optimales Erlebnis, die Demo funktioniert aber auch mit anderen kompatiblen Wallets.</p><p>Die Demo enthält verschiedene Anwendungsfälle, um eine mögliche Nutzererfahrung zu veranschaulichen. Die Anwendungsfälle sind an das Demo-Setup angepasst, d.h. in einem realen Szenario können je nach Anwendungsfall zusätzliche Schritte notwendig sein.</p> Anwendungsfall 1: Online Ausweis (eID — elektronische Identifikation) Erhalte deinen digitalen Ausweis.<p>Im ersten Schritt erhältst du deinen Online-Ausweis. Dieser Ausweis wird dir von einem Bürgeramt ausgestellt. Stelle dir vor, dass du in diesem Bürgeramt bist und dich vor Ort ausweist. Du kannst diesen Ausweis auch über die eID-Funktion deines Personalausweises erhalten und deine Daten direkt digital via NFC auslesen ohne beim Amt vor Ort zu&nbsp;sein.</p> Anwendungsfall 2: Kreditkarte Erhalte eine Kreditkarte von deiner&nbsp;Bank.<p>Sobald du dein Online Ausweis in deinem Wallet hast, kannst du diesen verwenden, um eine Kreditkarte zu erhalten. Eine Kreditkarte kannst du ganz einfach als Neukunde bei einer Bank beantragen. Die Karte wird dir zur Verfügung gestellt, sobald du deine Daten freigegeben hast, welches ein notwendiger regulatorischer Schritt ist. Die beantworte Informationsanfrage ersetzt z.B das Video- oder Postident-Verfahren.</p> Anwendungsfall 3: Hotel-Check-in Erlebe den schnellen und kontaktlosen check-in bei einem&nbsp;Hotel.<p>Du möchtest einen digitalen Check-in für deinen Hotelaufenthalt durchführen. Du kannst einfach deine persönlichen Daten sowie eine Zahlungsoption angeben, um deine Zimmerkarte zu erhalten. Einfach und unkompliziert!</p> Anwendungsfall 4: Einschreibung als Student und Kurszertifikate Einschreibung als Student und Kurszertifikate.<p>Du hast die Schule erfolgreich abgeschlossen und möchtest Dich nun bei einer Universität einschreiben. Du kannst deine Base-ID und Telefonnummer nutzen, um der Universität die notwendigen Informationen bereitzustellen.</p><p>Wir hoffen, dass die Demonstration hilft das Nutzererlebnis und die Interaktionen in einem digitalen Identitäts-Ökosystem wie <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a> besser zu verstehen. Die genauen Umstände und das erforderliche Sicherheitsniveau ist vom jeweiligen Anwendungsfall abhängig und kann stark variieren. Regulierte Anwendungsfälle haben gesetzliche Vorgaben bezüglich des benötigten Vertrauensniveaus. Das Lissi Team ist mit Vertrauensdienste-Anbietern, Behörden, Kommunen, Ämtern, Verbänden und sonstigen Parteien im Gespräch um alle notwendigen Bedingungen zu erfüllen und dir das beste Nutzererlebnis zu ermöglichen.</p><p>Wir würden gerne dein Feedback hören!

It is also available in&nbsp;<a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/teste-die-selbstbestimmte-identit%C3%A4t-mit-der-lissi-demo-98fd49b383a2">German</a>.</p><p>Lissi provides institutions and end-users with software to exchange trusted information while having maximal data sovereignty. We now offer a demonstration for the Lissi Wallet, which enables you to experience the user flow of receiving credentials and answering information requests.</p><p>You can find the demonstration on <a href="https://lissi.id/demo">www.lissi.id/demo</a>. You can either open the demo on your phone or on a desktop browser. While we recommend using the <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi Wallet</a> (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta">Android</a>) for an optimal experience, the demo also works with other compatible wallets.</p><p>The demo contains different example use-cases to illustrate a potential user journey. The use cases are adjusted to the demonstration setup, meaning that in a real scenario there might be additional steps necessary depending on the use case at question.</p> Use case 1: Base-ID (eID — electronic Identification) Get your&nbsp;Base-ID<p>In the first step, you get your Base-ID. This credential is issued to you from a municipal office&nbsp;. Imagine you are in this municipal office and show your physical ID card first. You could also get this credential by using the eID function of your pass and directly and digitally extract it via NFC from your eID-Card.</p> Use case 2: Credit&nbsp;Card Get your digital credit card from your&nbsp;bank.<p>Once you got your Base-ID in your wallet, you can use it to get a credit card. You can easily request a credit card as a new customer of a consumer bank. You will be provided with the card once you shared your data, which is a necessary step from a regulatory perspective.</p> Use case 3: Hotel&nbsp;check-in Check-in to you favourite hotel.<p>You want to do a digital check-in for your hotel stay. You can easily present your personal information as well as a payment option to get your room&nbsp;card.</p> Use case 4: Apply for a university and get a course certificate Apply for a university and get a course certificate.<p>You have successfully completed school and now want to enrol at a university. You can use your Base-ID and phone number to provide the university with the necessary information.</p><p>We are convinced this demonstrated user flow can help to better understand the interactions in a digital identity ecosystem such as <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion</a>. The exact circumstances are always dependent on the use case at hand and might vary regarding their required level of assurance, which is a standardised measure to determine the trust you can allocate to the information presented to you. Regulated use cases have legal requirements regarding the level of trust needed. The Lissi team is in discussion with trust service providers, authorities, municipalities, agencies, associations and other relevant stakeholders to meet all the necessary requirements and provide you with the best user experience.</p><p>We would love to hear your feedback.

<p></p>     <p>Dallas, TX (April 8, 2021) – The Texas Blockchain Council welcomes its newest member, <a href="http://www.bonifii.com">Bonifii</a>, an industry leader in privacy- and security-enhanced digital identity solutions for credit unions.</p>
<p>The Texas Blockchain Council’s mission is to promote blockchain technology initiatives that drive growth and benefit the citizens of Texas.&nbsp; With the influence of their members, the Council advocates for blockchain-centric public policies, to educate members of government about the benefits of blockchain and provide subject-matter expertise on topics related to blockchain, virtual currency, and distributed ledger technology.</p>
<p>“We are excited to contribute to the Council’s efforts in advancing the understanding, use and practical application benefits of blockchain/distributed ledger and digital identity technology to Texas legislators from our experiences in working with the credit union industry,” said John Ainsworth, President and CEO of Bonifii.</p>
<p>Bonifii’s flagship product, MemberPass(R), enables the exchange of verifiable credentials between credit union customers and branches, leveraging a combination of distributed ledger, biometrics and cryptography to protect credit unions’ consumer and small business members.&nbsp; MemberPass is a digital passport that allows members convenient access to their financial accounts while providing control over and privacy of their personal information.</p>
<p>Natalie Smolenski, Chair of the Digital Identity Committee for the Texas Blockchain Council, said, “Blockchain technology provides a new infrastructure for digital identity that decentralizes the ownership and verification of claims. Organizations like Bonifii have been at the forefront of bringing these technologies to market in the financial sector. We are pleased to collaborate with Bonifii to reimagine the future of digital identity in Texas.”</p>

 An Open Letter to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Advocating for Financial Inclusion in its Regulations <p>April 7,&nbsp;2021</p><p>On December 23, 2020, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Treasury Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/15/2021-01016/requirements-for-certain-transactions-involving-convertible-virtual-currency-or-digital-assets">Requirements for banks and money services businesses</a>” related to certain transactions involving convertible virtual currency (CVC) or digital assets with legal tender status (“legal tender digital assets” or LTDA). FinCEN is identifying additional statutory authority for the proposed rule under the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, providing additional information regarding the reporting form, and reopening the comment period for the proposal.</p><p>The<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0EAHbtr2GFDoK7_WlbrOJO1p8rUv9HrKCFBsPdnaUo/edit"> Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a> took the opportunity to submit its formal response to FinCEN on March 29, 2021 — focusing explicitly on how their proposed rules will impact financial inclusion.</p><p>Sovrin Foundation asked Amit Sharma, Chair of the Sovrin CIFWG, to tell us more about the potential impact of the NPRM, their response and recommendations to&nbsp;FinCEN.</p><p>Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the Sovrin CIFWG? What’s your mission and who are your group&nbsp;members?</p><p>The purpose of the Sovrin CIFWG is to advance the mission of financial inclusion globally, by addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by innovations in the financial services and payments landscape, and the attendant financial and regulatory compliance implications. We are an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts who monitor the challenges faced by the financially excluded and under-served. CIFWG focuses on how economic and regulatory technologies can bridge the gap between traditional banking compliance and associated risks injected by innovation. We have developed and been actively promoting the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SswHBZ1pwuIUcePeFe8czOoAOaHE78ij4okXuQq5OW0/edit">Sovrin Compliance and Inclusive Finance Rulebook</a>, an innovative best practices framework that extends traditional banking compliance and payments guidance to emerging fintech and virtual asset service providers (VASP) processes.</p><p>Q: What do you mean by global financial inclusion, and why is it important?</p><p>Global financial inclusion remains a desirable and necessary development goal — 1.7 billion adults lack a bank account[1], and millions more have limited or no access to traditional financial services around the world. Furthermore, “de-risking” — the efforts of financial institutions to terminate or restrict relationships of certain clients and customers — has continued to be amplified by the continued growth of global anti-money laundry (AML) / counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls[2]. The result is a disproportionate impact for the financially under-served, the global poor, and institutions and sectors that provide services to these segments of the economy. The attendant consequences of financial exclusion cannot be overstated given that remittances from migrant workers alone total over $500 billion a year (three to four times foreign aid) and is a vital source of finance for poor countries.</p><p>Q: What is the NPRM regarding “Requirements for banks and money services businesses” proposed by FinCEN&nbsp;about?</p><p>The December NPRM proposed to address the threat of illicit finance with respect to certain transactions involving CVC or LTDA by (a) establishing new reporting requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions analogous to existing currency transaction reports, and (b) establishing new record keeping requirements for certain CVC or LTDA transactions that is similar to the record keeping and travel rule regulations pertaining to funds transfers and transmittal of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>On January 1, 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (Division F of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/116/public/283?link-type=html">Pub. L. 116–283</a>) (“AML Act of 2020”) became law. FinCEN proposed that by regulation, CVC and LTDA are monetary instruments because they are “similar material” to “coins and currency of a foreign country, travelers checks, bearer negotiable instruments, bearer investment securities, bearer securities, [and] stock on which title is passed on delivery[3].”</p><p>Q: What do you think about the NPRM? How does it impact the fintech sector and its key stakeholders?</p><p>We believe combating illicit finance activities is necessary and a top priority for FinCEN. But efforts to serve both law enforcement equities and financial inclusion do not present a binary choice. An effective anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime should also prioritize increased engagement of financially underserved, de-risked and/or excluded parties to foster a financial system that provides enhanced participation, greater transparency, and innovation in domestic financial systems.</p><p>Further, the data on illicit finance risks in the CVC sector don’t necessarily support the need for the proposed rule changes which are motivated to strengthen law enforcement and regulatory oversight efforts. According to a recently released report by Chainalysis, illicit activities or crime related to virtual assets has continued to decline, with the illicit share of cryptocurrency activity falling to just 0.34% in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Importantly within the data analyzed by Chainalysis, the concentration of illicit activities has shown to be primarily with a “small group of shady cryptocurrency services, mostly operating on top of large exchanges, [who] conduct most of the money laundering that cybercriminals rely on to make cryptocurrency-based crime profitable[4].” This data would seem to call for more targeted efforts by law enforcement to concentrate investigations of criminals by identifying owners of these deposit addresses and the organizations that are conducting deliberate money laundering operations at scale (among otherwise legitimate activities).</p><p>As such, we are concerned with the proposed rules as they impact a growing sector that is increasingly providing solutions to marginalized and financially excluded constituencies. Also, organizations operating in CVCs, including fintech companies, virtual asset services providers (VASPs), and other similar organizations may fall under the broader definition of nonbank financial institutions or money services businesses/money transfer operators (MSBs/MTOs) that already face enormous scrutiny by mainstream financial institutions when evaluating their respective risks related to onboarding into new accounts. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) itself has acknowledged the fact of de-risking disproportionately impacting certain sectors like MSBs/MTOs[5].</p><p>Q: What is the role of the CVC services in regards to global financial inclusion, and how secure are&nbsp;they?</p><p>As CVC services continue to evolve and grow, so do the applications and opportunities inherent in facilitating greater inclusion of underserved and marginalized communities and organizations into the global financial ecosystems. As such, self-hosted wallets are playing an increasingly important role with virtual assets, as global financial operations continue to be unbundled, and an ongoing trend toward de-centralized financial services continues unabated[6].</p><p>Self-hosted wallets enable anyone with an internet connection to transact with others in digital assets on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis. Additionally, these wallets can be used to store value or digital assets securely and provide capability for the user/consumer to hold resources personally that enable them to interact in the fiat and digital financial context. This enables consumers to transact with counterparties directly without the need for a third-party intermediary–similar to making a cash transaction for a purchase of a good, pay an expense, or transfer value to a friend or family&nbsp;member.</p><p>When combined with blockchain technology, P2P transactions are arguably more secure and more transparent than activities undertaken in cash, as the convenience of cash and the efficiencies that come with electronic payments are combined with the risk controls associated with pseudonymous transactions that are not otherwise dependent on a specific financial intermediary[7].</p><p>Q: In sum, what are your recommendations to FinCEN regarding the&nbsp;NPRM?</p><p>We really appreciated the opportunity to comment on the NPRM. We believe that any proposed rule should explicitly include a thorough assessment of the threats to financial inclusion that may come about with such a proposal, and the Agencies should consider the concerns outlined in the response in our letter as part of such an assessment.</p><p>Secondly, increased targeted enforcement and requirements for transaction monitoring would strengthen law enforcement regulatory intentions with the proposed rules vs a more wholesale application of record keeping and reporting for related to all noncustodial wallet holders and their activities. In short, a smaller group of actors are engaged in such activity, and enforcement and regulatory measures should be better targeted to them vs the industry as a whole — especially in light of the financial exclusion implications of such proposed&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Strengthening financial inclusion, including by encouraging innovation in the financial services arena with technology applications that extend beyond existing banking and payments systems can actually provide enhanced security, risk and compliance controls, while bringing greater opportunities to marginalized and otherwise financially underserved or excluded communities. The underlying technologies include:</p>  The facilitation of cross-border remittances via P2P and blockchain networks that provide efficiency, cost advantages and security;  The enhanced auditability and traceability of transactions conducted via these applications that better enable financial services regulators and law enforcement interests; and  The application of digital and sovereign identity management capabilities that strengthen know-your-customers processes and customer information programs while preserving the essential privacy protections inherent in financial services.  <p>We welcome follow up with Agencies and participating members that are interested in providing guidance, examples and use cases of inclusion efforts — including the application of self-hosted/un-hosted wallets in particular.</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;Amit!</p><p>Anyone can download the full letter <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvQOHN9LeyoLAZFMgpYENLUXhYZaWClK/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<p>By: FIDO Alliance staff</p>



<p>A major milestone has been realized, with the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI-Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) becoming the first organization to the achieve the Certified Authenticator Level 3+ level, which is the highest level of validation currently offered by the FIDO Alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The path toward the Level 3+ designation has been several years in the making.</p>



<p>Dr. Rae Rivera, Certification Director for the FIDO Alliance explained that the Certified Authenticator program was originally launched in August 2018 in a bid to define greater levels of assurance for FIDO authenticators. She noted that the FIDO Specifications include an inherent amount of security and privacy. The goal with the Certified Authenticator program is to provide additional security assurances for the authenticators themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the first Certified Authenticator Level 3+ designation now granted, Rivera expects other organizations will follow, helping to improve strong authentication for users and organizations around the world.</p>



<p>“We’re continuing to see more pickup and uptake in the Certified Authenticator program,” Rivera said. “At each higher level, there’s less risk of a vulnerability.”</p>



<p>Understanding the Different Certified Authenticator Levels</p>



<p>There are three core levels (L1, L2, L3 and ) in the Certified Authenticator program with each level building on the requirements of the preceding level. Incremental additional assurance can be obtained to allow a vendor to achieve a “+” within each level (L1+, L2+, L3+).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program evaluates authenticators to answer the question ‘how well does the authenticator protect the private key?The most basic entry level is L1 which Rivera said a vendor can achieve by supporting and implementing the FIDO specifications. An authenticator certified at L1 provides protection against phishing and credential abuse.</p>



<p>Moving up to L2, Rivera noted that restricted operating environments are required to protect against malware attacks. When you get to L3 and L3+, Rivera said that it’s all about looking at hardware authenticators, and how they provide protection against brute force attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the core attributes of our higher level programs, specifically level three and three plus, is that they require the product to have what we call a companion program certification,” Rivera said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She noted that the companion program certification that has been defined for those higher levels is <a href="https://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/">Common Criteria</a> &nbsp;which provides sets of evaluations and designations to help define the security posture for a given device or service.</p>



<p>“The higher level that you go, the less vulnerable the authenticator is to any kind of attack,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Why the Level 3+ Certification is Significant</p>



<p>With BSI now certified at L3+ the door is open to others to follow the same path toward the highest level of security assurance.</p>



<p>“Personally I feel like this is a huge leap forward for the program,” Rivera said.</p>



<p>Rivera noted that to date there have been many products that have been certified at the lower levels of the Certified Authenticator program. Now that the first L3+ has been achieved she anticipates that there will be more interest from organizations to go through the program to gain that additional higher level of assurance.</p>



<p>“This certification clearly demonstrates the value of our certified authenticator program – particularly at the higher levels,” she said. “Government and regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, energy and education often have more sensitive use cases that require specific types of authentication into their networks. Vendors and relying parties in these markets see this as a benefit because it meets the need for hardware protection and is also Common Criteria certified.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How Others Can Benefit from the First Level 3+ Certification</p>



<p>Now that BSI has hit the Level 3+ certification, there is now quite literally a path for others to follow.</p>



<p>Rivera explained that with the L3+ certification there is a protection profile associated with it. The protection profile contains all the components that are used to achieve the L3+. As such, another vendor could utilize the protection profile to develop their product to get certified at the higher level.</p>



<p>“The protection profile serves as good guidance for those that are seeking the higher levels as to what they need to do and what modifications they need to make to their implementation,” Rivera said. “BSI getting certified at Level 3+ has made it a little easier for others to start achieving this level.”</p>

<p>Introducing the new Executive Director for Digital Identity NZ and formally farewelling Andrew Weaver as the outgoing Executive Director.&nbsp;<br><br>We are excited to announce that Michael Murphy joins us as the new Executive Director for DINZ. With a wide and diverse background, Michael is active in the investment and startup communities along with business mentoring.&nbsp;He had some early involvement in the Digital Identity Forum, the precursor to DINZ and so joins us with a broad understanding of the importance of digital identity in furthering a trust based economy and society.<br><br>Over the next few months Michael will be connecting with our members and stakeholders to better understand what people need and desire from the work of Digital Identity NZ and from the wider ecosystem activity, including the Trust Framework development being led by DIA.&nbsp;Please do make Michael feel welcome as he appears in various events in the near future.</p>



  



 Executive Director – Michael Murphy 



<p>Across several roles, Michael is focused on helping Aotearoa’s best and boldest entrepreneurs in creating truly world-class companies that will employ coming generations of Kiwis and underpin the economic and social development of our country.&nbsp;<br><br>As Executive Director at Digital Identity New Zealand, Michael sees trust and digital identity as being at the very heart of how people, communities, businesses and economies will thrive and prosper in a future driven by disruptive innovation.&nbsp;He is highly motivated to explore how the many threads of digital identity and trust can be most effectively woven together to create the firm foundations needed for the development of a truly trust based economy in Aotearoa, for the benefit of us all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his other roles as investor, director, advisor and mentor, Michael works with globally ambitious start-up and early-stage ventures as well as more established businesses, looking to innovate and adopt a more exponential mindset to drive their growth. Working across both groups, cross pollinating ideas and methods, is where Michael is most energised: bringing experience and disciplined entrepreneurship to early stage ventures and helping more mature businesses explore the opportunities for growth and manage the risks presented by these massively disruptive times.</p>

<p>By Beth Kanter, Chief Advocacy &amp; Strategic Communications Officer</p><p>For many women, March symbolizes more than just a month of observance. It’s a time where women across all industries and geographies celebrate the achievements of their peers and colleagues today and take a critical look at the opportunities they’re creating for young women just entering the workforce. It’s also a chance for us to celebrate the historic achievements of the pioneering women that came before us. At Omidyar Network, we’re constantly working to create a culture and world where all women have equitable access to the systems and powers that govern our daily&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Like many, I was inspired to do this work by the first woman in my life — my mother. My commitment to social justice was developed while watching her work as a special education teacher for more than 30 years. As an educator, she worked passionately to support and empower students who were often marginalized because of their race, class, or learning abilities. As an active member of her union, she understood why it was critical for people to have power and voice in the workplace. She taught me the importance of being engaged in my community and how to live my values and support my community through politics — one of my first memories is stuffing envelopes for our neighbor who was running for the Montgomery County Council and reading her NOW newsletter.</p><p>After her sudden death in 2000, I’ve always wondered what she would think of some of the unfortunate events the country has endured over the years. Part of me is relieved that she did not have to witness the horrors of 9/11, the recession, and the pandemic. On the other hand, I think she would have been amazed to see the remarkable women who have trailblazed their way through the world by challenging the status quo, reimaging what’s possible, and ensuring equality for the leaders of the future. My mom, along with other women before me, would have beamed with pride to bear witness to the accomplishments of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and most recently, Vice President Kamala&nbsp;Harris.</p><p>I am constantly awed and inspired by the incredible women grantees we work with at Omidyar Network who are shaping a new inclusive economy, ensuring a responsible tech ecosystem, and positively impacting our society. We have the honor to work with a powerhouse team of women leaders such&nbsp;as:</p>  Ifeoma Ozoma with Earthseed who’s taking on the role of Big Tech as a brave whistleblower at Pinterest, holding the company to account for racial bias and inequality;  Lisa Donner from <a href="https://ourfinancialsecurity.org">Americans for Financial Reform</a> who’s working to reimagine our economic system by way of representation and ensuring equality; and  Solana Rice from <a href="https://www.liberationinageneration.org">Liberation in a Generation</a> who’s providing equitable access to communities for meaningful social&nbsp;change.  <p>Click <a href="https://twitter.com/OmidyarNetwork">here</a> for a look at how we’ve highlighted our grantees for our Women’s History Month campaign!</p><p>I feel an obligation and a great sense of joy to carry out the legacy built by these women, my mother, and many others, through the work Omidyar Network does every day. We’re committed to showing up for each other and addressing all instances of biases and inequality. I see so much of what my mother believed in and stood for in Omidyar Network’s mission and through our phenomenal team of women grantees, including:</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/legacy-community-and-equity-reflecting-on-womens-history-month-9ac5c5edff80">Legacy, Community, and Equity: Reflecting on Women’s History Month</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Drilling down: Co-development <p>Competitors working together in the&nbsp;open</p><p>Having gone over the subtleties and complexities of <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c61c55cdec30169ea99471b9bd09e81b">open-source software</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495?source=friends_link&amp;sk=971c11824b0023758c34114cffc6c339">open standards</a> in general, we will now drill down into how exactly DIF advances both, in the form of a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) document. Topics covered&nbsp;include:</p>  What “standardization” means to DIF and what DIF means to standardization.  A newbie-friendly survey of how DIF relates to nearby organizations with overlapping or related&nbsp;foci.  What “co-development” and “coöpetition” really mean, concretely  <p>The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>We can start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations. Click on the image below to download a clickable PDF&nbsp;file.</p><a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/ssi-architectural-stack--and--community-efforts-overview.pdf"></a>Src: E.D. Rouven Heck 2019, updated by Interoperability Working Group,&nbsp;2020 What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization.</p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through&nbsp;OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening.</p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation.</p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working&nbsp;groups.</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”.</p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.”</p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the&nbsp;group.</blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development — patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to&nbsp;market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or&nbsp;not.</p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further&nbsp;down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape! In our next piece, we’ll sketch out how you can get strategic about open source, roll up your sleeves, and get your hands dirty at&nbsp;DIF.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-co-development-in-the-open-765a86ab153f">Drilling Down: [Co-]Development in the Open</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Berkman Klein Center event explores how technology factors into pandemic&nbsp;response Kendra Albert, Tanya Cooper, Roslyn Satchel, and Thema Bryant-Davis during a Berkman Klein Center event on “Marginalized Women, Technology, COVID-19, and Intimate Partner Violence.” Screenshot by Lydia Rosenberg.<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has upended myriad aspects of everyday life, from education to the economy to interpersonal relationships. For victims and survivors of intimate partner violence, the many struggles of escaping or finding support are particularly exacerbated by the pandemic. An <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">event</a> hosted by the Berkman Klein Center explored how technology factors into this problem — how it can help, and how it can&nbsp;harm.</p><p>Moderated by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/roslyn-satchel">Roslyn Satchel</a>, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center and the Blanche Seaver Professor of Communication at Pepperdine, the event convened an interdisciplinary group of scholars to discuss various issues surrounding intimate partner violence, particularly for marginalized women, during the pandemic. The discussion covered fostering safe spaces online, access to resources, and navigating the legal system during the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://gsep.pepperdine.edu/about/our-people/faculty/thema-bryant-davis/">Thema Bryant-Davis</a>, an associate professor of psychology at Pepperdine University, and director of the Culture and Trauma Research Lab, spoke about coping with trauma and supporting victims and survivors.</p><p>“The reality is that COVID-19 has also increased the risk of intimate partner violence when we see the large number of people who are practicing physical distancing and social distancing. There has been less of a buffer, less of an opportunity to come outside of the home and to seek services. And so we are mindful of the urgency of this work, as well as the additional barriers that make help-seeking difficult,” Bryant-Davis said.</p><p>“Part of what we are mindful of in the midst of COVID is the need for technology to be utilized in order to reach survivors and in order to protect survivors and help us to heal and restore,” Bryant-Davis said. “Many clinicians like me are currently practicing telehealth solely, so working with people in their healing journey by phone and by Internet which has benefits and challenges.” She pointed to easier access to resources not requiring travel, but also the dangers of sharing spaces with&nbsp;abusers.</p><p><a href="https://law.pepperdine.edu/faculty-research/tanya-asim-cooper/">Tanya Asim Cooper</a>, associate clinical professor of law and director of the Restoration and Justice Clinic, shared her experience working with victims of intimate partner victims from a legal perspective and illustrated her work through a case&nbsp;study.</p><p>“Studies show racial disparities in domestic violence for victims of color, predominantly women and they are in the greatest danger,” she said. “From my experience and based on my research, victims of color generally are perceived as less credible victims, suffer more serious violence, and require more concrete evidence of abuse, especially physical violence. They need photographs, they need not just medical records, they need medical professional live testimony.”</p><p>These demands are hard for people to meet — especially during the pandemic, with courts closing and forcing victims to wait. Cooper described how her clinic transferred their work online, but how she worries about people lacking technological skills or access to the internet.</p><p>“If law enforcement and courts can’t or won’t assist, especially during the pandemic, let’s equip faith communities and other online communities where marginalized women go, and let’s equip them to help,” she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Several event participants mentioned the idea of fostering online communities and safe digital spaces during the event. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Kendra Albert</a>, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, prompted the panel to question some of the values embedded in technologies and online tools and how those can be challenged in the intimate partner violence&nbsp;context.</p><p>As examples, Albert cited how phone companies may provide data about recently contacted phone numbers because “insiders are assumed to be safe.” Albert also pointed to Facebook’s “People You May Know” feature as a tool that has been shown to suggest mutual friends but that may expose degrees of connection that should remain private, such as therapist relationships “It’s just one example of these technologies that are often built on the assumption that more connection is better, that Facebook wants to connect to all of us or thinking about sharing as a net good, while not considering the very real reasons that people’s sharing or engagement with these platforms might be deeply contextual and they may have concerns about this information getting shared more broadly,” Albert&nbsp;said.</p><p>Although these contexts and situations are often not considered when developing such technology or their values, marginalized people are able to adapt the technologies to their circumstances, circumventing the intended uses and norms, Albert&nbsp;added.</p><p>“The reality is marginalized folks have been using, thriving, and changing technologies that were built without them in mind forever, for as long as we’ve had technologies,” they said. “And that we can think of examples of marginalized folks innovating and actually driving these technologies forward as the things that create change and in some cases, create money for these platforms. So I think while still keeping in mind that domestic violence victims and survivors, especially domestic violence victims and survivors that are women of color, Black and brown women could be much better served by these platforms and that their needs for contextual controls and control over one’s information.”</p><p>Towards the end of the conversation, Satchel drew connections between the speakers; she highlighted the theme of safety and security and acknowledged that the event is continuing an important conversation about centering the experiences of marginalized people and the value of cross-disciplinary discourse.</p><p>“This question of safety and security is really animating the very core of this discussion. And as a communication ethicist, as a person who actually studies communication in a variety of contexts, I really value interdisciplinarity. Why? Because it allows for conversations like this to happen,” she said. “The beauty is that we’re coming back to a common core, marginalized women. Women who are marginalized by race, socioeconomic status, ability, gender, sexual orientation, language, ethnicity, immigration status, and many more caste markers have very unique experiences, unique experiences that may very well cause them to call for different solutions and different options for justice.”</p><p>A podcast version of the event is available <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/events/marginalized-women-technology-covid-19-and-intimate-partner-violence">here</a>.

<p>Recognition of the value of FIDO in European digital identity systems and eIDAS continues to grow.&nbsp; This month has featured two new updates in Europe on the FIDO front: the release of a landmark ENISA report that discusses the role FIDO2 plays in eIDAS, and the accreditation by the Czech government of a new eID solution using FIDO2.</p>



<p>In March 2021, the EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) issued the report <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-report-remote-id-proofing">Remote ID Proofing</a>, which describes the current regulatory landscape and supporting standards for the European countries’ remote identity proofing laws, regulations and practices. ENISA’s report is based on the ETSI TR 119 460 and ETSI TS 119 461 documents, which describe the policies and practices for remote identity proofing among trust service providers in the EU. Especially the eIDAS regulation, the AMLD5 directive to prevent money laundering, and EU directives on issuing ID-cards and exchanging identity information have been taken into account from a legal perspective.</p>



<p>Several methods for remote identification are proposed in the ENISA report: video recorded sessions, identification based on eID schemes or electronic signatures, bank identification, scanning of existing ID-cards, or a combination of several methods. In particular the option to identify a user with an eID scheme is of interest from a FIDO perspective. The following statement is written in section “2.2.4 Electronic identification means” of the ENISA report:</p>



<blockquote><p>“A protocol used by several electronic identity means providers is OpenID connect. It is an authentication layer on top of OAuth 2.0 and is specified by the OpenID foundation. This protocol allows to verify the identity of the applicant based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, and by obtaining basic information about the applicant. Another technology that can be used in eID solutions is FIDO2. The FIDO Alliance explains in a <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FIDO_Using-FIDO-with-eIDAS-Services-White-Paper.pdf">whitepaper</a> how FIDO2 can be used for eID means corresponding to eIDAS article 8.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In the very same month, the Czech ministry of interior <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/e-podpis-povinne-zverejnovane-informace-oznameni-o-udeleni-akreditace-pro-spravu-kvalifikovaneho-systemu-elektronicke-identifikace-poskytovatel-cz-nic-z-s-p-o.aspx">issued eIDAS accreditation</a> for the Czech domain registry CZ.NIC, meaning that their identity provider mojeID can deploy FIDO2 as an eID scheme at eIDAS level of assurance High under the following conditions:</p>



  The FIDO2 authenticator is FIDO certified at Level 2 (or higher)  The FIDO2 authenticator is based on a secure element that is certified at FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or Common Criteria EAL4 + AVA_VAN.5  The FIDO2 authenticator has a PIN set and the PIN is required for all transactions at level of assurance High  Username and password are used in conjunction with FIDO2  



<p>Both ENISA’s report on remote identity proofing and the official approval of CZ.NIC’s FIDO-based eID scheme are great examples of how FIDO has been recognized as a viable authentication protocol for eIDAS compliant eID schemes in the EU.</p>

<p></p><p>Having gone over the subtleties and complexities of <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-source-f50d1a4f2a76?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c61c55cdec30169ea99471b9bd09e81b">open-source software</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/drilling-down-open-standards-e745d84d0495?source=friends_link&amp;sk=971c11824b0023758c34114cffc6c339">open standards</a> in general, we will now drill down into how exactly DIF advances both, in the form of a “Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ) document. In this FAQ, we'll cover what co-development means in general, at DIF, beyond DIF, and in legal terms. The next installment in this series will offer some concrete steps that a DIF member organization (or even a non-member organization) can take to roll up their sleeves and get involved.</p><p>Let's start with this 2020 diagram of how specific specifications fit in the landscape of open-source and open-standards organizations. &nbsp;Click on the image below to download a clickable PDF file.</p> What is DIF’s role in “standardizing” decentralized identity? <p>The governance of the decentralized identity standards space is, by design, decentralized: many different complementary organizations make steady, focused progress on specifications and codebases. In these coextensive communities, each garners consensus and buy-in for a focused set of data models and protocols with overlapping scopes and functions. Claiming the mantle of central authority for decentralization would be a pyrrhic victory for any Standards Development Organization (SDO).</p><p>Having been founded as a joint development project, DIF’s guiding mission is to effect harmonization, interoperability, and usability among early adopters, growing rather than controlling the development community. This nurtures healthy competition in the market growing around these &nbsp;technologies and provides a space for competitors to work together openly but safely, balancing “code-first” open source approaches and “standards-first” or protocol-driven ones. Allowing any single standards body (even DIF itself) to set the tone for all of decentralized identity or speak on its behalf would run counter to this mission.</p><p>Instead, the DIF exists to support, promote and facilitate two processes that seem to contradict each other at first blush. On the one hand, DIF accelerates the advance of standards and pre-standard specifications and libraries for emerging, decentralized identity systems. &nbsp;On the other hand, DIF strives to decentralize the landscape of identity technology and encourage new forms of data governance, new business models, and meaningful competition in our corner of the sector. </p><p>We unite these two processes with a pragmatic, considered, and adoption-ready strategy that is grounded in cooperation with external stakeholders and adjacent organizations. Most of these focus more squarely on technical standards or industry coordination and development, or some narrower set of technologies or protocols; decentralizing identity requires a both/and approach, which is deeply encoded in the DNA of DIF as an organization. </p> Who are the other major organizations in decentralized identity? <p>Of the various standards development organizations with which DIF cooperates closely, the World-Wide Web Consortium clearly has pride of place. The core specifications of decentralized identity were incubated there. The verifiable credential <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">specification</a> was ratified (or in W3C parlance, moved to “candidate recommendation” status) over a year ago, and the decentralized identifier <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">specification</a> joined it <a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizedID/status/1372480031184842753">two weeks ago</a>. As its name would imply, the WWW consortium is squarely focused on the standards structuring the WWW: browsers, cookies, web servers, and other “agents” in the topology of public web browsing.</p><p>Many important standards and specifications for data formats outside of the web problem space take place at the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>), particularly around data representations, transports, and security engineering. This includes many primitives and building blocks of modern programming, like JSON representations, cryptographic primitives, and universal tokens and authentication standards, usage of which extends far beyond the public web. There is a traditional division of labor according to which the web’s data models are standardized at W3C and its protocols are standardized in the IETF, leading to a kind of odd-couple dynamic whereby two very different cultures have grown up around these specialties.</p><p>Another major site of coordination for primitives and building blocks is the more constitutively open-source-focused Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS</a>). Originally a governance group for XML and the earliest forms of what we now call “Big Data”, OASIS saw its purview and power extended when various global trade and messaging standards were built extending XML. To this day, the Open Office document standards and much of the open-source tooling for PDF, DITA, and other non-proprietary document standards are still governed and advanced through OASIS.</p><p>DIF supports decentralized identity by incubating and co-developing prototypes and specifications, some of which are handed off to these more deliberative organizations for formal review and standardization where appropriate. Importantly, though, not all “pre-standards” work has as its goal a standardized or universalized version of that work. In many cases, a specification that was good enough to guide an experimental or contingent implementation making its way to market might serve its purpose well enough without further hardening. </p><p>These “DIF-terminal” specifications and sample implementations are apt contributions to the field and the market without going on to formal review. They serve to bootstrap and jumpstart other development by getting more credentials or identifiers into circulation, while growing the pool of developers experienced and excited about the technology and the community. This “build early” approach is crucial to refining and hardening other parts of the stack, as well as building up a market and its workforce.</p> How does DIF work together with these organizations? <p>DIF is not the only pre-standards organization in which specifications and implementations are co-developed by early adopters and explorers of this family of technologies and applications. Anywhere companies and individual experimenters collaborate on open-source projects, “co-development” is happening, but these too vary in the kinds of collaboration for which they have designed and optimized their processes.</p><p>The earliest work in this space, as well as much of the long-view-oriented work developing tooling for open-world data models and Linked Data tooling, takes place in the Credentials Community Group (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/">CCG</a>) of the W3C. The CCG is a community group operated through the W3C but open to participants that do not pay W3C dues. &nbsp;It promotes and hosts pre-standards work and maintains dialogue with various other W3C groups, not just those chartered to work on the VC and DID specifications. Since the CCG is hosted by the W3C, it inherits many of the procedures and specification publication processes from the members-only processes of the Consortium. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html">Secure Data Storage</a> working group is cosponsored by the CCG and DIF to maximize the community-wide participation creating a pre-standards specification for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/confidential-storage">Confidential Storage</a> structures that can serve many different kinds of decentralized identity and data systems.</p><p>The Linux Foundation houses a complex family of Hyperledger projects, which coordinate global contributors to massive open-source codebases that power blockchains and other decentralized data and identity systems. <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>, the first major fit-for-purpose permissioned distributed ledger optimized for decentralized identity applications, is the oldest and most high-profile of the identity-focused projects in Hyperledger, designed to anchor decentralized identities and governed by the Sovrin Foundation. </p><p>Another major Hyperledger project is the modular and progressively more blockchain-agnostic <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries </a>community, which evolved out of Indy-specific open-source systems. The Aries Project offers many common libraries, entire single-language frameworks, and cross-framework protocols so that small companies can quickly build into an ecosystem of interoperable service providers and business models. The <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID-Communications</a> working group is co-sponsored by Aries and DIF, allowing members of either group to participate directly in the specification of a DID-based communications protocol for the entire decentralized identity community, not just the ecosystem built around the Aries codebases.</p><p>Other groups also overlap and coordinate with DIF in their development of implementations and specifications in advance of formal standards. One of these is the OpenID Foundation (<a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>), which governs increasingly widespread standards for authentication that federate identity systems across most of the commercial consumer internet. As with Hyperledger Aries and CCG, this <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/dif-oidf-9753b9bd0093?source=friends_link&amp;sk=ae0719a23e9405c6d61fc19c8b938277">relationship is formalized</a> as a “liaison agreement” between the two organizations, and also entails a Liaison Officer to coordinate the relationship; DIF’s DID Auth WG was put on pause in mid 2020 to focus on work happening in OIDF working groups, and hopes to re-open regular meetings to work on items on the DIF side again soon.</p><p>Another is the Linux Foundation’s first project devoted exclusively to data governance and related legal and ecosystem management issues, the Trust-over-IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">ToIP</a>), where many DIF members work on task forces and working groups on compliance issues, consent tracking, data-capture best practices, and industry-specific governance issues. &nbsp;The decentralization-friendly but wider-scoped <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>, which promotes user-centricity and data subject rights in legacy identity systems, is also an important touchstone for regulatory and legal issues. &nbsp;The <a href="http://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> continues to maintain the active Indy production network and house many important <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">collaborations</a> and <a href="https://sovrin.org/the-sovrin-community-releases-new-ssi-iot-whitepaper/">working groups</a>, and are represented in many DIF working groups. &nbsp;</p> Coöpetition and DIF’s particular brand of co-development <p>The way DIF relates to other organizations working in the same space arose naturally from DIF optimizing its processes for neutrality and collaboration between companies of different sizes and market positions. &nbsp;DIF’s culture is one of business collaboration aligned with the increasingly buzzy term “co-opetition” (sometimes spelled “coöpetition” to emphasize the pronunciation). &nbsp;The term is a portmanteau combining cooperation and competition, but the clearest definition might be “coöperation between competitors, who remain competitors before and after coöperating”. <br></p><p>“Coöpeting” early in the design process makes for a unique pact between competitors, one that is crucial to the DNA of DIF: it is a forward commitment, before the design process, to cooperate through and after release of an open standard or codebase. This kind of pact makes the most sense in situations where network effects and portability of data and users matter more than platform control and vendor lock-in. Indeed, when your business plan is to maximize openness and interoperability, you end up cooperating earlier and more deeply than in more siloed forms of “open source” development. After all, much of what we consider open-source wasengineered for a single vendor’s business goals and opened up after release, once all the major design decisions had been made and tested. The difference of timeline and design process is hard to overstate!</p><p>Put bluntly, committing to coöpetitive development of common standards and protocols is committing in advance to a truly open standard, rather than one which advantages its designers on its path to general adoption. This kind of pact is particularly useful when forged between companies that are direct competitors or companies of vastly different sizes.</p> Cooperating in the patent-free zone <p>In large part, competitors and companies of different sizes find it far easier to work together substantively on new ideas once a safe space has been established for new ideas. Startups stay up at night worrying that their best ideas could be patented out from beneath them by collaborators with well-staffed legal departments, and large enterprises hesitate to do any work in the open that might endanger their R&amp;D inventions. The solution for both is often coming together openly on a precisely-scoped working group or project with proper “IPR protections.” </p><blockquote>Put in plain language, the IPR agreements protecting DIF’s work prevent all contributors from taking legal action against the results of the group, whether on the basis of previously-held patents, or the new ideas originating in the group. </blockquote><p>The terms of these IPR agreements can seem cumbersome to people coming from non-profit or academic research, but in the private sector and particularly at industrial or global scale, the enforceability in global courts of ownership over ideas and patents is absolutely essential to software investments, infrastructural governance, and even geopolitics. The protocols, specifications, and libraries co-authored in an IPR-protected group can be thought of as safe dependencies, which cannot have their open-source status (i.e., their royalty-free status!) endangered by the current or pre-existing intellectual property of any of its contributors. The relative degree of this safety is of huge importance to infrastructural decision-making and long-term planning. &nbsp;These assurances can be an important insurance policy against one major risk in software development -- patent action against code or its dependencies.</p><p>Another crucial way in which this kind of “co-development” protects participants from the risks inherent in cooperating with competitors is that DIF, not the contributing member organizations, “owns” the products of its members’ collective labors. In concrete terms, this means the ongoing governance, maintenance, and licensing of the products of working groups, often referred to as “technical control” of resulting code or specifications, stays with the Foundation rather than with any of the legal entities contributing. The risk that a trusted co-development partner will change its strategy, its culture, or its ownership and thus its governance structure is only one of the many unsavory surprises a product or a company can meet on the road to market.</p><p>This means that if the relationship sours between two parties collaborating on a standard or a reference implementation, the work might “fork” and take on two different future paths, but the version ratified by DIF stays open to the public under DIF’s management. &nbsp;In such a case, any DIF member can join the relevant group and maintain the project’s main branch, or influence future versions if the group continues the open work. In fact, DIF’s licensing even imposes some restrictions on contributing organizations forking a DIF collaboration to continue the work elsewhere, whether further development is carried out in the open or not. </p><p>It is important to note that DIF is not original here, but rather, standing on the shoulders of giants. We were founded within the Joint Development Foundation, now part of the Linux Foundation, and inherits not only their licenses and legal structures but also their culture of co-development and IPR protection. While the staff of DIF is happy to help socialize, navigate, and enforce these structures, none of us are lawyers and we defer to the professionals (including those available to DIF through the JDF) for all serious matters and conflict resolution on the subject of intellectual property.</p> Drilling further down <p>We’ve sketched out the different kinds of open source development and the many ways variously-open standards can structure markets, and positioned DIF among all these concepts and its neighbors in the community. There’s not much further down we can drill in general terms: it’s time to get particular and start positioning you and your organization in this landscape! In our next piece, we’ll sketch out how you can get strategic about open source, roll up your sleeves, and get your hands dirty at DIF.</p>
