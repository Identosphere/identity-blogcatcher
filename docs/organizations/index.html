 Mark Cuban is possibly distancing himself from the crypto space and is unfollowing multiple crypto accounts like <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/solana-price-prediction/">Solana (SOL)</a>, <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/polkadot-new-price-prediction/">Polkadot (DOT)</a>, and others from his Twitter account. 



 In a reply to a Twitter post from Will Clemente, a popular crypto and blockchain analyst, Mark Cuban stated that he is only removing the accounts that were not following his own and is only cleaning his feed. 



 The billionaire was recently sued for his alleged involvement with the bankrupt crypto firm, <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/voyager-token-price-prediction/">Voyager Digital</a>, and hence, people believe that Cuban is trying to distance himself from crypto. 
 



 



<p>Mark Cuban, one of the biggest names in the financial world and a huge backer of <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/polygon-price-prediction/">Polygon (MATIC)</a>, an Ethereum scaling solution that made huge gains last year, is possibly distancing himself from the crypto space after investing in some of the biggest names in the industry. The billionaire unfollowing multiple crypto accounts from his Twitter account and the community took a note. </p>



<p>The owner of Dallas Maverics has unfollowed some of the biggest crypto players and also the most prominent project in the space as well. These include Polkadot, Solana, MetaMask, and others. Moreover, he also followed a few crypto entrepreneurs along with many influencers in the space as well. There have been questions regarding this move by Mark Cuban but no subsequent answers. </p>



<p>While many believed that Mark Cuban was unfollowing only entities and people in the crypto space, some pointed out that he has indeed unfollowed other people as well. A few though that the billionaire is only cleaning his feed so that he can focus on what’s more important rather than following people and entities that doesn’t interest him. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Just cleaned out mostly ones that weren’t following me. Still following lots of crypto. And I cleared out a lot of non crypto accounts as well. Same reason. New twitter, new strategies to make the feed more useful,” Cuban said. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Shark Tank personality <a href="https://bitcoinwisdom.com/polygon-defies-crypto-sell-pressures-matic-up-5-today-here-is-why/">has backed Polygon</a> and since then, went on to support multiple projects as well. He has recently shifted his attention to Web3 space as well and invested in climate-focused crypto project <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/klimadao-price-prediction/">KlimaDAO (KLIMA)</a>, whose native token has plunged almost 99% in the last year, which has led to many people believing it to be a sort of Ponzi scheme. </p>



<p>Mark Cuban was recently sued for his alleged involvement with the bankrupt crypto firm, <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/voyager-token-price-prediction/">Voyager Digital</a>, which has now accepting bids for the sale of its assets. The 64-year-old entrepreneur was sued by The Moskowitz Law Firm for <a href="https://bitcoinwisdom.com/mark-cuban-sued-for-promoting-bankrupt-voyager/">advocating Voyager’s unlicensed cryptocurrency products</a>. </p>



<p>The billionaire recently posted a Twitter thread on why he has invested into the crypto space and what are his thoughts on the current market crash. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I believe Smart Contracts will have a significant impact in creating valuable applications. I have said from day 1, the value of a token is derived from the applications that run on its platform and the utility they create,” Cuban said in a Twitter post on Nov. 13. </p>

<blockquote><p>A basic question. Why have I invested in crypto? Because I believe Smart Contracts will  have a significant impact in creating valuable applications.

However, the Members of Parliament have yet to approve of the taxation law which is almost aimed to tame the booming space. </p>



<p>The bill titled The Capital Markets (Amendment) Bill, 2022, will impost tax on all the crypto coin holdings on digital exchanges and wallets and also seeks to impose “transaction taxes akin to excise duty charged on bank transactions,” the report states. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Where the digital currency is held for a period not exceeding twelve months, the laws relating to income tax shall apply or for a period exceeding twelve months, the laws relating to capital gains tax shall apply,” the Bill, sponsored by Mosop MP Abraham Kirwa, says.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, banks will deduct 20% exercise duty on all the transactions fees and commissions that crypto brokers charge for their services. If the KRA amendment is approved by the MPs, all the crypto investors will be liable to pay capital gains tax on their holdings when they sell or trade their cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, crypto traders will have taxed on their income as well. </p>



<p>While the crypto sector remains largely unregulated in many across, the four million crypto investors in Kenya can now be at peace that the government is providing some clarity into the space. Many people have feared that the usage of crypto coins would be banned but the introduction of regulation means that people can use these blockchain-based currencies subject to certain restrictions mentioned in the bill. </p>



<p>People or businesses involved in crypto assets in Kenya will be required to submit specific information to the Capital Markets Authority (CMA). This information includes the amount of crypto held in Kenya shillings and the date on which the virtual currency was acquired and the date on which the virtual currency was sold.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A person who possesses or deals in digital currency shall provide the Authority with the following information for tax purposes—the amount of proceeds from the transaction, any costs related to the transaction and the amount of any gain or loss on the transaction,” the Bill states.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accenture, Cisco, Cryptsoft, Cybeats, Dell, EclecticIQ, Hitachi, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, U.S. NIST, Oracle, Red Hat, and Others Advance Open Standard for Automated Security Advisories</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 21 November, 2022 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the approval of the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 2.0 as a full OASIS standard, a status that signifies the highest level of ratification. This new version of CSAF includes support for the Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange (VEX) profile, which is especially helpful in efficiently consuming SBOM data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The current threat landscape has profoundly changed how systems and people are protected, driving new approaches to cybersecurity, especially around vendor advisories dealing with vulnerability disclosure issues. The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=csaf">OASIS CSAF Technical Committee’s</a> work developing machine readable security advisories makes it possible for cyber defenders to quickly and automatically assess the impact of vulnerabilities and respond in an automated way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Security advisories play a crucial role in securing on-premises and cloud-based assets as they contain critical information about how to remediate vulnerabilities,” said OASIS CSAF chair, Omar Santos, of Cisco. “CSAF v2.0 brings more than machine readable advisories in JSON format; it specifies the distribution mechanism and how new CSAF documents can be discovered and disclosed. It’s the result of an international, industry-wide effort to standardize the reporting of security issues. CSAF enables software producers and consumers to modernize their vulnerability management and response programs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participation in the OASIS CSAF TC is open to all through membership in OASIS. Providers of products and services that produce, consume, or process security vulnerability remediation information, along with their customers who consume this information, and all other interested parties, are invited to join the group.</p>



<p>The CSAF TC is holding a webinar on Thursday, 1 December at 11am ET, “Using CSAF to Respond to Supply Chain Vulnerabilities at Large Scale.” Speakers include Diane Morris of Cisco, Justin Murphy of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Omar Santos of Cisco, and Thomas Schmidt of the Federal Office for Information Security Germany (BSI). Attendance is free and open to all. View more specifics&nbsp;<a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_KqD-a1t5SpuMI7w9cI7ZDg">here.</a> </p>



<p>Support for CSAF&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cybeats<br>“As the number of vulnerabilities exponentially increases, it is paramount to modernize and automate the way organizations exchange information about these risks. Cybeats is proud to be part of OASIS Open and supports the important work of developing CSAF 2.0, as standard of machine readable format. Cybeats is among the first companies to use CSAF 2.0 to generate VEX for SBOMs.”<br>– Dmitry Raidman, CTO, Cybeats</p>



<p>Oracle<br>“Oracle is an early adopter of the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 2.0, an evolution of the Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF). CSAF 2.0 further enhances organizations’ capabilities in assessing vulnerabilities to prioritize their patching effort. This new version will support the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) format, which provides a means to determine whether specific vulnerabilities in commonly-used components are exploitable in the context of a given product distribution.”<br>– Mary Ann Davidson, Chief Security Officer, Oracle</p>



<p>Red Hat&nbsp;<br>“Enhancing the security of software supply chains is critical for modern organizations, as complex, multi-footprint digital services take a greater presence in all aspects of society. As a contributor to the CSAF v2.0 framework, we see this effort helping IT security teams to more rapidly and efficiently respond to potential threats via these concepts that modernize and automate security workflows without compromising operations.”<br>– Pete Allor, Director, Red Hat Product Security</p>

 Bill Ackman believes crypto can have the same impact as the internet and the telephone. 



 The investor claimed cryptocurrency investments occupy less than 2% of his assets. 
 



 



<p>Billionaire hedge fund manager and investor Bill Ackman is convinced that the cryptocurrency industry will continue to exist despite the recent scare caused by the collapse of the crypto trading platform, <a href="https://bitnation.co/john-ray-ftx-mismanaged-userss-funds/">FTX.</a> FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, days after it ran into a liquidity problem.</p>



<p>The situation led many to believe that the crypto industry had come to an early end as investors quickly began to lose trust and regulators strengthened their pursuit of the sector. However, Bill’s comment will undoubtedly come as a ray of light to crypto enthusiasts. </p>



<p>Bill shared his belief in a <a href="https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1594456744851558402?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">Twitter thread</a> he posted on Sunday, November 20th, stating that “crypto is here to stay.” He noted, however, that there was a need to remove fraudulent players and make the industry safer.</p>



<p>Bill’s comment marks a significant change in the billionaire’s attitude toward crypto. The 56-year-old confessed that he was “initially a crypto skeptic,” but all that changed “after studying some of the more interesting crypto projects.”</p>



<p>Bill believes that like the telephone and internet, the crypto industry could usher in a new era of technological change. The hedge fund manager claims “crypto can enable the formation of useful businesses and technologies that heretofore could not be created.”</p>



<p>The investor has shown his newfound enthusiasm for the crypto industry by becoming a direct investor in a couple of crypto projects. He recently called for New York authorities to ease their policies and remove possible barriers to make the city a hub for crypto activities.</p>



<p>The American investor, however, pointed out an area of concern in the crypto industry. He wrote,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The problem with crypto is that unethical promoters can create tokens simply to facilitate pump and dump schemes. It may in fact be that the vast majority of crypto coins are used for fraudulent purposes rather than for building legitimate businesses.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the industry’s potential to aid fraud, Bill believes that with proper regulation and oversight, the crypto industry could go ahead and impact the economy and society like the internet and telephone. Sharing his thoughts on how to combat fraud in the crypto industry, According to Bill,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>All legitimate participants in the crypto ecosystem should therefore be highly incentivized to expose and eliminate fraudulent actors as they greatly increase the risk of regulatory intervention that will set back the positive potential impact of crypto for generations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bill claims that cryptocurrency represents less than 2% of his assets. He also has an interest in Helium, and owns a stake in ORIGYN Foundation</p>

 Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that he was “never against” the former CEO of collapsed crypto exchange FTX despite industry players calling him the orchestrator of the entire drama.  



 A Turkish-American economist Nouriel Roubini revealed his “seven Cs of crypto” ie. “concealed, corrupt, crooks, criminals, con men, carnival barkers, and&nbsp; Changpeng Zhao.”&nbsp; 



 Even if his announcement <a href="https://bitnation.co/binance-to-liquidate-its-500-million-ftx-position/">regarding the public sale of FTX token FTT</a> may have sparked a larger sale of the token and led to FTX’s liquidity issue, Zhao insisted that his actions were motivated neither by malice nor by rivalry. 
 



 



<p>As the accused FTX founder continues to complain on Twitter, Binance CEO and co-founder Changpeng Zhao has reiterated his viewpoint on Sam Bankman-Fried. Zhao told CNBC on Thursday that he was “never against” the now infamous SBF, whose $26 billion net worth has dropped to zero amid FTX’s collapse and charges of fraud and mismanagement of customer assets.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We don’t focus on other smaller exchanges,” Zhao stated, in an interview.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is important to note that the Binance head has been attacked by many critics citing him as the initiator of the FTX event. A Turkish-American economist Nouriel Roubini revealed his “seven Cs of crypto” ie. “concealed, corrupt, crooks, criminals, con men, carnival barkers, and&nbsp; Changpeng Zhao.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if his public sale of FTX token FTT may have sparked a larger sale of the token and led to FTX’s liquidity issue, Zhao insisted that his actions were motivated neither by malice nor by rivalry.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We were never in a battle with him. He may think he’s in a battle with us. We didn’t even notice. We did hear some concerns about, you know, him badmouthing us behind our backs in D.C., in other political lobbying circles,”&nbsp;Zhao admitted.</p>
</blockquote>



 Binance Initially Supported FTX 



<p>Binance was an early supporter of FTX. Zhao said he decided at which point <a href="https://bitnation.co/binance-backs-out-of-ftx-deal/">he needed to leave</a> when he realized things had gotten bad. He added: “We just said, ‘Look, we don’t wanna be entangled, we just want to exit our equity portion.’ We did that a year and a half ago. And as part of that transaction we got some FTT tokens,”</p>



<p>Zhao clarified he was unaware of the full scope of FTX’s off-the-record operations. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m shocked that he lied to everybody, I didn’t know that he lied to everybody until a week ago,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



 Zhao Speaks About Regulations 



<p>Binance’s CEO is a huge supporter of regulations and believes that the crypto space needs to be regulated almost immediately. In a recent statement, Zhao, who is known as CZ in the crypto space, said that stable and clear regulations for the industry are needed to prevent players from “cutting corners.” </p>



<p>Zhao was asked if he thought regulations would have avoided the FTX collapse, and he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/11/17/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-ftx-will-set-crypto-back-but-the-industry-will-become-healthier.html">responded</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Regulations could minimize some of the problems, but when a person lies—when there’s a bad player that just wants to do bad things—regulation doesn’t prevent it.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Binance has increasingly supported crypto firms and recently <a href="https://bitnation.co/binance-includes-12-projects-in-incubation-program/">introduced a the fifth season for the Incubation Program</a> wherein 12 projects were included which would be coached to make it big in the crypto space. </p>

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) commissioner Kristin N. Johnson said that the regulator of the US derivatives markets had “boots on the ground” at LedgerX.  



 Johnson repeated remarks made by CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam, who said at a futures conference that his agency’s oversight was responsible for LedgerX’s ability to avoid bankruptcy. 



 CFTC requires FTX’s subsidiary to have reserves, including a one-year liquidity reserve, and to refrain from touching, pledging, investing, or posing any other threats to functioning capital. 
 



 



<p>On Thursday, a commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Kristin N. Johnson, stated that the regulator of the US derivatives markets had “boots on the ground” at LedgerX, a US-based division of the FTX, whose CEO had recently resigned due to uncertainty surrounding the functioning of the firm.</p>



<p>At a conference on cryptocurrency regulation in London, Johnson was expressing her views on the matter and stated that the financial regulator was “monitoring and overseeing on a daily, if not hourly basis, verifying what we believe to be the case, which is [that] every dollar of customer assets held at LedgerX continues to be available.”</p>



<p>It is noteworthy that the <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/">CFTC</a> and FTX US, the US arm of the bankruptcy crypto exchange, interacted with each other using LedgerX. It submitted an application to the CFTC in 2017 to become a regulated derivatives center before being acquired by FTX the previous year.</p>



<p>She repeated remarks made by CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam, who said earlier this week at a futures conference that his agency’s oversight was responsible for LedgerX’s ability to avoid bankruptcy. Johnson emphasized that LedgerX was one of the businesses left out of FTX’s bankruptcy filing on Friday.</p>



 CFTC’s Regulation Of LedgerX 



<p>According to commissioner Johnson, the CFTC had mandated that LedgerX hold segregated funds separately, subject to monthly, quarterly, and annual examinations, and provide balance sheets and verified bank statements to prove the legitimacy of assets held in accounts on behalf of consumers.</p>



<p>Additionally, she claimed, it requires FTX’s subsidiary to have reserves, including a one-year liquidity reserve, and to refrain from touching, pledging, investing, or posing any other threats to functioning capital.</p>



<p>She asserted that the CFTC always has “a number of options” for providing oversight to maintain market integrity, even in the absence of regulation.</p>



<p>And yet, according to Johnson, the CFTC needs direct authority from Congress to interact with market participants and force them to enter the regulatory framework of U.S. markets.</p>



<p>She compared the interaction between American regulators to “coming to Thanksgiving dinner” and added that “there are some folks you might not necessarily sit beside.”</p>



 CFTC vs. SEC 



<p>There has been a constant struggle between <a href="https://bitnation.co/sec-and-cftc-hunts-bad-actors-in-the-crypto-market-as-directed-by-white-house/">CFTC and SEC</a> over who will be given the green signal to take over the crypto space and the Chairs of both the regulators believe that Bitcoin is a commodity while both have different versions of which tokens can be considered securities and which can be considered as commodities.</p>



<p>Recently, a polician criticized SEC Chai Gary Gensler and called his organization “power hungry.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Under Chair Gensler, the SEC has become a power-hungry regulator, politicizing enforcement, baiting companies to “come in and talk” to the Commission, then hitting them with enforcement actions, discouraging good-faith cooperation,” said Gensler.</p>

 The 2018 World Cup had an estimated viewership of over 2 billion people. 



 Crypto.com was announced as the official sponsor of the World Cup in May. 



 Blockchain could gain massive exposure with crypto ads set to be displayed during games. 
 



 



<p>The FIFA World Cup is only hours away, and football fans are bracing up for a special moment. However, human rights concerns have marred this year’s <a href="https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022">tournament</a>, with host country Qatar allegedly condoning abuse of foreign workers. Regardless, football fans are willing to focus solely on what goes on on the pitch.</p>



<p>The World Cup, which is held every four years, is seen as the chief event in the football world. Fans from all qualified nations enjoy the thrill of watching their teams battle against other countries as they gun for the top prize. </p>



<p>These games are watched by millions worldwide, more than any other sporting event. The 2018 finals between France and Croatia had 1.1 billion viewers, making it one of the most-watched soccer games in the world.</p>



<p>But aside from the chance to see new players shine and <a href="https://bitnation.co/c-ronaldo-partners-with-binance-for-his-first-nft-collection/">older players</a> bow out in glory, the 2022 FIFA World Cup could also be a time for the cryptocurrency industry to gain massive exposure to billions of viewers. Crypto.com, a cryptocurrency exchange, sponsors this year’s event. Experts expect the 2022 World Cup to trigger a new wave of adoption for the crypto industry, as Crypto.com ads will feature during games and be watched by millions of sports fans.</p>



<p>FIFA launched its own NFT platform on the Algorand blockchain in September, which will also be featured at the World Cup. Blockchain seems fairly well represented at the global event, with several integrations and partnerships. For example, in May, Algorand was selected to be FIFA’s official blockchain partner and will sponsor the Women’s World Cup, which begins in 2023.</p>



<p>Regardless of the FTX situation, the FIFA World Cup could be the much-needed break the crypto market has been looking for. Fan tokens for both Portugal and Argentina saw huge surges hours ahead of the opening games on Sunday. This could be a sign of things to come.</p>

 USDA will debut in Q1 2023 and the Cardano ecosystem will give potential investors the option to convert their USD into the Cardano-based regulated stablecoin via credit/debit cards, wire transfers, and other means. 



 USDA has been described as the first fully fiat-backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin in the <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/cardano-price-prediction/">Cardano (ADA)</a> ecosystem. 



 Emurgo has partnered with a regulated financial services firm based in the United States and will help Emurgo as a banking partner to issue USDA. 
 



 



<p>A stablecoin based on the <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/cardano-price-prediction/">Cardano (ADA)</a> blockchain, USDA, is all set to debut in 2023 by Emurgo, the official commercial arm and a founding entity of the Ethereum-rival blockchain. This stablecoin will be pegged to the US Dollar as per a report and will attempt to enter the already competitive market space which is currently dominated by Tether (USDT). </p>



<p>USDA has been described as the first fully fiat-backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin in the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem and will attempt to compete with the likes of USDC, DAI, among other major stablecoins. However, following the collapse of the UST stablecoin, the industry is being viewed with increased scrutiny. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The introduction of a fully fiat-backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin is the next step in realizing the future for our community,” wrote Emurgo Fintech Managing Director Vineeth Bhuvanagiri, in a note to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/18/cardano-based-regulated-stablecoin-usda-will-hit-the-market-in-early-2023/">CoinDesk</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, USDA is a part of Emurgo’s Anzens product, under which the creators plan to offer users several financial services and products functioning on Cardano-based assets. These financial services range from crypto lending and borrowing services, crypto-based card payments, along with bridges between traditional markets and decentralized applications, or dApps. </p>



<p>The goal is to boost the decentralized finance ecosytem on the Cardano blockchain and as per the data from <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano">DefiLlama</a>, the total value locked (TVL) in the blockchain is somewhere around $54 million which is more than 80% low from its highs noted in the month of March, which was valued at $300 million. </p>



<p>Interestingly, the plan is to launch USDA in Q1 2023 and the ecosystem will give potential investors the option to convert their USD into the Cardano-based regulated stablecoin via credit/debit cards, wire transfers, and other means as well. In order to facilitate and easily implement the new steps, Emurgo has partnered with a regulated financial services firm as well. </p>



<p>The name of the regulated financial service provider was not revealed but it was confirmed that it is based in the United States and will help Emurgo as a banking partner to issue USDA, and ensure that the stablecoin is fully compliant and adheres to regulatory guidelines as well. </p>



<p>Soon, a new service will be debuted as well which, along with tokenization of USD, will allow investors to convert USDC, USDT, and other stablecoins to USDA and in the longer run, the Cardano ecosystem participants will be able to swap <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, <a href="https://bitnation.co/forecast/ethereum-price-prediction/">Ether (ETH)</a>, and others via USDA.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://bitnation.co/cardano-ada-price-up-1-5-vasil-upgrade-scheduled-for-september-22/">Vasil upgrade</a>, Cardano users have been waiting for a new development on the platform and it seems that this new venture initiated by the blockchain is aimed to bring new utility to the users. </p>

<p>This week I had the opportunity to take part in the GS1 Healthcare Conference in Paris together with BSI’s Global Director for Healthcare, Courtney Soulsby. As usual, GS1 event brought together a lot of people and organizations looking for innovative approaches to solving the industry’s biggest challenges. Speaking with some of the largest players in the space, a few recurring themes were present across the majority of our conversations that showcased how Web3 assets can play a key role in addressing them.</p>Courtney Soulsby, BSI’s Global Director for Healthcare, and Jurij Skornik, Trace Labs’ General Manager at Global GS1 Healthcare Conference<p>While today the Web3 industry might be appearing in the news for a plethora of reasons, I’m certain that the true and biggest opportunities are being seized by those focusing on education and building tangible value. By understanding how we can leverage this technology, we can address some of humanity’s biggest challenges, like those present in the industry that comprises ⅔ of the world’s GDP — supply chains. Here are 3 pain points that were mentioned often in our conversations in Paris and can very effectively be addressed using Web3 technology:</p>  Access to information — actionable knowledge derived from information that is currently scattered across supply chain networks can unlock possibilities of precise alignment of supply and demand; quality/origin claims backed by verifiable data; forward tracking to minimize diversions and gray market sales; and many other high-impact solutions.  Digital twins — creating a Web3 asset representation of a physical product, digital certificate/credential, or even a service — is a game changer. Not only are you able to have a much more precise understanding of asset ownership (chain of custody), but you have a single place to access key information about each product. This can be useful in ensuring product authenticity (counterfeit medicine is a huge problem), precise patient support during complex treatments and pin-pointing critical items in the unfortunate event of&nbsp;recalls.  Expanding the supply chain — no supply chain today ends at the point of sale but rather extends to the consumer, and in the event of circular approaches, can even end up back at the producer. In healthcare, the element of extending the supply chain towards patients is more and more critical. Receiving real-time information about the correct effects of the medicine and medical devices can not only hugely increase the speed of innovation but also save lives. However, a big challenge of handling patient data and providing direct incentives for data sharing exists, both of which Web3 assets can be the right solution&nbsp;for.  <p>The discussions we had also came as a great validation for solutions we’re building at Trace Labs. With the new OriginTrail — decentralized knowledge graph version 6 (DKG V6) — enabling us to describe any supply chain using Web3 assets as building blocks we can tackle all these huge challenges head-on.</p><p>Before signing off — Trace Labs is also releasing a big update to our Network Operating System (nOS) allowing us to address challenges like those above with efficient deployments. Having it entirely transformed to fully exploit the new and more efficient DKG V6, the nOS now allows any user to evolve the data structured according to GS1 and other important data standards into Web3 assets that can be made discoverable (available) and verifiable for plethora of business cases (some solutions built on top of the nOS can be seen here). The nOS also abstracts all complexities with regards to digital assets required to use the public decentralized infrastructure, so all you have to focus on is creating value for your business.</p>Network Operating System&nbsp;(nOS)<p>Subscribe to <a href="https://origintrail.io/">our newsletter</a> to be among the first ones to receive news about the latest technology updates!</p><p>P.S.: The croissants in Paris were amazing,&nbsp;too.</p><p>👇 More about Trace&nbsp;Labs👇</p><p><a href="https://tracelabs.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/TraceLabsHQ">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tracelabs.io">Facebook</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/trace-labs/">LinkedIn</a></p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/gs1-healthcare-conference-paris-was-more-than-just-croissants-89ad2b7fedd9">GS1 Healthcare Conference: Paris was more than just croissants</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The Bank of America has come out in support of blockchain technology, and said that people should not tarnish blockchain technology with speculative crypto trading.  



 Citigroup (C), HSBC (HSBC), BNY Mellon (BK) and Wells Fargo (WFC) along with payments giant Mastercard (MA) have participated in the testing phase for the use of digital tokens representing dollars.  



 Bank of America also stated that the crypto space needs a clear delineation between trading platforms and market makers and emphasized on increased regulations. 
 



 



<p>The Bank of America has come out in support of blockchain technology and stated that crypto enthusiasts and firms should not tarnish blockchain technology with speculative crypto trading in a research report released Thursday, when a group of some of the biggest banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York tested the use of digital tokens representing dollars.</p>



<p>Citigroup (C), HSBC (HSBC), BNY Mellon (BK), and Wells Fargo (WFC), along with payments giant Mastercard (MA), have <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/18/bank-of-america-says-crypto-exchanges-proof-of-reserves-have-too-many-shortcomings/">participated</a> in the testing phase, which is a major step towards blockchain adoption in the traditional finance sector. The news comes at a time when the <a href="https://bitnation.co/ftx-had-1b-of-liquid-assets-against-9b-of-liabilities/">collapse of a multi-billion dollar crypto exchange FTX</a>, has left the industry in a state of huge shock. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The development of applications that leverage distributed ledger and blockchain technology continues to advance,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, the Bank of America said that a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) allows faster settlement of payments providing the benefit of reallocation of funds that had been otherwise held as collateral into yield-bearing investments. Reduced costs, lower credit risk and increased transparency were some of the other benefits pointed out by the bank. </p>



<p>Bank of America also stated that the crypto space needs a clear delineation between trading platforms and market makers. After the FTX collapse, crypto firms and service providers have rushed in to show that they are fully liquid and functional. However, the bank stated that these “proof of reserves, at least in the form they’ve been suggested, have too many shortcomings to inspire confidence.”</p>



<p>Crypto firms are planning to use merkle trees to produce proof of reserves which can be efficiently stored and accessed. However, the Bank of America has noted several shortcomings when it comes to the usage of merkle trees and stated that the assets are shown at a fixed point in time and as a result, the data can be manipulated. For example, certain foul actors can borrow assets right before the snapshot is taken.</p>



<p>According to the bank, proof of liabilities is required as well, in order to determine leverage and the safety of assets. However, proof of reserves often rely on third party audit firms that can be manipulated easily or “may even be created by the trading platform itself,” the note added.</p>



<p>Bank of America says that stablecoin reserves need to be audited as well and not just displayed. Interestingly, the bank stated that regulations are a must in the crypto space given that the collapse of FTX wiped off billions from the crypto space. </p>

 Introduction  <p>Soulbonds are evolving NFTs that reflect a Web3 user's on-chain activity. Users can construct, customize and upgrade their Souls (using 220+ hand-drawn traits) to represent adventures they’ve embarked on and tailor the NFT to their unique experience. </p><p>"The Soul becomes their reflection in the decentralized web, a true reflection of their digital identity," the Soulbonds teams says. </p><p>Soulbonds chose to build on Ceramic to significantly improve usability. With Ceramic, users can apply new traits to their NFTs when they obtain on-chain achievements. Leveraging Ceramic to update Soulbonds metadata avoids all costs related to these data transactions.</p><p>"Storing Soulbonds data on Ceramic also offers users a decentralized gateway that allows Soulbonds the same accessibility as IPFS, removing any centralization risk or server damage, and ensures that user content remains permanently available," the Soulbonds team says. </p><p>Ultimately, Ceramic enables Soulbonds to store data in a decentralized way without incurring transaction fees for users.</p><p>Before creating Soulbonds, the team noticed a lack of popular projects that allow the customization of NFTs. Using a centralized server with APIs was one possible solution to create evolving NFTs. Zerion DNA, for example, offers customizable NFTs but it comes at the cost of losing decentralization. The Soulbonds team also considered another option: upgrading NFTs via on-chain transactions; however, this approach would become prohibitively expensive for users frequently updating their data.</p><p>The team chose to build Soulbonds on Ceramic because of its ability to perform off-chain data updates in a decentralized environment. </p> Ceramic Offers Mutability and Decentralization  <p>NFTs are a set of links between blockchain addresses, NFT metadata, and media content. These links could lead to:</p>  Centralized servers of the project company (i.e. CryptoKitties)  Decentralized storage (i.e. Arweave or IPFS)  <p>Decentralized storage solutions like Arweave or IPFS are immutable—this means that changing the stored content is usually impossible for certain use cases, like an ever-evolving NFT. From a security point of view, immutable storage is important, but it limits the number of possible applications (like the ability for NFTs to evolve). On Arweave or IPFS, a change in content means that the link also changes, this requires paying gas fees on blockchains every time. This can be a big issue for NFT projects that allow customization to be done frequently, since they need to use a proxy that will contain the latest version of the NFT.</p><p>Ceramic allows decentralized access to the entire history of changes affecting the Soulbonds NFT (including new features), as well as the most recent version of the metadata. With Ceramic, users do not have to pay for updates or sacrifice decentralization.</p> How Soulbonds Built With Ceramic <p>For Soulbonds, Ceramic stores a sequential stream of metadata along with links to media stored on IPFS. Using one of the API endpoints, projects can request the current state of the content in the stream. Since Ceramic is decentralized, there is no threat that content owned by users will someday be lost.</p><p>In addition to dynamic NFTs, the Soulbonds team continues to push new features, including a leaderboard to rank users via on-chain activity and bootstrapping mechanisms to reward Soulbonds token holders. </p> Get in Touch  <p>The Soulbonds team completed beta testing and encourages the ecosystem to check them out on these <a href="https://linktr.ee/soulbondsnft">channels</a>. </p><p>Join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/6VRZpGP">Discord</a> to learn about how you can build your application on Ceramic!</p><p></p>

<p>Poor password hygiene is the root cause of more than 80% of data breaches, according to the FIDO Alliance. Efforts to ditch easy-to-guess, phrase-based passwords are gaining more traction with the adoption of passkeys, paving the way for the passwordless future cybersecurity pros dream of. Growing passkey adoption requires widespread availability, industry collaboration and regulatory support, says FIDO Alliance executive director Andrew Shikiar.</p>

<p>The use of biometric technology has taken off in recent years which could largely be down to loopholes in password security becoming more apparent. Biometrics represents the most convenient and easy form of Multi-Factor Authentication and is therefore very well placed to increase security. It’s easy to combine biometric patterns, fingerprint combined with facial, for example, and to complete it with other authentication method – as per FIDO Alliance standards.</p>

 What Is Biticodes? 



<p>A well-known bitcoin automated trading platform called BitiCodes was created to provide both novice and seasoned traders with a smooth trading experience. The program’s creators claim that in order to conduct winning transactions on your behalf, it makes use of artificial intelligence (AI), complex algorithms, and trading strategies. In other words, by assisting you in automating tedious and time-consuming processes like market research, chart analysis, price forecasting, and trend analysis, the BitiCodes platform makes cryptocurrency trading simple.</p>



<p>We think BitiCodes is the best trading programme for both new and seasoned traders based on our own experience using it. With this platform, you don’t need to worry about learning how to trade or spend a lot of time trading every day. If you choose to trade manually on the site, BitiCodes also provides handy tools and data, like charts, to help you with your transactions.</p>



<p>With a 90% success rate, BitiCodes will likely execute winning trades for you nine out of 10 times. The platform can also execute numerous deals per second, a feat that is beyond the capabilities of even the most seasoned cryptocurrency trader. This software also enables you to trade other popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, Cardano, Bitcoin Cash, and more, in contrast to other automated cryptocurrency trading systems that only handle Bitcoin.</p>



 How Does Biticodes Work? 







<p>As was previously said, to execute deals, this bitcoin trading platform uses top-notch algorithms, artificial intelligence, and robotics. When you press the trade button, it immediately begins automatically scanning the bitcoin market and analysing charts to find profitable trading chances. AI technology and cutting-edge algorithms are used to accomplish this. When it sees a chance, it immediately sends out its trading bots to carry it out.</p>



<p>This method enables the automated trading program to accurately complete more than ten trades in a single second. So, you can anticipate BitiCodes to complete 1000+ transactions for you in less than an hour. Additionally, the software has a 90% success rate, meaning 900 out of the 1000+ trades will probably be lucrative.</p>



<p>Both desktop and mobile devices are compatible with the official BitiCodes website. We have confirmed that the website functions flawlessly on every type of laptop, tablet, and smartphone that we tested it on. You should also be aware that using the platform to register is free. Setting up your trading account on BitiCodes won’t cost you a dime. However, in order to begin trading on the platform and making money, you must deposit $250 as the minimum trading amount.</p>

 Biticodes Overview 



<p>Cryptocurrencies Available: BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC and more<br>Withdrawal Speeds: Instant withdrawals<br>Minimum Deposit: $250</p>



 Key Features of Biticodes Trading Platform 



 User Experience 



<p>The key selling point of the BitiCodes platform is its straightforward user interface, which is intended to draw in new crypto investors and newbies. The autonomous cryptocurrency trading platform will handle the majority of the job on behalf of the user with little to no effort required from the investors.</p>



<p>To get started, just create and confirm an account. Users of the account can make the program live after making a minimum payment of $250. After completing this, BitiCodes will start scanning the markets and starting fresh deals every day. The BitiCodes account may be accessed by traders using a web browser, and all they need to get started is a reliable internet connection.</p>



<p>Additionally, the BitiCodes website asserts that it works with every gadget. The website, mobile devices, and tablets can all be used to access BitiCodes. As a result, the crypto trading bot is always immediately available.</p>



 Customer Support &amp; Personal Account Manager 



<p>Once registration is complete, the BitiCodes website states that each new user will be assigned a personal account manager. To resolve any account-related questions, traders can get in touch with the account managers by Whatsapp, Telegram, email, and phone.</p>



<p>Members of BitiCodes have 24/7 access to customer support in addition to account managers. The customer support team gives the same level of accessibility as the account managers because they are also accessible through various internet channels including email, Telegram, and others.</p>



 Demo Account 



<p>According to the BitiCodes website, demo account options are available to investors, enabling them to sample the software and account features without having to make a real-money investment. The same functions available on a conventional account are supported by a demo account, which utilises fake money to place new transactions and buy assets.</p>



<p>For traders wishing to test out a new platform without putting any real assets at risk, the demo account function is useful.</p>

 Security 



<p>Since security is a key concern for every cryptocurrency trading platform, BitiCodes asserts that it has started a number of security protocols to safeguard investors’ money. The database used by BitiCodes stores data that is completely encrypted, protecting it from potential hacks.</p>



<p>The website also claims that it protects consumer data with numerous SSL certificates.</p>



 High Rate of Success 



<p>The program for the crypto trading robot, which is most significant, asserts to have a very high success rate. The software’s algorithm is able to make potentially successful transactions because it uses cutting-edge technology to scan the markets and start deals when it is most advantageous to do so.</p>



<p>According to the BitiCodes website, the AI system has a 96% success rate. We haven’t independently verified this, though.</p>



 Leverage 



<p>The platform’s ability to leverage up to 5000:1 is another benefit of BitiCodes. However, if you are a newbie, we do not advise choosing this choice. It is quite profitable, but there is a danger you could lose everything.</p>



 How to Use Biticodes – Step-by-Step Guide 



 Step 1: Open an account 



<p>You can sign up for the platform using the form above. You can also do so through their website, but the form above presents an easier way to do this without running the risk of ending up on a duplicate or fraudulent platform.</p>



 Step 2: Verify your Account 



<p>You must submit the completed form to the website. BitiCodes will create your free account and give you a verification email in a matter of seconds. You will have access to your account after the verification procedure is finished.</p>



 Step 3: Make a Deposit 



<p>Funding your account with the required minimum trading capital is the next step after completing the BitiCodes registration and verification process. Before customers can begin trading, the platform asks all users to deposit a minimum of $250. You can deposit money using a few different methods on the BitiCodes website. Debit cards, credit cards, bank transfers, and e-wallets are all options for funding your account.</p>



<p>As previously stated, BitiCodes does not charge for registration. Therefore, this amount is your trading capital rather than your registration fee. The site does not impose deposit fees, which is another benefit worth mentioning. Therefore, the trading capital you receive will be equal to the amount you put in your trading account.</p>



 Step 4: Monitor Trading Bot 



<p>Before trading with your hard-earned money, you can utilize BitiCodes’ demo account to get acquainted with the platform. You receive monies through this feature—not actual cash—that you may use to test the software and learn how it functions.</p>



<p>Once you are certain that you comprehend how the BitiCodes platform functions, click the start trading option to begin the transaction. The window for the trade parameters will open after this operation. The crypto asset you want to trade must be chosen here, along with additional settings like risk level, stop loss and more. Click the live trading button when finished to watch the program trade and earn money for you.</p>

 Biticodes vs other Trading Robots 



<p>Minimum Deposit: $250 (in line with other platforms)</p>



<p>Success Rate: 90% (lower than other platforms like Yuan Pay Group with 99% success rate)</p>



 Can you make money with Biticodes? 



<p>After carefully examining the website, our specialists have concluded that BitiCodes is both legitimate and profitable. Furthermore, we found no evidence to support the claim that it is a hoax. In order to learn more about BitiCodes, we first looked at user reviews on TrustPilot, Yelp, Facebook, and other reliable review sites.</p>



<p>Many people assert that since the platform’s introduction, they have been using BitiCodes to generate passive revenue. We must warn you, nevertheless, that some customers claim they lost money using the site because they were unable to understand how it operated. Not content, we continued our research by registering for a BitiCodes account to gain first-hand experience.</p>



<p>We think BitiCodes is 100 percent genuine based on our experience and other considerations. We take the founders’ assertion that even a novice trader with no prior experience can increase their money by using BitiCodes seriously. Please be aware, though, that no automatic trading programme in the world has a success record of 100 percent. Therefore, when you invest in these automated trading systems, there is still a danger that you could lose your money.</p>



<p>So, we suggest that you only invest money that you can afford to lose. Ideally, you should start with the smallest amount of money possible and only expand your investment after you begin to profit from the platform.</p>

 Tips for new traders 



<p>The following advice can help you maximise your profits on BitiCodes while lowering your risk of financial loss.</p>



  <p>Only invest what you can afford to lose. Because of the cryptocurrency market’s extreme volatility and unpredictability, anything can happen while you are trading. Never invest money you’ve borrowed or used for necessities like rent or food in cryptocurrency.</p>  <p>Always routinely cash out your platform gains. You won’t be at a loss if the unexpected occurs if you do it this way.</p>  <p>Try to set aside 20 to 30 minutes every day to check on your account to make sure the program is functioning properly. Additionally, monitoring will enable you to identify any anomaly in your account before it worsens.</p>

 4. Affiliate Marketing 



<p>One of the most common and successful business model when it comes to earning money online is affiliate marketing. Although its level of popularity has waxed and waned over the course of the years, it has remained a reliable means of making money over the internet.</p>



<p>The most advantageous aspect of affiliate marketing is the availability of a wide variety of organisations with whom to form business partnerships. Some examples of such companies are Shopify, Amazon, Uber, the Facebook Marketplace, and FabFitFun.</p>



<p>Affiliate marketing gives you the opportunity to make a career by advertising the products of other companies. Promoting retail goods, software, applications, and even more may earn you a commission on purchases if you are a skilled marketer and know what you are doing.</p>



<p>Despite the fact that it might not seem like much to make a commission, bear in mind that you can work on an affiliate program for several businesses, and you can include more than one affiliate link in a single blog article.</p>

<p>You will have created an asset that is uniquely yours when you have finished populating a blog with numerous pages of high-quality material. Your affiliate links should be strategically placed throughout your blog articles in order to drive visitors to the website of your affiliate partner.</p>

<p>Earnings from the Amazon Associates programme are dispersed sixty calendar days following the close of the month in which they were earned. In order for profits to be distributed, you need to have a balance of at least ten dollars.</p>

 Requirements 



<p>A website, social media account, or another type of online presence that has a consistent number of users browsing through it each day.</p>



 5. Selling Things You Make 







<p>Selling the things you no longer have use for is a simple method to bring in some more cash. When utilizing this tactic, you need to ensure that the products you put up for sale are of value to the customers in the market today.</p>



<p>The majority of individuals very instantly consider selling their outdated media, such as CDs and DVDs. However, the majority of individuals do not wish to purchase those items. The year is 2022; do you still intend to purchase a CD? Almost certainly not. Therefore, you shouldn’t even bother wasting your time attempting to sell it.</p>



<p>When you are considering selling your belongings, you should concentrate on selling things like gadgets, furniture, toys, and handmade crafts.</p>



<p>You may offer the same items on numerous platforms, including your own web shop, Etsy Shop, Amazon’s Marketplace, and Facebook Marketplace, among others. Selling through many channels will increase the likelihood of finding individuals interested in purchasing your products.</p>



<p>Do you want to have a positive impact on the consumer right from the start? Include photographs of the goods that are of a high quality in your listings.</p>



<p>You have the option of either employing a freelance graphic designer to generate product photographs on your behalf or enrolling in a photography class that will teach you the skills necessary to capture and edit your own images.</p>



 Quick Snapshot 



<p>Total time: Customers may take some time to find you. Setup can be time-consuming.<br>How easy to begin: On the difficulty meter, I’m leaning toward “hard.”<br>Minimum age: 13 years old.<br>When you’ll be paid: From the next day to seven days after the sale.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>Creating an online storefront on Etsy is the simple part. It is possible to finish it in a few of hours.</p>



<p>The preparation work that has to be done before you open for business takes up the majority of your time. You will need to have products to sell, photos and descriptions of those products to post, a name for your storefront, and a strategic business plan in order to be successful.</p>



<p>After that is finished, you will still need to find people to use your services. Because of this, you should anticipate that the overall time for this gig will be slow because that could take weeks, depending on what it is that you are selling.</p>



<p>Your Etsy Payments account will be credited with the sale price of an item as soon as it is sold.</p>



<p>In the first three months that you are a seller, the funds from a sale are available for deposit seven days after the sale has been completed.</p>



<p>Once the initial 90 days have passed, the funds in your account will be ready for deposit the following business day.</p>



 Requirements 



<p>If you are older than 13 but younger than 18, you are eligible to sell on Etsy; however, you will be considered a minor and will be subject to additional policies.</p>



<p>It is imperative that you own all of the relevant rights to the products that are being sold in your store.</p>



 6. Advertising revenue on YouTube 







<p>If other people are able to profit from YouTube, then you should be able to as well. Jimmy Donaldson, often known as MrBeast, is the most successful YouTuber because he has mastered the art of building his personal brand.</p>



<p>In 2021, MrBeast made $54 million through his YouTube channel. Jake Paul, who uploads high-energy prank videos and content related to boxing, is another great earner on YouTube. He has made $45 million from his videos. Beyond what he made through his YouTube channel, he was able to capitalize on his popularity and make extra money online because of his celebrity gained through boxing and YouTube.</p>



<p>To attract a sizable and devoted following to your YouTube channel, you need to zero in on a certain sector of interest. You may, for instance, produce cosmetics lessons, broadcast video games, review items, teach skills, create viral videos, or any other type of content that you believe will appeal to an audience and help you make good money fast.</p>



<p>Creating content that people want to watch and subscribe to is the key to generating money on your YouTube channel. To get more people to view your videos, come up with catchy titles and include relevant keywords in the descriptions.</p>



<p>This will help optimize your channel for YouTube searches. When you hit the milestone of 1,000 subscribers, you will be able to formally monetize your channel through the use of YouTube advertisements.</p>



 Quick Snapshot 



<p>Total time: Getting up and running can take several weeks. Setup is not difficult.<br>How simple it is to begin: This depends on your ability to create interesting videos.<br>Minimum age: 18 years old.<br>How quickly you’ll be paid: It could take a long time to earn the first payout; then it will be monthly.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>The process of signing up for Google AdSense is rather straightforward; however, the activation of your account may take anything from a single day to a number of weeks.</p>



<p>You should give it at least two months before you start seeing any money from ads.</p>



<p>Before you may request a payment, you need to have a balance of at least one hundred dollars in your account.</p>



<p>Your profits will be provided between the 21st and 26th of each month once you have reached the barrier of $100. Receiving payment with an electronic funds transfer can take anywhere from four to ten days while receiving money through a wire transfer might take up to fifteen days.</p>



 Requirements 



<p>Your very own website, which should have been up and running for at least three-quarters of a year.</p>



<p>You need more than one thousand followers in order to use YouTube.</p>



<p>You must be at least 18 years of age.</p>



 7. Become an influencer 



<p>Creating a name for yourself online might also help you earn money in the long run. Did you know that the famous soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo costs between $880,259 and $1 million for a sponsored Instagram post on average?</p>



<p>Keep in mind that even influencers on a lesser scale may make more money now than they did even just a few years ago, despite the fact that it may appear like reality TV stars, musicians, and sportsmen are the most powerful people in this industry.</p>



<p>To become an influencer, you must first cultivate a sizeable audience for your content. Which are the most effective beginning platforms? Instagram and TikTok. These platforms have frequently served as the launch pad for the careers of some of the most influential people in the world who are not celebrities.</p>



<p>If you want to attract a sizable number of followers on Instagram, you should probably familiarize yourself with the best strategies for doing so.</p>



<p>You can generate income as an influencer in a number of ways: by charging for sponsored posts; by opening your own online store and selling products; by including affiliate links in your bio; by selling your photographs; by selling advertising space on your own podcast; by creating and selling merch; by getting paid to appear at events; and so on.</p>



 Quick Snapshot 



<p>Total time: You must commit to it. Setup is quick and simple.<br>How simple it is to begin: Not so simple. It’s an extremely competitive platform.<br>Minimum age: 13 years old.<br>How quickly you’ll be paid: It depends on the partnership.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>Creating an Instagram account is easy, but growing your following is a slow and steady process. Give it a few months for your audience to expand to the point where it can attract enough advertisers to make it worthwhile.</p>



<p>As soon as you have the numbers in hand, it is time to start looking for paid job. This may be accomplished through the use of affiliate networks or by making business proposals to companies with which you would like to engage.</p>



<p>The conditions of your agreement will decide how long it takes for you to get your money; nevertheless, affiliate networks often distribute revenues one month after a campaign has come to an end.</p>



 Requirements 



<p>A dedicated and active following on Instagram for a given Instagram account.</p>



<p>In addition to this, you are going to need to fulfill the requirements of any affiliate network.</p>



 8. Sell photography 







<p>You don’t need to be a professional photographer to make money online by selling your images; all you need to be is someone who likes capturing photographs of a high quality. Websites like Shutterstock and Alamy are great places to showcase your work to potential customers since they are easily accessible online.</p>



<p>When someone uses one of these websites to download a copy of a picture that belongs to a photographer, the photographer is entitled to a royalty payment.</p>



<p>If you are interested in quickly converting your photography into a source of revenue, you should create a listing on Foap, a mobile application that allows you to upload your works and get money by doing so.</p>



<p>When a brand, agency, or any other organization purchases a photo or video from your digital Foap portfolio, the creator of the app divides the revenues with you and pays you half of what they earned. This provides you the opportunity to earn more money from your work.</p>



 Quick Snapshot 



<p>Total time: Buyers must discover you – and enjoy your work. The setup time is only a few hours.<br>How simple it is to get started: If you have a photo collection, you’re halfway there.<br>Age limit: None.<br>The speed with which you will be paid is determined on your sales platform.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>Assuming you have an existing body of original work, it should only take you a few hours to create a profile on a site such as SmugMug, PhotoShelter, or Fine Art America.</p>



<p>The sites provide a wide range of different payment options.</p>



<p>After the 30-day return deadline has passed, payment will be paid by Fine Art America. Messages are delivered on the 15th of each month.</p>



<p>Payment is given at the moment of sale to the payment method of your choice when using PhotoShelter (PayPal, Stripe, etc.).</p>



<p>If you have a balance of at least $5 on your SmugMug account, you have the option to request that payment be made the following month.</p>



 Requirements 



<p>The requirements for each site are different, but in order to sell images, you are required to have full ownership of those images.</p>

With services such as Getaround and Turo, which allow you to rent out your car on an hourly or daily basis, you can turn your unused driving time into additional passive income. You keep the bulk of those revenues, while Getaround or Turo takes a cut to cover the costs of maintaining and monitoring your vehicle while it is being rented out.</p>

The podcast Studenomics included an interview with an individual whose tutoring business brought in $2,100 in extra cash within only one academic year. It is interesting to note that he built up his customer base by increasing his visibility, offering amazing group pricing, and relying on word of mouth.</p>



<p>It is possible that you may have an easier time finding work as a tutor and making money online if you have a degree in education. For a position like this one, it is necessary to either have prior expertise in a language or a degree in that language. It is possible that you will be considered for an online tutoring, teaching, or mentoring role if you have previously delivered a presentation on the subject at a conference or event.</p>

<p>Total time: varies depending on the subject. Some firms may have a weekly availability requirement (e.g., Tutor.com requires 5 hours). Setup can be time-consuming.<br>How simple it is to begin: Students will have to locate you, which may take some time.<br>Age limit: None.<br>How quickly you’ll get paid: Usually rather quickly; typically immediately.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>The amount of time needed to start an online business is directly proportional to the demand in your region. It’s possible that you won’t have your first student sign up for classes for quite some time.</p>



<p>If you haven’t worked as a tutor or made an online course before, you should allot some time for preparation in order to give your pupils the impression that they are making the most of their time spent with you.</p>



<p>Whether you tutor students in-person or online, the amount of time it will take for you to earn money may vary depending on which option you choose; nevertheless, it will probably not be very lengthy.</p>



 Requirements 



<p>You’ll need to have a strong background in a subject that many people struggle with comprehending, such as mathematics, a foreign language, or test preparation.</p>



<p>There may be educational requirements that need to be met. It is possible that in order to qualify as a tutor and start making money online, one must either be currently enrolled in a four-year university or hold a bachelor’s degree or higher from an accredited four-year university.</p>



 13. Drive for Uber/Lyft 







<p>If you have access to a vehicle, you may be able to generate some passive income by working for Uber or as a delivery person. But even if you don’t, you may still use your bicycle or moped to transport groceries and other necessities even if you don’t have a vehicle. Through the use of Free Car Media, Uber drivers who are interested in making even more extra cash off of their car may transform their automobile into a moving billboard. In this scenario, the firm will apply a detachable vinyl wrap on your vehicle, which will feature an advertisement for a certain brand or product.</p>



<p>Do you want to learn how to make quick money driving for Uber? If you operate a side company or another online store, you can offer your wares for sale to passengers in the event that they have an interest in what you provide. However, it is not the case for everyone. On the other hand, if a passenger shows interest in your goods, you may place some of your wares for sale under the driver’s seat so that the passenger could look through them. You have the option of asking consumers to pay the fee via the tip feature in Uber if they do not have cash on hand, generating even more passive income.</p>



 Quick Snapshot 



<p>Total time: This is determined by the market demand.<br>Setup time: a few weeks. It’s not difficult to get started, but you’ll need the correct car and an internet connection.<br>Age requirement: You must be licensed to drive in your area and have one year of licensed driving experience (or three years if you are under the age of 25).<br>How quickly you’ll get paid: Very quick. Either immediately or within days.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>It will take a few weeks to complete the application process, including the background check and the vehicle inspection. Only after the application is complete can you start making money online.</p>



<p>Both Lyft and Uber have the capability to pay you immediately using a debit card or to transfer earnings to your bank account in a relatively short amount of time.</p>



 Requirements 



<p>A vehicle that has four access doors. Additionally, it needs to fulfill additional requirements, such as the year, its physical condition, and so on.</p>



<p>Notify your auto insurance provider of your plans before you begin driving. They will appreciate the heads up.</p>



 How to make money from crypto 



 14. Staking 



<p>After a transaction involving a cryptocurrency has been finalized, it must undergo verification before it can be considered authentic. This is necessary to ensure that the transactions themselves are not fraudulent. This objective can be achieved through the use of either the Proof of Work mechanism (PoW) or the Proof of Stake mechanism. Both of these mechanisms are described further below. The point-of-sale (PoS) method is frequently chosen in preference to the others because it requires no specialized hardware and uses a significantly lower amount of energy than the other methods.</p>



<p>Users deposit their crypto assets into a block as collateral, which is then used to validate transactions in accordance with the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method. Staking is the term that’s used to describe this practice. When a new block is produced, the tokens associated with that block are mined, and then they are distributed to the owners of cryptocurrencies who have chosen to stake their assets. This procedure is carried out each time a new block is produced. The value of the assets that you wager on has a direct bearing on the potential returns that you can expect.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>What you’ll need to get started: You can use your own computer, but you’ll either need some level of technical expertise or the patience to learn it before you can get it up and running. In order to become a lone staker on Ethereum, you will need to stake 32 ETH, which will be equivalent to around $55,000 in September 2022.</p>



<a href="https://www.truesense.com/blog/emojis-in-donor-marketing-know-the-pros-and-cons"></a> Pros<a href="https://www.truesense.com/blog/emojis-in-donor-marketing-know-the-pros-and-cons"></a> ConsStaking is advantageous in that it does not require an initial investment in hardware, and its model uses a little amount of power, which is wonderful news for your finances.Stakeholders on Ethereum that operate their own validator software presently receive an annual percentage return of a little more than 5%, although this value is likely to climb following Ethereum’s merging in September 2022. The annual percentage yield (APY) offered by Solana is only about 6%. It’s nice to have, but it’s nothing to write home about, especially considering the possibility that you’ll need to lock up thousands of dollars to take advantage of the chance.



 15. Liquidity Mining 







<p>The extraction of liquid assets is critical to the success of any business that deals in DeFi. After it has been launched, a new venture has to first achieve a certain level of liquidity before it can be considered tradable in the market. This need must be met before the venture may be traded. Mining for liquidity is one of the strategies that may be used in order to provide the DeFi protocol with liquidity. This is one of the ways that liquidity can be obtained. During this stage of the process, owners of crypto assets have the ability to contribute their holdings to the liquidity pools that are being formed by the DeFi protocols. These pools will be used to facilitate transactions. After that, these assets are utilized in crypto trading, and the users are provided with a Liquidity Provider Token, which is essential for the successful conclusion of the redemption procedure.</p>



<p>In addition to the Liquidity Provider Token that has already been provided to them, the DeFi protocol will continue to award users with the project’s native tokens that have been mined at each block for as long as the user’s tokens continue to be stored in the liquidity pool. This will occur as long as the user’s tokens continue to be stored in the liquidity pool. In addition to the Liquidity Provider Token that they have previously been provided with, this will also be sent to them. The amount of the participant’s assets that they have contributed to the pool is used to calculate the participant’s share of the liquidity pool, which is then converted into a percentage that is applied to the award. This percentage is then multiplied by the number of awards that are given out. Not only do these newly generated tokens provide liquidity miners access to the governance of the project, but they can also be exchanged for rewards of a greater value or for other cryptocurrencies.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>To get started, you will require mining software, which is available for no cost, as well as a computer capable of running the software, which will cost you money. Back in the day, all you needed was a personal computer to get the job done. However, the challenges that must be met continue to get more difficult, and as a result, you will most likely have to invest several thousand dollars in specialist gear. And then there’s the monthly cost for the electricity. It is projected that Bitcoin alone consumes about the same amount of power in a year as Pakistan, which is the fifth most populated country in the world in the same time span.</p>



<a href="https://www.truesense.com/blog/emojis-in-donor-marketing-know-the-pros-and-cons"></a> Pros<a href="https://www.truesense.com/blog/emojis-in-donor-marketing-know-the-pros-and-cons"></a> ConsThe first person whose computer successfully solves a problem will be awarded for their efforts. If you mine a block of Dogecoin, you will be rewarded with 10,000 Dogecoins, which will have a value of around $600 as of September 2022.It’s difficult to come out on top as a solo miner, and it’s nearly impossible to do so if you’re mining Bitcoin. There are businesses out there who are competing with you that have warehouses packed to the brim with thousands of computers.



 16. Lending 



<p>It is possible that you will not always be able to sell your crypto assets whenever it is convenient for you to do so due to the fact that the cryptocurrency market is frequently affected by highs and lows that may be fairly volatile and unpredictable. This is because the cryptocurrency market is frequently afflicted by highs and lows that may be fairly volatile and unpredictable. If all of your finances are invested in cryptocurrencies, this might put you in a precarious financial position since it’s possible that you won’t have enough money left over to pay for your other expenses after you deduct those costs from your cryptocurrency holdings. When something like this occurs, the business of cryptocurrency lending goes into full swing.</p>



<p>If you use your cryptocurrency holdings as collateral for loans denominated in stablecoins, you may be able to receive loans at very low interest rates. These loans may be denominated in stablecoins. This will make it possible for you to maintain your cryptocurrency holdings while also giving you with a enough amount of liquid assets to satisfy your day-to-day requirements and expenditures. You also have the choice to take on the role of the lender in this transaction. This would include providing loans that are denominated in stablecoins in exchange for cryptocurrencies that are kept as collateral.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>Users are able to borrow fractional shares of bitcoin from each other on platforms such as Cake DeFi, which offer annual percentage yields (APY) of up to 5%.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the requirements for lending vary depending on the platform. In the case of Gemini Earn, the interest-earning program offered by Gemini, and Cake DeFi, for example, you run the risk of losing some or all of your investment if the borrower to whom you are lending does not repay their debt.</p>



<p>A significant amount of risk and uncertainty is associated with crypto financing, which is another area that is still in its infancy. This year, notably, a number of different platforms have discontinued their provision of loan services. Gemini informed its customers on November 16 that they might be unable to withdraw funds from the Gemini Earn program. This is a program that pays rewards of up to 8% on assets that customers lend out to other people.</p>



 17. Crypto Insurance 







<p>Because cryptocurrencies and the technology behind them, blockchains, are still in its infant stages, the ecosystem that surrounds them is also in its infancy, which means that the majority of its components are continually being constructed and improved upon. This includes the part of the ecosystem that is responsible for addressing cybersecurity issues. Throughout the course of the preceding several years, a number of significant businesses and exchanges have been the focus of cyber attacks and breaches, which have resulted in the loss of monetary resources, data, or both on the part of the affected parties. The great majority of companies that fall under this category are typically not of a size that would compel traditional insurance companies to take an interest in them.</p>



<p>When it comes to crypto-insurance, this is where DAOs, which are sometimes referred to as decentralized autonomous organizations, come into play. These businesses are thus in a position to cover the cryptocurrency holdings of exchanges and startups alike, so generating profits for their investors and adding an extra degree of protection for the firms that they insure. This is made possible by combining the financial resources contributed by a number of individual retail investors into a single sizable institution. Taking advantage of the opportunity to invest in insurance projects like Etherisc, Medishare, Teambrella, and PAL Network might be a highly profitable choice for investors.</p>



 18. DeFi Option Vaults 



<p>When you elect to trade options and futures, you have access to a wide number of various trading techniques. Nevertheless, if you are interested in participating in the derivatives markets, you may do it in another way if you utilize cryptocurrencies, and this is possible through the utilization of DeFi Option Vaults (DOVs).</p>



<p>Here, all you have to do to make money is deposit your cryptocurrency assets into a vault. These funds will then be utilized by algorithms to trade options in a number of different ways, bringing in profits for you. DOVs, or exchange-traded derivatives, are essentially the same thing as having someone else manage your assets on your behalf; the only difference is that these funds are invested entirely in derivatives markets. Because of both the ease with which they may be implemented and the overall lack of liquidity that existed in the crypto derivatives market before the introduction of DOVs, this strategy has become highly widespread.</p>



 19. Yield Farming 



<p>One more method through which you might profit from your cryptocurrency holdings is known as yield farming. Let’s first look at the analogy of a bank before attempting to comprehend what yield farming actually is. When you deposit money into a bank, the bank will often utilize that money to make loans to others in the community. The bank makes money by charging interest on these loans, and a portion of the money it makes from charging interest on these loans is used to pay interest on your deposits. When it comes to yield farming, a very identical thing takes place.</p>



<p>If you have crypto assets that you intend to keep for extended periods of time, you may contribute them to the liquidity pool of a marketplace by lending them out. Through the use of smart contracts, these pooled currencies are subsequently put to work in order to offer loans and liquidity within the market (explained later in future modules). Every time a transaction is completed on the marketplace, users are required to pay a fee. A portion of this cost is then distributed to the yield farmers as payment for them staking their cryptocurrency holdings.</p>



 All You Need To Know 



<p>Farmers who “earn yield” can make a profit off of tokens or “earn yield” by moving their money into various platforms and wallets, staking their assets to give liquidity to other users, and earning interest on their holdings.</p>



<p>Because it needs price predictions in a market that is unpredictable, this sort of investment may involve an even higher level of risk than typical cryptocurrency investments. To be eligible for incentives, yield farmers need to secure their assets, which otherwise run the risk of being stolen, compromised, or lost.</p>



<p>As users continue to seek to maximize returns on their investments through the movement of assets, yield farming has emerged as a significant contributor to the development of DeFi.</p>



 Watch Out for Scams 



<p>There are countless possibilities to earn money online or from home that can be found on the internet; however, many of these offers are dubious, if not plain fraudulent. Be aware of any “opportunity” that requires an up-front payment, wants you to pay for certification, asks for your Social Security number or any other financial information, such as your credit card number. These are all red flags that indicate you should avoid the “opportunity.”</p>



<p>Are you still confused about the legitimacy of an opportunity? Look through community forums, such as the ones on Reddit, for unvarnished reviews and complaints about a product or service. (For instance, workers on TaskRabbit, Uber, and Lyft each have their own subreddit.) Additionally, check to see if the firm has a profile with the Better Business Bureau. The Better Company Bureau (BBB) offers ratings to businesses based on many variables, including documented complaints, business transparency, and other considerations.</p>

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/solutions/blockchain/"></a>A unique blockchain-based search engine aims to disrupt the search market. 
 The Kin search engine has been developed in Scotland and turns the traditional ad-based, data-harvesting model on its head. 
<p><a href="https://www.betterinternetsearch.com/">Better Internet Search</a>, the Fife based company behind the unique Kin search engine is doing things very differently.</p>
<p>They have ditched the traditional ad-based revenue model that is universally used by search engines, instead they have developed a new model with a community-based ecosystem and revenue share that enables users to participate in the development and success of the platform.</p>
<p>Blockchain and web 3 ideologies are the foundations of the new platform. This not only facilitates the highest levels of user privacy, but also provides a mechanism for community rewards. Users and supporters’ participation within the platform is the catalyst for both community and revenue growth. Digital tokens with a finite supply are used as incentives and recirculate within the company’s ecosystem. The ‘tokenomics’ model used is explained fully in the company’s <a href="https://www.betterinternetsearch.com/whitepaper">white paper</a>.</p>
 Pioneering the Next Generation Internet 
<p>Kin is the brainchild of serial tech entrepreneur, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordonpovey/">Dr Gordon Povey</a>, who filed his ideas for a new type of search engine into a patent (now granted) back in 2017. He then worked with cyber-security expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billatnapier/">Prof Bill Buchanan</a> and his team at Edinburgh Napier University, and with a grant from the European Union’s <a href="https://www.ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet</a> project they were able to demonstrate a proof-of-concept in the lab.</p>

		 
			 
				The first experiments with a digital rewards token used the Scotcoin cryptocurrency and then a partnership with <a href="https://www.partisiablockchain.com/">Partisia Blockchain</a> enabled the company to mint its own Kin rewards token and create an internal ecosystem.
			 
		 
	
<p>The Kin revenue model is based on brokerage (finding what people want to buy) rather than advertising (convincing people to buy what you want to sell) and is effective because online sales are now high and continue to grow. Almost all online sales are the result of searches and advertising tends to reduce the efficiency of this process, and biases decisions in favour of known brands and large advertising budgets. This works in favour of the advertiser rather than the customer, but Kin reverses this bias.</p>
<p>The minting of digital tokens on blockchain via a smart contact ensures that only a limited volume of tokens can exist, and this enables the company to raise funds via token sales to supporters. The <a href="https://www.betterinternetsearch.com/token-sale">first of these</a> opened on 1st November 2022 and on 1st December the tokens purchased will begin to be distributed into supporter’s digital wallets.</p>
<p>The growth of the Kin community (and the continuous need for user rewards) creates a demand for the finite tokens and increases its value over time. Profit sharing provides a fund to buy and recycle tokens within the ecosystem. This gives the token its utility within the ecosystem and liquidity in the wider market. While raising funds via token sales is certainly not unique, it is very rare in Scotland and again underlines this company’s approach to doing things differently in order to disrupt the status quo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The unbranded Kin prototype has been tested by early adopters around the globe and is available <a href="https://search.betterinternetsearch.com/login">for Digital Scotland readers to try</a>. The beta and full release version are scheduled for early in 2023. The above table demonstrates the significant differentiation that Kin has from other search engines in the market.</p>

 Find the pockets of interop
 
 Which companies interop with what other companies; build bridges between the pockets 
 
 
 Interop testing
 
 Don't boil the ocean. Start with small targets. Let the question "what are we trying to accomplish with interop?" guide the targets. 
 Interested in a public assessment framework. 
 Bonnie Yau of IDLab mentioned they're working on a framework, starting from (or modelled after) the Aries Agent Test Harness. 
 
 
 Approaches to Localization
 
 BC Gov gave a demo of a localized wallet app with credential localization using OCA. (Link to demo pending) 
 What other approaches? 
 
 
 What does "interoperable" mean to different communities?
 
 Often gets thrown around in marketing jargon but what are some real metrics for defining whether something is "interoperable?" 
 
 
 Wallet UX
 
 There might be some other working groups focused on UX already. There might be some overlap with interop.

<p>This article explains how a programmable framework of impact evaluators can be built on top of Ceramic in order to distribute rewards to a wide range of community contributors—allowing DAOs to distribute funds more effectively to the people that create meaningful value.</p> What is an impact evaluator? <p>Impact evaluators (IE) are not new. The Bitcoin block reward is likely the simplest, and oldest, example of an impact evaluator. It’s an objective function that takes a measure of the world and distributes rewards based on that measure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1soPQ31ZHkQ">Juan Benet defines</a> an impact evaluator as follows:</p> <code>ImpactEvaluator {
  foreach round {
    m := measure(world)
    w := evaluate(m)
    r := reward(w)
  }
}
</code> <p>The IE runs iteratively in rounds, with each round distributing a reward. There isn’t really a limit as to what the IE can measure and reward. However, it’s important that the measure is fairly objective and as non-gameable as possible. The more objective and immutable the IE is the more powerful it can generally become since actors interacting with it can reason about rewards long into the future.</p> Examples in Practice   Bitcoin block reward: Rewards miners based in <code>minerHashRate/totalHashRate</code>  Filecoin block reward: Rewards miners based on storage capacity they add to the network  <a href="https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/summoning-the-money-god-2a3f3564a5f2">RAI PID controller</a>: Rewards all participants based on the market rate of the RAI token  <a href="https://sourcecred.io/">Sourcecred</a>: Rewards contributors on Github, Discord, etc. based on a weighed page rank algorithm  <a href="https://coordinape.com/">Coordinape</a>: Rewards contributors based on the rating and feedback of other contributors  <a href="https://givepraise.xyz/">Praise by GivEth</a>: Rewards contributors based on how much “praise” they received  <a href="https://www.openq.dev/">OpenQ</a>: Rewards developers for closing PRs  <a href="https://jogl.io/">Just One Giant Lab</a>: Community peer reviews   Govrn <p><a href="https://medium.com/govrn/govrn-governance-model-27603e6dedd9">Govrn</a> stands out, from other projects tracking contributions in a social graph, since it allows projects to create an ontology of various types of contributions, which lets the IE of the DAO dynamically evolve over time.</p> Three Modalities of Rewards <p>There are thee main methods of distributing the rewards of an IE.</p> Rewards From DAO Treasuries <p>The <code>r</code> of the IE comes directly from the DAO treasury that is operating the IE. This can be seen as a way to reward the community of the DAO more effectively than running a grant program, or as a more fair continuous airdrop.</p> New Token <p>With a new token, an IE can mimic the Bitcoin reward curve. This can be seen as a fair launch based on the evaluation criteria of the IE.</p> Governance Shares <p>In certain DAO structures, such as Moloch, members hold non-transferable shares. An IE could easily be made to distribute these sort of shares as well. Here a Bitcoin-like reward curve could be used as well, and could be customized for the DAO in question.</p> Verifiable Data on Ceramic <p>Data written to Ceramic (e.g. using ComposeDB, Ceramic’s decentralized graph database) is ideal for creating verifiable contribution graphs. This is due to three main properties:</p>  Hash linked event logs - all data is stored as streams in Ceramic. A stream is an event log that can be independently verified by anyone who runs a node in the network  Timestamps - all streams are periodically anchored into the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof timestamp of when data was created  Attributable - all streams have one account as the controller and all events added to a stream needs to be signed by this controller. In practice the controller is a blockchain account (e.g. Ethereum address)   Trust Graphs and Evaluations <p>The framework for IE’s should be programmable such that developers can create their own IE for whatever actions they want to reward their community for. In order to reason about what this programming framework would look like we need to consider what data goes into the evaluation.</p> Data Apps on Ceramic <p>Some example of DAO-centric apps that can be built on Ceramic’s data layer:</p>  Issue tracking - who opened and closed issues  Project management - planning and management of projects  Personal contribution logs - individuals can state all the contributions they have made and to which projects / DAOs the contribution might be valuable for (this is the approach MetaCred is using)  Governance forums - proposals, discussions, etc.  Contribution evaluation - data similar to Coordinape or Praise  Knowledge graphs - e.g. Lateral’s Discourse Graph, or Foresight institute’s tech trees   Computation Over the Contribution DAG <p>All data in Ceramic is represented as an <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> DAG. An IE would have a specific CID (content identifier) hash that represents the entire contribution graph and runs the computation over this graph. This will make the computation easily reproducible, as long as it is deterministic.</p> Trusted Seed <p>In order to mitigate the issue of sybil accounts adding random or noisy data, an initial set of accounts that the graph is based upon is likely a good idea. This can be a simple list at first, but it should eventually leverage something like <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/gitcoin-builds-passport-on-ceramic/">Gitcoin Passport</a>. In addition to the initial trusted seed, the set of eligible accounts could grow through attestations according to some web-of-trust-like logic in the IE.</p> Evaluation Function <p>Let’s explore what the IE function will run each round.</p> World <p>First we need to measure the world. We can define a completely verifiable world as follows:</p>  Ceramic Data Models - the IE model would select a set of Ceramic models from which to read contribution data  Trusted seed - the set of accounts that root the trust of the contribution graph  Previously distributed rewards - the rewards that have been distributed in previous rounds  Other data - potentially including data from other sources, such as on-chain state   Evaluator <p>The evaluator itself should be a function with the world as parameters, and return a reward as a list of accounts and value. This function should be easy to implement in a general programming language. Something like Javascript (using <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-ses">Secure Ecmascript</a>) or WASM would make sense.</p><p>The world input parameters could be defined as follows:</p> <code>ImpactEvaluatorParams {
  ceramicData: [CID] // a list of CIDs defining the contribution graph DAG
  trustedSeed: [DID] // a list of initially trusted accounts
  previousRewards: CID // a merkle root of previous rewards
  otherData: CID // other verifiable data, e.g. ethereum state
}
</code> <p>The output of the IE, ideally, is easily claimable on-chain. It could be a CSV file for distributing tokens in Safe. These sort of distributions can be quite expensive as the contribution set grows. A better approach is to use some sort of merkle drop, basically putting the rewards in a merkle tree and allowing people to claim rewards as they see fit. <a href="https://github.com/Astrodrop/shrine">AstroDrop</a> is a good example of this that allows you to easily update the merkle tree. A merkle tree can also be represented in IPLD, which is nice for our compute function. The return value would likely need to return an updated trusted seed, as well, to enable growing of the user set using some sort of web-of-trust model.</p> <code>ImpactEvaluatorResult {
  rewards: CID // merkle root of rewards
  newTrustedSeed: [DID] // an updated list of trusted accounts
}
</code> <p>Ideally subsets of the IE function can be reused as modules and are composable.</p> Bringing Results On-Chain <p>The result of the IE needs to be put on-chain every round so that participants can claim rewards. There are a few different approaches to this outlined below.</p>  Oracles - A trusted third party, a set of nodes, or some sophisticated oracle network could be used to put the merkle tree root on-chain. Ideally there is some dispute mechanism that can be used if the oracle misbehaves. Worth noting is that the IE function should be reproducible / deterministic. This means that it’s straight forward for an outside observer to determine if the oracle behaved well or not  Verification game - A verification game like fraud proofs in optimistic rollups or Truebit. These can be quite complicated to implement but possible as a way to reduce trust assumptions  ZKP - In principle the entire IE function can be evaluated in a zk circuit and the proof posted on-chain. This would make the IE’s completely trustless. However, it would be a quite big undertaking to implement provers for every IE. It would be more convenient to rely on some sort of general circuit. Something like <a href="https://github.com/DelphinusLab/zkWasm">zkWasm</a> or <a href="https://github.com/lurk-lang">Lurk</a> could be good candidates   A Practical Approach <p>In order to bring the programmable IE primitive to as many DAOs as possible a good first approach would be an integration with <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Safe</a> using <a href="https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started">Zodiac’s reality</a> module. Reality is a configurable oracle that uses Reality.eth. It could be easily used to put the root of the reward merkle tree on-chain, attached to some custom logic. In practice, every round some off-chain actor would load all Ceramic streams and associated data, run the IE function over this data (e.g. using <a href="https://www.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a>), and make a call to the Reality.eth oracle on-chain. Other actors can run the same computation over the same data and dispute the result if necessary. Final arbitration could be handled by the Kleros court, for example. Note that, in contrast to normal arbitrations that Kleros deals with, here we have a completely objective outcome that the arbiters will need to judge. They can easily run the computation for themselves to see the desired result.</p> Next steps   <a href="https://app.radius.space/grants/a644017a-fd11-4ae4-8e86-0d0293ddd0c1">Apply for the MVP implementation grant!</a> Ceramic and Bacalhau have put together a joint grant to fund the development of an MVP impact evaluator protocol  <a href="https://forum.ceramic.network/">Share your Impact Evaluator ideas on the Ceramic forum</a>  Eventually there might be an IE that rewards apps adding valuable data to the Ceramic network

 RMI Partners with Energy Web to Build Sustainable Aviation Fuel Certificate Registry, as Part of Ongoing Decarbonization Work with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers&nbsp;Alliance  A digital registry for sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) can give corporate fliers, fuel suppliers, the aviation sector, and its investors confidence to aim higher and scale&nbsp;faster. <p>Boulder, CO — November 16, 2022 <br>RMI and Energy Web Foundation today announced that they will build a digital registry for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates that will bring more transparency to emissions reduction claims about air travel. The registry will also support and accelerate the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels that drastically reduce lifecycle emissions from air transport.</p><p>The registry will support ongoing work with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (<a href="https://rmi.org/saba">SABA</a>), a coalition of corporate buyers and aviators committed to decarbonizing aviation, co-founded by RMI and the Environmental Defense&nbsp;Fund</p><blockquote>“RMI is very excited to see this crucial tool to fruition,” said Bryan Fisher, managing director for RMI’s Climate-Aligned Industries Program. “A transparent, easy-to-use registry built on a rigorous accounting approach will lift public confidence in SAF emissions reduction claims, propel investment in SAF production, and accelerate decarbonization of the aviation&nbsp;sector.”</blockquote><p>SAF is a drop-in fuel made with renewable or waste feedstocks that can decrease the lifecycle emissions of flight by up to 99 percent. Currently, SAF production is insufficient to meet demand from corporate flyers that aim to decarbonize flights taken by their employees and&nbsp;goods.</p><p>SAF certificates enable companies and other aviation customers to pay for the environmental benefits (such as emissions reductions) of SAF, even if the physical fuel is not yet available for their flights. Decoupling the environmental attributes of SAF from the physical fuel will democratize access to SAF’s benefits and catalyze SAF supply at scale. A digital registry in which SAFc can be securely and consistently issued, transferred, and retired is critical to ensure that these certificates represent unique and verified emissions reduction claims.</p><blockquote>“This registry is a wonderful opportunity to showcase how technology can bring transparency and trust to complex supply chains like SAF,” said Jesse Morris, CEO at Energy Web. “And by building the registry open source, the SAF industry can help other hard-to-decarbonize sectors understand what’s possible with digital technology.”</blockquote><p>The registry will enable SAF suppliers, airlines, corporate flyers, freight carriers, logistics service providers, and freight shippers to demonstrate and verify that the SAF and SAFc they invest in meets specific sustainability criteria linked to certifications of each fuel’s supply chain. It will support companies’ ability to make auditable claims about their investments in climate disclosures.</p><blockquote>“The development of the SAFc registry represents the first major milestone for the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, making good on our promise to break down roadblocks and create the tools necessary to decarbonize the aviation sector,” said Kim Carnahan, head of SABA’s Secretariat and Senior Director for Net Zero Fuels at Engie&nbsp;Impact.</blockquote><p>The SAFc registry is expected to go live in mid-2023.</p><p>Media inquiries please&nbsp;contact:</p><p>Alexandra Jardine Wall, Strategic Communications Manager for the Climate-Aligned Industries Program, RMI.

<p></p>
 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/social-tech/"></a>For a while in 2014 I found myself homeless on the streets of Toronto. 
 Here’s what I learned that inspired and informed my passion and ambitions for ‘Social Tech’ innovations. 
 
 Stories and stereotypes – The greatest challenge we face in addressing poverty-related social issues is the dark stereotypes harboured about poor people and grotesquely amplified by the tabloid media. 
 Community knowledge – Angels operate among us, providing charitable services to help the homeless, and knowledge of who/what/where/when is shared by word of mouth. 
 
<p>These insights can help begin to identify where technology innovations could be applied.</p>
 Challenging Stereotypes 
<p>Just a few years before my own experience of homelessness I was a dotcom millionaire, living in a house with an indoor swimming pool and driving a BMW 7 Series, thinking I was the cock of the walk.&nbsp;Fast forward through a series of terrible decisions and disasters and I was a resident of the Salvation Army homeless shelter in Toronto.</p>
<p>So, a poster boy for how a riches to rags tale can happen to any one and testimony to no matter how smart and well off you think you are, every one is just a few mistakes away from ending up on the streets.</p>
<p>This provided a starting point for my learning.</p>
<p>There are often dark stereotypes peddled about the homeless, that they are all where they are due to substance abuse and do little to help themselves, indeed it is broadly applied to all aspects of poverty. Those on welfare are demonized as lazy and taking advantage of the system. Immigrants receive the same treatment. It greatly impacts how they are treated.</p>
<p>In short they are reduced one dimensional caricatures by hate spreaders like the Daily Mail, when the reality is as you would expect, there is a huge diversity of different people with different, tragic stories for how their life journey led them to situations like homelessness. Mine was just one in a sea of other, far worse experiences.</p>
 Social Reporting – Helping Invisible People Become Visible 
<p>So one of the most important steps we can take is to challenge these nonsensical and harmful stereotypes that influence people’s perception of those affected: That the homeless community is made up of every possible human story across the spectrum of life you might imagine.</p>
<p>This led me to the idea of ‘Social Reporting’, ways in which this spectrum can be communicated to an audience such that they too come to this realization, on a large scale.</p>
<p>For example in Canada a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/teen-photographer-portrays-homeless-1.4192340">teen photographer</a>&nbsp;set out to capture the photos and life stories of the homeless around cities in North America, such as the man from Winnipeg who lost his three year old daughter and whose wife committed suicide, published into a book Nowhere to Call Home with a goal of&nbsp;<a href="https://surreyhomeless.ca/news/2017/07/theyve-never-stopped-to-talk-to-the-person-sitting-on-the-corner-of-the-street-they-just-walk-by/">encouraging others</a>&nbsp;to see the homeless as people not stereotypes.</p>
<p>An especially powerful initiative is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/InvisiblePeople/videos">Invisible People Youtube series</a>. The host has spent years interviewing homeless people across the world building a vast library of the most painful human experiences you can be exposed to, entirely destroying the idea that there is a single stereotypical homeless story.</p>
<p>Critically it also highlights that from a Social Tech point of view, it doesn’t have to be advanced technologies like the Blockchain or Ai, but rather it’s simple journalism tools that can achieve the most impact. How we might scale their use to achieve a wholesale societal transformation is the key question.</p>

 Imagine Digital Scotland wasn’t just a brand, an event or this web site, but an actual digital place. 
 Literally, a digitized version of the nation, where you can walk around and meet other people there, a ‘digital twin’ if you will. 
<p>That’s the vision for ‘The Metaverse’, what is described as the future of the Internet, an entirely virtual reality world, brought into the public mainstream consciousness through Facebook’s massive investment into the trend and even the rebranding of their company to Meta.</p>
 Metaverse Innovators 
<p>While the ultimate vision of a single, real-world realistic Metaverse environment is some time away, there is still very tangible innovation happening right now, using different virtual world tools and environments.</p>
<p>For example big businesses like <a href="https://digitalscot.net/nikes-metaverse/">Nike</a> are implementing ‘Nikeland’, a Metaverse world powered by Roblox for their consumers to engage with the brand in a radically new and innovative form, and through the use of NFTs, purchase ‘virtual sneakers’.</p>
<p>To the heart of what Digital Scotland is all about, other exciting pioneers are right here in Scotland, notably <a href="https://digitalscot.net/scottish-schools-pioneering-the-eduverse-the-educational-metaverse/">some schools using the technology</a> to transform how education is delivered, the ‘Eduverse’.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine a more potent and important exemplar – Using the latest technologies to equip our young for what will inevitably be a technology driven future economy.</p>
 Global Scots and Digital Embassies 
<p>For some ideas on what else Scotland could do to harness and be at the forefront of this amazing trend, within a context of an overall national strategy, we can look at our ambitions to be a more connected, global country.</p>
<p>For example the primary function of the <a href="https://www.globalscot.com/">Global Scots</a> program and our embassy initiatives like the Scottish Government in <a href="https://twitter.com/scotgovcanada">Canada</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/ScotGovUSA">USA</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ScotGovGermany">Germany</a>, is to connect Scottish businesses and entrepreneurs with useful contacts around the world, and what better way to accelerate this activity than bringing them all together in a virtual world specifically intended for easily connecting people from across the globe.</p>
<p>Another small, highly innovative nation <a href="https://www.xrtoday.com/virtual-reality/barbados-to-open-world-first-metaverse-embassy/">Barbados has launched</a> the first virtual embassy in the Metaverse, and Scotland could do the same.</p>
<p>There are Metaverse platforms that are especially ideal for this, catering for an event style format, with conference talks, fireside chat networking rooms and vendor exhibition stands. This would be perfect for showcasing up and coming Scottish companies, providing a platform for ‘Virtual Trade Missions’.</p>
<p>Such a strategy would be a massive accelerator for Scotland’s economy, putting us at the heart of what is now the single most important technology trend in the world and boosting international growth for a multitude of Scottish businesses.</p>

<p>The ToIP Foundation is pleased to announce the release of the first public review draft of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0</a>. This document specifies the architectural requirements for the ToIP Technology Stack shown on the left side of the diagram below. (The first generation requirements for the ToIP Governance Stack on the right side were <a href="https://trustoverip.org/news/2022/02/01/the-toip-foundation-releases-its-first-official-governance-specifications/">published in January 2022</a>.)</p>







<p>This first public review draft represents over a thousand collective hours of work by members of the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Architecture Task Force</a> of the ToIP <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Technology+Stack+Working+Group">Technology Stack Working Group</a>. It is divided into 12 sections:</p>



 
 Introduction 



 Terminology 



 Motivations 



 Audience, Purpose, and Scope 



 Example Use Cases 



 Reference Architecture Overview 



 Endpoint Systems and the Layered Stack 



 The ToIP Trust Spanning Protocol 



 Intermediary Systems 



 Supporting Systems 



 Endpoint System Interoperability 



 Integration with the ToIP Governance Stack 
 



<p>It also includes three helpful Appendices:</p>



 
 Consolidated Requirements — a table of all 30 normative architectural requirements broken down by layer 



 Consolidated Views of the ToIP Stack — a set of diagrams showing different ways of viewing the technology stack as a whole. 



 Evolution of the ToIP Stack — a synopsis of the new living document published by the ToIP Foundation — <a>see below</a>. 
 



 The Hourglass Model 



<p>Of the 17 <a href="https://trustoverip.org/permalink/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a> developed by the ToIP Foundation in 2021, perhaps none is more important than #3, the Hourglass Model. It can be summarized as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In a layered protocol architecture, the most successful design takes an hourglass shape where a single “spanning layer” in the middle connects a family of higher-level application-facing protocols with a family of lower-level transport protocols.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Hourglass Model is widely cited as the key reason for the success of the TCP/IP stack that gave us the Internet. Here is a depiction of the TCP/IP “hourglass” from a <a href="https://www.iab.org/wp-content/IAB-uploads/2010/11/hourglass-london-ietf.pdf">2001 IETF presentation</a> by Steve Deering of Cisco:</p>







<p>As this diagram shows, for the TCP/IP stack, the spanning layer is the IP protocol in the middle. For the ToIP stack, the spanning layer is the ToIP trust spanning protocol, as shown in this figure from section 6.2 of the specification:</p>







<p>The importance of the trust spanning layer is reflected in the fact that 60% (18 out of 30) of the requirements in the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0 are for this layer. The full implications of the Hourglass Model — when applied to establishing Internet-wide decentralized digital trust infrastructure — are further suggested by this diagram from Appendix B of the ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification:</p>







 The Public Review Process 



<p>The release of the first public review draft of the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification V1.0 is just the first step in completing the specification. The ToIP Technology Stack Working Group is reaching out to all related industry organizations and stakeholders for feedback. We plan to publish at least one (and possibly several) additional public review drafts before the 1.0 spec is finalized.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">draft specification</a> is available in both PDF and Markdown formats. To provide feedback on the draft specification, please <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/">see the instructions on this page</a>.</p>



 Evolution of the ToIP Stack 



<p>The release of the ToIP Technology Architecture V1.0 Specification for public review is the next major milestone in a multi-year process of fully defining the ToIP stack. To help audiences outside the ToIP Foundation better understand this planned progression of deliverables, the Foundation has also published a new living document called <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/evolution-of-the-toip-stack/">Evolution of the ToIP Stack</a>. This document explains the four major stages of development as illustrated in this diagram:</p>







<p>The Evolution of the ToIP Stack also includes a mapping of existing technologies and specifications to the ToIP technology stack. Since this mapping will evolve both as the ToIP Technology Architecture Specification and the component technologies/specifications evolve, the ToIP Foundation intends to publish new versions of the Evolution of the ToIP Stack at each major evolutionary milestone. You can track new versions of the document <a href="https://trustoverip.org/our-work/evolution-of-the-toip-stack/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In October, the Human Colossus Foundation <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/oca-v1-launch">released</a> the “Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)” and announced the intent to launch the “Decentralised Semantics Working Group (DSWG)”. The DSWG is where the ongoing active development of OCA and future decentralised semantics standards at the Foundation will occur. A month on, the Foundation is officially launching the DSWG and inviting you to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/geneve-new-technology-meetup-group/events/289662414/">join the kickoff call</a> on Thursday, November 17th, at 17.00 CET.</p><p>Decentralised Semantics is an exciting new data domain spearheaded by the Foundation to enable the structuring of unstructured data with morphologic, semantic, and pragmatic accuracy. It is an essential underpinning of our envisioned Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) and guides tooling development for the DDE Semantic Layer (Layer 1 of the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure</a>). One of the first tools we created for the Semantic Layer is the recently released OCA, an architecture for capturing the metadata necessary to interpret and preserve the meaning of inputted data.</p><p>OCA is the Foundation’s proposed global standard for data capture that promises to significantly enhance the ability to define, manage, and use data in terms of simplicity, accuracy, and allocation of resources. The DSWG will maintain the official<a href="https://oca.colossi.network/"> OCA </a><a href="https://oca.colossi.network/specification/">Technical Specification</a>, generate Source Code for open-access schemas, and create and maintain related datasets and assets to benefit the<a href="https://oca.colossi.network/ecosystem/tour.html"> OCA Ecosystem</a> (a reference implementation of the OCA specification). We also expect to discover further standardisation and tooling needs for Decentralised Semantics through the Working Group.</p><p>Paul Knowles and Ryan Barrett will co-chair the DSWG. Paul is a co-founder of the Foundation and the Head of our Advisory Council. Paul plays an instrumental role in identifying and defining Decentralised Semantics. He is also the inventor of OCA, the brainchild of his over 20 years of experience in roles spanning different stages of the data management cycle. Ryan is an independent Tech Lead/Architect with over 20 years of experience building and designing reliable and innovative software systems. He currently represents the Dutch Ministry of Health as a Technical Architect after playing a leading role in the pandemic Contact Tracing and Vaccination Passport systems.</p><p>The Working Group will meet weekly on Thursday at 5 pm CET. We will release more information about how to join the Working Group and contribute on the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/decentralised-semantics-wg">website</a>. For the kickoff call, we will walk through the DSWG Charter, provide an overview of the current status of OCA, give a brief synopsis of the short-term roadmap, and describe the standard <a href="https://github.com/the-human-colossus-foundation/oca-spec">Request for Comment (RFCs) lifecycle</a> for OCA development.</p><p>To learn more about Decentralised Semantics and OCA before the kickoff, we recommend the following resources:</p>  <p>The New Blog Post - “A quest for accurate data (Part 1)” [<a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/accuratedata1">Link</a>]</p>  <p>The Academic Paper - “Decentralised semantics in distributed ecosystems” [<a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3249/paper4-OSS.pdf">Link</a>]</p>  <p>The OCA Technical Specification [<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/634d55c7cb2c9a43206480c1/1666012626086/HCF+Overlays+Capture+Architecture+%28OCA%29+v1.pdf">Link</a>]</p>  <p>We look forward to meeting you at the Decentralised Semantics Working Group kickoff meeting on Thursday, November 17th, at 17.00 CET!</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/solutions/blockchain/"></a>In late 2021 <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/nike-is-quietly-preparing-for-the-metaverse-.html">CNBC reported</a> that Nike was quietly preparing for the Metaverse. 
<p>This included filing several new trademarks that indicated its intent to make and sell virtual Nike-branded sneakers and apparel.</p>
 Nikeland 
<p>Tubefilter then <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2022/03/23/nike-metaverse-nfts-nikeland-users/">explores</a> how the strategy has paid off, describing how Nike partnered with Roblox to launch <a href="https://www.nike.com/kids/nikeland-roblox">Nikeland</a>, which is based on its real-life headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, and is stocked with minigames, where users are encouraged to outfit their avatars with digital versions of the newest Nike drops, like Air Force 1 Fontanka and Air Max 2021 sneakers.</p>
<p>The Drum reports how Nikeland saw 7 million visitors over the first two months and to date received over 21 million visitors, contributing to digital sales now representing 26% of its total Nike brand revenue.</p>
<p>In addition to introducing new clothing items, Nikeland has been emulating gaming’s release-and-refresh approach. During NBA All-Star Week, for example, Nike commissioned LeBron James to visit Nikeland, during which time participants were rewarded for physical gameplay with the ability to unlock virtual products.</p>
 NFTs and Virtual Sneakers 
<p>PSFK <a href="https://www.psfk.com/2022/05/nike-is-taking-over-the-metaverse-with-direct-to-avatar-sales.html">provides an analysis</a> of how Nike is integrating digital products into this new environment. Nike <a href="https://qz.com/2102247/nikes-purchase-of-rtfkt-is-one-step-closer-to-the-metaverse/">purchased RTFKT</a>, a non-fungible token (NFT) studio that produces digital collectibles, including virtual sneakers (just one <a href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/latest-nike-sells-virtual-sneakers-for-186000-in-the-metaverse-20220428">sold for $186k</a>), and leveraged this capability to launch their highly-hyped first-ever digital speaker drop, the <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/nike-and-rtfkt-take-on-digital-fashion-with-first-cryptokick-sneaker">Nike Dunk Genesis CryptoKicks</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A full Web3 experience accompanied the release of the digitally wearable metaverse sneaker NFTs, as Nike leveraged a marketing build-up similar to their massively popular in-real-life product drops and fashion collaborations to promote the direct-to-avatar product.</p>
<p>QZ reports that while they are experiencing challenges for their traditional revenues they are <a href="https://qz.com/nike-is-minting-money-in-the-metaverse-1849589901">Minting Money in the Metaverse</a>, they are the highest-earning brand in the NFT business, generating over $185m in virtual sales.</p>
 Digital Strategy 
<p>Writing for Forbes Bernard Marr describes Nike’s Metaverse and NFT strategy and also critically discusses this within a context of their overall digital strategy, in particular their ‘experiential stores’.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nike’s latest adventures in digital transformation aren’t solely limited to virtual and digital worlds. Its real-world, bricks ‘n’ mortar stores are also becoming showcases for ways the brand is leveraging new technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>In its New York flagship store, the idea is that encouraging users to engage with and experience the brand through sport and technology is equally important as encouraging them to buy products. They can shoot hoops on the in-store baseball court, complete with cameras and video screens to capture and playback highlights in real-time.</p>
<p>They can also customize shoes to look however they like before buying them and get advice from trainers and coaches who are always on hand.</p>
<p>Nike is hoping that technology will create memorable shopping and leisure experiences that will build strong bonds between customers and the brand. This will mean they will be more likely to look for the famous swoosh logo next time they are in the market for sporting goods – of the real or virtual variety.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/solutions/digital-tourism/"></a>As they <a href="https://www.stirling.gov.uk/news/stirling-to-become-world-s-first-fully-augmented-reality-city/">report</a> Stirling Council has launched a ground-breaking Augmented Reality tourism app. 
 It’s another example of Scottish tourism harnessing the latest ‘<a href="https://digitalscot.net/real-world-metaverse-strategies-for-scottish-digital-tourism/">Metaverse</a>‘ innovations for providing exciting, immersive experiences for visitors. 
<p>The cutting edge software will transform the visitor experience to Stirling allowing people to explore the city in a unique and exciting way through their smartphone screen.</p>
<p>Virtual signs will respond to users’ needs, Stirling’s rich history and heritage will be brought to life and interactive games will unlock rewards and incentives.</p>
<p>To access the new AR environment, people simply need to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yourstirling.com/">download the free Stirling XP app</a>&nbsp;and then hold up their phones as they navigate the city.</p>
<p>Stirling Council has invested £200,000 in the project via funding from the Scottish Government’s Place Based Investment Programme.</p>
 Exciting world-first 
<p>Stirling Council Leader, Councillor Chris Kane said: “Offering this complete AR environment across Stirling is an exciting world-first and will revolutionise the visitor experience in our amazing city.</p>
<p>“Stirling’s historic city centre and world-class attractions will be overlaid with interactive information, graphics, 3D models and much more, creating a fully immersive and dynamic experience that no other city currently offers.</p>
<p>“Stirling is already a must-visit destination and this pioneering product will raise the city’s profile and attract more people to come here, boosting the wider tourism economy.</p>
<p>“The new free app will also open up a plethora of fantastic opportunities for local businesses and will make Stirling a more inclusive and accessible place that’s setting the world standard for next generation tourism.”</p>
<p>Stirling’s substantial investment in fibre broadband and BT’s rollout of 4G and 5G in the area has delivered the cutting-edge connectivity to lead other world cities on this innovative technology.</p>
 A first of its kind experience 
<p>Alan Lees, Director for BT’s Enterprise business in Scotland, said: “At BT, we don’t just build the connectivity, we help to build the solutions which will be powered by it to change communities.</p>
<p>“Tourism is vital to the Scottish economy and working with Stirling Council and Seymour Powell we’re excited to be part of this brilliant app, helping to deliver a first of its kind experience which visitors will love.”</p>
<p>Seymour Powell, a tech innovation company with a base at Codebase Stirling, developed the cutting edge software in partnership with Stirling Council and BT.</p>
 Brings the city to life 
<p>Chris Doughty, Head of Immersive Experiences at Seymour Powell said: “The Stirling XP project demonstrates what is possible when cutting-edge infrastructure providers, optimistic and forward-looking public bodies and award-winning designers work together.</p>
<p>“Using Google’s new Geospatial platform, we were able to design a truly immersive experience that brings the city to life by revealing an exciting digital layer, gamifying local history and providing tourists with local challenges that encourage them to go out and explore the city.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have been able to deliver a project which firmly positions Stirling as a world-class digital destination and paves the way for continued, industry-leading, development.”</p>
 Experience Stirling from the palm of their hands 
<p>Neil Christison, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “It is incredibly exciting to see such an innovation showcase Stirling like this.</p>
<p>“AR enables people from anywhere in the world to experience Stirling from the palm of their hands and learn more about this historic and vibrant city in an interactive way.</p>
<p>“It is also great to have a new platform that local businesses can take advantage of and a tool that visitors can use to plan their trips to Scotland.</p>
<p>“We know that tourism is a force for good with an impact that spreads far beyond the industry itself – it benefits our economy, our community and our wellbeing.”</p>
 Stirling is a step ahead of other destinations 
<p>Go Forth Stirling BID Project Director Danielle McRorie-Smith welcomed news of the project and the opportunities it will give the city’s business owners.</p>
<p>She said: “This is an exciting initiative which really taps into the expectations of visitors – especially those of the younger generation who grew up with technology – who are looking for a much more experiential and immersive experience when they come to a city.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see that Stirling is a step ahead of other destinations when it comes to enhancing the visitor experience and we’re excited by the power of augmented reality to tell stories and showcase our amazing city by providing more options for locals and visitors to explore its hidden gems.</p>
<p>“The many independent and national businesses represented by the BID will benefit from a new way of promoting the experiences, goods and services they have to offer – whether that’s through the use of interactive posters and artwork or giving visitors the chance to explore inside buildings without ever leaving the footpath.</p>
<p>“We look forward to the chance to show people in Stirling and around the world exactly what makes our city extra special.”</p>
 Additional info 
<p>The Stirling XP project supports the objectives and aspirations of a number of Stirling Council plans and strategies including the Tourism and Events Plan 2018-23, the Making Stirling a Dementia Friendly City – A Citizen Led Places and Spaces Project and the City Centre Strategy and Action Plan 2022-2030.</p>
<p>The aim of the <a href="https://www.ourplace.scot/about-place/themes/place-based-investment/place-based-investment-infrastructure">Scottish Government’s Place Based Investment Programme</a> is to ensure that all place-based investments are shaped by the needs and aspirations of local communities and accelerate our ambitions for place, 20-minute neighbourhoods, town centre action, community led regeneration and community wealth building.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/solutions/digital-tourism/"></a>From simple web sites through travel marketplaces to Augmented Reality, there are a plethora of technologies tourism companies can harness to boost their business. 
<p>Our Digital Tourism guide is intended to provide a comprehensive review of these many possible options, and distill them into an actionable strategy that Scottish businesses can tap into and utilize for their success.</p>
<p>As well as technology we’ll also highlight key marketing ideas, showcasing best practices for online content marketing that catches the eye of and attracts new visitors to Scottish venues and businesses.</p>
 The Outlander Effect 
<p>In terms of what content to promote a key dynamic is the relationship between TV media and social media, providing the context for tapping into global markets aka ‘Harnessing the Outlander Effect’.</p>
<p>Visit Scotland in particular focuses on the TV hit Outlander, and how the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/outlander-is-a-goldmine-for-years-to-scotland-s-tourism-1-4105964"> huge viewer popularity is translating into tourism traffic</a>, describing it as the new ‘<a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15524809.Outlander_dubbed_the_new_Braveheart_for_boosting_Scottish_tourism/">Braveheart of tourism</a>‘. They produced <a href="https://www.visitscotland.org/binaries/content/assets/dot-org/pdf/research-papers-2/20190314-outlander-effect-2019.pdf">a report</a> specific to this strategy which provides a detailed research analysis, and have packaged an ‘experience’ tour <a href="https://www.visitscotland.com/see-do/attractions/tv-film/outlander/itinerary/">around this theme</a>.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>40% of visitors to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UK</a> are inspired by a film or TV series – with Outlander being the most mentioned for people visiting <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Scotland?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Scotland</a> . <br> Learn more about set-jetting at our new industry website <a href="https://t.co/vhBVxZthWH">https://t.co/vhBVxZthWH</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TapIntoTourism?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TapIntoTourism</a> <a href="https://t.co/fXT8jsGbMt">pic.twitter.com/fXT8jsGbMt</a></p>
<p>— VisitScotland News (@VisitScotNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/VisitScotNews/status/1019128888352440321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
 
<p>For tourism entrepreneurs the trend presents multiple product opportunities. For example <a href="https://www.outlandishjourneys.com/">Outlandish Journeys</a> offers tours that tap into these and other historical Scottish tales.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.thenational.scot/news/18221542.sam-heughan-says-tourist-bosses-late-outlander-effect/">reported in The National</a> star of the show Sam Heughan commented that the Scottish Government were “maybe a little late” to jump on the buzz.</p>
<p>Heughan told Radio Times that tourism bosses haven’t taken the full advantage of the flood of tourists who have come to Scotland to explore the locations of the hit series. He cited a surge in “unofficial” tour operators who marketed themselves as guides around the areas shown on the screen and recommended tourism boards do more to cater to the demand.</p>
<p>“I think Scotland was actually kind of unaware of what’s been happening here for many years, I think we were under the radar a little bit. I think finally they’ve realised, I think Scottish tourism has obviously risen dramatically.</p>
<p>“Doune Castle, that played Castle Leoch, home to the Mackenzie clan in the show, was up 600% in their tourism numbers, there’s so many now unofficial Outlander tours, there’s vast tourism here, so I think people are really realising and the Scottish government as well.”</p>
 Heritage Tourism – Leveraging Scotland’s rich history 
<p>For tourism venues through e-commerce sales of tartan products, Scotland’s heritage offers a goldmine of what is truly valued most in today’s online world – Storytelling that stimulates the mind and soul, and any Scottish company can thoughtfully relate this to their online business to better achieve audience engagement.</p>
<p>The key to capturing this market is content for engaging Internet research. As Digital Tourism Scotland describes:</p>
<p>“Did you know that 90% of travelers research their holidays online and 80% book their holidays online? Digital channels play a huge role in the visitor experience. From dreaming up their ideal trip to sharing it, good digital marketing is essential for any business looking to get the attention of today’s visitors.”</p>
<p>During this research stage tourists aren’t necessarily interested in the logistics of the trip, the hotel bookings et al, instead they are seeking a stimulating experience.</p>
<p>Scotland’s history is a treasure trove of assets that can be utilized towards this goal. Our heritage of folklore, the historic battles and the tales of family tartans all are rich sources of the type of storytelling ideal for eye-catching promotional blogs.</p>
<p>This is the ideal type of content for publishing online to catch the attention of potential visitors planning their vacation, and it’s typically the local residents who are the most expert, so providing them the tools to easily publish it is a key success factor.</p>
 Lanark – Local digital tourism 
<p>As an example for small towns like Lanark there is a goldmine of material to work with. The town has a magical historical story, being the famous location of William Wallace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_Lanark">killing the town sheriff</a> and igniting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence">Scottish Wars of Independence</a>.</p>
<p>It also highlights an important point – Where local town rejuvenation efforts can be weaved into this same narrative, so that it is specifically aligned to tangible economic strategies.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.carlukegazette.co.uk/news/environment/lanark-community-development-trust-unveils-william-wallace-inspired-artwork-to-brighten-up-town-centre-close-1-4790541">Carluke Gazette reports</a>, a project featuring Art Pistol Projects, famous for murals such as Billy Connolly’s in Glasgow, and the local high school decorated a drab close that links the high street with car parks.</p>
<p>Indeed it’s the Wallace Close, with the artwork depicting an aspect of William Wallace’s life in Lanark – from marrying <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Marion-Braidfute-of-Lamington/6000000003646008354">Marion Braidfute</a> at <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/william-wallace-s-church-st-kentigern-s-will-become-a-tourist-attraction-qfjztdc0g">St Kentigern’s Church</a>, to slaying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_Lanark">Sheriff Heselrig</a> before fleeing into the Clyde woodlands.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/social-tech/"></a>Our <a href="https://digitalscot.net/action/social-tech/">Social Tech Digital Nation project</a> seeks to identify, and action, the transformational role technology can play in bettering society, tackling deep issues such as poverty and homelessness. 
<p>‘Social Tech’ refers to Social Technology, the category of technology that seeks to identify and apply how it can enable social transformation.</p>
 Social Business 
<p>First we can consider the broader context of how business in general is taking on an increasingly social role, aka ‘Social Business’.</p>
<p>‘Social Business’ is an evolution that disregards the rule that businesses only make money, and only charities do social good. They define ways of making money that improve the society’s they exist within, as a better commercial strategy too.</p>
<p>it is driven by entrepreneurs who are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eiuperspectives.economist.com/financial-services/motivated-impact-new-generation-seek-make-their-mark">Motivated By Impact</a>. and includes best practices such as ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_investing">Social Impact Investing</a>‘, where we broaden this ideal to society as a whole, that we will all be better off when we’re all better off, the rising tide.</p>
<p>As legendary management guru Michael Porter explains in <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-ecosystem-of-shared-value">this Harvard Business Review article</a>&nbsp;Social Businesses are commercial organizations that synchronize social good and their own profit making.</p>
<p>This may seem obvious but evidence abounds of the cliche that for some to profit others must lose out and suffer. Michael prescribes a new methodology,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sharedvalue.org/about-shared-value">Shared Value</a>, for how this strategy can be understood and implemented, highlighting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Companies must take the lead in bringing businesses and society back together.</p></blockquote>
 Scottish Social Tech Pioneers 
<p>To encourage growth of the trend in Scotland we’ll be showcasing entrepreneurs leading this field, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/gavinneate">Gavin Neate</a> and his venture <a href="https://www.wel-co.me/">WelcoMe</a>.</p>
<p>Gavin is pioneering&nbsp;#Tech4Good, an entrepreneurial solution for ensuring businesses are suitably cognizant of the needs of disabled and visually impaired visitors to their stores, hotels and airports, and also for governments to ensure all their facilities are equally welcoming.</p>
<p>Gavin has won multiple awards for his pioneering work, including the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/business/entrepreneur-behind-disability-focused-tech-firm-neatebox-honoured-at-diversity-awards-3394568">Entrepreneur of Excellence</a> at the National Diversity Awards, winning the <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/business_hq/18881760.edinburgh-tech-firm-neatebox-wins-start-up-award/">Super Connect for Good</a> competition, <a href="https://www.ceo-review.com/winners/neatebox-ltd-gavin-neate/">Best Assistive Technology CEO</a> and the <a href="https://www.digit.fyi/two-scottish-firms-named-tech-nation-rising-stars/">TechNation Rising Star</a>.</p>

<p></p>     <p>Increasing demand for batteries in consumer electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and grid support has accelerated the global market. In the U.S. alone, batteries landed in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2021/11/30/supply-chain-challenge-20-complex-auto-industry-transitions-to-electric/?sh=563ed5cc1192">top 3 imports</a> for September 2021. Globally, EVs are projected to make up <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/26/electric-vehicles-projected-to-make-up-31-of-the-global-fleet-by-2050/">31% of all light-duty vehicles by 2050</a>. This increased demand — in addition to recent proposed legislation such as the EU’s carbon border tax — puts pressure on battery manufacturers, suppliers, and vehicle manufacturers (OEMs) to ensure a safe, secure, efficient, and sustainable global battery value chain.</p>
<p>As demand skyrockets, we’re seeing a surge in new regulations surrounding the composition, manufacturing, usage, and recycling of batteries around the globe. Battery labeling — which includes attaching physical labels to a battery to provide its unique characteristics, such as number of cells, cell chemistry, dimensions, and more — is of particular interest to regulators and battery supply chain stakeholders hoping to increase visibility and efficiency as well as reduce the margin of error in battery recycling, reuse, and repurposing procedures.</p>
                      <p>The European Commission (EC) lays out clear requirements for battery labeling in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02006L0066-20131230&amp;rid=1">Directive 2006/66/EC</a> and amendments to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R1020&amp;from=EN">Regulation (EU) No 2019/1020</a>. EC regulations specify size and location requirements for the label, stating that all batteries must meet these labeling requirements to be placed on the market in the EU. For example, the EU will require batteries measuring above 2 kWh to provide carbon footprint labeling.</p>
<p>The California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) Lithium-ion Car Battery Recycling Advisory Group also mentioned battery labeling in its <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/2022_AB-2832_Lithium-Ion-Car-Battery-Recycling-Advisory-Goup-Final-Report.pdf">final report</a>, released in March 2022. In this report, the advisory group suggests requiring OEMs in California to attach standardized physical battery labels to help with reuse, repurposing, and recycling efforts. The California Air Resource Board (CARB) is also developing a labeling requirement as part of their proposed <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-cars-program/advanced-clean-cars-ii">Advanced Clean Cars II</a> regulation.</p>
<p>At MOBI, we believe that trusted multiparty track-and-trace systems are needed to effectively manage assets in the value chain, enhance interoperability between stakeholders, and empower consumers to make informed purchasing decisions with confidence. In addition to spurring second-life and recycling use cases, battery labeling is also necessary to enable trusted track-and-trace applications for battery manufacturers, OEMs, and consumers, as peer-to-peer traceability requires that all participants reference a standardized framework for identifying assets as they travel upstream and downstream the value chain. Labeling is a foundational element for recording battery State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) data, managing battery-electric-grid integration, tracking maintenance and repairs, managing recalls, and more.</p>
                      <p>In July 2022, MOBI released the <a href="http://dlt.mobi/standards/">Battery Identification Number (BIN) Technical Specifications</a>, which specifies the format, content, and physical requirements for a globally unique identity of battery packs. The BIN is composed of a Battery Manufacturer Identifier (BMI), a Battery Descriptor Section (BDS), and a Battery Identifier Section (BIS), each of which denotes a battery’s specific characteristics, integrated with a unique and traceable identity. Similar to the vehicle identification number (VIN), the BIN is designed to be a physical indelible identity included on the battery’s physical label. The unique BIN number can be included as an attribute in a digital identity such as the one standardized by MOBI called Battery Birth Certificate, which is based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs</a>) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> standards.</p>
<p>Additionally, in 2021 and 2022, MOBI developed a <a href="http://dlt.mobi/citopia-partstrak/">pilot to demonstrate a traceability flow</a> for maintaining a verifiable chain of custody in the EV battery supply chain with multiple stakeholders. In the demonstration, a Battery Birth Certificate containing BIN information such as the battery’s serial number, energy capacity, and chemical composition was issued by the battery supplier. The battery certificate was linked with the Vehicle Birth Certificate (stored in a vehicle’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/self-sovereign-digital-twins/">Self-Sovereign Digital Twin</a>, or SSDT, as defined in MOBI’s <a href="http://dlt.mobi/standards/">VID Standards</a>) when installed by the OEM. When dealing with faulty batteries that were returned to the supplier, RevocationList2020 from W3C’s VC standard was implemented to revoke the vehicle or battery credentials if the components of the vehicle or battery were changed. The Battery SSDT is designed to be linked to a physical label on the battery, so that the physical label can be resolved to the battery’s digital identity, credentials, and other data. We aim to integrate these capabilities developed during the demonstration in the ongoing <a href="http://dlt.mobi/battery-innovation/">Battery SSDT and the Battery Passport</a> initiatives.</p>
                      <p>MOBI’s <a href="https://dlt.mobi/mobi-working-groups/">Supply Chain Working Group</a> is developing a guideline for the industry to use previously mentioned technology components in battery passports for reuse, repurposing, and recycling traceability. The Supply Chain Working Group contributors include Accenture, AIOI, Anritsu, Arxum, ASJade Tech, Aucnet, Autodata Group, AWS, Blockedge, BMW, CEVT, Dana, DENSO, DLT Labs, DMX, Fifth-9, Ford, Hitachi, Honda, IBM, IOTA, ITOCHU, Marelli, Mazda, Nara Institute, ParkMyFleet, Politecnico Di Torino, Quantstamp, R3, Reply, State Farm, Stellantis, SyncFab, Thirdware, TICO, and Vinturas.</p>

<p>Finding a way to easily implement verifiable credentials? 🧐</p>
<p><a href="https://verifiablecredentials.info/">Verifiable Credentials Ltd</a>&nbsp;has 20 years of university research experience that users the most standards conformant, easiest to implement, fully secure, and privacy-protecting verifiable credentials eco-system from a co-author of the W3C Recommendation.</p>
<p>We have had the pleasure to interview&nbsp;<a href="https://spaces.fundingbox.com/spaces/ngi-next-generation-internet-ngi-news-events/20%20years%20of%20university%20research%20brings%20you%20the%20most%20standards%20conformant,%20easiest%20to%20implement,%20fully%20secure,%20and%20privacy%20protecting%20verifiable%20credentials%20eco-system%20from%20a%20co-author%20of%20the%20W3C%20Recommendation">David Chadwick</a>, CEO at Verifiable Credentials and renowned expert on SSI, which will explain to you the beginning of this idea and which are their goals in the future.</p>
 1. Introduce yourself and your company, and what services or products you offer. 
<p></p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials Ltd (VCL) was a spin out company from the University of Kent, led by David Chadwick, Professor of Information Systems Security. The objective of VCL was to commercialise Professor Chadwick’s 20+ years of research into identity management that started with X.500/X.509 in the 1990s, and culminated in a proof of concept Verifiable Credentials prototype at about the same time that the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model Recommendation was first published. VCL applied to the first business-oriented eSSIF-lab call in order to build&nbsp;a user friendly controlled natural language (CNL)&nbsp;GUI for creating the policies that verifiers will need to specify for requesting verifiable credentials from users 1. The GUI allows users to specify their policies in either conjunctive normal form or disjunctive normal form, in the controlled natural language of their choice. English, German, French and Portuguese variants were produced during the eSSIF project. The CNL is then translated into VCL’s JSON-based policy language 2 and stored in an open-source Policy Server, allowing many different wallets and verifiers to share the same policy.</p>
 2. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>One of the unexpected outcomes of participating in eSSIF-lab, was that VCL was introduced to the TRAIN project being run by Fraunhofer. TRAIN allows verifiable credential ecosystems to provide scalable trust in issuers. This functionality was already in Professor Chadwick’s roadmap for VCL, so it was opportune to work with Fraunhofer and to integrate TRAIN into VCL’s prototype.</p>
<p>Shortly after the eSSIF project was completed in 2021, Crossword Cybersecurity PLC (CCP), a UK SME listed on the London AIM stock market, acquired VCL, in order to strengthen VCL’s development and marketing teams. CCP now licenses the Identiproof product, which is a fully standard conformant implementation of the W3C VC Data Model.</p>
<p>Identiproof comprises a VC issuer, a wallet for both Android and iOS, and a VC Verifier, along with background services such as a policy server and audit server. CCP is currently leading the NGI Atlantic project “Next Generation SSI Standards” which is implementing the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VCs) protocol suite. Partners in this project are Spruce Inc from the USA and Fraunhofer from Germany. Interworking tests between Spruce’s (or CCP’s) wallet and CCP’s (or Spruce’s) issuer and verifier are currently taking place, Under this project TRAIN has been extended by Fraunhofer to support scalable trust in both verifiers and wallet software providers, as well as in issuers. A protocol enhancement to OIDC4VCs has been specified in order for TRAIN to be tested between the USA and Europe.</p>
 3. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future? 
<p></p>
<p>CCPs short to medium-term goals are to fully integrate the OIDC4VCs protocol suite and enhanced TRAIN infrastructure into Identiproof, and to add a web-based wallet to Identiproof to complement its existing iOS and Android offerings. Since the education market is one of CCP’s identified markets for verifiable credentials, CCP’s short-term goal is to successfully participate in the JFF Plugfests in order to show that Identiproof is a standards conformant product that can interwork with a whole range of different verifiable credential products from different providers across the globe.</p>
 4. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
<p></p>
<p>CCP’s advice to others who are looking for public funding is to&nbsp;keep one step ahead of the crowd in your R&amp;D work, so that when calls for proposals are issued you already have a very good idea and well worked-out plan of what you want to develop. Ideally, you may already have a proof of concept in your lab.</p>

<p>Early pilot partner Checkout.com, who was instrumental in supporting the development of the Payments Engine, has facilitated more than $1 billion in digital asset merchant settlements through their solution this year. Today, Fireblocks welcomes FIS, the largest merchant acquirer in the world, into its network of partners using the Payments Engine. FIS and its Worldpay solutions already provide card-to-crypto processing services for 4 of the top 5 cryptocurrency exchanges and was the first global merchant acquirer to offer USDC settlements. Together, the payment services providers&nbsp;collectively serve over a million merchants around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the last several years, critical work has been done in the space to address pieces of the payments system,” said&nbsp;Michael Shaulov, CEO of Fireblocks.&nbsp;“From stablecoin settlement to cross-border payments to payouts for creators, we believe that the payments system must be addressed holistically, especially as we see digital assets continue to proliferate into mainstream technologies and the global economy. We have seen a tremendous amount of momentum from some of the biggest names in categories such as creator economies, streaming applications, and ride-sharing apps, who are actively thinking about more efficient ways to remit payments to marketplace participants.”</p>



<p>Following the acquisition of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/accelerating-our-payment-capabilities-with-first-digital-acquisition/#:~:text=We%27re%20excited%20to%20announce,make%20payouts%20in%20digital%20currencies.">First Digital</a>, which brought specialized digital asset payments capabilities to the Fireblocks’ platform, the newly launched Payments Engine provides a turnkey solution for businesses that want to integrate digital asset operations into existing or new products. Utilizing Fireblocks’ Payments Engine, PSPs will have a secure platform to deploy new digital asset payment rails, expanding their capabilities to accept, collect, payout, process and settle transactions using digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The widespread use of stablecoins have made digital asset-based payments use cases very compelling for payments companies,” said&nbsp;Fireblocks Vice President and Head of Payments, Ran Goldi.&nbsp;“Fireblocks’ new Payments Engine will allow PSPs to offer and interact with a new breed of payments technology. We have had the privilege of working alongside the largest PSPs in the world to develop innovative fit-to-purpose solutions to support the next generation of payments products and services. We’re excited to roll out our vision for the payments space with our partners and showcase the results of these collaborative efforts with our customers in the upcoming months.”</p>



<p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology/us-cons-merchant-getting-ready-for-crypto.pdf">reports</a>&nbsp;anticipating that over 75% of retailers plan to adopt digital asset payment services within the next two years, early movers in the payments space like Checkout.com and FIS have already begun taking advantage of Fireblocks’ Payments Engine to offer merchants the flexibility of 24/7 settlement, increasing cash flow, and reducing operational complexity.</p>



<p>“We’re enthusiastic about a wide-scale shift among enterprises and consumers towards digital payment systems,” said&nbsp;Nabil Manji, Head of Crypto &amp; Web3 at FIS. “Together we will enable crypto-native and traditional businesses to accept, manage and settle digital assets so that they may choose their preferred currency for conducting business. This further builds on our relationship with Fireblocks, where we have already teamed to provide enterprise-grade&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fisglobal.com/about-us/media-room/press-release/2022/fis-teams-with-fireblocks-to-accelerate-crypto-adoption-within-capital-markets-industry-globally">digital asset investing and wallet technology</a>&nbsp;to our capital market clients.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to stablecoin settlements, PSPs can use Fireblocks’ Payment Engine for:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Cross-border internal settlement&nbsp;— PSPs can now provide global, multinational companies ability to easily settle finances across multiple currencies with greater transparency 



 Creator/seller payouts&nbsp;—&nbsp;Enabling PSPs to offer payouts to marketplace participants faster and with more transparency in a way that is more suited to micropayments 



 Pay-ins&nbsp;—&nbsp;Allowing PSPs to enable their merchants to accept crypto as a payment method with significantly lower processing fees 
 



<p>“Across the globe, businesses, organizations, local governments, and individual consumers are all emphatically embracing new Web3 and digital payments technologies,” said&nbsp;Max Rothman, Head of Crypto &amp; Digital Assets at Checkout.com.&nbsp;“To that end, through Checkout.com’s partnership with Fireblocks’ Payments Engine, we are able to pioneer new Web 3 solutions for our clients, such as our Stablecoin Settlement solution launched earlier this year. The result is faster, more affordable, and more secure transactions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accessible via its UIs and APIs, Fireblocks’ Payments Engine provides a platform for PSPs to manage their merchants’ money flow in an easy and secure manner. Fireblocks is the highest-valued digital asset platform in the world, currently valued at $8 billion, and has also secured the transfers of over $3 trillion in digital assets.</p>

<p>Several government departments around the world are keen to offer their citizens seamless interactions and engaging experiences, akin to those in the private sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The public sector is often riddled with manual processes, time-consuming verifications, legacy systems leading to low transparency and high costs. Over the years, digitalization has alleviated some of the challenges, but rising threats on privacy, data security coupled with the increasing legislations that enshrine the right-to-be-forgotten such as Europe’s GDPR or California’s CCPA pose new challenges for leaders serving in the public sector.</p>



<p>In the future, we will witness a monumental shift in what citizens will come to expect from their governments – nothing short of how they experience retail or banking in their life. While this digital transformation has already begun in the public sector, technologies such as blockchain are essential foundations that will power the next generation of citizen experiences. Blockchain and, more broadly, distributed ledger technologies will create a core of trust, transparency, and immutability that&nbsp; breaks down information silos, reducing&nbsp; cost all while vastly enriching the citizen experiences.</p>



<p>Infosys is proud to have been part of the transformation that is driving change in the public sector. We are happy to share a couple of examples where Infosys brought our strong capabilities in blockchain to help clients reimagine citizen experiences.</p>



 
 Blockchain helps reimagine public records validation for Riverside County California 
 



<p>Riverside County California relied heavily on security paper and wet signatures to establish ‘trust’ and authenticate records. Citizens often had to wait for the physical copies of verified documents to reach them by post, which led to delays. In addition, easy access to numerous online tools increased the incidence of fraud, making it challenging to verify proof-of-records and physical documents, which was done manually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Infosys Public Services helped create a blockchain-based digital records fulfillment solution for Riverside County’s Assessor-County Clerk-Recorder Office. Built on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework, the new platform can seamlessly verify and authenticate several types of digital records (like land records, births, marriages, and deaths). The solution also bypasses physical paper records by issuing digital documents when a citizen or entity requests them, thereby providing an e-commerce-like experience. The blockchain solution will help Riverside County California achieve cost savings, faster turnaround time, and enhanced customer service.</p>



<p>Read the full case study to see <a href="https://www.infosyspublicservices.com/insights/public-records-validation-process.html">how Riverside County authenticates and delivers digital records with 100% trust to citizens</a>.</p>



 
 Blockchain streamlines professional license issuance and verification for the State of Rhode Island 
 



<p>The Department of Business Regulation (DBR) in the State of Rhode Island chose to pilot a blockchain solution for identity validation, which is a pre-requisite for issuing licenses. The department used paper-based applications to issue nearly 200,000 licenses annually. This led to high operational inefficiencies, greater costs, and a poor citizen experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DBR partnered with Infosys Public Services (Infosys) for its proven expertise in transforming government processes and implementing blockchain technology. Infosys implemented a blockchain-based identity and credential management solution using Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries that can quickly and securely validate an individual’s credentials. The solution is built on the Self-Sovereign Identity Model where citizens are the custodians of their data (i.e., personal data is stored on citizen mobile wallets, not on the blockchain). Instead, the blockchain stores the information needed to cryptographically validate the citizen’s credentials, which is shared with other parties. This solution can be easily adopted by other departments within the state paving the way for greater adoption across the entire state.</p>



<p>Read the complete case study to see <a href="https://www.infosys.com/services/blockchain/analyst-reports/streamline-identity-validation.html">why blockchain was the right solution for the State of Rhode Island</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the buzz, blockchain is proving to be a beneficial technology in the real world across banking, insurance, retail and other industries. Governments around the world are not sitting on the sidelines but jumping mainstream into this disruptive technology to drive citizen-centered governance.</p>

<p>Geneva, Switzerland, November 10 2022&nbsp;<br>“Integrity” and “Authenticity” are the cryptographic data security properties to ensure data accuracy across a digital network, connection, or exchange. Unfortunately, both properties are only sometimes adhered to simultaneously, which leads to security degradation. For example, even if a data source is authentic, it does not necessarily mean that the metadata and data in the message have integrity. This blog post delves into the dualism of the two data security properties and how they translate to data capture and entry processes in a digital system. These properties ensure uncompromised cryptographic data security and provide the basis for structuring metadata and data to preserve the original context of messages at any interaction point in a data lifecycle.</p><p>Data accuracy, the sole standard of data quality, refers to data consistency with reality, where data messages require the following characteristics to be deemed accurate.</p>  <p>Authenticable lineage assures where the data originated and where it moves over time in a chain of interrelated events.</p>  <p>Incorruptible content assures that the data was not intentionally or unintentionally modified from source to target.</p>  <p>Comprehensible meaning provides information about the context of the data and how to interpret and comprehend it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Nowadays, it is common in digital systems to have uninterpretable data from a known source in its original format. Furthermore, approximately 80% of recorded data in today's digital landscape is unstructured, and the trend is towards more unstructured data [1][2]. However, data is more accessible for systems to interpret for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistical analysis if it is tied to structured metadata to provide comprehensible meaning.</p><p>Without “meaning”, even the most secure data won’t provide value because it is difficult to interpret for processing.</p> The integrity of digital objects and objectual relationships <p>Data semantics is the study of the meaning and use of specific pieces of data in computer programming and other areas that employ data. Without a system of interpretation, data has no inherent structural, definitional, or contextual meaning. This interpretation is provided by "metadata", sets of data that give meaning to any stored sequence of bytes. In computer science, an object or objectual relationship can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method [3]. Metadata organises objectual data by using terms associated with a particular object. Any change in metadata could influence the meaning of the data it describes, which is why assuring metadata integrity is as important as guaranteeing the integrity of the data itself.</p><p>Data capture is the process of collecting structured and unstructured information electronically and converting it into data readable by a computer or other electronic device. The process entails implementing structural, definitional, and contextual definitions (“metadata”) to interpret data that adhere to those definitions. In a balanced digital network [4], connection, or exchange, data capture requires messages to be deterministically identifiable and content-addressable to ensure the integrity of the objectual content of the message.</p><p>So, "Integrity" relates to objects. All objects and their relationships MUST be deterministic to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency. An object is deterministic if any operation's result and final state depend solely on the initial state and the operation's arguments.</p><blockquote><p>We can achieve objectual integrity by combining data integrity with metadata integrity.</p></blockquote> The authenticity of digital events <p>Data inputs are sequences of bytes that provide information to a computer in a moment. In computer science, a factual event is an action or occurrence identified by a program that has significance for system hardware or software. Stored sequences of bytes are known as "data".</p><p>Data entry is the process of transcribing information into an electronic medium such as a computer or other electronic device. The process entails storing state changes as recorded events to determine the authenticity of the data origin (the “source”), its status, and where it moves over time. In a balanced digital network [4], connection, or exchange, data entry requires append-only logs to accompany signed data inputs to identify the origin and creation of authentic events at recorded moments so that the inputted data can be considered factual.</p><p>So, "Authenticity" relates to events where cryptographic unicity is the only available tool in the digital landscape. All recorded events MUST be associated with at least one public/private key pair to be considered authentic. Public/private key pairs provide the underpinning for all digital signatures, a mathematical scheme for certifying that event log entries are authentic.</p> The veracity of inputted data

<p>With deterministic data capture and authentic data entry processes, cryptographically accurate data is possible. However, another data security property we need to consider is “Veracity”, the data's truthfulness, which is epistemic, and, therefore, down to human accountability. So, just because a data capture construct may facilitate semantically accurate data, a free-form text field at the capture point would allow the user to enter erroneous data. Unfortunately, technology is not a cure for human fallibility.</p><p>Let's provide the following hypothetical scenario. Suppose I were to enter "Rpbwrt" instead of "Robert" as my first name. The inputted data might have objectual integrity (i.e., the structural, definitional, and contextual characteristics of the data capture are deterministic), it would have factual authenticity (i.e., you could verify that I entered it), and yet I've still managed to enter a typographical error into the system, where the veracity of the data is compromised.</p><p>The quest for "accurate data" is indeed challenging.&nbsp;We will address the veracity of inputted data in part 2 of the series.</p> The Dynamic Data Economy and Decentralised Semantics <p>Although treated as separate security properties, "Integrity" and “Authenticity" are interdependent. As with any successful union, they are interconnected and counterbalancing. For example, the accuracy of data lineage refers to the authenticity of the data origin, what happens to it, and where it moves over time. The accuracy of data contextualisation refers to the integrity of the message content so that all interacting actors can understand its meaning in context.</p><p>At the Human Colossus Foundation, we created and are fostering the development of the Dynamic Data Economy (DDE), the critical infrastructure for a data-agile economy, to empower people and organisations through better-informed decisions. The <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f288b25f9c364d7945e6eb/1660061875006/HCF+DDE+Principles+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Principles</a> define these fundamental security principles (“Objectual Integrity” and “Factual Authenticity”), demonstrating their interdependence. The DDE <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">Trust Infrastructure Stack</a> recognises the differentiation between them, offering objectual integrity to the Semantic infrastructure (Layer 1) and factual authenticity to the Inputs infrastructure (Layer 2). In combination, the two properties provide the necessary cryptographic assurance to data capture and entry processes within any secure digital system, providing the basis to tackle consensual veracity, the primary security principle of the Governance infrastructure at Layer 3.</p><p>Guiding the tooling development for the DDE Semantic Layer is Decentralised Semantics [5], an exciting new data domain spearheaded by the Foundation. Decentralised Semantics refactors the definition of integrity by putting the meaning of data at the core of objectual integrity. This domain provides enhanced data modelling for an evolving data-agile economy comprising distributed data ecosystems where harmonisation between competing standards is essential for data object comprehension in any bilateral exchange. As a result, it enables the structuring of unstructured data with morphologic, semantic, and pragmatic accuracy.</p><p>If you are interested in reading more about data accuracy, <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/home/#newsletter">sign up for our newsletter</a> and stay tuned for part 2 of the series.</p> References <p>When writing this post, we were conscious of the need for accuracy regarding the terms used in this article.

<p>Gitcoin Grants Round 15 (GR15) wrapped up at the end of September, resulting in the distribution of almost $4.4M to 1,495 grants for public goods. In order to ensure that each vote was linked to a human, Gitcoin created <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/">Passport</a>—a reputation system built on Ceramic. Gitcoin introduced Passport during GR14 in June; by the close of GR15, in September, the number of passports rose to 33,515.</p><p>This article covers Gitcoin’s recent quadratic funding rounds (GR14 &amp; GR15), the challenges of sybil resistance and how Gitcoin built with Ceramic—the data layer powering Gitcoin Passport. It also explains how any application can leverage Gitcoin Passport on Ceramic—adding robust anti-Sybil protection and a proof-of-personhood reputation system.</p> What is Gitcoin Grants and Passport?  <p>Gitcoin Grants is the largest Quadratic Funding (QF) application in Web3, having contributed over <a href="https://gitcoin.co/results">$72.5M</a> in funding for a variety of hackathons, bounties, and open source projects since its inception in 2017. The Gitcoin Passport and the Trust Bonus are grants mechanisms that provide identity verification, improve Sybil resistance, increase the cost of forgery, and increase the weight given to grants donations from verified funders.</p><p>Passport is an identity verification utility that uses Ceramic to store personal credentials—making them self-sovereign to the user and allowing them to be portable across ecosystems and applications. By connecting their internet identities to Gitcoin Passport (Facebook, Twitter, ENS, etc), donors were able to receive up to 150% matching bonuses during GR15. The team launched Gitcoin Passport for GR14 and added 11 more verification methods or “stamps” to this <a href="https://go.gitcoin.co/blog/gr15-results">most recent grants round</a>.</p> Sybil Resistance Improves Public Goods Funding <p>Quadratic Funding is the<a href="https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;match=1000"> mathematically optimal way</a> to fund public goods in a democratic community. At the core of QF is its matching pool of funds provided by partners, companies, or protocols supporting public goods projects. The matching pool of funds is used to amplify the individual contributions to different projects. In short, projects undergo a crowdfunding campaign that is matched with funds according to the QF algorithm, where the number of contributors is weighed more than the amount funded.</p><p><a href="https://finematics.com/quadratic-funding-explained/">For example</a>, imagine Project A receives a total of $1,000 in funding from five contributors ($200 each) and Project B receives a total of $1,000 from 20 contributors ($50 each). Assuming a matching pool of $10,000, according to the QF algorithm, Project B would receive over $7,000 of the matching funds while Project A receives about $2,000.</p><p>Essentially, QF incentivizes individuals to contribute small amounts and pushes decision-making powers away from whales who donated a much larger amount. This ultimately creates more democracy in public goods funding.</p><p>While QF is the most optimal way to democratically allocate funds to projects that a community cares about, it is<a href="https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-policy/policy/understanding-potential-attack-vectors/sybil-attack"> susceptible to Sybil attacks</a>. Sybil attacks happen when an attacker pretends to be multiple people at the same time, manipulating a distributed peer-to-peer network and its incentives to their benefit. In Gitcoin Grants, the Sybil attack could mean that a user spreads their funds across multiple wallets and donates to the same project. Since QF weighs the number of donations over the total amount donated, attackers can game the system to receive a larger slice of the QF matching pool.</p><p>To build in Sybil resistance, the Gitcoin team asks users to verify their “proof of personhood” by proving ownership over various accounts and data. Gitcoin Grants integrates with a variety of identity providers (Proof of Humanity or BrightID), Web2 services (Google, Twitter, or Facebook), and Web3 accounts (ENS). The more providers that users link, the higher their ‘<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/a-higher-personhood-score-means-more-contribution-matching/">Personhood Score</a>’ and the more eligible they are for a ‘Trust Bonus’. Contributors begin with only 50% of their eligible matching funds actually being matched. As they verify more providers, they are eligible for up to 150% of their eligible matching funds being matched.</p><p>While the Trust Bonus helps to minimize the impact of Sybil attacks, it isn’t the end solution. Gitcoin has long subsidized these payouts (called a Fraud Tax) to ensure that no grant has received less than it was supposed to due to any detected Sybil attacker. Since<a href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/a-community-based-roadmap-for-sybil-detection-across-web-3/"> Grants Round 7,</a> identity verification has evolved to take several variables into consideration, including training a Machine Learning model to detect adversarial behavior. By introducing these mechanisms, between Grants Rounds 9 to 11, the Fraud Tax paid out by the Gitcoin team has<a href="https://medium.com/block-science/gitcoin-grants-round-11-anti-fraud-evaluation-results-50f4b0f15125"> decreased from 6.6% of the pool to about 0.6%</a>.</p> Why Gitcoin Built Passport on Ceramic <p>In addition to reinforcing the algorithms behind the Trust Bonus, the Gitcoin team long explored the concepts behind Passport as it is today. Primarily, Passport has been designed to adhere to two principles: the data generated must be sovereign to the user, and the app must be built on open standards to be composable, programmable, and portable. Aligning to this vision, Gitcoin built an alpha version of the Passport to issue NFTs attesting to the user’s identity claims that are sovereign to the user and built on the ERC-721 open standard.</p><p>The Gitcoin team believes in the World Wide Web Collective (W3C) standards, specifically that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/"> Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/"> Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) are the best place for personhood information to live; this is what initially drew them to Ceramic. DIDs are globally unique identifiers, mapping a blockchain-specific address to a chain-agnostic identifier that can be used to collect and attest to verifiable claims and credentials.</p><p>It’s particularly attractive that these standards are not blockchain specific, and in-fact, exist across Web2 and Web3 technologies, promoting high levels of interoperability between technology stacks. In addition to being chain-agnostic, VCs are cryptographically signed when they are issued, leading to useful tamper-resistance properties. Finally, DIDs and VCs are abstractions on top of user information and can be leveraged to secure Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</p><p>Ultimately, Ceramic aligns with Gitcoin’s driving principles for Passport: Self-sovereign data stored on a chain-agnostic protocol supported by open standards.</p> How Gitcoin Built With Ceramic <p><a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic</a> is a decentralized data network that brings composable data to Web3 applications. Applications use Ceramic’s shared infrastructure and open API to store, modify, and retrieve data that can be reused or repurposed within other applications—across any blockchain, wallet or account. Therefore, any JSON data can be stored in streams, each controlled by an authenticated DID.</p><p>Gitcoin Passport leverages Ceramic to link a user’s Ethereum address to a DID, enabling users to create and control data streams on the Ceramic network. If a user already has a DID linked to their Ethereum address, the application will not prompt them to create a new one. Users will specifically generate a DID method called did:pkh, which generates a DID from the Ethereum address’s Public Key Hash. Ceramic recently adopted this DID method to align with the<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/"> Sign-In With Ethereum</a> (SIWE) specification—leading to a clean, standardized authentication flow with minimal user interaction and greater clarity around what data is being requested and transferred.</p><p>From the Passport application, as users verify their online identities with various trusted third-parties (BrightID, Google, Facebook, ENS etc), Gitcoin signs and issues “stamps” to the user’s Passport. Since Gitcoin is acting as a signatory in this relationship, these stamps verify and publicly attest the user’s identity claims. Each identity that a user attests is assigned a weight and is used to calculate a weighted Personhood Score that secures the Quadratic Funding mechanism.</p><p>Behind the scenes, both the Passport and stamps are stored as a<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/data-models/"> Ceramic Data Model</a>, which specifies a schema on what the data stored in those streams look like. The stamps are issued as Verifiable Credentials that include information about the identity that has been verified (Google, ENS etc.), to whom they are issued (user’s DID), and the signatory (Gitcoin). Once a VC is issued, it’s then stored on Ceramic streams and controlled by a Gitcoin DID. A reference to the VC is stored on the streams controlled by the user’s DID. The user’s Passport streams are simply a collection of references to the stamps assigned to them.</p><p>The Gitcoin team runs Passport as an app that assigns pre-determined weights to each account a user verifies. In the future, the Passport app will be progressively decentralized as a public utility so that any application can assign custom weights to the issued credentials and calculate its own Personhood Score. For example, a decentralized exchange may weigh a KYC (Know Your Customer) credential higher than a social media verification. On the other hand, an online community for developers may prefer to heavily weigh a Github verification stamp. Since the Passports and credentials are stored on Ceramic, it makes it simple for any application to leverage this data.</p> The Results <p>Gitcoin Grants Round 14, from June 8-23, was<a href="https://gitcoin.co/blog/gr14-results/"> record breaking on all fronts</a>: 44k+ community members contributed $1.7M to over 1250 grants, with a total of $3.2M ultimately matched. In this round, a total of $4.9M was distributed as part of the Quadratic Funding mechanism.</p><p>It was during Grants Round 14 that Gitcoin launched Passport, encouraging users to verify their personhood so that their matching contributions could be increased. Gitcoin users created over<a href="https://cerscan.com/mainnet/family/kjzl6cwe1jw148h1e14jb5fkf55xmqhmyorp29r9cq356c7ou74ulowf8czjlzs"> 22,000 individual Passports</a> during the two-week grants round.</p><p>During that time, Ceramic and Gitcoin co-hosted the Passport Hackathon, encouraging collaboration among identity owners, issuers, and field experts to find solutions to pressing identity verification issues using Gitcoin Passport. This hackathon brought together 270 participants from around the world and 50 submissions to build interfaces, integrations, and educational materials for Passport.</p><p>During Grants Round 15, from September 7-22, almost $4.5M will be distributed to public goods as part of the round, of which $3.1M came from the combined matching pools and $1.3M was contributed by the community.</p><p>This round also saw strong community participation. The number of passports that had one or more stamps by the end of GR15 was 33,515 passports (up from 22,000 passports created during GR14).</p><p>This means that 33,515 users are now able to travel across the Web3 metaverse with their Gitcoin Passport and prove to other applications that they are in-fact a human being. This information can be treated as a public utility—moving DAOs to adopt a one-human-one-vote policy and unlock use cases like quadratic funding, quadratic voting, sybil-resistant airdrops, and improved spam resistance for any decentralized application.</p> Are you building a reputation system? <p>Ceramic is a solution that seamlessly integrates DIDs and VCs along with robust database-like features for users and applications to issue, store, and share their credentials. Accruing credentials in a multi-chain metaverse and associating them with a chain-agnostic DID allows users to portray an accurate picture of their digital reputation and carry that with them into any application they use.</p><p>Here are a few <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/highlighted-projects/#reputation">projects using Ceramic</a> to build robust identity and reputation systems.</p><p>Gitcoin Passport on Ceramic can be leveraged by and integrated into any application, adding robust anti-Sybil protection. If you’re working on a project on identity, credentials, and reputation, Ceramic might be a great fit in your tech stack—join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/6VRZpGP">Discord</a> and we’d love to chat!</p>

Confirm the restore&nbsp;process   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): <p>Can the Lissi Wallet be restored without first exporting the backup?<br>No, if users have not created a backup themselves before it’s not possible to restore the old&nbsp;data.</p><p>Does the backup include all credentials including self-scanned customer cards and PK.Pass files?<br>Yes, the backup includes all data that can be stored in the Lissi&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Can a backup of the Lissi Wallet be restored in another wallet?<br>No, it is currently not possible to restore a backup of the Lissi Wallet within a wallet of other providers. However, we are already in contact with other wallet providers and the community to enable smooth data portability.</p><p>What are the next steps?<br>For now, we focus on a coherent and well functioning backup process. Next, we want to enable data portability to and from other wallets. Further expansion steps include the use of hardware tokens (such as the German identity card) for additional security, as well as the possibility to store the encrypted files using a cloud backup. We will also evaluate other methods (such as social key recovery) and discuss them with the community.</p> About Lissi: <p>Lissi provides convenient applications for companies and organisations to receive, organise and share trusted data from end users while respecting privacy and data sovereignty.

 Deine Daten jederzeit verfügbar mit dem Backup der Lissi&nbsp;Wallets <p>Dieser Artikel beschreibt, was das Backup ist und wie es genutzt werden kann, um im Falle eines Verlustes die Lissi Wallet wiederherzustellen. Dieser Artikel ist auch <a href="https://lissi-id.medium.com/8c12cc3a2c1d">in englisch</a> verfügbar.</p> Was ist ein&nbsp;Backup? <p>Ein Backup der Lissi Wallet sichert vorhandene Nachweise, Kontakte und deren Interaktionshistorie. Falls Nutzende keinen Zugang mehr zur Wallet haben oder das Gerät verlieren oder austauschen, ermöglicht das Backup die Wiederherstellung der Inhalte. Aktuell ist die Funktion noch auf die Beta (<a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/guRQ8LaY">Testflight</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.lissi.mobile.android.beta&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1">Android</a>) beschränkt.</p><p>Das Backup besteht aus einer verschlüsselten Datei, welche die Daten der Wallet enthält, sowie einem Sicherungsschlüssel. Der Schlüssel wird für die Ver- und Entschlüsselung der Daten genutzt. Nutzende benötigen beide Teile (Datei + Schlüssel), um das Backup wiederherzustellen. Der Sicherungsschlüssel wird von der Wallet zufällig erzeugt und besteht aus 12 englischen Wörtern.</p> Die Erstellung des&nbsp;Backups Prozessdarstellung der Schritte zur Erstellung des&nbsp;Backups Lissi Wallet Erstellung des Backups in sechs Schritten:   Wähle “Backup erstellen” in den Einstellungen  Lese den Erklärtext aufmerksam  Notiere den Sicherungsschlüssel  Bestätige den Sicherungsschlüssel  Exportiere die verschlüsselte Backup-Datei an einem Ort, wo du diese leicht wieder findest und diese nicht verloren geht z.B. in deiner persönlichen Cloud  Überprüfe den Status des Backups mit dem Zeitstempel   Wiederherstellung der Lissi Wallet mit dem&nbsp;Backup Prozessdarstellung der Schritte zur Wiederherstellung des&nbsp;Wallets Lissi Wallet Wiederherstellung des Backups in fünf Schritten:   Wähle “Wallet wiederherstellen” bei einer Neuinstallation oder in den Einstellungen bei einer existierenden Wallet  Wähle die Backup Datei (.ZIP) aus, welche du selbst beim Erstellen des Backups gespeichert hast.  Gebe deinen Sicherungsschlüssel ein, welcher aus 12 englischen Wörtern&nbsp;besteht.  Überprüfe den Zeitpunkt des Backups, welches du wiederherstellen möchtest  Bestätige den Wiederherstellungsprozess   Häufig gestellte Fragen&nbsp;(FAQ): <p>Kann die Lissi Wallet ohne vorherigen Export des Backups wiederhergestellt werden?<br>Nein, wenn Nutzende nicht selbst ein Backup vor der Wiederherstellung erstellt haben, ist eine Wiederherstellung der alten Daten nicht&nbsp;möglich.</p><p>Beinhaltet das Backup alle Nachweise inkl. selbst eingescannten Kundenkarten und PK.Pass Dateien?<br>Ja, das Backup beinhaltet alle Daten, welche im Lissi Wallet abgelegt werden&nbsp;können.</p><p>Kann ein Backup der Lissi Wallet in einem anderen Wallet wiederhergestellt werden?<br>Nein, aktuell ist die Wiederherstellung in Wallets von anderen Anbietern nicht möglich. Wir sind jedoch bereits mit anderen Wallet Anbietern und der Community im Austausch, um eine reibungslose Datenportabilität zu ermöglichen.</p><p>Was sind die nächsten Schritte?<br>Wir werden vorerst gewährleisten, dass der Backup-Prozess gut funktioniert und verständlich ist. Anschließend möchten wir die Datenportabilität von und zu anderen Wallets ermöglichen. Weitere Ausbauschritte sind die Verwendung von Hardware Tokens (wie z.B. dem deutschen Personalausweis) zur zusätzlichen Absicherung, sowie die Möglichkeit, die verschlüsselten Dateien mittels eines Cloud-Backups zu speichern. Auch werden wir andere Verfahren (wie z.B. soziale Schlüsselwiederherstellung) evaluieren und mit der Community diskutieren.</p> Über Lissi: <p>Lissi bietet einfache Anwendungen für Organisationen, um vertrauenswürdige Interaktionen und Kommunikation mit Nutzenden zu ermöglichen. Dazu gehört das<a href="https://lissi.id/mobile"> Lissi Wallet</a> sowie unsere<a href="https://lissi.id/institutions"> Anwendungen für Organisationen</a>.</p>

<p>This blog post is written to explain decentralized self sovereign data, snippets of it shared at the <a href="https://www.ifc.org">IFC</a> hosted session on “distributed data ecosystems: heterodox approaches to data portability” at the Singapore FinTech Festival on the 4 Nov&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Let me start with a basic understanding of the economic property of data. It is a “non rivalrous” good. That means one party using it doesn’t deny another party from using it as well. So every institution with data of data subjects (the “producers” of data) can potentially have their data be used by both themselves and the data subject concurrently, if they&nbsp;wish.</p><p>Let’s assume, if you will, that a technology in the form of a <a href="https://www.hubofallthings.com">cloud data server</a>, at a few cents a month, can now be provisioned for a person or a micro SME to be a decentralized legal entity on the Internet, hold any content or data they have rights to with their own set of APIs. This was what was created from more than $10m research funding across 8 universities in the&nbsp;U.K.</p><p>What it means is that data that currently sit in any producer’s server can now sit with data subjects or microSMEs on their own servers. Same data, same entitlements to use the&nbsp;data.</p><p>I will repeat for emphasis. It is now technically and legally possible for 2 identical copies of the same data, one centralized and one decentralized, sitting on 2 different servers with 2 sets of APIs for that data, with the same entitlements and licensing rights to share and transfer the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Which would create better functioning markets? For us, the answer is&nbsp;both.</p><p>The producer’s centralized server has data that is heavily regulated, terribly siloed, badly portable and facing one of the largest market failures in the digital economy can now have the same data in a decentralized form in their own customer servers, now legally transformed into self sovereign data to be used and shared across territories and yet be fully verified by the producer’s server.</p><p>Now you’re probably wondering which organization would allow that. The answer may surprise&nbsp;you.</p><p>The same institutions that may not be so willing to share data through open APIs with third parties are now more willing to decentralize data to data subjects because they obtain better engagement and create loyalty. In addition, they are paid for every transaction of the data, thereby creating a market for the data that they can verify (we call this a data asset) and have painfully invested into over&nbsp;years.</p><p>Since data cannot create a market unless individuals have the right to contract on it, IP rights are necessary. But these IP rights have a great market effect in terms of the distribution speed and scalability of a data asset. It takes only 3 minutes for a new demand side merchant/partner to sign up to a data terminal to receive verified data. No legal or tech integration is necessary with the producer. Across borders. Because the contract is with the individual. So the producer provide the source of truth, individuals transport it, the merchant pays. With the speed and scalability that self sovereign data brings, the revenue multiplier for the producer is significant. This creates an incentive for producers to create and scale their own data ecosystem which I’ve blogged about in an <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/designing-markets-and-scaling-data-ecosystems-1d799e870250">earlier&nbsp;post</a>.</p><p>In a web3 environment, decentralized self sovereign data can move meaningfully between services, carried by data subjects themselves to any service provider. Indeed, the data servers themselves can be hosted by country level custodians. The data is always up to date because there is incentive compatibility and there can be efficient bargaining on the price of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Much like money devolved to bank accounts created markets with payment systems, we expect self sovereign data to create large markets, achieving data at the speed of money as any consumer app can have a data wallet to decentralize data and build their ecosystems across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>This infrastructure is currently scaling up in Malaysia and entering Vietnam, US and Germany in the first quarter of 2023. The stewardship and governance of data flow contracts is under the oversight of a <a href="https://www.hatcommunity.org">foundation</a> set up by the original universities and we welcome public and private sector involvement.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/decentralized-self-sovereign-data-c8dd796d8c12">What is Decentralized Self Sovereign Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things">Hub of All Things</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   On October 18, we hosted a community call to plot a course for future work at the intersection of environmental justice and digital rights. Here's what we discussed.

<p>After publishing our report exploring the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-report-at-the-confluence-of-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">intersections of digital rights, tech and climate justice</a>, we wanted to make space to collectively imagine what it would look like to turn our research findings into action. So on October 18, we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/join-our-community-call-digital-rights-climate-justice/" title="">hosted a community call</a> to plot a course for future work in this area. We were joined by activists, researchers and practitioners who are working on issues such as tech policy, environmental sciences, open data, digital rights, health, indigenous data and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the call we focused on two main themes: 1) environmental data &amp; AI for climate and 2) tech sustainability and decarbonization. While it is hard to capture how much collective energy was in the room, we’re sharing some of the main takeaways from the call below.</p>



 Environmental data &amp; AI for climate 



<p>Participants had a lot of ideas for how the digital rights community could support environmental and climate justice activists. One suggestion was supporting indigenous data sovereignty efforts by helping communities apply this lens to the popular FAIR and open data approaches, and avoiding “imposing AI discourse” and data projects that continue extractive methods. These suggestions overlap with the ways environmental justice and climate justice (EJ-CJ) are connected to other types of justice, such as anti-racism. The group recommended that digital rights advocates support data efforts that focus on environmental racism and identify areas where AI and other data initiatives can harm communities even as they further EJ-CJ priorities.</p>



<p>To bring environmental and climate justice activists into digital rights work in an effective way, digital rights communities should use their skills, knowledge and networks to help strengthen environmental justice and climate justice work. Participants said this could be done by providing advice on secure collaboration and communication, facilitating training on digital security and digital rights and showcasing work that could benefit from exposure. Additionally, EJ-CJ and digital rights communities could do skill/knowledge sharing around such topics as digital rights, environmental racism &amp; AI, tech labour issues, how companies collect and use user data, strategic litigation methods, environmental risk assessment, community engagement and trust-building processes.</p>



<p>Another priority was collaboration and adaptation. Participants recommended “identifying issues and models that demonstrate how data sharing collaboration is possible”, sharing “facilitation methods to identify real and perceived data collaboration risks”, and “bringing data back to the community as a model for sharing”. Others suggested sharing designs and source code “to enable tool use and adaptation”, adapting and designing apps for more intuitive and comprehensive monitoring and mapping work or interoperability, and connecting efforts for broader impact (e.g., linking data governance to spatial efforts can support food sovereignty).</p>



<p>Finally, participants identified four top priorities for how digital rights communities can engage on environmental data &amp; AI for climate:</p>



 
 Understand how vulnerable communities are affected by critical AI questions. 



 Ask probing questions like, “What is meant by green AI? Sustainable for whom?” 



 Address the need for more secure monitoring tools and build “better bridges” between them. 



 Facilitate community convenings that emphasise “diverse spaces and backgrounds”.&nbsp; 
 



 Tech sustainability &amp; decarbonization 



<p>These groups quickly zeroed in on the need for the digital rights community to expand their push for transparency around algorithms, platform governance and other technical issues of companies to include transparency around environmental data. Specifically, participants mentioned transparency around the “environmental impact of data-driven processes”, including data centres, and social and environmental issues around the mineral extraction that digital technology currently requires, especially so-called “green minerals” and supply chains.</p>



<p>Relatedly, participants would like to see digital rights activists demand accountability from social media companies regarding disinformation and misinformation. This might include advertising transparency around fossil fuel and energy companies, limitations and better moderation on greenwashing, misleading environmental claims and climate conspiracies across platforms, including in paid ads/content and increased efforts to promote digital literacy.</p>



<p>Two rights were top of mind: privacy and right to repair. One participant said they want to see digital rights communities “consistently use and promote privacy-by-design tools to prevent data collection by big players”. Right to repair was a popular topic of conversation, as participants wanted to see it enforced for product developers along with fixable software that can be supported in older devices and an end to planned obsolescence, which forces people to constantly buy new devices, increasing extractive mining and its harms to local communities. Said a participant, “Back in the day, people around the corner could fix my Nokia, but now tech companies make it hard”. We’re left with an over-reliance on tech companies.</p>



<p>Participants also identified three areas of cross-sector and cross-movement collaboration:</p>



 
 Connecting digital rights and labour organising by “supporting organised labour [especially in all areas of tech], teaching about cooperatives, building scalable tech frameworks for these movements” and supporting digital literacy across movements. 



 Adapting divestment strategies from the climate justice movement. 



 “Anticipating that the transition will be destructive [and] ‘our’ job as privileged people is to cushion the less privileged”. 
 



<p>Ultimately, people emphasised the urgent need for advocacy around climate reparations, tying many of the above issues together. They pointed out that not only are the people most affected by climate change the least responsible for it, but they also tend to be left out of the solutions, which mirrors other areas of the tech sector. Those most harmed by digital rights restrictions are often left out of strategising and decision-making. A commitment to EJ-CJ and digital rights means imagining and advocating for climate reparations on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>NEWARK, NJ, November 3, 2022  – Dr. Forough Ghahramani, Edge’s Assistant Vice President for Research, Innovation, and Sponsored Programs, will lead a session at the Internet2 Technology Exchange (TechEX) “Leveraging the Cloud for Research” December 5-9, 2022. This annual conference brings together thought leaders in technology and innovation, including researchers, analysts, engineers, technologists, and students. Together, attendees will explore the&nbsp; issues facing researchers and which tools and services could be implemented to better support the global research community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TechEX Conference explores the most critical challenges and exciting opportunities in research and education, with expert-led sessions, tutorials and working meetings in advanced networking, cloud technology, research engagement, identity and access management, and information security. Featured under the research engagement track, Dr. Ghahramani’s presentation session will share findings from the the Ecosystem for Research Networking&nbsp; (ERN) Broadening the Reach (BTR) working group’s workshops and surveys conducted within the community, including the challenges and opportunities as institutions are leveraging the cloud to advance their research and education initiatives.</p>
<p>Many smaller, mid-sized and under-resourced campuses, including minority-serving institutions (MSI), Hispanic-serving institution (HSI), Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities (HBCU), and Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) institutions, have compelling science research and education activities along with an awareness of the benefits associated with better access to cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources. “These schools can benefit greatly from resources and expertise for cloud adoption to augment their in-house efforts,” says Dr. Ghahramani. “By directly focusing on the under-resourced academic institutions in the region, the ERN BTR working group is learning how to better support these organizations by enhancing advanced computing capabilities and research collaboration.”</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope is a specification for the achitecture of a “smart document”. It supports the storage, backup, encryption, authentication, and transmission of data, with natively supported cryptography and explicit support for Merkle-based selective disclosure. It’s designed to protect digital assets including seeds, keys, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Verifiable Presentations (VPs).</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is currently working with multiple companies on the development and deployment of Gordian Envelopes via regular biweekly meetings; <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us</a> if you’d like to be involved. We are also presenting Envelopes as a prospective Informational Draft for the IETF and engaging in discussions with the W3C Credentials Community Group.</p>

 The Envelope as Metaphor 

<p>The name “envelope” was chosen for this smart-document architecture because that provides an excellent metaphor for its capabilities.</p>

<p></p>

<p>These capabilities include:</p>

 
   Envelopes can have things written on them. Plaintext parts of a Gordian Envelope can be read by anyone. 
   Envelopes can have routing instructions. That plaintext information can include data on how to use the Gordian Envelope, such as how to open or close it. 
   Envelopes can contain things. Things can be placed within the structure of a Gordian Envelope. 
   Envelopes can contain envelopes. The Gordian Envelope structure is fully recursive: any part of an envelope can actually be another envelope. 
   Envelopes can have a seal. A signature can be made for the contents of a Gordian Envelope, verifying their authenticity and that they haven’t been changed. 
   Envelopes can be certified. Beyond just guarding against changes, a Gordian Envelope signature can also act as a certification of the envelope’s contents by some authority. 
   Envelopes can be closed. Encryption allows any part of a Gordian Envelope to be protected from prying eyes. 
   Envelopes can have windows. Selective disclosure allows for some parts of a Gordian Envelope to be readable while others have been redacted. Merkle proofs can proof that those parts were present in the original envelope. 
   Different recipients can open envelopes in different ways. Just as people might use letter openers, their fingers, or a machine to open a normal envelope, special permits can grant people different ways to open a Gordian Envelope. 
 

 Why Envelopes Are Important 

<p>The Gordian Envelope is intended as a more privacy-focused encoding architecture than existing data formats such as JWT and JSON-LD. We believe it has a better security architecture than JWT and that it doesn’t fall victim to the barriers of canonicalization complexity found in JSON-LD —&nbsp;which should together permit better security reviews of the Gordian Envelope design.</p>

<p>However, new features of Gordian Envelope not available in JWT or JSON-LD offer some of the best arguments for using the Smart Document structure.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Fundamental Structure:</p>

 
   Sematic Triples. Gordian Envelopes are built on powerful semantic triples, sometimes known as semantic graphs. (Semantic graphs are a feature of JSON-LD.) 
   Known Values. A set of “known values” for regularly used predicates can reduce the size of content within a Gordian Envelope. 
   Structured Merkle Tree. All parts of a Gordian Envelope can be hashed, creating a tree of digests that forms a structured Merkle Tree. (In this variant of Merkle Trees, all nodes contain both semantic content and digests, rather than semantic content being limited to leaves.) 
   Bottom-Up Support. Support for elision, privacy, and authentication is a fundamental element of Gordian Envelope, not an add-on. 
 

<p>Elision Support:</p>

 
   Elision of All Elements. Gordian Envelopes innately support elision for all the elements of their triples: subjects, predicates, and objects. 
   Redaction, Compression, and Encryption. Elision can be used for a variety of purposes including redaction (removing information), compression (removing duplicate information), and encryption (enciphering information). 
   Holder-initiated Redaction. Elision can be performed by the Holder of a Gordian Envelope, not just the Issuer (which is a large advance over most redaction designs to date). 
   Granular Holder Control. Elision can not only be performed by any Holder, but also for any data, allowing each entity to elide data as is appropriate for the management of their personal (or business) risk. 
   Progressive Trust. The elision mechanics in Gordian Envelopes allow for progressive trust, where increasing amounts of data are revealed over time. It can even be combined with encryption to escrow data to later be revealed. 
   Consistent Hashing. Even when elided or encrypted, hashes for those parts of the Gordian Envelope remain the same. 
 

<p>Privacy Support:</p>

 
   Proof of Inclusion. As an alternative to presenting redactive structures, proofs of inclusion can be included in top-level hashes. 
   Herd Privacy. Proofs of inclusion allow for herd privacy where all members of a class can share data such as a VC or DID without revealing individual information. 
   Non-Correlation. Encrypted Gordian Envelope data can optionally be made less correlatable with the addition of salt. 
 

<p>Authentication Support:</p>

 
   Symmetric Key Permits. Gordian Envelopes can be locked (“closed”) using a symmetric key. 
   SSKR Permits. Gordian Envelopes can alternatively be locked (“closed”) using a symmetric key sharded with Shamir’s Secret Sharing, with the shares stored with copies of the Envelope, and the whole enveloped thus openable if sufficient  copies of the Envelope with a quorum of different shares are gathered. 
   Public Key Permits. Gordian Envelopes can alternatively be locked (“closed”) with a public key and then be opened with the associated private key, or vice versa. 
   Multiple Permits. Gordian Envelopes can simultaneously be locked (“closed”) via a variety of means and then openable by any appropriate individual method, with different methods likely held by different people. 
 

<p>Future Looking:</p>

 
   Data Storage. The initial inspiration for Gordian Envelopes was for secure data storage. 
   Credentials &amp; Presentations The usage of Gordian Envelope signing techniques allows for the creation of credentials and the ability to present them to different verifiers in different ways. 
   Distributed or Decentralized Identifiers. Self-Certifying Identifiers (SCIDs) can be created and shared with peers, certified with a trust authority, or registered on blockchain. 
   Future Techniques. Beyonds its technical specifics, Gordian Envelopes still allows for cl-sigs, bbs+, and other privacy-preserving techniques such as zk-proofs, differential privacy, etc. 
   Cryptography Agnostic. Generally, the Gordian Envelope architecture is cryptography agnostic, allowing it to work with everything from older algorithms with silicon support through more modern algorithms suited to blockchains and to future zk-proof or quantum-attack resistent cryptographic choices. These choices are made in sets via ciphersuites. 
 

 Usage of Envelopes 

<p>Gordian Envelopes are a foundational architecture that we expect to support many advanced projects involving self-sovereign control of digital assets.</p>

<p>Currently, it’s being used in two major Blockchain Commons projects.</p>

 
   Crypto-request/response. Requests and responses are specified ways to ask for and send information needed for self-sovereign operations, including when transmitting across an Airgap. Our second generation of requests and responses encodes those communications in Gordian Envelopes. 
   Collaborative Seed Recovery. The <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR system</a> requires the use of Smart Documents to store shares of seeds that have been sharded for backup and recovery. The Gordian Envelope is thus the heart of that system. 
 

<p>There are a broad swath of additional use cases, some of which can be found in our [Use Case Overview of Envelopes] (PENDING). These include:</p>

 
   Self-Sovereign Control of Assets. There are many different use cases for helping users to resiliently control their digital assets, going beyond the specific design of CSR. These include the inclusion of metadata for resilience, the usage of salts to block correlation, and the creation of variable-use permits to allow multiple ways to open an envelope. 
   Educational Credential. All sorts of credentials can be created in Gordian Envelopes, but certifications and other educational credentials are likely to be some of the most popular. These can be credentials signed by accredited institutions or by Web of Trust peers. Elision and third-party manipulation can allow these credentials to be safely passed around for a variety of purposes. Herd privacy features can create even greater anonymity. 
   Source-Control Signing. The standardization of Gordian Envelopes is another of their strengths. Case studies involving source-control signing demonstrate how a field that is currently managed in a variety of different ways could allow for real improvements in security.

 New study highlights policy design principles to maximize benefits of digital identity 



<p>(TORONTO) – November 2, 2022 – The Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) and the Human Technology Foundation (HTF) today released a report titled <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Universal-Digital-ID-Policy-Principles-to-Maximize-Benefits-for-People.pdf">Universal Digital Identity Policy Principles to Maximize Benefits for People: a shared European and Canadian Perspective</a>. This report highlights the latest research, analysis and lessons learned about the ongoing development of digital identity strategies. The report further offers a set of policy design principles to help guide the optimal development and implementation of digital identification policies by governments, institutions and private sector entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This paper has been written with human considerations at the center, to inform policy makers and influencers from the public and private sectors, as well as the general public that may have interest in policy design,” said Joni Brennan, President of the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada. “We hope governments and private sector entities will use the report as a tool to define policy design principles that support a common duty of care for organizations that implement digital identification systems and help enable them to consistently apply that duty of care.”</p>



<p>The report is a joint project of DIACC, a Canadian non-profit coalition of over 100 private and public sector organizations, and HTF, a network of several thousand members that operates in Paris, Montreal and Geneva. It offers 3 core policy design recommendations for decision makers, which are then declined into concrete measures:</p>



  Digital identity policy must be people centered. Digital identity policy needs to be designed above all on a user-centric basis that prioritizes citizens’ needs and rights and puts individuals at the center of the process. People-centered means inclusive, voluntary, resilient, and intuitive for both institutions and people.&nbsp;  Digital identity policy must foster empowerment. Digital identity that empowers companies, customers, clients, and citizens builds confidence in relationships, expands usage, and can promote public participation in community, government and political processes. It must be user-controlled, based on informed consent, and allow for data portability.&nbsp;  Digital identity policy must encourage trust through governance. People gain confidence in services when the functioning and governance of the service is transparent and understandable. Digital identity policy must be transparent, accountable, secure, and future-proofed.&nbsp;  



 Keys to a socially accepted digital identity 



<p>This report focuses on the perception and the impact of a digital identity on different groups within society. It lists the characteristics to maximize the benefits of a digital identity for citizens and companies. One core measure includes reducing the amount of information disclosed, and protecting, when possible, the anonymity of the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital identity is a solution to societal issues. For instance, an effective protection of minors requires their identification and the supervision of their access to online services and content. This cannot be done at the expense of the strict respect for privacy. Thanks to the principle of data minimisation, digital identity meets this challenge” said Eric Salobir, President of the Human Technology Foundation.</p>



 A public-private cooperation&nbsp; 



<p>The report reflects the belief that governments and private sector entities must deeply engage in fast-reacting and smart policy-making on digital identity. It also addresses the issue of including the private sector in the processes,&nbsp; and the elements of governance that can build public trust. It highlights the need for extensive public engagement to inform on the digital transformation and promote inclusive and fair solutions that underpin trust in digital ecosystems as the digital economy continually develops and expands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The risks of not moving ahead with the policy design needed to support transformation will include the loss of the strategic autonomy of the nation, worsening cyber security attacks, and failure to realize substantial economic growth potential,” said Eric Salobir, Human Technology Foundation President.</p>



<p>DIACC and HTF hope decision-makers in national and sub-national governments, along with private sector entities, will use the information herein as a tool to work urgently with all stakeholders to establish inclusive, privacy-protecting, and trustworthy digital identity related policies that empower individuals, businesses, the public sector, and civil society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Coalition of Canada (DIACC)</p>



<p>DIACC is a Canadian non-profit coalition of 100+ private and public sector organizations who are passionate about building a strong, trusted and interoperable identity ecosystem in Canada. Originating from Finance Canada’s task force recommendations on moving Canada into the digital age, DIACC delivered their first mandate to develop a digital identity and authentication framework — now known as the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF). Today, DIACC continues to serve Canadians by driving the adoption of the PCTF that defines a duty of care that citizens, clients and customers should expect while using modernized digital services. This defined duty of care puts people’s benefits at the center while enabling adopters to verify their practice.</p>



<p>About the Human Technology Foundation (HTF)</p>



<p>Created in 2012, HTF is a network of several thousand members that operates in Paris, Montreal, Rome, Brussels and Geneva with the intention of placing the human being at the heart of technology development and putting technology back at the centre of social debates. HTF’s mission is to coordinate international multidisciplinary research projects and serve as an interface between academia, society, and the economy. For HTF members, technology must be part of the solution for building a society that is more respectful of everyone.</p>

<p>The world is going digital, offering unmatched flexibility and potential for global interoperability. Mobile credentials allow users to authenticate with their smartphone and use it as their key to accessing everything from a bar where an individual must prove their age to a government web-based service where an individual must verify their identity. Balancing the wealth of opportunities, however, are the risks of having these new levels of convenience undermine any expectation of privacy. The&nbsp;<a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/l/cp/0BXjjcnX">Privacy-Enhanced Mobile Credentials Working Group</a>&nbsp;within&nbsp;<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">Kantara Initiative</a>&nbsp;is working to help address this challenge, focusing on mobile credentials such as mobile drivers’ licenses (mDL).&nbsp;</p>







<p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@aka_opex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Mitya Ivanov</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@aka_opex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>



<p>According to the PEMC WG charter, the PEMC WG exists “to create a set of requirements and conformance criteria to protect the privacy of individuals holding or using mobile credentials such as mobile Driving Licenses.” This work is being done against the backdrop of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en">ISO/IEC 18013-5</a>-compliant mobile driving license ecosystem. While the ISO standard establishes details regarding the credential itself, more work is needed to provide assurances to the holders of mobile credentials that relying parties collecting their identity attributes will only use those attributes for fulfilling the purposes for which the mobile credential was presented. Failing to respect the consent of the mobile credential holder or the legal authority of the verifier to collect the identity attributes could violate the privacy of the mobile credential holder.</p>



 Expected Work Items 



<p>The PEMC WG is working through a phased approach to writing requirements and conformance criteria for the various endpoints of data flows in a mobile credential ecosystem. This ecosystem describes the interactions of the Issuer, Holder and Verifier, and includes the software, hardware, individuals, and entities at the technical endpoints. In ISO/IEC 18013-5, these are the “Issuing Authority”, “Issuing Authority Infrastructure”, “mDL What about including a simple table where you map the ISO term to the “common language” version? Holder”, “mDL” (credential and holding software), “mDL Verifier”, and “mDL Reader”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of the next one to two years, the PEMC WG plans on producing several reports and guidelines, including an Implementors Report, the Requirements for Issuers, Verifiers, and Providers, and various Compliance Profiles.&nbsp;</p>



 PEMC Implementors Report 



<p>The group’s focus today is on creating the outline that will provide the scope and structure for the PEMC Implementors Report. The mobile credential ecosystem includes people and/or organizations that hold the credential and consent to its use (Holders),&nbsp; issue the credentials (Issuers), and verify the credential as valid or legitimate (Verifiers). Each of those entities has roles, expectations, and responsibilities that must be clearly defined such that later work can build upon that information to develop assessment and conformance criteria. The Implementors Report offers the necessary framing, guidance, and description of appropriate evidence that will allow the group to develop the requirements and profiles needed for implementing the best practices described by the PEMC WG.</p>



<p>The goal is to have this report published by the end of the 2022 calendar year.</p>

 PEMC Requirements for Issuers, Verifiers, and Providers 



<p>Once the initial report has framed the discussion, the group will produce three additional documents that set out the specific requirements for each type of entity in this ecosystem. These requirements will offer a complete set of guidelines that will serve as the basis for allowing assessors to measure whether an Issuer, Verifier, or Holder (and the specific technology they use) is compliant with the privacy-supporting&nbsp;</p>



<p>While not the focus of the group today, the PEMC WG has spent considerable time discussing the requirements in the past, and will continue to flesh them out once the Implementor’s Report is done. You can see the&nbsp;<a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/l/cp/0ozvM0cB">candidate requirements</a>&nbsp;on the PEMC WG wiki.</p>



 PEMC Compliance Profiles 



<p>With almost every requirement comes an “it depends” caveat as to whether that requirement applies in all cases. For example, any requirement about the handling of age data doesn’t apply if there is no age data being shared. Alternatively, there may be a use case where even more stringent requirements for handling that data are appropriate. The general requirements set the baseline; profiles set the details for common scenarios. Profiles cannot add entirely new requirements, but they can specify how the existing requirements must be implemented in the scenario they are capturing.</p>



<p>The final output of the PEMC WG will be these compliance profiles. Exactly what scenarios will be captured will be determined by the working group participants.</p>



 How to Learn More 



<p>Interest in mobile credentials in general–and mDLs in specific–is growing as governments and commercial organizations move to explore the possibilities. If you are interested in helping developing best practice in this space in a way that’s measurable and globally critical, please join us! Information on joining the group is available&nbsp;<a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEMCP/pages/2097681/Participating+in+the+PEMC+Work+Group">online</a>; no mDL required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the past year, my <a href="https://www.dataswift.io">Dataswift</a> team and I have been so busy designing, building and rolling out data ecosystems that we’ve not had time to do much else. Thanks to invitations from friends at <a href="https://www.ctrl-shift.co.uk">Ctrl Shift</a>, <a href="https://www.ifc.org">IFC</a> and <a href="https://www.adb.org">ADB</a> (thank you!) I now have an opportunity to talk a bit about what we do at the <a href="https://www.fintechfestival.sg">Singapore Fintech Festival</a> Distributed Data Ecosystem session, the ADB reception on their sandbox (Singapore) and at the <a href="https://www.openxcongress.com">OpenX Congress</a> (London). This blogpost is the full version of the&nbsp;topic.</p> The view from here:&nbsp;web2.0 <p>Let’s start with how I view data, as someone who has spent many years working on <a href="https://ireneng.com/markets/">markets and ecosystems</a>. In the web2.0 world, data is mostly fragmented, with disparate pieces of information about a person held across companies. This world, which we currently live in, is populated by centralized systems that have made “platform business models” very popular. These businesses usually design, build and operate the technology of all three business layers – service (applications/website), data (traits/attributes of people), custodian (storing the&nbsp;data).</p><p>Each of these layers in the business stack is tightly coupled with one another with centralized technologies. Almost all businesses use centralized digital technologies today, whether single service or platforms, because they are technically very efficient. Coupling between the layers can be made looser for large conglomerates looking to share data amongst multiple apps/services/businesses, but they are often also built in a centralized fashion. Building decentralized systems require a very different mindset but that’s a subject of a different post.</p> Web3.0 <p>In the web3.0 world (which we are actively engaged in), data is self sovereign and decentralized to individuals. This separation of data from service is important because self-sovereign data provide agency and autonomy. By providing the “nodes, pipes and plumbing” of self-sovereign data, our clients’ data wallets and services have greater freedom to operate on more data and can also compete better in vertical&nbsp;markets.</p><p>This separation also matters for regulatory purposes; while self-sovereign data is compliant and portable across all global territories, services on top of self-sovereign data would still need to conform to a specific country’s regulation. For example, our client in Europe who is creating their “Bring your Own” Identity Service using our decentralized data infrastructure would still require <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.electronicid.eu/en/blog/post/qualified-electronic-signature/en">QES</a>.</p><p>Separated from the service, data is more portable, making it possible for data ecosystems to be designed and&nbsp;built.</p> How we design data ecosystems <p>In web2.0 where data is siloed, it is the virtualization of human traits and attributes. Web2.0 tends to focus on aggregation and prediction for better recommendations with better data products, or to ascertain risks of an individual’s behaviour.</p><p>In web3.0 with decentralized self-sovereign data, multiple traits and attributes can now be grouped together across companies, giving visibility to micro-behaviours. These micro-behaviours can be linked up to form journeys that are enabled by data within a data wallet. At Dataswift, we are often called to design these journeys, together with the types of data that form them. These journeys bring the person into a “Phygital” environment – where the physical and the digital interact.</p><p>Of course, getting multiple data sources to decentralize their data requires them to come together to form a data ecosystem. And many of our clients do so, because it reduces customer churn, improves engagement, and cuts their customer acquisition costs. Much like how Star Alliance competes with One World in the airline sector, data ecosystems also create collective stickiness. Most of all, ecosystem owners potentially increase their income because every use of their customer data in the ecosystem earns them revenue (more of that&nbsp;below).</p> The art of the&nbsp;possible <p>With data ecosystems and data wallets, it is now possible to design and intervene in journeys to achieve large-scale outcomes such as ESG goals. This ability to achieve mass coordination while preserving privacy and enabling agency is what’s most exciting about data ecosystems.</p><p>The following are some examples of data ecosystems we have designed for our clients; the illustrations should be self-explanatory.</p><p>This customer journey is the shortest we’ve ever designed. A KYC process takes only 5 mins and yet its reusability is of such high&nbsp;value.</p><p>This journey is quite unique as it involves self-sovereign data of a micro-SME where the individual is a shop&nbsp;owner.</p><p>This journey will probably have huge potential for the measurement of scope 3 emissions.</p> “Phygital” Journeys <p>You will notice that these journeys bring the person into a “Phygital” environment – where the physical and the digital interact. And in doing so, enable the full potential of the metaverse and decentralisation to be realised.</p><p>Of course, designing and rolling out data ecosystems is one thing; using a market to scale it is&nbsp;another.</p> How we scale data ecosystems <p>At Dataswift, we design a data ecosystem for a “triple coincidence of wants” (see my rather dry <a href="http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/160054/">paper</a> on&nbsp;this):</p>  Individuals want better offers and more contextual and personalized recommendations.  Partners want to reach audiences with selected attributes.  The app/website and ecosystem owner wants greater loyalty, better engagement, lower acquisition costs and most of all, to generate revenues from the data they hold of their customers.  <p>So when we design data ecosystems, we adhere to certain market design principles that will ensure that the ecosystem is able to grow, reinforce itself and self regulate. When all this happens, revenues for the ecosystem owner should start flowing in and outcomes are achieved with minimal intervention. For example, it should take mere minutes for a completely new partner to sign up to use verified data when an individual shows up at their business; they should not need to deal with cumbersome tech and legal integration. This is how revenues of a data ecosystem can scale exponentially.</p><p>Data ecosystems usually attract the interest of private equity funds. They often partner us by bringing low-performing investees who hold customer data, so that we can help them achieve a larger multiplier of returns with a data ecosystem.</p><p>One of our most visible ecosystems is <a href="http://sejutakg.my">SejutaKG</a>, which is looking to get the whole nation of Malaysia to lose 1 million kg in weight through changing micro-behaviours and micro-habits, and checking the country’s obesity epidemic while using the market to fund its roll-out. SejutaKG has completed their pilot and would be scaling in the next few months. It is a good example of charities/NGOs that struggle to raise funding or donations and may wish to build a data ecosystem that can generate sustainable revenues for their&nbsp;cause.</p><p>We have many more data ecosystems on our design table. Working with NFTs, stable coins and CBDCs are some we can’t quite talk about yet but we’ll put them out when we can. If you want to earn revenues from decentralizing your customer data and think you need a data ecosystem, we usually ask you three questions:</p>  What micro-habits / behaviours do you wish to incentivize?  What customer journey do you wish to transform /&nbsp;improve?  What impact / outcome do you wish to achieve (as a business and as a community)?  <p>If you have answers for each of these, a data ecosystem may be&nbsp;viable.</p><p>In fact, if you have a “wicked” problem, have thrown money at a collective outcome, have had difficulty scaling data portability and want to gain advantage over your competitors, <a href="https://www.dataswift.io/contact">let’s have a chat</a>. I’m in Singapore for the Singapore Fintech Festival week starting 31 Oct and in London for the OpenX Congress in the week beginning 7 Nov, then in the US for a month from 14&nbsp;Nov.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things/designing-markets-and-scaling-data-ecosystems-1d799e870250">Designing markets and scaling data ecosystems</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/hub-of-all-things">Hub of All Things</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  China: Tracking drugs and medical devices on a single platform
 
 
     

 
              Galderma has implemented a single traceability system for its dermatology drugs and medical products, based on GS1 standards and increasing safety and efficiency. 

<p>The supervision of medical cosmetic products is quite difficult in China, and there are problems with unlicensed and smuggled products in the market.</p>

<p>Current traceability system standards are not unified, various coding standards coexist and each traceability system is incompatible with the others. As a leading dermatology product enterprise, Galderma has three major groups of downstream distributors using various data exchange methods. Some small distributors have no IT system at all.</p>

  Pfizer (Global): Using barcodes to support efficient clinical trials
 
 
     

 
              Pfizer has introduced a single GS1 standard barcode to all its clinical trial products. This is helping those at Pfizer’s packaging and distribution centres to ensure the right products go to the right sites in the right quantities – and providing a base for greater use of barcode scanning. 

<p>To run a clinical trial for a potential new medicine is to confront a challenging and very precise distribution process. Ensuring every healthcare site involved in the trial receives the right products for the right patients – including placebos, or perhaps several different doses of the active ingredient being investigated – is complicated. There is then the further issue of clinicians being certain that the right patient is being administered the right product.</p>

<p>Getting all this correct is crucial to successfully running trials, which are in turn crucial to testing new medicines which could improve treatment options for patients. A clinical trial is a highly controlled environment, and an incorrect shipment or the wrong drug going to the wrong patient could ultimately impact the integrity of outcomes and patient safety.</p>

<p>Several countries now require serial numbers to be present on pharmaceutical products, and forthis data to be transferred from the manufacturer to the regulator. In 2017, the pharmaceutical company Aspen Australia was awarded a significant contract manufacturing portfolio, with many of the resulting products being exported to nations in which such requirements were in place. The firm therefore needed to implement a solution to ensure compliance.</p>

<p>List of recommendations</p>



  Recommendation 1: That the government drive economic growth by prioritizing and investing in the government’s digital identity mandate.  



  Recommendation 2: That the government strengthen alignment with provinces and territories on digital identity initiatives.&nbsp;  



  Recommendation 3: That the government make strategic investments to combat misinformation and disinformation that is impeding the acceleration of Canada’s digital economy.  



<p>Introduction</p>



<p>On behalf of our members, we would like to thank the House of Commons Finance Committee (FINA) for the opportunity to submit this pre-budget submission. As the federal government continues to build a digital government and embrace a digital-first mindset, the Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) is eager to help ensure Canada is leading on digital identity, adapting to our new realities, and playing a leadership role among our global peers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DIACC was created following the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, with a goal to bring together public and private sector partners in developing a safe and secure digital identity ecosystem. Our work is guided by an overarching and deep commitment to trust and duty of care, evidenced by the development of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) — a co-created framework that any jurisdiction and industry sector can work with to ensure business, legal and technical interoperability. Instead of a single solution, the PCTF promotes choice and offers a shared hub that distinct solutions can interoperate through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our submission and recommendations reflect the deep experience and expertise of DIACC’s member organizations, and our collective commitment to the success of verifiable digital identity to secure Canada’s full and beneficial participation in the global digital economy.</p>



<p>Canada’s opportunity to lead on the global stage</p>



<p>DIACC and its members applaud the government for its commitments to date on digital transformation in general, and digital identification in particular. We were encouraged to see digital identity as a priority in Treasury Board President Mona Fortier’s mandate letter, and to see the government announced its Digital Ambition plan which recognizes the need for digital options among Canadians, as well as the need for transformation of public and private-sector organizations as they adopt digital technology solutions to better deliver programs and services.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Yet despite the commitments made, Canada risks getting left behind as the global community embraces digital identity. At the recent 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, a broad range of representatives discussed and <a href="https://www.undp.org/press-releases/global-leaders-usher-new-era-digital-cooperation-more-sustainable-equitable-world">agreed</a> to scale up efforts to build safe, trusted and inclusive digital public infrastructure (DPI) for a more sustainable and equitable world. The commitments included an initial $295 million in funding to support the development and adoption of inclusive DPI, scaling technical assistance and deeper capacity building. The event — called ‘The Future of Digital Cooperation: Building resilience through safe, trusted, and inclusive digital public infrastructure’ — was the first significant gathering of countries to advance the development and use of DPI. This is a sign of the momentum and growing priority both the public and private sectors are placing on DPI and digital identity.<br><br>The time to lead is now, but to do so governments must make solving digital identity, with an overarching commitment to privacy and security, a stated priority now and establish public policy that puts people in control of their public and private sector data. That opportunity — and imperative — comes at a time when Canadians are clear about their expectations around digital identity and the desire for privacy and control over how and which personal information is shared. In a recent <a href="https://diacc.ca/2022/04/04/privacy-security-and-choice-drive-canadians-desire-for-digital-id/">survey</a> conducted by DIACC, 91 per cent of Canadian respondents indicated they want control over their personal data collected by provincial and federal governments, 86 per cent of respondents indicated they want control over personal data collected by private organizations, and 80 per cent said they want a secure and unified digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>It is within that context that DIACC offers three key recommendations in advance of Budget 2023.</p>



<p>Recommendation #1: Drive economic growth by prioritizing and investing in the government’s digital identity mandate.<br><br>While the benefits of privacy, choice, and trust in advancing digital identity are clear, the economic benefits — and related cost of inaction — are significant. More than just a part of driving Canada’s post-pandemic recovery strategy, digital identity has the potential to be a powerful economic driver for Canada. A white paper developed by DIACC member Hyperion found that the impact of digital identity used to improve processes could result in a potential <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Economic-Impact-of-Digital-Identity-DIACC-v2.pdf">$4.5 billion of added value</a> to SMEs and reinvestments in the Canadian economy. Further, in a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/strategy/articles/digital-identity.html">recent study</a>, McKinsey found that extending full digital identity coverage could unlock economic value equivalent to 3 to 13 percent of GDP in 2030, with just over half of the potential economic value potentially accruing to individuals.<br><br>Yet the cost of inaction on digital identity goes beyond the loss of potential economic growth and failure to reach Canada’s economic potential. <a href="https://diacc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Economic-Impact-of-Digital-Identity-DIACC-v2.pdf">Other countries</a> prioritizing identity solutions have begun looking for ways to expand beyond their borders by promoting their digital identity solutions and using their own experiences as a role model for new initiatives, bringing with it revenue potential by letting other countries leverage existing solutions, platforms or infrastructure.<br><br>The strength of Canada’s economic future depends on strategic digital investments making digital identity a priority, and ensuring Canadians can completely and securely participate in the global digital economy.<br><br>Recommendation #2: Strengthen alignment with provinces and territories on digital identity initiatives.<br><br>Multiple Canadian provinces have either launched or made investments in digital identity products and services, yet federal funding and cohesive leadership remains the missing piece. Alberta and British Columbia have launched digital identification, with BC including a mobile card and a Verify by Video option. Significant investments have been made in Ontario and Québec, where proof of vaccination credentials have been launched. Saskatchewan, Yukon, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick are launching pilots, proof of concepts and digital identity components.<br><br>There is demand for and interest in enabling capability across the country — but unequal funding and approaches developed in silos pose a risk. Without cohesive federal leadership, these systems will be disjointed and miss the opportunity to be truly interoperable, efficient and useful for all Canadians. Unlocking these opportunities in a synchronized and equitable manner will ensure Canadians can all access economic opportunities, public services and the chance to manage their own personal information in a safe and controlled way in our digital economy.<br><br>Recommendation #3: Make strategic investments to combat misinformation and disinformation that is impeding the acceleration of Canada’s digital economy. <br><br>According to Statistics Canada, during the pandemic a full 96 per cent of Canadians who searched for and found COVID-19 information online said they suspected the information was misleading, false or inaccurate. Among these, one-quarter saw misinformation multiple times a day. Only four per cent said they never saw misinformation, and 40 per cent of Canadians said they saw information they believed to be true, then later realized it was not.<br><br>Trust in online information, media and government organizations, and the perceived lack of privacy, can be seen on the decline over the years. So it is no surprise that there is so much confusion and mistrust around the benefits and privacy protections gained by implementing digital identity solutions and services.<br><br>Canadians need to feel safe and in control of their information when they engage online. Core to that safety is privacy, security and choice in how they share personal information online. In order to increase trust and maximize the economic benefits of digital identity, we need government-led public education campaigns and initiatives that speak to the facts around digital identity including privacy, security and benefits to Canadians as the world shifts to a digital economy.<br><br>Conclusion <br><br>While Canada has made significant strides in prioritizing digital identity and the shift to a digital economy, there is still work to do on the path to an inclusive, privacy-enhancing digital identity strategy that works for all Canadians.<br><br>As a creation of the federal government’s Task Force for the Payments System Review, DIACC wants to support the government in empowering individuals, increasing government efficiency, strengthening companies, and uniting communities across the country with secure access to resources, economic development, trust and support. Our organization and its members are committed to helping the government continue to unlock opportunities for Canadians, decrease costs for governments, consumers and business, improve service delivery, and drive GDP growth. We believe these three recommendations will get us there.<br><br>Thank you once again for the opportunity to provide our input in advance of Budget 2023 and as we collectively move forward on the path to a digitally and economically prosperous Canada.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Energy Web is working with Shell on Avelia, a digital platform for scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), one of the most promising new technologies for reaching net zero in the aviation&nbsp;sector.</p><p>All areas of the economy need to reach net zero in the coming decades. This will be much more straightforward for some sectors than others. In many cases, the deciding factor will be the speed at which technologies develop.</p><p>One way of thinking about large-scale decarbonization is as a triangle with three points, all three of which need to be spoken for to drive change at&nbsp;pace:</p>  Technology: We need technologies which can replace current ways of doing things with low-carbon options — such as electric vehicles replacing petrol&nbsp;cars  Clear targets: On top of the desire to want to reach net zero, we need to maintain clear targets to make sure we progress towards our end&nbsp;goal.  Economics: We need the economic drivers which will make switching to new technologies and approaches financially viable.  <p>For the aviation sector, governments around the world made a major step last month towards evidencing the middle of these three points. At the assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the air transport division of the United Nations, <a href="https://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/States-adopts-netzero-2050-aspirational-goal-for-international-flight-operations.aspx">184 countries signed a landmark treaty</a> agreeing to target net zero carbon emissions for air transport by&nbsp;2050.</p><p>The sector will require major changes to hit this long-term goal in the time allotted, from all actors in the industry, and progress has to start now. Aviation is currently responsible for around 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. With the total number of passengers globally expected to continue growing as flights become more accessible, this is only set to increase.</p><p>Flying, however, has typically been a difficult area for emissions reductions, primarily because the technologies simply don’t yet exist to completely replace the kerosene-powered jet engines which are responsible for emissions.</p><p>Manufacturers and engineers are working hard on this central problem. Airbus’ <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/zero-emission/hydrogen/zeroe">ZEROe concept aircraft</a> explore hydrogen-powered propulsion for zero-emission flight. And <a href="https://www.afar.com/magazine/electric-planes-are-coming-sooner-than-you-think#:~:text=The%20largest%20electric%20plane%20in,BAE%20Systems)%20with%20electric%20batteries.">United will start flying</a> Heart’s 19-seat ES-19 electric aircraft in 2026 for short-hop journeys.</p><p>But these aircraft and the associated infrastructure for fuelling and charging may be decades off from widespread use. And for greater uptake for longer-ranges, electric aircraft will require major battery technology improvements.</p><p>Over the past decades, much improvement has come from advances in flight efficiency through improvements to aerodynamics, engines, weight distribution, and&nbsp;routing.</p><p>But what goes in the engines is proving to be just as important. One of the most promising areas for emissions reductions right now is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a fuel which can be mixed with regular jet fuel and be used without having to modify the jet engine, and is made of renewable sources such as plant or animal material — including cooking oil, urban and agricultural waste, and even&nbsp;algae.</p><p>Over the lifecycle of an aircraft, it can reduce emissions by up to 80%, and has already been successfully deployed by some industry actors, with around 450,000 flights having already used it. It’s a great example of a technology which, if supported correctly, can be worked seamlessly into existing operations to cut emissions.</p><p>There are problems though. SAF is currently much more expensive than traditional jet fuel — often double the price. For all the net zero goodwill, airlines simply can’t operate without workable&nbsp;costs.</p><p>In addition to the massive demand from airlines for this fuel, it’s also scarce. In 2021, 100 million litres of SAF were produced — against the global aviation’s typical yearly usage of <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/sustainable-flying-blog/why-saf-is-the-future-of-aviation/">360 billion litres</a> of jet fuel, accounting for less than 0.03% of industry consumption.</p><p>We’re working with Shell, one of the largest energy companies in the world and a founding member of Energy Web, as well as Accenture and American Express, on a blockchain powered book-and-claim solution that provides fully traceable SAF purchases, to help scale&nbsp;SAF.</p><p>It works like this: corporate travelers use Avelia’s book-and-claim system to purchase a share of SAF for the flight they are taking. If SAF isn’t available on that flight, then the total equivalent SAF paid for is used by another flight — contributing to the overall demand for the fuel, and allowing travelers to claim a purchase. The environmental benefits of this purchase are then recorded in the company’s favor.</p><p>This has benefits for everyone. Airlines access the buying power of corporations for SAF needs, while companies can use the traceable attributes Avelia provides to meet their own sustainability targets, and one day include them as part of corporate reporting.</p><p>The ultimate goal of Avelia is to create and evidence the demand necessary to help SAF to scale up. By creating a straightforward and transparent way to purchase SAF, we send clear buying signals to the market, giving SAF suppliers the confidence to invest in ramping up production.</p><p>At the same time, by furthering investment in production, Avelia will help to lower the price of SAF for all airlines. In this way, we’re contributing to the third point on the decarbonization triangle above: by facilitating the economic drivers needed to make SAF more accessible, we’re aiming to turbocharge its&nbsp;uptake.</p><p>Green Proofs, which you can<a href="https://www.energyweb.org/solutions/green-proofs/"> read more about here</a>, is our solution for registering and tracking low-carbon products — like SAF — in a traceable, efficient manner, helping to validate proof of ownership and environmental benefit for corporate customers.</p><p>In 2022, SAF saw <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/sustainable-aviation-fuels/">$17.0 Billion in forward purchase agreements</a> — fantastic progress. But we need a lot more. With Avelia, we’re hoping to help share the costs of SAF across companies, airlines and travellers, to help the SAF industry — and aviation’s net zero transition — to take off.<br>You can visit Avelia’s website<a href="https://aveliasolutions.com/"> here</a> to see&nbsp;more.</p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Ceramic recently launched Sign in With Solana (SIWS)—a specification developed in partnership with the Chain Agnostic Standards Association and leading Solana wallets and apps—to provide secure and user-friendly authentication.</p><p>Signing in with a wallet means users don’t have to worry about pop-up modals or needing to sign every action they take on an app.</p><p>Check out an example below, using a Phantom wallet to sign into <a href="https://orbis.club/blog/kjzl6cwe1jw1496mwu9sxirb3rc3bml8tutthakzi7vcd4jee6lybme6fl2qytr">Orbis Protocol</a>. Developers use Orbis to build features such as social timelines, comment systems or private messaging on top of their applications, with the underlying Ceramic data infrastructure facilitating performant social experiences.</p><p>How Sign-In With Solana works:</p>  Ceramic uses the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> standard for users accounts. DIDs require no central authority—users control their data and decide who they share it with.  With the <code>did:pkh</code> DID method, a persistent ID is securely generated from the public key hash of a wallet address. This enables one-click sign-on with a wallet to many apps on Solana.  App developers can pair it with the DID-Sessions library, which allows a stream author (user) to delegate to another entity (app developer) the ability to sign certain read/write actions on their behalf for a time-bound period.  The SIWS spec passes a human-readable message between a Solana wallet, like Phantom, and a Solana app, like Magic Eden. The message includes sign-in, defines which capability permissions the user is offering to the developer, and for how long—similar to a web2 session today.  <p>You can learn how to use DID:PKH by invoking a Solana auth provider <a href="https://did.js.org/docs/authorization">here</a>. Learn more about DID-Sessions <a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/accounts/did-session/">here</a> and Capability Permissions <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/">here</a>.

<p>November 17, 2022<br>
11 am EDT<br>
</p>
 
 
<p>For years, Online Program Managers (OPMs) have provided costly, cookie-cutter digital learning options for institutions looking to fast-track a presence in the online market. Now, as many institutions have made investments in their own digital learning capabilities over the last two years, and federal guidelines and regulations on OPM providers continue to tighten, institutions have a perfect opportunity to foster successful home-grown digital learning programs.</p>
<p>In this session, Edge Chief Digital Learning Officer Josh Gaul will share insights into why institutions should take this opportunity to evolve beyond OPM partnerships, and how to do so successfully.</p>
<p>This session will outline:</p>
 
 
 How the drawbacks of OPM partnerships far outweigh the benefits 
 How institutions can take advantage of unique institutional characteristics and intellectual property to evolve beyond OPM branded programming 
 Steps institutions will need to take to effectively replace OPM capabilities, including instructional design, faculty training, student support, and more 
 The role of digital learning leaders in launching and maintaining sustainable online programming 
 How Edge can support a successful shift away from OPMs with support services and collaborative community-building

The programme is designed to help National Governing Bodies (NGBs) across England with digital transformation, so more people from more communities can access and enjoy&nbsp;sport.</p><p>For the rest of the year and into 2023, we’re testing the hypothesis that Sport England NGBs will share more openly (in terms of both transparently within their organisation, and externally with other orgs) if we run sessions that provide access points on a spectrum of openness.</p>Logos of Sport England, CAST, Catalyst and the Innovation &amp; Digital Accelerator<p>This goes from, for example, changing sharing permissions on web-based folders (e.g. Google Drive) through to writing weeknotes on a regular basis.

We are more or less open depending on our context and situation. However, we also know that working openly has been shown to have benefits for organisations and society as a whole, as well as the individuals who choose to work&nbsp;openly.</p><p>Learning to work more openly is a process. There are a variety of themes to understand and find tactics for. We developed the free email course “<a href="https://learnwith.weareopen.coop/courses/open-course/">What We Talk About When We Talk About Open</a>” to serve as an introduction.</p>First Steps in working openly&nbsp;badges<p>We know it takes time to be comfortable working openly, so we’ve created badge pathways to help people take their first steps and then take a few more.

				 <p>Systems Integration Solutions&nbsp;is a Lithuania-based company specializing in blockchain technical solutions in information technology.</p>
<p>Their team is part of the eSSIF-Lab project and participated in Completing the Framework Open Call, which has helped them to develop their open-source SSI solution.</p>
<p>We’ve had the pleasure of interviewing&nbsp;Deividas Umbrasas, project manager at Systems Integration Solutions where he’s leading a team to build an interoperable, decentralized self-sovereign identity framework.</p>
<p>In this interview, he explained to us what Systems Integration Solutions is about, what are their goals for the middle and long time and give us a piece of advice about what other companies like his should do to get a public funding opportunity.</p>
 1. Introduce yourself and your company, and explain what makes you different. 
<p>First and foremost, Systems Integration Solutions would like to thank eSSIF-Lab for the invitation to the interview; it was an incredible journey in which we had to overcome many challenges in order to bring our self-sovereign – decentralized identity product package CorpoSign DID to fruition. I would like to express my gratitude to our amazing team, our CEO Rišardas Bedulskis, our lead software developer Dainius Preimantas, and our application developer Augis Bražiūnas, without them it would never have happened.</p>
<p>To return to the subject at hand, my name is Deividas Umbrasas, and I work as a project manager at Systems Integration Solutions, LLC, a Lithuania-based company specializing in blockchain technical solutions in information technology. I have worn several hats in my career, but blockchain technology sparked my attention in 2017. It all started with trading cryptocurrencies, which inspired my curiosity in blockchain technology, and now I am leading a team to build an interoperable, decentralized self-sovereign identity framework on European Blockchain Service Infrastructure.</p>
<p>At Systems Integration Solutions, we are working with European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) to create a Self-Sovereign identity and European Identification Framework with the product CorpoSign DID. Being the first one to launch an EBSI node in Lithuania and one of the first in the EU to be fully conformant with EBSI, W3C, and the first to offer Self-Issued OpenID v2 – CorpoSign DID main advantage lies in the streamlined process of simultaneous login, authentication, and KYC (know your customer) using trust anchor’s power of attorney verifiable credentials.</p>
 2. What services or products do you offer? 
<p>Everything began with the development of an open-source SSI solution, made possible by eSSIF-Lab CFOC funding. We started in the e-Government domain by enabling government and business entities to participate in the cross-border logistics ecosystem, by authorizing their representatives to conduct relevant acts on their behalf, using an ecosystem-specific scheme (business or government power of attorney).</p>
<p>As there was a clear need for new authorization methods, we have implemented them into our eCMR (<a href="https://sis.lt/projects/diginno-proto">https://sis.lt/projects/diginno-proto</a>). By scanning a QR code with a mobile application, a user can verify or authorize data on behalf of the organization, or just log in. But as we neared completion of this project, we realized that we had produced the majority of tools and components necessary to launch our Software as a Service or White label offerings.</p>
<p>Currently, our novel technology enables CorpoSign users to exchange any sort of data and decide how their data is used and processed, without the need for any login credentials. CorpoSign’s decentralized identity makes it a self-sovereign, privacy-protecting, and user-friendly application that anybody can use and benefit from, to easily communicate any form of data utilizing interoperable DID and SSI solutions; we specialize in Natural, Legal Persons IDs &amp; Diplomas.</p>
<p>Shortly, we offer the issuance of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) via our custom client panels or APIs, the storage of VCs in our mobile application wallet, and the sharing and verification of Verifiable Presentations (VP) via custom or universal verifiers and SDKs. We can also launch public/private blockchains with white-label solutions if needed.</p>
<p>Please view our brief product demonstration at&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/fIo%20Gdz80K8">https://youtu.be/fIo Gdz80K8</a></p>
 3. What milestones have you achieved so far since your project launch? 
<p>In just seven months, we have accomplished things we never imagined we would attain. With the assistance of the eSSIF-Lab community, we have finalized our business case and are on the verge of completely commercializing CorpoSign DID as a SaaS or White label service. We are prepared to adapt this technology to provide streamlined data exchange, KYC, authorization, and SDK logins.</p>
<p>Regarding business potential, we have begun discussions with local institutions and schools about adopting the SSI solution for diplomas and student identification cards. In addition, we are in discussion with government entities to implement SSI for natural and legal persons in cross-border solutions. We are already in discussions with our local AML KYC providers to join forces for a better future, as we are continually pondering simpler KYC procedures.</p>
<p>Also, in our eSSIF-Lab CFOC project CorpoSign DID (also known as eSSIF4Logistics), we have released and described the majority of our APIs and infrastructure decisions to contribute to the standardization and global interoperability (<a href="https://cutt.ly/sBXsHys">https://cutt.ly/sBXsHys</a>), as we are ardent supporters of both W3C and EBSI standards for SSI and DIDs. We take this matter seriously; so, we have also made an envisioned interoperability table with most of the eSSIF-Lab participants.</p>
 4. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to the eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>The purpose of the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) was to enable individuals to control their digital identities and authenticate securely to government and business websites. We knew we were at the right place at the right time since both of our objectives were to drastically lower the expenses of verification; automate notarization, enhance data integrity and security by integrating digital audit trails, and more.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>As previously said, because eSSIF-Lab saw the possibility from the same perspective as we do, they encouraged us to commercialize our contribution to SSI solutions, aided in the development of a detailed business case and increased the exposure of our work. In addition to the financing, consultations, and awareness, the engagement and collaboration with other eSSIF-Lab subgrantees, as well as the consortium’s assistance, were the key benefits. We hope to continue on this adventure together.</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  5. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future? 
<p>Our mid-term objective is to promote Verifiable credentials and decentralized identities, which will enable governments to easily link natural persons to organizations and migrate to a fully digital world, therefore enhancing both export market access and border security. We anticipate that data-sharing technologies will be globally interoperable in the near future.</p>
<p>Some may wonder why and how this is possible. Verifiable credentials have the unique scalability attribute of issuer and verifier separation. Issuers can go fully digital at any time without requiring other parties to invest in EDI and API connections or register on hubs. At any time, verifiers can continue using paper-based methods or switch to automated data extraction and verification.</p>
<p>Regarding the future, we are huge fans of Unece.org’s recently published whitepaper, “eDATA Verifiable Credentials for Cross-Border Trade”, which asserts that World Wide Web Consortiums (W3C) DID approaches for data sharing, are the only way to accomplish worldwide interoperability at now. Currently, we are investigating how to completely embrace our technology for all whitepaper-mentioned use cases, such as mitigating compliance concerns, tampered papers, product counterfeits, illicit trade and items, and easing trade financing, while maintaining scalable and user-friendly technology.</p>
<p>We recognize that the majority of this will be a formidable obstacle, but we are prepared to face it in the hopes that we are not the only ones who desire global interoperability.</p>
 6. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
<p>I am yet to raise a substantial amount of money, so I might be not the one to give this kind of advice. Nobody can answer this question for sure, however, let me try.</p>
<p>Always be searching, learning, and improving, there are opportunities everywhere, you just might be at the wrong place, so do not waver if something went wrong. If your application was rejected – insist to give honest feedback (request to give reviewer’s comments), even if it will hurt you.</p>
<p>Hire a company, that knows how to prepare and submit for public funding or investment, and make sure they have a substantial portfolio.</p>
<p>I would also add that you should never stop seeking like-minded people, since we are stronger in numbers, and the most common reason for public funding rejection is a lack of expertise or project execution plan (wrong program, idea, or budget problems).</p>
<p>Lastly, ask whether you may resubmit during the next grant period and how your application might be improved. Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Passkeys are designed to replace passwords and allow seamless logins for consumers across devices and platforms. Makes online purchases easier for consumers, removes checkout friction for merchants.</p>



<p>SAN JOSE, Calif.,&nbsp;Oct. 24, 2022&nbsp;/PRNewswire/ — Today, PayPal announced it is adding passkeys as an easy and secure log in method for PayPal accounts. Passkeys are a new industry standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium that replace passwords with cryptographic key pairs, offering customers a simple and secure way to log in to PayPal based on technology that is resistant to phishing and designed so that there is&nbsp;no shared passkey data between platforms. The new PayPal log in option will first be available to iPhone, iPad, or Mac users on PayPal.com and will expand to additional platforms as those platforms add support for passkeys.</p>



PayPal introduces passkeys as an easy and secure log in method for PayPal accounts.



<p>A founding member of the FIDO Alliance, PayPal is one of the first financial services companies to make passkeys widely available to its users. This cutting-edge security standard is significant as passkeys address one of the biggest security problems on the web, which is the weakness of password authentication. Over 2.6 billion records were hacked in 2017 and of these hacks, 81% are estimated to have been caused by password stealing and guessing1. Many consumers recycle passwords across online services, which can not only be cumbersome but can also lead consumers to reuse the same, potentially vulnerable passwords across services. Passkeys are designed to replace passwords for an even more seamless and secure login experience with PayPal.</p>



<p>Passkeys will also help more consumers complete their purchases with PayPal – once PayPal users create a passkey, they won’t have to remember their password, allowing them to check out with greater ease. According to a recent survey of U.S. consumers, 44% of consumers have abandoned an online purchase because they forgot a password.2</p>



<p>“Launching passkeys for PayPal is foundational to our commitment to offering our customers safe, secure and easy ways to access and manage their daily financial lives,” said&nbsp;Doug Bland, SVP and GM, Head of Consumer, PayPal. “We are excited to provide our customers a more seamless checkout experience that eliminates the risks of weak and reused credentials and removes the frustration of remembering a password. We are making it easier for customers to shop online.”</p>



<p>How to Create a PayPal Passkey</p>



<p>Creating and using a passkey with PayPal is a quick and easy process on an Apple device. Once created, passkeys are synced with iCloud Keychain, ensuring a strong, private relationship between a customer and their device, and an easy sign-in experience for PayPal users with devices running iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, or macOS&nbsp;Ventura.</p>



  Once existing customers log in to PayPal with a browser on desktop or mobile web using their existing PayPal credentials such as a username and password, they will have the option to “Create a passkey.”  Customers will then be prompted to authenticate with Apple Face ID or Touch ID. Then the passkey will be automatically created, and next time PayPal customers log in, they won’t need to use or manage a password again.  



<p>PayPal Passkeys Can Be Used to Log In on Any Device</p>



<p>If they have devices that don’t support passkeys yet, users can still use an iPhone to log in with a PayPal passkey. Users simply scan the QR code that will appear after they enter their PayPal User ID.</p>



<p>PayPal passkeys will start rolling out today to customers in the U.S.. PayPal passkeys will become available in additional countries early in 2023, and on additional technology platforms as they add support for passkeys.</p>



<p>About PayPal</p>



<p>PayPal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution for more than 20 years. By leveraging technology to make financial services and commerce more convenient, affordable, and secure, the PayPal platform is empowering more than 429 million consumers and merchants in more than 200 markets to join and thrive in the global economy.

TIME (PT)
PRESENTATION
PRESENTER(S)


12:30-12:35
Welcome 
Gail Hodges – OIDF


12:35-1:00
OIDF Privacy Whitepaper Listening Session: “Help Design a Scalable Future for Personal Privacy”<br>
Government-issued digital IDs have the potential for amazing societal impact but getting there from here means bridging the gaps in identity validation, verification, privacy, and control. In this session, we offer an open conversation to gather different perspectives on how policies and protocols need to evolve to help government-issued IDs fill their role in a global privacy-preserving infrastructure. Come join us to be a part of thinking outside the box of today so we can achieve tomorrow’s promise of government-issued IDs as a benefit to all.
Heather Flanagan – Spherical Cow Consulting


1:00-1:25
OIDF Government Whitepaper Listening Session: “Citizen-Centric Identity Systems”<br>
The OpenID Foundation is developing a whitepaper for governments and their associated stakeholders with the goal of supporting them in making good decisions when implementing citizen-centric digital identity systems – and to help them understand where OIDC and its extensions fit in. This session will be a facilitated discussion about the key concerns of government when thinking about digital identity:<p></p>
 
 The Role of Government 
 Key Stakeholders 
 Adoption 
 Balancing privacy/security/trust 
 Resilience 
 Economic Benefits 
 Technology and Interoperability 
 How existing standards fit in 
 

Elizabeth Garber – Whitepaper Co-Author


1:25-1:50
OIDF IoT Whitepaper Listening Session: “IoT &amp; Identity: First Thoughts on a Blueprint for How People and Things can Interoperate<br>
Most enterprises implementing use cases with connected devices follow proprietary approaches when interacting with people. This results in challenges when it comes to integrating different systems but also adds risk from a security perspective, efforts from a development perspective, and inconsistency from an end-user perspective. A blueprint for how people and things can interoperate has to outline ideas, paradigms, and enhancements to existing standards to provide guidance to architects, developers, and product owners. In this session, you’ll get insights into early thoughts on that topic, hear about challenges leading enterprises in this segment have today, and are invited to share your opinion, ideas, and concerns regarding IoT and Identity.
Andre Priebe – iC Consult


1:50-2:00

<p>The OpenC2 Architecture Specification describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2</p> 


<p>OASIS is pleased to announce that Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Architecture Specification Version 1.0 from the OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC [1] has been approved as an OASIS Committee Specification.</p>



<p>Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyber defense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.</p>



<p>The OpenC2 Architecture Specification describes the abstract architecture of OpenC2 to define a common understanding of the messages and interactions for all bindings and serializations.</p>



<p>This Committee Specification is an OASIS deliverable, completed and approved by the TC and fully ready for testing and implementation.</p>

 Exploiting the potential of the e-ID ecosystem 
<p>In chemistry, a reaction can be accelerated by adding a substance called a catalyst. The catalyst reduces the activation energy required for the reaction, which can then be sped up.</p>
<p>The addition of a catalyst to a chemical reaction can be considered the analogy to the introduction of the trust infrastructure and the government-issued verifiable ID card – the e-ID – into the ecosystem of Swiss society and economy. In our view, it can also be seen as a «response booster» to enhance the performance of economic growth in an increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>In June 2022, the Federal Council opened the consultation on the new e-ID (<a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/bj/de/home/aktuell/mm.msg-id-89515.html">media release</a>). Its main difference from the previous one is the following three aspects:</p>
 
 The federal government is responsible for issuing the e-ID and operates the e-ID infrastructure. 
 Data protection plays a central role. 
 The e-ID serves as the cornerstone of an ecosystem of digital credentials that supports the issuance and use of government and private digital credentials of all kinds (see also the das digitalswitzerland <a href="https://digitalswitzerland.com/building-a-swiss-digital-trust-ecosystem/">white paper</a>, in which DIDAS was heavily involved). 
 
<p>This ecosystem has great potential in terms of digitization in Switzerland and will strongly influence the way we handle personal data and consume digital services and products in the future.</p>
 Making the e-ID ecosystem tangible with a real application 
<p>To make this ecosystem tangible, three members of DIDAS (SwissSign, cardossier and Adnovum) have built a mini-ecosystem as a PoC in collaboration with the canton of Aargau. This exemplary ecosystem consists of three use cases that build on each other and shed light on the issuance and use of digital credentials in the form of SSI-Verifiable Credentials (VC).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use case 1 – Issuing a basic identity or basic ID: In the first use case, users log in to the SwissID portal with their productive SwissID login. On the portal, users are visually guided – from the installation of a suitable wallet to the issuance and storage of the basic ID as a verifiable credential on the smartphone.</p>
<p>Use case 2 – Issuing a certificate of residence in the eGov portal: With the basic ID created in the first step, the user logs in to the eGov portal of the Canton of Aargau. The login is done by SSI and requires e-mail, last name and first name from the basic ID. The other data of the basic ID is not disclosed. The eGov portal can trust the data of the basic ID and verify it. The data is used to load a residential address for the person from the system. The user can then store the residential address as a verifiable credential in his or her mobile wallet. Upon completion of use case 2, the user has a basic ID and the residential address is stored in his or her wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use case 3 – Initiating a provisional traffic authorization for a vehicle: The registration of a car involves many players such as the policyholder, the insurance company, the garage and, of course, the road traffic authority (StVA). In addition, there are many formalities associated with it. The goal of this use case is to facilitate the registration of a vehicle by providing the cardossier platform with the identity and certificate of residence of the policyholder as verifiable credentials. cardossier then automatically carries out the further registration steps together with the relevant insurance company and the road traffic authority. In the process, the insurance company and the road traffic authority always receive the same and correct address information.</p>
      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By implementing the mini-ecosystem and intensively testing the three use cases, stakeholders gained valuable insights into user interaction, governance, and technology. However, the initiative has primarily demonstrated how an ecosystem of digital credentials can function and bring sustainable added value to data protection and digitization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Expanding the scope of exploration 
<p>Similar to these three use cases, there are endless opportunities to build value-added digital services and products based on the e-ID ecosystem. However, they require an understanding of participation in an ecosystem with possibly distributed benefits versus existing centralized models, i.e. ecosystems characterized by the control of a value stream or the unique positioning of one or more intermediaries.</p>

 Consultation for BGEID 
<p>The Federal Council <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-89515.html">opened</a> consultation for the Federal Law on Electronic Proof of Identity and Other Electronic Evidence (BGEID) on June 29, 2022.</p>
<p>As with previous discussion <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/de/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id.pdf.download.pdf/diskussionspapier-zielbild-e-id-d.pdf">paper</a> “Target Image E-ID” from 2021, our members have taken a close look at both the preliminary draft of the federal law and the explanatory report.&nbsp; Our extensive commentary and observations has been submitted to Federal Council and the FDJP.</p>
 Summary of the Position Paper 
<p>The preliminary <a href="https://www.bj.admin.ch/dam/bj/de/data/staat/gesetzgebung/staatliche-e-id/vorentw.pdf">draft</a> of the federal law contains the much needed legal foundations, which are formulated in a fairly open manner and is therefore considered by our members to be very good. We are convinced that the proposal for the e-ID law represents a solid basis and sets the framework for a promising trust infrastructure in which a state-issued e-ID represents the core element. We welcome the creation of a legal framework for this trust infrastructure.</p>
<p>In ecosystems of Verifiable Credentials, the state can thus assume the role of enabler and pursue the goal of creating an attractive environment for a wide range of applications. However, a viable ecosystem of Verifiable Credentials can only be successfully designed, piloted and implemented together with the issuers, verifiers and holders of&nbsp; Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>We also recommend that the terms used in the ecosystem be defined uniformly and in line with international standards.</p>
<p>In the context of wider Verifiable Credentials, it is essential to define uniform standards as well as to allow for differences in sectoral governance in the ecosystem. For example, the same attributes should always be used for a residence confirmation, while additional attributes could be used in different sectors.</p>
<p>DIDAS looks forward to the next steps and recommends a priority treatment in the Federal Council. Furthermore, we recommend pushing for technical proof of concepts and minimal viable products (MVPs) involving all stakeholders and civil society in order to make the best use of the planned implementation timeline for the political decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 ESMS – Pioneering&nbsp;Experiential Learning 
<p>Pioneering Scottish schools are harnessing this technology to transform how they deliver 21st century Education</p>
<p>This includes <a href="https://www.esms.org.uk/">ESMS</a>, where <a href="https://twitter.com/MrLux4DMoore">Mr Simon Luxford-Moore</a>, Head of eLearning, has a deep passion for teaching and importantly, for modernizing it to deliver the best learning experience for students.&nbsp;He was understandably recognised as one of the <a href="https://www.esms.org.uk/news/head-elearning-recognised-edtech-50-list-2020">TES Edtech 50 leaders</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>Mr Luxford-Moore explained how this adds a new category of learning modes. There is visual, auditory and kinaesthetic, and Simon defines ‘Experiential’ as a fourth, with quite profound implications and benefits for teaching.</p>
<p>He is passionate about inclusive learning, where if you design teaching to accommodate a neuro-diverse audience the minority of whom may have the most difficulties, from physical to mental challenges, it will be all encompassing, beneficial to all the students. VR offers a mode of engagement that addresses these challenges and removes barriers to learning in a way that traditional media cannot.</p>
<p>An example of an experiential lesson was a virtual tour of the Mecca pilgrimage, where students participated via VR in the Hajj, something that no non-Muslim can do. This is an excellent and simple example of fostering cultural and religious appreciation and understanding. The students also learned about rainforests through a VR tour and as one young pupil described it enables an experience “beyond the rectangle of a picture”.</p>
 Harnessing the Creator Economy 
<p>Simon reviewed a number of potential VR solutions for the school, settling on ClassVR because of one critical feature – the ability to create and upload one’s own content. Others could only make use of content pre-built by the supplier.</p>
<p>This is the key to unlock Scotland’s digital education future. Using advanced tools like Blender ClassVR can create sophisticated virtual tour content for schools, and being UK-based have been very responsive to Mr Luxford-Moore’s requirements, such as creating a castle siege scenario, even endorsing the flags with the school logo, but critically he can also create his own using simple 360 camera devices and enhancing it with tools like <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/">ThingLink</a>.</p>
<p>For example he used this approach to create a virtual tour of New Lanark, closed to the public due to the pandemic, and has even shared tours of their own school, a historic Victorian building. They also act as a hub centre, where other schools who don’t have the technology can visit and make use of it.</p>
<p>The two biggest trends of the technology industry for the 21st century are ‘the Metaverse’ and the ‘Creator Economy’, an evolution of the Internet to a wholly immersive virtual world combined with the tools that enable everyone to create the experiences within it.</p>
<p>Scotland’s ambition to be a world-leading digital nation lies in harnessing these trends to transform our Education system, where schoolchildren are empowered to create learning content shared with other students, using the tools and technologies central to the future of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Critically it breaks down the barriers between public and private schools, creating a single playing field where investments and learning by one school is contributed to a shared pool from which all can benefit.</p>
 Forfar Academy 
<p>Another keynote exemplar is&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/an/forfaracademy/">Forfar Academy</a>, utilizing the technologies to involve students in building skills that will have huge value in the most modern of workplaces.</p>
<p>Therefore there are multiple benefits to this approach. It’s not only pioneering a state of the art learning approach for students, but it’s achieving what the Scottish Government’s overall goal is for their digital strategy: To put Scotland at the very forefront of technology in global terms.</p>
<p>As they highlight in their tweets below Forfar are leveraging the technology to expose students to knowledge about technology in new ways and crucially, engaging them into scenarios that have massive commercialization potential, such as building virtual tourism experiences or applying the technology in a business setting like a factory production facility.</p>
<p>This will equip them with skills and knowledge of immense value to Scottish businesses.</p>

 Webinar: Into the Eduverse – Challenges and Opportunities 
<p>To learn more about the detail of these technologies and how to apply them in modern Education settings, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnmSiAXc5Jw">this webinar</a>, where&nbsp;Stephen Reid from Microsoft, Ian Stuart from Avantis Education and educators from around the world discuss the challenges and opportunities around the Eduverse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Stephen Reid, the first speaker, is from Microsoft and his expertise is in technology and game-based learning. He has used about 140 games to help children learn through gaming.</p>
<p>According to Stephen there are three pillars of game-based learning. The first pillar is an explicit curriculum through which children can have access to science, art, geography, history etc. The second pillar is social and emotional learning which helps children to develop their capacity as human beings. The third pillar is career readiness which helps children to explore their career options.</p>
<p>By using game-based learning children are taught in school important topics like gender equality, refugee crisis, climate change, civil rights etc. There are two types of curriculum for children in school. The first one is an explicit curriculum which must be taught by the teachers and they have to assess the teaching at the end of year of school. The other one is an implicit curriculum which teachers are not bound to teach the children but if they teach these curriculum, it will contribute to developing the moral of children.</p>
<p>In Scotland Stephen was involved in the Pave Project. It was an alternative vocational education program for young offenders. At this program the teachers used digital platforms like Minecraft to teach the children about various topics. Minecraft is a virtual game-based learning platform that promotes creativity, collaboration and problem solving in an immersive digital environment. Game-based learning is a blessing for children from working class families.</p>
<p>Due to their financial restraint, they cannot afford to often go to the beach, hills or the zoo. Through these virtual games they can experience what it feels like to go to these places without actually being there. Thus, by using game-based learning educators bring abstract concepts to life. Educators also teach children emotional vocabulary for writing.</p>
<p>Stephen was also involved in another project named the 100,000 trees project in France. The purpose of this project was to teach children the importance of trees in the environment, to teach them how to maintain and plant trees to reduce global warming and climate change.</p>
<p>They were taught about biodiversity and interaction between humans and plants. At this program the educators created fake scenarios to help children see the wider picture then they observed their reactions and make them feel what it is like to be in that situation.</p>
<p>For example, to teach children the concept of refugee crisis, educators created fake BBC reports where they wrote that their country is under invasion and they have to flee their houses and have shelter in some other countries. Then they let the children find a solution to this crisis. By using this method children learned empathy and critical analysis of a crisis.</p>
<p>According to Stephen, because of the current systematic pressure in the grading system, children are not taught empathy and analysis and for this they often cannot understand the gravity of a crisis. When they will feel empathy, they will learn about the concepts themselves.</p>
<p>By using Metaverse classroom educators have seen drastic change in the teaching system. Children learn more efficiently through these digital platforms and most important is they are really interested to learn about new concepts.</p>
<p>The Metaverse permits an immersive experience into the digital classroom environment where students will be able to interact with the learning content. Thus, it provides users with an empowered learning experience. The experiences in the metaverse space are limited only by one’s imagination.</p>
<p>This digital platform has been recently used in Korea. By using these digital platforms educators make the children problem solvers and creators for real world problems. They are also triggered through empathy to believe in that problem and find an effective solution and will break the barrier.</p>
<p>To make the education system effective the teachers training colleges and organization should be monitored and the educators must be experts in Metaverse education. Educators can collectively change the education system and enhance learning by using Metaverse education.</p>

<p></p>
 Speaking on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltoc2O33z_0">The 8th Wall podcast</a> Tom Emrich (<a href="https://twitter.com/tomemrich">Twitter</a>) shares his views on the key Augmented Reality trends for 2022. 
 Kicking off the talk Tom describes 2022 as being a peak year for the Metaverse, the next iteration of the Internet that will be achieved through the unified convergence of the Blockchain, IoT, AR / VR and AI. 
<p>This peak has been characterized through many investments into the sector and a realization of the potential by corporate brands.</p>
 AR Hardware 
<p>From 4m:50s Tom begins to look at the individual trend of AR hardware, beginning with the smartphone.&nbsp;Due to advancements in chips, displays, cameras, WiFi speed increases and massive changes in form factors such as the Samsung Fold, 2022 has seen a major leap forward for the role the phone will play in AR.</p>
<p>Another key trend he sees is glasses and headsets, highlighting the important point that this will further emphasize of the role of the smartphone not diminish it, such as the fact glasses will plug in to phones for AR features, to offload the compute requirements to the phone.</p>
<p>Tom describes this as “connected eye-wear”, showcasing an example of the <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/application/xr-vr-ar/snapdragon-xr1-platform">Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1</a>.</p>
<p>At 9m:25s he focuses on mixed reality headsets that enable both VR and <a href="https://uploadvr.com/lynx-r1-through-the-lens-view/">video passthrough AR</a>, highlighting important industry developments such as Meta updating the Quest 2 with an <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/">experimental API</a> for mixed reality mode. Tom expects these headsets to target the upper end of the consumer market, for living room not outdoor experiences.</p>
 WiFi 6 
<p>From 12m:10s Tom moves on to infrastructure, stating that connectivity is essential to AR experiences, with the growing adoption of 5G being a major shift forward, adding that a critical dimension of this is activation of the ‘<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/c-band">C-Band</a>‘ frequency. He expects early roll out of this in 2022 expanding into nationwide coverage through 2023.</p>
<p>Another major evolution is the opening of a sixth gigahertz band for Wifi, ‘<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work">Wifi 6</a>‘, the biggest spectrum addition since 1989, for which you will need devices that support it. This will greatly improve speed and latency, important for AR, and enable new modes of device interconnectivity in the home for example.</p>
 Platforms and Tools 
<p>At 14m:50s begins to look at software and the web, in particular the role of the browser in AR/VR.</p>
<p>Tom highlights the success of The 8th Wall in this scenario, where over 50,000 web apps have been created, with over 1,000 being experiences for top brands. To learn more check out <a href="https://www.8thwall.com/discover">8thwall.com/discover</a>.</p>
<p>He sees 2022 as being a big year for accelerating the ‘<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-the-spatial-web-bb8127f9ac45">Spatial Web</a>‘, with Web AR and Web VR in high demand, for a number of reasons including the Metaverse centred around the browser, where Tom anticipates developments that make browsers more able to discover and interact with immersive content.</p>
<p>The second platform trend he talks about from 18m:05s is the increasing sophistication of more complex and contextual AR experiences, unlocked through advanced tools being made available to developers, citing an example of Snap enabling the <a href="https://eng.snap.com/life-with-ar-landmarkers">creation of custom landmarkers</a>&nbsp;with LiDAR scanners.</p>
<p>From 19m:35s he moves on to the last of the platform trends, a focus on creators and developers and how they can be empowered to succeed as AR entrepreneurs, via ideas such as matchmaking for example.</p>
 Consumer Solutions 
<p>At 20m:47s Tom begins the final trend section of consumer solutions, encompassing major markets such as advertising, often one of the first industries to harness new tech trends like mobile and social and now the Metaverse.</p>
<p>He sees a number of brands intelligently using the technology to achieve large scale web engagements that drive sales, with key advanced being display ads that can be better personalized to users through AR.</p>
<p>Tom then looks at QR codes at 24m:05s, describing how they tie in to this trend. For example Pepsi presented QR codes during the Superbowl which led to an AR portal featuring The Weekend. VW and Amazon collaborated to send out boxes with a QR code that led to an AR experience. He expects this approach to become ubiquitous and always on.</p>
<p>From 27m:00s Tom then says that in the same way users will expect AR experiences tied to things they’ll expect the same for places, with a key motivation being to encourage people to return to the outdoors following Covid, such as parks, stadiums and retail spaces, aka <a href="https://metaverse.digital/augmented-reality-metaverse/">The Real World Metaverse</a>.</p>
<p>This is ‘Location Based Entertainment’, an AR experience that requires attendance at a specific place, with an example provided of <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/introducing-dreamground-powerful-combination-samsung-technology-augmented-reality/">Samsung’s Dreamground</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 E-Commerce 
<p>From 29m:15s Tom explores the relationship of AR to e-commerce, where he believes it will evolve from one-off novelty features such as virtual try-on, to becoming a foundational pillar for all retailers. One example of this the development of API integrations with their e-commerce systems, such as CMS and ERP applications.</p>
<p>He cites a keynote case study of <a href="https://www.8thwall.com/blog/post/52534792519/saatchi-art-launches-worlds-largest-webar-deployment-letting-customers-view-over-1-million-works-of-art-in-their-home">Saatchi art</a>, and how they are utilizing “View in a Room” WebAR to allow customers to view over a million works of art in their home before buying online. This resulted in consumers who used the WebAR feature were four times more likely to purchase and purchased 17% more than those who did not.</p>
 Digital Doubles and Virtual Goods 
<p>Tom concludes the webinar with two last topics: Digital Identity and avatars, your ‘Digital Double’, and digital twinning, mapping reality to it’s virtual equivalent.</p>
<p>He highlights how user profiles are evolving from a simple personal picture through the use of NFTs and new ventures like <a href="https://metaverse.digital/ready-player-me-raises-13m/">Ready Player Me</a>, which enable the portability of profiles across multiple virtual world environments.</p>
<p>An example of digital twinning he provides is how Gucci is enabling the creation of ‘virtual goods’, the online equivalent of their offline products. Tom identifies a super hot trend of the intersection of NFTs and AR to accelerate this trend.</p>

 <a href="https://digitalscot.net/solutions/digital-tourism/"></a>In a <a href="https://metaverse.digital/augmented-reality-metaverse/">previous blog</a> John Hanke, creator of the Pokemon Go app, defines the ‘Real World Metaverse’, a concept of enhancing reality through overlaying it with Augmented Reality features. 
 These can be applied in a practical way to boost success for Scottish businesses. Tourism is a great example. 
<p>Enhancing the experience with these types of exciting innovations will draw in even greater visitor numbers and continue the massive economic success of this industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/tourist-attractions-are-being-transformed-by-immersive-experiences-some-lessons-from-scotland-110860">This Conversation article</a> comments on the details of this economic success and the critical role immersive experiences can play in facilitating this boost.</p>
<p>Simple examples include&nbsp;AR tourism guides, such as this one for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_RppvB4rDo">Inverness Castle</a>, and for <a href="https://thelochsidepress.com/2019/04/19/augmented-reality-is-a-world-first-for-tourist-guide/">Loch Lomond</a> they inserted ‘Zapcodes’ into the local guide magazine, to trigger AR links that enhance the printed word with a virtual experience. You can <a href="https://www.scotsmagazine.com/articles/discover-fife-augmented-reality/">discover Fife</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FOSIT_cMCk">discover the Highlands via AR</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another great example is described in <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19241367.castle-first-scottish-landmark-sign-app-tours/">this recent news</a>, about Blair Castle adopting the <a href="https://about.smartify.org/">Smartify</a> app. Via easy-to-use interfaces and well designed technology available as a native and web app, the Smartify guide allows visitors to follow their own interests and curated tours, with additional features such as e-commerce, targeted push notifications and donations.</p>
<p>Other Scottish venues adopting Smartify include the National Galleries of Scotland. The Smartify <a href="https://about.smartify.org/case-studies/national-galleries-of-scotland-ray-harryhausen-exhibition">case study</a> explains how the venue employed the app for their <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/ray-harryhausen-titan-cinema-virtual-exhibition-experience">Ray Harryhausen exhibition</a>, to offer visitors a fun (and COVID-safe) experience on site, as well as access from home.</p>
 Virtual Treasure Hunts 
<p>As we consider larger Pokemon Go-type Real World Metaverse strategies, for more advanced and engaging experience the technology can be combined with features like ‘Gamification’, to enable super fun activities like Virtual Treasure Hunts. As the Conversation article highlights:</p>
<p>“It’s the sort of immersive experience that many tourist attractions want to have these days. At the <a href="http://www.burnsmuseum.org.uk/">Burns Birthplace Museum</a>&nbsp;in Ayrshire, dedicated to Robert Burns, visitors can download an app aimed at children called the&nbsp;<a href="https://digit.fyi/augmented-reality-scottish-attractions/">Mighty Mission Trail</a>. It sends them on a virtual treasure hunt throughout the site and surroundings.”</p>
<p>This highlights the other types of technologies that can be called into play. For example <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/14/google-maps-gaming-platform-expands-after-a-year-of-success-stories/">Google Maps Gaming</a> provides a capability for making more use of location data in mobile games, the Pokemon Go type, that can ‘can unlock augmented reality and social gameplay, can increase engagement and retention, and can help bring new life to games that were originally designed without a location component.’</p>
<p>This is complimented by their general capabilities for improving navigation, such as <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/02/11/google-maps-ar-navigation/">AR Navigation</a> and harnessing AI for <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/02/using-global-localization-to-improve.html">Global Navigation</a>, helping you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWbY5jdJnHg">better navigate cities</a>.</p>
<p>These various innovations provide the building blocks for creating any type of highly immersive, highly engaging experience, that better enables visitors to explore and enjoy attractions, with the ability to ‘gamify’ the experience of particular value for those looking to attract children and young families.</p>
 Whereverly 
<p>An example of a Scottish innovator in this field is&nbsp;<a href="https://whereverly.com/">Whereverly</a>. They develop apps and web platforms that make journeys memorable and allow users to embrace local culture through music, song and stories, whilst discovering hidden gems.</p>
<p>The apps blend together local storytelling with engaging interactivity, from songs to driving routes, with projects delivered for the&nbsp;<a href="https://whereverly.com/north-coast-500/">North Coast 500</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://whereverly.com/explore-stirling/">Explore Stirling</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://whereverly.com/highland-discovery/">Highland Discovery</a>.</p>
<p>Recently they launched&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/whereverly/status/1416062049889685512">Badenoch The Storylands</a>, where users can discover the past through the interactive Augmented Reality reconstructions of Badenoch’s fantastic historic sites.</p>
<p>As part of the last CivTech innovation competition they&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/CivTechScotland/status/1448682642862399490">successfully bid</a>&nbsp;a new solution to&nbsp;to better manage visitors at tourist hotspots, combining&nbsp;IoT&nbsp;data&nbsp;and mobile&nbsp;tech&nbsp;to give public sector&nbsp;rangers access to a live map of remote attractions, improving public safety and engagement.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>


 
 


<p>The final day of the <a href="http://www.authenticatecon.com/">Authenticate 2022</a> conference was packed with user stories, thought leadership and panel discussions about the challenges and opportunities for FIDO strong authentication today and in the years to come.</p>



<p>The first user story of the day was from global science and technology company EMD Group / Merck KGaA which is now using FIDO to help improve its own authentication system. Dennis Kniep, domain architecture for Identity and access management at the company explained that his team’s mission is to help secure the company where he sees FIDO as playing a major role.</p>



<p>A challenge that EMD Group / Merck KGaA faced with its implementation of FIDO is that there were a number of legacy applications and services that did not support modern web standards.</p>



<p>“We developed the detach authentication mechanism,” Kniep explained. “With that mechanism the users are able to authenticate with FIDO in a phishing resistant way, even if the user needs access to apps with legacy backends, meaning we can enforce FIDO.”</p>



<p>Equity and inclusion matter</p>


 
 


<p>A recurring theme through the Authenticate 2022 conference is the need for equity and inclusion.</p>



<p>One panel on the topic specifically looking at the issue of inclusiveness in authentication and identity systems. Jamie Danker, senior director of cybersecurity services at Venable LLP, commented that when solving a problem, the makeup of the people trying to solve a given problem will have an impact on the solution.</p>



<p>Danker noted that a recent equity and inclusion study completed by the U.S. government’s&nbsp; General Services Administration (GSA) provides some real empirical data on how remote identity proofing solutions will actually operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Danker also mentioned the NIST digital identity guidelines, which are currently being updated to revision 4. She noted that NIST has been very clear that equity considerations are going to be part of that.</p>



<p>Security is more than just the web interface</p>



<p>FIDO strong authentication helps to provide authentication into many different types of systems, but it’s not a ubiquitous option for all types of access.</p>


 
 


<p>“Everybody’s talking about web and mobile, and nobody’s talking about the contact center,” John Poirier, Lead Director – EIS at CVS Health said.</p>



<p>Poirier explained that when a password doesn’t work, or a user can’t get access, they will call into a contact center for help. He emphasized that there is a need to make sure there are security policies, procedures and technology in place at contact centers, that secure access, without introducing too much friction.</p>



<p>The idea of extending strong authentication to all types of devices was also discussed by Chad Spensky, CEO of Allthenticate and his co-founder and COO, Rita Mounir.</p>



<p>“The FIDO protocol right now only talks to websites and computers,” Spensky said.</p>



<p>Spensky wants to help bring strong authentication to all types of devices and access ranging from cars, to office doors and everything in between.</p>



<p>Navigating the authentication landscape</p>



<p>In a thematic presentation, Pamela Dingle, director of identity standards at Microsoft, spoke like a pirate and warned about passengers falling off the boat.&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>The analogy of the boat is that of helping passengers safely get to their destination, which isn’t always an easy task. Dingle said that Microsoft blocks more than 1000 Password attacks every second, and outlined the multiple reasons why passwords are a weak link. She emphasized that users should wear a life jacket, which in the real world translates into user multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>



<p>While there are risks with MFA, Dingle said it’s the right first step for many, until they are able to move to phishing resistant strong authentication with FIDO.</p>



<p>“Out of 10,000 compromised accounts, only one will be an MFA credential attack,” she said. “It’s really important to understand the difference in risk between being vulnerable to a password attack, and being vulnerable to an MFA bypass attack.”</p>



<p>That said, she noted that what makes phishing resistant credentials so great, is that they are not susceptible to exactly the same predictable behaviors that make MFA vulnerable. Dingle also noted that she’s very optimistic about the potential for passkeys.</p>



<p>“If we get it right. passkeys become the seat cushion that becomes a flotation device for our passengers,” she said.</p>



<p>Earning Trust in Identity at Scale</p>



<p>With one of the largest ecommerce&nbsp; and cloud platforms in existence Amazon has a real need for strong authentication and it is increasingly relying on FIDO for those needs.</p>



<p>Sarah Cecchetti, head of product for Amazon Cognito explained that identity is handled by the platform team within Amazon Web Services. She noted that identity needs to have a consistent security and usability bar for every service at AWS. To that end, AWS has built out a modular, but centralized approach that uses FIDO.</p>


 
 


<p>Arynn Crow, Senior Manager, User Authentication Product at AWS, said that her company has invested really heavily into FIDO2.</p>



<p>“We continue to invest because fundamentally we believe that FIDO supports greater flexibility,” Crow said. “We have fewer trade-offs between our user’s experience and their security.”</p>



<p>Usability is the key to strong authentication adoption</p>



<p>In a panel session on usability, a key theme that emerged is the foundational need for good usability in order for FIDO adoption to grow.</p>



<p>Judy Clare, vice president, product manager, digital authentication at JP Morgan Chase commented that it’s critical to put strong authentication messages and workflow in the right tone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The right wording and to make it clear, simple and understandable for the average user is very important so that you’re not ostracizing anybody by using all technical jargon,” Clare said.</p>



<p>The need for clear language was echoed by Sierre Wolfkostin, senior product designer at Duo Security. Wolfkostin said that it’s hard to adopt what you can’t understand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Getting to simple human language is really important,” Wolfkostin said.</p>



<p>Usability is also about making sure there is a vibrant ecosystem of vendors and technologies that can help businesses small and large to actually implement FIDO strong authentication in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the closing panel of the event, Christiaan Brand, product manager at Google commented that while well staffed organizations might be able to implement strong authentication and passkey options on their own, many other organizations will need help. It’s a situation much like any other enterprise technology where organizations make use of consultants and service providers to implement complex technology.</p>



<p>Bob Lord, senior technical advisor at CISA argued that the best thing to do is to just start with FIDO. He emphasized the organization should focus on what they can do, not what they can’t.</p>



<p>“I think there’s a lot of hesitation at starting,” Lord said. “I think a lot of misconceptions out there would go away if they were to just start the journey, they would find their misconceptions are wrong.”</p>



<p>Next year in San Diego</p>


 
 


<p>In the closing session, Andrew Shikiar, executive director of the FIDO Alliance highlighted the key themes of the event.</p>



<p>Those themes are that deployments are real and organization can and should start today. Usability was another strong recurring theme, as a key to helping to ensure adoption. The concept of security by community also resonated at the conference, with users learning from each other about lessons learned.</p>



<p>In the final analysis the Authenticate 2022 was a stellar success with 90 sessions, spread across three tracks and three days of content.</p>



<p>For next year’s event, Authenticate 2023 will be moving to San Diego.</p>

 Research in Decentralized Identity Yields Confidential Data Storage 


 
 


<p>NEW YORK, Oct. 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — The Self-Sovereign Foundation, a nonprofit focused on equitable solutions for decentralized identity, has unveiled its Self-Sovereign Database. This critically needed software component stores sensitive data in a provably tamper-proof way. We all need to store personal data, and we all know it is not appropriately protected: trade secrets, family pictures, customer information, and healthcare data. Digital identity is not just about passwordless login and a driver’s license — it’s about all data. Because very soon, all data will be verified and credentialed.</p>



<p>The Self-Sovereign Database is a personal, privacy-respecting database management system for storing, searching and retrieving personal data so securely that even the storage provider cannot verify the identity or access the information. The Self-Sovereign Database is the ultimate secret data vault, a database powered by self-sovereign identity and verified credentials where only the individual is in control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This breakthrough technology helps applications quickly achieve decentralization and data immutability without the slowness and expense of blockchain-based solutions while still being redundant, portable, and protected from breaches. The Self-Sovereign Database supports 256-bit AES encryption and optional FIPS security. The Foundation has started beta testing the integration of the Self-Sovereign Database with decentralized identity platforms and service providers and is seeking new partnerships. Currently supporting Microsoft Entra and EBSI, the database is W3C DID standard and interoperable.</p>



<p>About the Self-Sovereign Foundation</p>



<p>The Self-Sovereign Foundation is a nonprofit entity that empowers individuals with self-determination over personal data. The pillars of our Foundation are protecting confidentiality, ensuring accessibility, and equitable participation. Our mission is a future where users decide for themselves what information they share about themselves with different parties to preserve their privacy.

<p>Over the course of 2021 and early 2022, the DIACC worked with a Special Interest Group (SIG) to explore how the integration of Foundational IDs into the digital identity ecosystem could improve identity resolution between silos, introduce new efficiencies in service delivery, and reduce fraud. Members of the SIG included representatives from provincial Vital Statistics agencies and digital identity initiatives, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), representatives from the Canadian financial and insurance sectors, as well as additional participants from the private and public sectors. The SIG members took part in 14 working sessions to explore work streams across various topics including birth records, impacts on service delivery and fraud, and roadmapping.</p>



<p>This report outlines observations, conclusions, and recommendations including a list of 12 proposed initiatives that may be considered as a method to address and resolve some of these challenging issues facing our community today.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>


 
 


<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.authenticatecon.com/">Authenticate 2022</a>&nbsp;conference got underway on Oct. 17 with a stellar lineup of speakers that included enterprises, service providers and government agencies, all gathered to talk about the current and future state of strong authentication.</p>



<p>The opening session was led by FIDO Alliance Executive Director and CMO Andrew Shikiar who detailed the progress that has been made this past year. Among the highlights mentioned by Shikiar was the launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-certified-professional-program/">FIDO Certified Professional program</a>&nbsp;also got underway in 2022 providing a way for professionals to validate skills. There has also been work done to help with usability as well as adoption with initiatives designed to help accelerate broad deployment of FIDO strong authentication.</p>


 
 


<p>“Our mission is to reduce industry’s reliance on passwords and legacy multi factor authentication,” Shikiar said. “From day-one we’ve had this audacious goal of shifting away from centrally stored shared secrets to a model that is more possession based in nature and relies on common end user devices, that has been our guiding principle.”</p>



<p>Marcio Mello, head of product, PayPal identity platform, talked about how the online payment plans to leverage passkeys as a way to realize the promise of passwordless. Mello demonstrated workflows using passkeys showing how easy it is for a user to authenticate.</p>



<p>“I would say this is an inflection point in our decade-long commitment as an industry, to a passwordless world,” Mello said about passkeys.</p>



<p>NTT DOCOMO has been a leader both within and outside FIDO Alliance beginning with its Board appointment in 2015. DOCOMO has helped shape FIDO specifications and is the first mobile operator to deploy FIDO authentication at scale. Shikiar welcomed Koichi Moriyama, a Chief Security Architect at NTT DOCOMO, to the keynote stage where he announced DOCOMO’s intention to support passkeys for its millions of d ACCOUNT users. Moriyama said support would begin in early 2023.</p>



<p>U.S Government sees FIDO as the gold standard for MFA</p>


 
 


<p>The U.S. government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is taking a very active interest in strong authentication.</p>



<p>“We’ve known for decades that passwords are a weak link in cybersecurity and that the extra layer of protection provided by multi factor authentication prevents cyber attacks,” CISA Director, Jen Easterly said. “Yet only a small percentage of people are using it.”</p>



<p>Easterly emphasized that CISA is aggressively pursuing multiple initiatives to help spur adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and more specifically FIDO standards-based strong authentication.</p>


 
 


<p>“We’re using this opportunity to shine the spotlight on FIDO as the gold standard for MFA and the only widely available phishing resistant authentication method.”</p>



<p>Bob Lord, senior technical advisor, cybersecurity division at CISA, told the Authenticate 2022 audience that it is a weird thing that the technology industry has normalized the idea that the burden of staying safe is placed on those organizations that are least able to understand things like threat landscapes.</p>



<p>“We see far too many organizations failing in part because they have no idea they need to do this,” Lord said about strong authentication and FIDO adoption. “And that’s because they don’t have something that is nudging them in the right direction.”</p>



<p>Both Lord and Easterly advocated for technology vendors to make it easier for users to have strong authentication and provide security by default.</p>



<p>“Security features our customer rights, they’re not luxury goods,” Lord said.</p>



<p>FIDO Authentication has social impact</p>


 
 


<p>Jonathan Bellack, senior director, identity and counter-abuse technology at Google outlined some of the challenges that Google has seen for users adopting MFA and passwordless security.</p>



<p>“Our user research has shown at least from a consumer point of view, users don’t draw a distinction between any of the words we use in the industry like security, privacy, abuse as it all just kind of fits into this great amorphous blob of safety,” Bellack said.</p>


 
 


<p>He noted that consumers have very little time and they just want to know if they can do whatever task they want or need to complete online. To that end, Bellack detailed multiple efforts that Google has underway to embed security in a way that doesn’t introduce friction.</p>



<p>Christopher Harrell, CTO at Yubico, explained during his session how the use of FIDO authentication is being used by organizations around the world to help protect freedom and privacy. Yubico is working with the Freedom of the Press Foundation and Operation Safe Escape among other organizations. The company has donated over 20,000 keys to support many different government agencies in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do hope that the war ends soon but in the interim, we hope that we can help protect infrastructure from cyber attacks,” Harrell said.</p>



<p>FIDO users detail adoption challenges and opportunities</p>


 
 


<p>A key part of the program for Authenticate 2022 are user stories and there were plenty to be told on the first day of the conference.</p>



<p>Ian Glazer, SVP product management at Salesforce, described the highs and the lows of his company’s MFA adoption efforts. Salesforce decided in the fall of 2019 that it wanted to achieve 100% adoption of MFA across its services and it’s a journey the company has been on ever since.</p>



<p>Salesforce’s path toward 100% MFA adoption involved both technical considerations as well as a massive effort to engage with users, which led to solid results. Glazer noted that at the end of Salesforce’s fiscal year approximately 80% of its monthly active users were using MFA or SSO. While 80% is a noticeable achievement, it’s not the 100% goal that Salesforce has set. Glazer emphasized that the pursuit of the 100% adoption figure forces his team to continue to innovate and find ways to push adoption.</p>



<p>Salesforce has noticed multiple benefits from MFA adoption so far, including cost reduction and security improvements.</p>


 
 


<p>“Because we adopted MFA, we have seen a dramatic reduction in account takeovers,” Glazer said.</p>



<p>Microsoft is also pushing hard for broad adoption as it aims to enable a passwordless experience for its users. Scott Bingham, Senior Program Manager in Identity, and Emily Houlihan, Senior Product Manager at Microsoft, explained in their session what lessons have learned so far on their passwordless journey.</p>



<p>Bingham said that Microsoft has spent years rolling out support for temporary one time passwords, security keys, authenticator apps and Windows Hello as different password replacement offerings. Microsoft is increasingly moving toward eliminating passwords entirely.</p>



<p>“People want passwordless,” Bingham said. “Security is important, but user experience is critical and helps to drive demand.”</p>


 
 


<p>USAA, which provides financial services to members of the U.S. military and veterans, is also adopting FIDO and MFA to help secure its users. Dereck Henson, technical security architect at USAA, provided a series of key lessons learned during his session.</p>



<p>His first lesson learned is that it’s a good idea to default to strong authentication from the start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We found that it’s a whole lot easier to start someone in an MFA, highly secured program, rather than to convince them to change their mind later,” Henson said.</p>



<p>Another key lesson that USAA has learned is that when it comes to a passwordless approach, being entirely passive and not showing users that authentication in place, is not a winning scenario. Henson said that USAA members were calling in saying they had been members for decades and couldn’t believe they could just log in with a fingerprint. To that end, USAA has had to add some interstitial screens to its authentication workflow that tell users their access is being secured.</p>



<p>“So not only do you have to be secure, you have to actually look secure,” he said.</p>



<p>Financial service giant Citi has also embraced the FIDO strong authentication approach. Matthew Nunn, Director, Secure Authentication Architecture &amp; Technology Engineering at Citi, did not mince words in his session about why there is a need to move away from passwords.</p>


 
 


<p>Nunn said that there really isn’t a meaningful way to make passwords more secure.</p>



<p>“The reason you’re doing passwords and we’ve been doing it for so long is because we are held hostage to the keyboard being the interface to use in order to interact with the system,” Nunn said.</p>



<p>He added that with passwordless, users are no longer held hostage and there is the ability to take advantage of capabilities in devices to authenticate, instead of users needing to regurgitate a password.</p>

<p>By: FIDO Staff</p>



<p>The second day of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.authenticatecon.com/">Authenticate 2022</a>&nbsp;conference had a mix of topics and speakers that spanned multiple facets of the authentication world including payment security, biometrics, national identity and design systems.</p>



<p>The day got started with a keynote from Doug Fisher, senior director at Visa, who discussed the current state of the global payments system and the challenges it faces. Fisher noted that while ecommerce fraud remains a pervasive risk, strong online authentication is helpful to help reduce that fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A challenge for stronger forms of authentication for ecommerce is often that it introduces more friction into the consumer buying process, which can lead to shopping cart abandonment. To help solve that issue, Fisher explained that the FIDO Alliance, EMVCo and the W3C have been working together to help improve interoperability in a bid to reduce payment authentication friction. The joint effort had led to the Secure Payment Confirmation (SPC) standard that is currently in development</p>



<p>“SPC is a web standard currently in development that is built on WebAuthn to support streamlined authentication during a paymen</p>



<p>t transaction,” Fisher said. “SPC and FIDO go together like peanut butter and jelly.”</p>



<p>The perils of MFA</p>



<p>Not all multi-factor authentication (MFA) technologies are equal was the primary message in a session led by Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4.</p>


 
 


<p>Grimes outlined a litany of MFA bypass techniques that could potentially enable attackers to exploit vulnerable users. He emphasized however that FIDO based strong authentication is unlike MFA in that it can help to eliminate many of the man-in-the-middle attacks that enable bypassing techniques.</p>



<p>“MFA attacks have been around for decades but it certainly is going mainstream this year,” Grimes said.</p>



<p>The risks of non-FIDO MFA is top of mind for Heikki Palm Henriksen, CTO of BankID.</p>


 
 


<p>Henriksen’s organization provides a digital identification that is widely used in Norway. BankID started to look at FIDO in 2020 and discovered the insightful white papers produced by the alliance which helped Henriksen and his team to choose FIDO and begin implementation.</p>



<p>“We realized that FIDO2 was the best solution to modernize BankID to reach our goals,” Henriksen said.</p>



<p>Biometric considerations for FIDO</p>


 
 


<p>Strong authentication can make use of biometrics such as a fingerprint reader or facial recognition system, as an authenticator.</p>



<p>Biometric systems however are not universally without fault or bias, which is an issue that was discussed by Stephanie Schuckers, director, Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) at Clarkson University.</p>



<p>“When we talk about bias related to biometrics, what we’re really talking about is variability in performance due to demographics or demographic differentials,” she said.</p>



<p>Shuckers emphasized that bias relates to the specific technology implementation being used, not the whole field of biometric recognition. Through testing and certification, it is possible to better understand and reduce the risk of potential bias.</p>



<p>Greg Cannon, principal AI/ML standards at Amazon joined Schuckers for a panel session, emphasizing that the goal is to help eliminate passwords and biometrics is a great technology for doing that.</p>



<p>To help illustrate the point that biometrics spoofing is a concern that testing can help to solve, Shuckers brought some props on stage, including a mask of her own face, which apparently did not fool the facial detection system on her phone.</p>



<p>Consumer authentication habits</p>



<p>Understanding how users view authentication is an important aspect of understanding what needs to be done to help improve adoption.</p>


 
 


<p>The FIDO Alliance conducts an annual survey that looks at consumer habits for trends and adoption of authentication technologies. Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing at FIDO Alliance, said that the 2022 survey shows users are in some respects entering their passwords less than prior years, though the data is far from being definitive.</p>



<p>Perception of biometrics is also re-assuring as a potential way to help eliminate the use of passwords.</p>



<p>“We have actually been very pleased with consumer sentiment towards biometrics,” Shamas said. “In fact, a lot of consumers that we surveyed find it to be the most secure way to log in.”</p>



<p>Helping to reduce remote authentication fraud</p>


 
 


<p>Marianne Crowe, vice president, secure payments innovation and research at Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, used her time on stage to ask for more cooperation across the authentication ecosystem to help secure against fraud.</p>



<p>Crowe noted that there is consumer fatigue with passwords and many users will just reuse the same passwords on multiple sites which is an unsafe practice. MFA is helpful, but she noted that it is often inconsistent today in how it is presented to consumers.</p>



<p>“We’ve got to try to increase implementation and adoption of MFA even in industries and businesses that aren’t required to do it,” Crowe said.</p>



<p>Design system comes to FIDO</p>



<p>One of the ways consistency can come to authentication and specifically to FIDO based strong authentication is with the use of a design system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations can now benefit from the FIDO design system at&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/design-system">fidoalliance.org/design-system</a>&nbsp;that provides principles, patterns and reusable components.</p>


 
 


<p>“Our intention for putting all this together is to make FIDO deployments simpler and faster for product designers, for project managers, product managers and engineers,” Kevin Goldman, chief experience officer at Trusona, said. “Our intention is to fill the gaps that they might have around authentication in their own design systems.”</p>



<p>The final day of Authenticate 2022 is looking to be another day loaded with useful content, thoughtful discussion, more user stories and best practices to help organizations move to the passwordless future.Want to attend the final day of Authenticate 2022?

 A simple moderation process <p>We’ve been moderators in various communities across the web and IRL. Great moderators interest themselves for healthy, positive, vibrant Community of Practice. After all, being a moderator is an important community role. It influences the culture within a community!</p><p>In this post, we generalise our facilitation approach in online Communities of Practice (and share some classic gifs). We follow these steps to find pockets of activity and be responsive to community members.</p><a href="https://whimsical.com/moderator-8oUgMCEHwqMRKf7rWhG2KT">How to become a KBW moderator</a> 0. Schedule time for moderation <p>We’ve often come across organisations or projects that try to do community moderation on the fly. Others say “everyone on Team X is a moderator”, but don’t allow for time to actually do the moderation. Lots of people think that moderation is something that just “happens”. It’s not, moderation needs designated time. Schedule at least a half an hour each week to run through your moderation process. Your community will be a lot more engaged for&nbsp;it!</p> 1. Check for new introductions <p>Every community should have a place for people to introduce themselves. Whether a forum thread or an #introduction Slack channel, this space helps community members get to know each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Provide a prompt to help people introduce themselves. In the Keep Badges Weird community, we ask people to tell the community why they’ve joined and a “weird” tidbit or fact. We check for new introductions and reply to people once they’ve written about themselves. The “weird” tidbit provides for some very interesting initial conversations. Oh, and we issue a badge once people have introduced themselves too!</p> 2. Check for new&nbsp;members <p>The introduction thread or channel is also a great place to keep track of new members who have joined the community. Depending on where your community is organised, you might also have the ability to see when people join or sign up. The Keep Badges Weird community is on the <a href="https://www.participate.com/">Participate platform</a>, so moderators can easily see when new folks have joined. We’ve set our notifications to let us&nbsp;know!</p><p>Whenever a new member joins your community, take a moment to reach out and welcome them. We send direct messages and ask people to introduce themselves. We’ve written about how important personal invitations are in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/quick-wins-to-improve-your-open-source-communitys-architecture-of-participation-9d0e6c8d60fe">quick wins to improve participation</a>.</p> 3. Check for comments and&nbsp;shares <p>Discussions and comment threads might be a bit more sporadic then introductions. Check your community forum and channels for any new discussions, questions or comments. If you have ways for people to submit resources or ideas, you’ll want to check those&nbsp;too!</p><p>Use “follow” or “track” functions to allow you to watch discussions so that you don’t miss new messages. People need timely and relevant feedback. It can be disheartening if someone doesn’t receive an answer. Great moderators do their best to make sure that conversations keep&nbsp;moving.</p> 4. Check for event&nbsp;updates <p>A successful community will have regular events and activities. Get into a habit to make sure the community events calendar is up-to-date. Activities grow as communities do! Setting the habit in the beginning means you’ll have updated information when a lot more of it is flowing at you. It seems simple, but outdated links or text often make it impossible for people to take part in&nbsp;events.</p> 5. Post regularly <p>There are a lot of different types of content and one or another might work better for your community. Experiment with various formats and ask people for feedback. Share different kinds of information and share early and often. Make a schedule, though, and post on a regular basis. People will get used to seeing moderator posts, and they’ll know that there is momentum in the community.</p><p>Moderation is both a science and an art. There are practical tactics and processes you can use to increase participation. There are empathetic behaviours need to help community members feel like they belong. Both are essential for building communities.

<p>Kia ora e te whānau<br><br>As signalled in last month’s newsletter,&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Submission_OPC-Consultation-on-Biometrics_4-October-2022-1.pdf">DINZ’s submission</a>&nbsp;to<a href="https://privacy.org.nz/news/consultations/use-of-biometric-information-in-aotearoa-new-zealand/">&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/assets/New-order/News/Consultations/Privacy-regulation-of-biometrics-in-Aotearoa-New-Zealand.pdf">the Office of the Privacy Commissioner’s consultation paper on Biometrics&nbsp;</a>did proceed to plan, and we were grateful to receive OPC’s thanks and acknowledgement of the work put in by our special interest group of DINZ members. Read and note our conclusions as to the adequacy of the Privacy Act in the field of biometrics, the challenge of the limited scope of OPC’s mandate and the need for more structured guidance and targeted compliance before defaulting to all-encompassing legislative intervention – perhaps preemptively.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As biometrics continues to dominate domestic headlines in the context of law enforcement, I am reminded of Ann Cavoukian’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf">7 principles of Privacy by Design</a>, notably Principle 4; ‘Full Functionality — Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum. Privacy by Design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by Design avoids the pretense of false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, demonstrating that it is possible to have both’. Let’s be honest. It’s not always easy to achieve, but if a combination of actions and processes that derive from the 7 principles (or others such as those IPPs in the Privacy Act) can be agreed upon and transparently operated, the right balance can be found. That is what we expectantly hope for as the parties work it out – as I’m confident they will.<br><br>The other great piece of mahi emerging from DINZ over the past month is this&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Inclusive-and-Ethical-Use-of-Digital-Identity-1.pdf">Research and Discussion Paper</a>&nbsp;produced by the leads of the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Uses of Digital Identity working group</a>. Its purpose is to set a baseline from which the real mahi of this member group can build from. The topic area has a range of interwoven themes involving policy, society and culture and the group is keen to target one or more aspects where the development of good practice can positively impact outcomes. If it was easy other groups would have resolved it by now! So please&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/10/DINZ-Inclusive-and-Ethical-Use-of-Digital-Identity-1.pdf">read the paper</a>&nbsp;and feed back your comments and interest in participating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As with all significant mahi produced in the past year, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/submissions/">Our Work</a>&nbsp;on our website and browse.<br><br>Lastly, watch out for a slew of Event announcements coming soon. The report that integrates DINZ’s general public and business attitudinal research results into the landscape in which digital identity operates in Aotearoa, is nearly complete. The report and its highlights will be showcased at events planned for later in November.<br><br>Meanwhile members, don’t forget the&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2022/10/06/executive-council-nominations-now-open/">annual elections for the Executive Council</a>. There’s still time to nominate yourself or someone else. And get out to vote!<br><br>Ngā mihi nui,</p>

<p>FIDO Alliance’s second annual Online Authentication Barometer reveals the habits, trends and adoption of authentication technologies</p>



<p>Summary of key findings:</p>



  Entering passwords has dropped globally&nbsp;– by 5% – 9% across all use-cases tracked, as people adopt more convenient ways of logging in.  Yet passwords are still the most-used authentication method and they are proving costly to service providers&nbsp;– 59% of people gave up on accessing online services and 43% abandoned purchases in a given month.  The use of SMS OTPs has increased globally&nbsp;–&nbsp;by 1% – 4% as it is increasingly offered by service providers as a multi-factor authentication method.  Businesses need a way to offer people the convenience they want without sacrificing security&nbsp;– passkeys is one new approach and is on the radars of 48% of 18-34 year-olds.  The metaverse has gained traction yet phishable authentication dominates despite security concerns&nbsp;– 61% of metaverse users are concerned over their security and privacy yet 38% use a password.  



<p>SEATTLE, WA, October 18, 2022&nbsp;— The&nbsp;<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>&nbsp;today published its second annual&nbsp;<a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Authenticate-2022-Barometer-Report.pdf">Online Authentication Barometer</a>, which gathers insights into the state of online authentication in 10 countries across the globe. New to the Barometer this year, the FIDO Alliance has begun tracking authentication in the metaverse, and plans to incorporate utilization of technologies like passkeys in future editions of the report.</p>



<p>Key findings</p>



<p>The 2022 Online Authentication Barometer has identified that entering passwords online has dropped by 5% – 9% across all five major use-cases that it tracks – including accessing financial services, work computers and accounts, social media, streaming services, and smart home devices – compared to last year.</p>



<p>Despite this, passwords remain the dominant form of online authentication and cause major issues for people and businesses. For example, 70% of people had to recover a password at least once in a given month. Service providers and retailers also were impacted, with 59% of people giving up on accessing online services in a given month and 43% abandoning purchases because they couldn’t remember their password.</p>



<p>Data from the Barometer also suggests these issues with remembering and entering passwords are leading more people to stay logged into accounts, rising by 5% – 11% across all use-cases, as people opt for greater convenience. Other notable trends include multi-factor authentication through SMS One-Time Passcodes (OTPs) rising between 1% – 4% across all use-cases, as this legacy form of second-factor authentication is increasingly offered by service providers to rapidly improve consumer security and to meet regulatory requirements.</p>



<p>“This year’s Barometer data reveals that people see entering passwords as a pain and avoid it when they can,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “Service providers realize the inconvenience and security issues with passwords and are offering more ways to authenticate such as cookies to stay logged in and/or legacy MFA like SMS OTPs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shikiar added: “However, these attempts at convenience and security are still based on outdated and phishable authentication technologies that everyone needs to move away from if we are ever going to stop the constant onslaught of data breaches. Organizations should all have implementation of modern, phishing-resistant authentication on their roadmaps, whether it is via on-device biometrics, FIDO security keys or passkeys.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tracking emerging technologies</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance’s Online Authentication Barometer is designed to track habits, trends and adoption across key use-cases, including new technologies and use-cases as they are adopted. This year, it began tracking the metaverse as one of its key online use-cases. The Barometer also sampled early insights into passkeys, which are FIDO credentials designed to replace passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps.</p>



<p>Almost a third of people (31%) have logged into the metaverse recently, with 61% concerned over their security and privacy. Despite this, phishable authentication methods dominate with 38% of people logging in with passwords, 24% using password plus OTPs, and 21% remaining logged in. Other, more secure, possession-based methods like biometrics (26%) and physical security keys (16%) are also prevalent.</p>



<p>Passkeys, which provide secure and convenient passwordless sign-ins to online services, appear to&nbsp;</p>



<p>have a high level of awareness, despite only being announced this year. The data shows that 39% of people are familiar with the concept of passkeys – and this is especially high among 18-34 year-olds at 48%. FIDO’s Online Authentication Barometer will track the adoption of passkeys in next year’s report and determine how far this early awareness translates into usage.</p>



<p>Ends</p>



<p>Notes to editors:</p>



  Research for the FIDO Alliance’s Online Authentication Barometer was conducted by Sapio Research among 10,044 consumers across the UK, France, Germany, US, Australia, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, India and China.

<p>Key Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Standards Put to the Test</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 18 October, 2022 – The OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti">Cyber Threat Intelligence Technical Committee</a> (CTI TC) conducted its first STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 PlugFest, hosted by Peraton. Members of the CTI TC confirmed the multi-vendor interoperability of their CTI tools and verified their compliance with the STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 Interoperability Test Documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2021/06/23/stix-v2-1-and-taxii-v2-1-oasis-standards-are-published/">STIX and TAXII standards</a> are widely used to prevent and defend against cyberattacks by enabling threat intelligence to be analyzed and shared among trusted partners and communities. The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cti-interoperability">CTI TC Interoperability Subcommittee</a> (SC) helps guide adherence to CTI TC-promulgated standards and interoperability between CTI TC standards-based implementations, while encouraging standards maturity throughout the industry.</p>



<p>“The PlugFest was a collaborative, hybrid experience with both in-person and virtual attendees. It was a successful event, with levels of interoperability achieved among the participants,” said CTI TC Interoperability SC co-chair, Kartikey Desai, of MITRE. “Participants shared ideas about user interfaces and features while planning future opportunities for more efficient data creation and processing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This event brings visibility to the growing list of organizations that support interoperability adoption,” said Marlon Taylor of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (DHS CISA), who co-chairs the Interoperability SC with Desai. “We encourage any organization involved in CTI to collaborate with us and demonstrate their support for STIX and TAXII at future PlugFest events.”</p>



<p>“We have always given great importance to STIX2/TAXII2 interoperability testing and are fortunate to have participated in many PlugFest events over the years, ever since the very first PlugFest in 2018,” said Koji Yamada, Research Manager at Fujitsu System Integration Laboratories LTD. “In this year’s PlugFest, although we passed most interoperability tests, we have identified areas for future improvement. We strongly encourage all software vendors that use STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1 standards to participate in future PlugFest interoperability events.”</p>



<p>“Participation in PlugFest events shows vendor commitment to STIX and TAXII interoperability compliance,” said Marlon Taylor. “Standardizing the promotion of STIX and TAXII compliance would ease consumer evaluation of interoperable STIX and TAXII products.”</p>



<p>OASIS and the CTI TC’s Interoperability Subcommittee commends all participants for a successful event and is grateful to Peraton for hosting the PlugFest at their facility outside Washington, DC.</p>



<p>Any organization that is developing STIX 2.1/TAXII 2.1 capabilities is encouraged to get involved. Organizations interested in participating in the OASIS CTI TC Interoperability Subcommittee and future events should contact <a href="mailto:communications@oasis-open.org">communications@oasis-open.org</a>.</p>



<p>About STIX 2.1 and TAXII 2.1</p>



<p>Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) v2.1 and Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII) v2.1 are widely used to prevent and defend against cyberattacks by enabling threat intelligence to be analyzed and shared among trusted partners and communities. The STIX standard defines a JSON-based language for sharing structured threat intelligence in a consistent, machine-readable manner, allowing organizations to better protect against, detect, and respond to cyber threats. STIX v2.1 adds new objects and capabilities, enabling it to better describe the cyber threats we confront today, as well as future-proofing STIX via STIX Extensions. As a result, STIX v2.1 creates a solid and stable foundation for vendors and consumers alike to exchange actionable CTI.</p>



<p>The TAXII standard defines a transport protocol which supports the exchange of STIX data over Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). TAXII enables machine-to-machine sharing of CTI by defining an API that supports common sharing models used by industry and Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs).</p>

<p>The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada Launches Voilà Verified Program to Spotlight World-Class Vetted Digital Identity Solutions.</p>



<p>Toronto, October 18, 2022 – The <a href="https://diacc.ca/">Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada</a> (DIACC) has officially launched the Voilà Verified Trustmark Program – the first and only certification program to determine digital identity service compliance with the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/pctf-overview/">Pan-Canadian Trust FrameworkTM</a> (PCTF).</p>



<p>A non-profit coalition of over 115 public and private members, the DIACC develops research and opportunities to enable Canada’s confident, safe, and full participation in a global digital economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One size does not fit all when it comes to identity solutions – but ensuring a solution delivers upon a defined duty of care is critical,” says Joni Brennan, president of the DIACC. “With the PCTF, and now with Voilà Verified, there is an opportunity to adopt a framework rooted in trust – and to earn compliance recognition. Voilà Verified identifies those who are ‘walking the walk’ –&nbsp; those who are delivering safe and secure access to the global digital economy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DIACC’s PCTF is a publicly available framework for identity solutions that defines client, customer, and individual duty of care. The Voilà Verified program provides a vetting and assessment opportunity where PCTF-compliant solution vendors can earn a public-facing Trustmark. The result? Spotlight visibility of trustworthy, safe, reliable, and efficient solutions.</p>



<p>“The PCTF being leveraged on a global scale marks a significant opportunity across industries,” says Franklin Garrigues, VP External Ecosystems at <a href="https://clicktime.symantec.com/3RHvB8cGMXspcP51pBTit217VN?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcts.businesswire.com%2Fct%2FCT%3Fid%3Dsmartlink%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.td.com%252Fca%252Fen%252Fpersonal-banking%252F%26esheet%3D52286601%26newsitemid%3D20200915005744%26lan%3Den-US%26anchor%3DTD%2BBank%26index%3D5%26md5%3D372921976ab1c50e42cd675da4f0b96b">TD Bank Group</a>, DIACC Board Vice-Chair. “Voilà Verified is rooted in safety, protection, and reliability. This program enables safe access to the global digital economy with certainty.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voilà Verified presents an opportunity to grow provincial-level investments in digital identity solutions. Provincial governments who have launched identity services can now earn a Trustmark of their own, and provinces that are on the cusp of entering the digital solution market can do so with confidence by seeking vendors with a Voilà Verified Trustmark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Going digital is a big step for governments – and now, with Voilà Verified, provincial leaders are empowered to do so with confidence by engaging solution vendors that will protect end-users first and foremost,” says Colleen Boldon, Director, Digital Lab and Digital ID Programs, Public Services and Smart Government, Province of New Brunswick and DIACC Board member.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ruth Puente, Voilà Verified’s Trustmark Verification Program Manager, says a leading component of the program’s development was to ensure its procedures aligned with the <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html">International Organization of Standardization</a> (ISO).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is inclusive yet diligent in verifying PCTF-compliant solutions. The program was developed in alignment with ISO<a href="https://www.iso.org/benefits-of-standards.html"> standards</a> – and empowers informed decision making in a rapidly growing ecosystem of identity solutions.”</p>



<p>Puente, based in Madrid, Spain, brings international perspective and expertise to the Voilà Verified program with deep experience in internet governance policy and public affairs, trust and privacy innovation, and digital identity frameworks and certification.</p>



<p>“Delivering high-quality service is our priority. Customer protection is our priority. Increasing access to trustworthy solutions is our priority. We have formed teams of international experts to perform assessments and to oversee the process through an impartial lens,” says Puente.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entities who are responsible for <a href="https://diacc.ca/voila-verified-program-public-directory%ef%bf%bc/">assessing</a> PCTF compliance within the Voilà Verified program are known as Accredited Assessors, Readiness Advisors, and Testing Laboratories.</p>



<p>The first official Accredited Assessor and Readiness Advisor is <a href="https://kuma.pro/">KUMA</a>, a private sector DIACC member and global privacy, security, and identity consulting firm specializing in custom cybersecurity solutions – now <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202206/kuma-expands-digital-identity-assessments-with-canadian-trustmark-certification">the world’s first and only</a> assessor to offer identity assessments in the US, Canada, and the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“KUMA is bringing the same expertise to the Voilà Verified program that we’ve been bringing to our clients for over a decade,” says Michael Magrath, KUMA’s Managing Director of Digital Identity. “We are dedicated, alongside the DIACC, to generate growth opportunities for identity solutions across Canada and the globe.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Voilà Verified Trustmark Oversight Board (TOB) will make all final verification decisions based on reports from accredited entities. Made up of third-party volunteers with international expertise in identity management, auditing, compliance, cybersecurity, information security, and law, the TOB is the highest operating body of Voilà Verified. It is subject to impartiality, confidentiality and conflict of interest policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified is a unique opportunity in which I am honoured to share my experience as an advisor and auditor within information security, compliance, and identity,” says Björn Sjöholm, Cybersecurity Entrepreneur of Seadot, and TOB Chair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vendors are turning to the Voilà Verified program for several reasons, but the leading value proposition is market differentiation. Trustmark holders stand out from competitors by unlocking global business opportunities through international recognition and credibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Voilà Verified puts internationally reputable identity solutions on the map,” says Dave Nikolejsin, the DIACC’s Board Chair. “This is the way forward. With lateral growth of PCTF compliance across sectors – public and private – we establish a common value of trust. Launching Voilà Verified is a monumental stride for Canada to influence a safe and secure global digital economy.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Geneva, Switzerland, October 2022&nbsp;<br></p><p>After releasing the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/blog/dde-launch">Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) v1.0</a> architecture in July 2022, the Human Colossus Foundation announces the release of Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA). OCA enables “Objectual Integrity”, an essential DDE Principle of the DDE Trust Infrastructure’s Semantic Layer, by providing an interoperable solution for data capture and exchange, agnostic to existing data models and representation formats. The release includes the launch of the <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/">OCA website</a>, which hosts the <a href="https://humancolossus.foundation/s/HCF-Overlays-Capture-Architecture-OCA-v1.pdf">OCA v1.0 specification</a> and <a href="https://oca.colossi.network/ecosystem/tour.html">reference implementation</a>, and the announcement of the Decentralised Semantics Working Group (DSWG), the formal governing body for further developing the official OCA specification.</p><p>Paul Knowles, a Co-Founder and the Head of the Advisory Council of the Foundation, is the architect of an entirely new data domain, Decentralised Semantics. His conceptual modelling of this new domain led to the invention of OCA, which provides a data harmonisation solution within and across distributed data ecosystems to ensure the objectual integrity of any digital object and its relationships with other objects. OCA facilitates semantic interoperability and privacy-compliant data sharing throughout any DDE-compliant ecosystem, offering a comprehensive solution for defining deterministic metadata, structuring digital objects, and harmonising data payloads.</p><blockquote><p>"OCA is a core utility architecture for capturing the metadata necessary to interpret and preserve the meaning of inputted data. ‘Characters’ provide the essential elements required for written language in the physical world. In the digital world, stored sequences of bytes known as ‘data’ represent these elements. However, without a system of interpretation, data has no inherent morphological, definitional, or contextual meaning. OCA enables this interpretation by providing an architecture to capture the ‘metadata’, sets of data that provide meaning to any stored sequence of bytes. In addition, OCA introduces a comprehensive solution to support data validation, transformation, and presentation requirements throughout a data lifecycle.&nbsp;</p><p>Before co-founding the Human Colossus Foundation, my previous life was as a "data wrangler" in the pharmaceutical industry, repeatedly encountering data aggregation issues when working with supposedly "clean data" supplied by my colleagues in data management. So, after 20 years as a statistical programmer, I took the plunge and transitioned to the sharp end of data capture as a data architect. From that new vantage point, I gained valuable insights into the cause of many of the data aggregation issues I had encountered further upstream, which continued to cost the company millions of dollars daily. I also found that I was in an influential position to improve the company's internal semantic architectural design initiatives.</p><p>So, four years later, after bidding farewell to that esteemed position as a corporate data architect with nothing more than a conceptual draft of a layered architecture for data capture written in the back of my notebook, I'm excited to announce the rollout of OCA as a global solution for data harmonisation at scale. What a journey it has been. I look forward to our continued journey together to take OCA to the next level of technical maturity while helping many of you resolve data harmonisation issues with OCA and the supportive tooling we are developing at the Foundation."</p><p>- Paul Knowles, Co-Founder and the Head of the Advisory Council of the Foundation</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Decentralised Semantics and OCA</p><p>Data Semantics is the study of the meaning and use of data in any digital environment that focuses on how a data object represents a concept or object in the real world. Decentralised Semantics is an emergent domain that provides enhanced data modelling for an evolving data-agile economy comprising distributed data ecosystems where harmonisation between competing standards is essential for data object comprehension in any bilateral exchange.</p><p>This new data domain recognises the reality of standardisation complexities in an ever-evolving digital landscape of peer-to-peer interactions not addressed today; examples of gaps include inaccurate use of data due to its misinterpretation at the point of exchange. In other words, upstream data comprehension erodes without well-defined metadata at the start of the data lifecycle. Therefore, the harmonisation process must occur at the earliest stage of the life cycle, the point of initial data capture, where its contextual meaning is fresh and more manageable than further upstream.&nbsp;</p><p>It is critical to double down on investments in Decentralised Semantics, including supportive standards and tools, because by most estimates, unstructured data accounts for at least 80-90% of the digital data universe and current solutions often disregard the data harmonisation process, leaving no guarantee of the data's objectual integrity throughout a given lifecycle. We invented OCA to offer a comprehensive solution for data harmonisation at the Semantic Layer (Layer 1 in the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf">DDE Trust Infrastructure Stack</a>) so that machines and people can precisely understand the intended use of accurate data in the correct context across distributed data ecosystems.</p><p></p><p>Explaining OCA through a Use Case 	</p><p>Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) marks a new paradigm shift in “Objectual Integrity”, with "Overlays" providing the necessary separation of granular tasks to enable seamless semantic interoperability across sectoral and jurisdictional boundaries. An "OCA bundle" consists of a "Capture Base" and "Overlays", which in amalgamation, represent a contextually-rich schema.</p>

<p>This separation of tasks into task-specific objects facilitates the core pillars of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR Guiding Principles</a>, where all objects should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) for machines and people. In addition, the granular separation of semantic “overlays'' enables distributed custodianship of specific objects within a bundle where the responsibility of separate tasks can reside with different actors without compromising the objectual integrity of the overall semantic structure. As a result, actors from various institutions can contribute to defining schemas for complex use cases, supply chains, and data flows supported by multi-stakeholder data governance administrations and frameworks.</p><p>Take Switzerland as an example, a quadrilingual country with German, French, Italian, and Romansh as its national languages and many other minority languages, such as English, becoming increasingly important. The Swiss Constitution Article 70 lets the sovereign cantons define their official language to preserve linguistic harmony in their jurisdiction. The Swiss federal government would enable a collaborative solution to internationalisation by using OCA to separate language-specific overlays from any capture bases and core language-agnostic overlays issued by the federal government. Different cantons will be able to control and maintain their sets of language-specific overlays depending on their primary spoken language. In other words, distributed custodianship of language-specific overlays would enable regional authorities to manage the official translation of any document issued by a national federal government into their region’s official language(s).</p>

   A Digital ID Handbook is a tool for anyone who is confronting a national digital ID system and in search of strategies for organising around it. 
The post Digital IDs rooted in justice – APGT and TER present A Digital ID Handbook for civil society first appeared on The Engine Room.

<p>A few months ago, we published the findings of our research on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/community-call-digital-ids-rooted-in-justice/" title="">civil society advocacy on digital ID systems across the globe</a>. For this project, we spent a year working with a team of researchers in four countries (Indonesia, Jamaica, Pakistan, and Uganda), looking at how organised civil society actors seek to shape the design, implementation and oversight of digital ID systems, so as to mitigate or eliminate potential harms to vulnerable populations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of our main findings was the fact that, when it comes to digital ID systems, civil society actors have been pushed to work reactively, rather than proactively. We saw that groups were more often pushing for change within problematic proposals and systems, rather than being able to proactively advocate for a system that could meet the needs their communities actually face. In other words, civil society has been grappling with the impact and harms of digital ID systems as they are implemented, and not having the time or space to envision alternative frameworks for identification systems that put people’s needs and wants first. Throughout the research, justice was articulated by these actors as access – to better registration processes and to the services these IDs serve as barriers towards. And while access is crucial, as actors are reacting to material conditions on the ground, our research got us thinking that civil society, especially groups that represent and advocate for the most marginalised populations, could be leading the process of shaping digital ID systems that are rooted in justice for their contexts.</p>



<p>With that in mind, we partnered with <a href="https://www.peoplesguidetotech.com/" title="">A People’s Guide to Tech</a> to develop A Digital ID Handbook for civil society, a resource based on our research and APGT’s wealth of experience in popular education and in translating complex concepts into accessible information. </p>


 
<a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/A-digital-ID-handbook-APGT-The-Engine-Room-2022.pdf"></a>A digital ID handbook: strategies for navigating electronic identification systems 


<p>In the handbook, you will find a primer on digital ID systems, along with activities to support civil society organisations in developing their advocacy strategies for dealing with digital ID implementation and to exercise their ability to visualise what digital ID systems grounded in justice could look like. We hope this resource will be useful to civil society organisations and activists interested in learning more about digital ID and designing their own strategies for addressing these systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The guide is available for download <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/A-digital-ID-handbook-APGT-The-Engine-Room-2022.pdf" title="here">here</a> and at <a href="https://www.peoplesguidetotech.com/" title="">peoplesguidetotech.org</a>.</p>

 From data to assets — gateway to the knowledge economy <p>The upcoming new version 6 of OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) is introducing a paradigm shift to the OriginTrail ecosystem and marks the beginning of a new era. Until now, OriginTrail network delivered key enhancements to the world of decentralized data (such as integrity, interoperability and interconnectedness). With the new version, we are making the leap from exchanging data to creating assets from the data. This is possible with features of discoverability, verifiability and ownership of assets on the DKG representing anything in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsCUigu39Hw">physical and digital&nbsp;world</a>.</p><p>The new paradigm enables anyone to create DKG assets and own their connected “real estate” in the global Web3 graph, enabling a plethora of applications previously impossible due to lack of true data ownership primitives on the internet. The new functionality takes nothing away from the original value propositions but rather upgrades them with ownership, the OriginTrail technology and TRAC tokenomics need to be upgraded as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Before jumping into the tokenomics, let’s take a closer look at what the core building blocks — DKG assets — are from the perspective of DKG and how they influence the TRAC tokenomics. Assets consist of 4 components implemented across two network&nbsp;layers:</p>  The DKG layer hosts the asset graph state (1) in semantic form (RDF), identified by a new Web3 primitive — the Uniform Asset Locator (UAL) (2). Similar to how Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) made it possible to reference an object (e.g. a website or document) in Web2, UALs make it possible to reference anything physical or digital, in Web3. UALs extend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">existing web URI standards</a>, revolutionizing URLs as their counterparts in Web2. A UAL also inherits capabilities described in the W3C recommendation on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The UAL format (to be formally specified in further documents) therefore is in the following standardized form:<br> <br>dkg: [// DID] / UAI [“?” query] [“#” fragment]  The Blockchain layer is responsible for maintaining asset ownership record and asset graph state verifiability proofs. Information about ownership is kept in the form of an ERC 721 compatible Non Fungible Token (3). This allows us to tie DKG and blockchain layers even more closely together and enable ownership to be transferable in the form of NFT token transfer. State commit proofs (4) are used to verify that the asset graphs DKG nodes persist are available, haven’t been deleted or in any form tampered with, as well as enabling complex verifiable presentation implementations (according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a>).   Moving from data bundles to unique&nbsp;assets <p>The introduction of DKG assets is expected to induce an update of existing applications built on OriginTrail significantly, as previously bundled publishings (being just “data”) now get “unbundled” and packaged into unique assets, each published with their own asset graphs and UALs for referencing. In versions prior to v6, publishers would publish bundled “data dumps” in consolidated form actually containing information on sometimes hundreds or even thousands of actual physical objects — each of which in v6 is expected to become a uniquely published DKG asset with its own UAL as a verifiable, ownable identifier. Bundling can still be performed if needed by the asset publisher however — builders and developers now have more freedom to create different solutions on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>Assets can be continuously updated by their owners with new (immutable) assertions, allowing assets to increase their asset graph and their value. Assets also act as building blocks — they can be connected to other assets, be indexed in various ways (for search) and extended in many ways to improve the discoverability of the&nbsp;asset.</p> DKG as a Multi-chain Decentralized Knowledge Graph <p>OriginTrail technology is a system of 3 logical layers. The top layer is the application layer where web and mobile applications reside with their interfaces, backends and connectors to the DKG. Sitting below the applications we find OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph as layer 2. It consists of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN), a permissionless network of nodes that are maintaining a distributed knowledge graph of assets. Finally the consensus layer (layer 1) is implemented via blockchain enabling trusted interactions needed for the OriginTrail protocol. Since inception, the DKG was designed to enable multiple blockchains to support a single DKG. This design was for the first time implemented in 2021 when the DKG became multichain and leveraged the many efficiency gains this unlocked which led to over 10-fold jump in its adoption. After the initial Ethereum deployment, we have seen both Gnosis and Polygon blockchains get integrated with the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>After successfully obtaining <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/google-for-web3-specific-blockchain-origintrail-parachain-launches-today-heres-what-s-next-9a0d92bb72ef?source=collection_home---4------6-----------------------">the parachain slot on the Polkadot network earlier this year</a>, OriginTrail will now also receive a tailored blockchain layer network in the OriginTrail Parachain, allowing for yet another jump in its overall capabilities. This is particularly important for the OT-RFC-14 as the DKG v6 will have its inaugural launch on the OriginTrail Parachain. The OriginTrail Parachain and OriginTrail v6 DKG integration is effectively starting with the <a href="https://teleport.origintrail.io/">Teleporting process</a> to bring TRAC tokens from Ethereum to OriginTrail Parachain (explained in OT-RFC-12 and OT-RFC-13). The TRAC holders participating in the Teleport will also be the first to engage with the OriginTrail v6 and its new tokenomics presented below.</p> Guidelines to TRAC tokenomics <p>The OT-RFC-14 document is serving as a foundational piece upon which the first implementation of TRAC tokenomics in the v6 of OriginTrail DKG will be done. As with all TRAC tokenomics so far, the latest version is equally molded to support the adoption of the OriginTrail DKG, however this is the first time it takes full advantage of the upcoming OriginTrail DKG v6. When assessing the various aspects of TRAC tokenomics it’s important to keep a few high-level goals in mind, as they guide us to growing the ecosystem:</p>  Ease of use — asset publishers are the core users of the OriginTrail DKG and in order to allow them to engage with OriginTrail technology, it should be reasonably easy to&nbsp;use.  Cost efficiency — allow the market to achieve attractive prices by not wasting resources.  DKG node rewards — allow DKG nodes to get compensated for providing useful services to the network. By enabling an efficient market for the “supply side” of the DKG network, infrastructure runners can get fairly compensated.  Quality of service — ensure that applications querying the DKG (asset consumers) benefit from a high quality&nbsp;service.  Scalability of network activity — implement a system that has capacity to support the rising levels of adoption.  Decentralization — as a core consideration in any implementation and tokenomics decision, avoiding system control by any single&nbsp;party.   TRAC tokenomics stakeholders <p>The TRAC tokenomics stakeholders can be described through 4 system&nbsp;roles:</p>  DKG asset publishers are agents which create and manage knowledge graph entities (assets) by publishing asset graphs to the DKG according to the OriginTrail Protocol  DKG asset consumers are agents who discover, query and consume the DKG asset graphs created and owned by DKG asset publishers  DKG node runners, who run and maintain the DKG infrastructure nodes, providing the DKG&nbsp;services  TRAC Token holders, who participate in the ecosystem by providing economic support for system activities  <p>The roles indicated above however do not need to be distinct — one ecosystem actor can hold different roles at the same time. For example, DKG node runners are by definition also TRAC token holders as TRAC tokens are necessary for running DKG&nbsp;nodes.</p> DKG node&nbsp;services <p>The OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) natively operates on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN) which represents a permissionless decentralized system of nodes communicating according to OriginTrail protocol. Anyone with sufficient technical knowledge is able to run an OriginTrail DKG node and contribute to the system by doing so. By design, the DKG nodes receive compensation for the network services provided in the form of TRAC&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The DKG nodes are able to perform various different activities, specified by OriginTrail core protocol operations or through extensions. On the network level we can categorize these activities into two&nbsp;groups:</p>  Publishing protocols, which introduce additional asset graphs into the DKG (equivalent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_publishing">semantic web publishing</a>, or a database insert operations)  Querying protocols, which enable asset discovery through network queries (equivalent to database query operations)  <p>In OriginTrail v6 we distinguish two generic types of DKG network&nbsp;nodes:</p>  full or service nodes which provide network services implementing full DKG protocol choreographies. Full nodes persist the public DKG state, make it available and execute semantic queries, in return for getting compensated in TRAC&nbsp;tokens.  light nodes which do not provide network services, rather act as network gateways. They are not responsible for persisting the public DKG state as they do not have such capability (don’t respond to publish requests, therefore don’t qualify for rewards). Light nodes are analogous to the notion of light clients in blockchain networks, eliminating the need for gateways such as RPC services with having direct access to the DKG&nbsp;.  <p>Full DKG nodes implement services to facilitate the publishing and querying choreographies. Nodes can generally implement a variety of such protocols, building on the core components: assertions, shards and service agreements.</p><p>Assertions present graph data entries into the system. They constitute asset (data) graphs coupled with corresponding on-chain state commit proofs. In a general sense, assertions are “data building blocks’’ which represent asset graph state, search index entries or any such data structure implemented on the OriginTrail DKG. In OriginTrail v6 graph assertions are natively modeled in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/">RDF (Resource Description Framework)</a>, therefore all tooling of the Semantic Web stack is interoperable with OriginTrail on the core level. Assertions can be versioned, and are expected to be further aligned with standards and recommendations, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/07/rch-wg-charter/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20RDF,defining%20RDF%20Dataset%20Canonicalization%20algorithms.">the latest initiative led by Phil Archer of&nbsp;GS1</a>.</p><p>Assertion shards or replicas represent DKG entries positioned in the DKG index space (the index space is formed by all full nodes in the network), centered around a replica key, hosted by a number of DKG nodes. Specific groups of nodes in a replica are subsets of the DKG index space node “neighborhoods” (similar to distributed database shard concept), formed according to service agreements facilitated by the protocol. At any moment, one full node hosts a number of logical shards, and due to node id difference (different positions in the index space), different nodes are intended to host different pieces of the DKG. This mechanism achieves a randomized, yet highly organized, distribution of shards and data over the decentralized network.</p><p>Service agreements are defined on assertion level and incentivise availability for a particular set of assertion shards over a period of time. When service agreements no longer require assertion replicas or expire, the assertion replicas availability is no longer incentivized. For ease of implementation, service agreements are defined in terms of space quants, represented in bytes, and time quants called&nbsp;epochs.</p><p>Full DKG nodes receive assertions from asset publishers, form shards in qualifying neighborhoods hosting assertion replicas, which make assertion graphs available for querying during the service period. For these services, (full) nodes receive compensation in TRAC tokens. “Light” nodes enable interacting with the DKG (publishing, querying) without the capability of providing above mentioned services.</p> Publishing protocol choreography <p>The publishing protocol choreography is a coordinated activity between the publishers and DKG nodes whose goal is to form service agreements and establish assertion replicas on the DKG. Due to the decentralized nature of the system, the DKG nodes receive compensation for their services according to their defined service asks, expressed in TRAC tokens required for kb-epoch units. Using the publishing choreography of the DKG one can publish various different data structures on the DKG (assets, index entries for keyword search, vector search in the future&nbsp;etc).</p><p>A publishing choreography initiates a service agreement and is successful if a service bid provided by the publisher satisfies the required service asks posted by DKG nodes for the assertion replication in the given neighborhood. Service asks are posted by DKG nodes on-chain and updated on a regular basis, forming the service&nbsp;price.</p><p>An asset publishing choreography consists of 4&nbsp;phases:</p>  Preparation phase: the asset publisher prepares an assertion in the format expected by the&nbsp;protocol  Feature phase: initiates the appropriate functionality of the desired feature (e.g. updating an asset state) on the blockchain  Store phase: invokes the store protocol to create an assertion replica on the&nbsp;DKG  Commit phase: used to finalize the choreography and initiate the service&nbsp;period   Service market mechanics <p>The DKG service market is formed between asset publishers &amp; consumers on the demand side, and DKG node runners on the supply side. As the DKG is a decentralized environment no entity controls the market and each participant in the DKG gets to act based on their economic preferences.</p><p>For ease of use in OriginTrail v6, the asset publisher client derives a suggested bid for a service based on the price (according to on-chain asks provided by DKG nodes). Once a publisher creates a bid for their asset on chain (feature phase) and successfully creates required assertion replicas on the DKG (store phase), the nodes from the assertion replica submit commit proofs to the blockchain (commit phase). Once the commit phase is completed, the publisher tokens are locked in the system (in the bid amount, to be collected by DKG nodes), the publishing choreography is completed and the service period&nbsp;starts.</p><p>Assertion replicas are hosted by groups of DKG nodes forming shards, based on the following 3 criteria in order of importance:</p>  Key-space proximity criteria: assertions need to be replicated to nodes and maintained in a specific “neighborhood” of the DKG index space, specifically around the key where an assertion is to be kept. Nodes form neighborhoods based on the XOR distance of the assertion key to the node IDs, similar to how distance is determined <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf">in Kademlia DHT</a>. This criteria needs to satisfy efficient data discovery in the decentralized network environment by deterministically locating assertion replicas in querying choreographies. Additionally, due to assertion keys being consistently hashed, assertion replicas are evenly and randomly distributed across the network key-space. A neighborhood is formed by the R2 number of nodes (neighborhood size) which is a protocol parameter.  Node compensation asks: once the appropriate neighborhood is determined (satisfying the first criterion), the second requirement is to ensure that there are enough nodes willing to provide the service in that neighborhood, indicated by their compensation ask. A bid satisfying a minimum number of R1 nodes (R1 being the minimum set of “willing” nodes within an R2 neighborhood, R1 &lt;= R2) is considered a valid bid in terms of the second criterion, where R1 is a protocol parameter.  Security signal criterion: after both previous criteria have been satisfied, finally R0 nodes get chosen (R0 being the minimum replication factor) out of the R1 set, based on the amount of provided TRAC token stake. A higher stake of TRAC tokens in the system indicates higher quality of service guarantees by nodes, as the stake represents a collateral guarantee for nodes providing expected services and acting according to service agreements.  <p>An illustration of the publishing choreography criteria with regards to R0, R1 and R2 is provided below as an example for R2 = 8 and R0 =&nbsp;3.</p> Service period <p>During the service period, nodes involved in the service agreement need to provide service proofs during each epoch of the service to the blockchain. Providing service proofs consists of answering randomly generated cryptographic challenges for hosted assertions and submitting appropriate answers to the blockchain for verification. Successful proof generation and submission to DKG smart contracts in the designated period of time guarantees that a node indeed hosts the assertions required by the service agreement. Once a successful proof submission is performed on a blockchain integrated with the DKG, a portion of the locked tokens (during the publishing choreography) is released and designated for the hosting&nbsp;node.</p><p>In case a service node fails to provide a proof in an epoch, replacement nodes from the candidate node group can replace it in the service group by submitting service proofs (in case they host the required assertions) during the replacement period. The same criteria (as indicated above) apply for the replacement process (self-healing). Therefore by design, the entire network neighborhood is incentivised to host assertions opportunistically in order to be able to perform “self-healing” of replicas.</p><p>In the case of a node failing to provide services (and submit proofs), it is subject to stake slashing. Slashing is no way intended to punish nodes for reasonable latency in submitting proofs (such as short downtimes for updates, or while under load) but rather acts as a deterrent to longer service outages. Slashing is implemented as a lockup system, where a designated percentage S (S being a protocol parameter, suggested value being 5%) is being locked from the available amount of stake for a period T (T also as protocol parameter, suggested value being 2 years). In this way the node’s stake isn’t lost or redestributed among other stakeholders (which could drive malicious targeting of nodes), but rather incapacitated to be utilised in network activities for a significant time&nbsp;period.</p><p>Additionally, node replacements are possible in case when new (full) nodes join the DKG network. Since new joining (full) nodes will inevitably increase the coverage of the DKG index key space and become part of neighborhoods adjacent to their Node IDs, in order to provide high quality discoverability services (via the querying choreography) new nodes are incentivised to provision assertion replicas expected in those neighborhoods. Therefore all DKG v6 nodes joining the network for the first time will perform an opportunistic synchronization sequence loading the assertions in their immediate neighborhoods, enlarging replicas and making assertions available, with the aim to compete for the available compensation via replacement. The DKG tokenomics are designed therefore to incentivise the maintaining of healthy assertion replicas even with network growth as neighborhoods are changing. Replacements due to better positioning in the DKG index key space (and not due to lack of proof submission) do not initiate stake slashing.</p> Querying protocol choreography <p>We consider querying protocols as any protocols that enable discovery and information retrieval from the DKG. They present coordinated activities between asset consumers and the DKG node runners, aimed at finding and querying assets on the DKG, by leveraging the core protocol querying choreography and the DKG&nbsp;index.</p><p>The querying choreography on the DKG directs a generic query (such as a request for an asset by its identifier — the UAL, a SPARQL query or similar) to one or more assertion shards, effectively querying the appropriate “neighborhood” as designated by the publishing choreography. The query routing is equivalent to the Kademlia protocol among full nodes of the DKG. Light clients are not part of the routing protocol, however can invoke queries and publish assets through the network. (It is the responsibility of clients to implement publishing and querying specifics on the application layer to utilize the DKG sharded nature when designing information retrieval systems).</p><p>An asset querying choreography consists of 4&nbsp;phases:</p>  Preparation phase: the asset consumer client prepares a query in some way (e.g. taking input from a search&nbsp;box)  Feature phase: initiates the query prepared in the previous phase on the DKG, on the appropriate DKG shard, and performs necessary URI resolution if&nbsp;needed  Verification phase: verifies the obtained results from the feature phase using on-chain verifiability proofs (verifying immutability, state consistency, issuer or&nbsp;other)  Presentation phase: presenting the query result to the client in requested form  <p>Note that no global SPARQL endpoint in the system exists, due to its decentralized nature. Each of the nodes can however freely decide to build and expose their own SPARQL endpoints, having all implications of such a decision in mind (e.g. availability). The DKG enables queries on its shards via asset graph traversal facilitated by UALs. DKG nodes also implement local graphs (for storing private asset assertions, in their local triple stores) for which they can perform local SPARQL queries of any sort, on both the local asset graph and the loaded assets from the public DKG. More information on querying capabilities will be provided in the official documentation.</p> DKG Node service&nbsp;market <p>Nodes providing services to the DKG network are subject to the market forces (supply and demand), driven by the choreographies explained above. With the updated implementation in version 6, it is expected that DKG node runners obtain an easier and clearer way of determining the optimal market value of compensation for their services, enabling them to achieve profitability easier. Nodes are expected to maintain their asks on-chain, enabling the asset publisher applications to obtain the current market price for DKG services.</p><p>In unison, the market becomes more efficient due to an improved ability of DKG node runners to differentiate their services based on service quality (through availability, throughput, capacity) and security (proxied through the amount of TRAC collateral posted).</p><p>We envision a set of tools to enable easy management of service parameters for DKG node runners to achieve the best possible market return. Such tools would indicate the fluctuations in supply and demand, for example indicating network load increase (due to higher demand) which would have an impact on the service price in the positive direction, until the service supply is increased (via additional nodes joining the network).</p> Tokenomics role in system&nbsp;security <p>In order to reach the necessary system security level the OriginTrail network requires all full nodes to post an amount of TRAC tokens as security deposit in the system. With the new implementation of tokenomics as proposed above, the stake provided by nodes has a function also in the publishing choreography, as described by the third criterion. As nodes compete in the market based on prices and deployed stake in the network, it is expected from nodes to attract a higher amount of stake (either by directly depositing more TRAC by the node runner, or accepting delegated TRAC from the community) to position themselves better in the market. Delegated node staking becomes one of the additional features in OriginTrail v6 and will allow TRAC token holders to participate even further in the TRAC economy by delegating their tokens to nodes they pick, being eligible for sharing the compensation for services by those nodes. This new component of the tokenomics not only introduces new ways for ecosystem stakeholders to participate, but also motivates them to act as “quality signal providers”, as token holders need to carefully assess who to delegate their TRAC to to minimize the probability of slashing. DKG node runners are expected to become further specialized in capabilities needed to provide a high quality service to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>As stake slashing needs to be a meaningful deterrent to potential service outages, given the proposed slashing implementation above, the minimum required amount of posted stake for a full node will be increased to 50 000 TRAC in order to be eligible for operation. Nodes can achieve this minimum both through direct staking or by collecting delegated TRAC tokens from the community. (Note: delegated TRAC tokens cannot be controlled by node runners, only by delegators). Being a stake delegator is therefore similar to the notion of <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking">nominators in the Polkadot&nbsp;network</a>.</p><p>Detailed delegation and staking mechanics are to be presented in the coming&nbsp;RFCs.</p> OriginTrail v6 scalability considerations <p>The implementation of OriginTrail v6 introduces, as already mentioned, the notion of full and light nodes. It also clearly separates the functionalities to be implemented by clients and network nodes (which were previously one monolithic structure).</p><p>The responsibility of the dkg-client is therefore to implement the preparation and feature phases of both publishing and querying choreographies. DKG nodes implement all the network communication related phases and incentivisation functionalities, however are “relieved” of e.g. the preparation phase complexities and load, which are moved towards the network “edge” (clients). With the separation of concerns between the clients and nodes, as well as the new implementations choreographies illustrated above the DKG implementation becomes far more scalable.</p><p>Furthermore, with the new indexing logic and deterministic shard resolution, the nodes need to communicate significantly less, making the load of publishing even less strenuous on nodes, making them able to run more operations at the same time than previously. In this way the ODN becomes “less chatty” and achieves an order of magnitude scalability improvement in the DKG layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>Another consideration in scalability is the OriginTrail Layer 1 (blockchain), which in the system illustrated above is expected to handle a number of transactions per specific epoch. The limit of scalability in terms of blockchain can be calculated by the following equation:</p><p>Number of assets secured on DKG in one epoch = Epoch_length * block_size / number of proof transactions in an&nbsp;epoch.</p><p>The epoch_length is a system parameter that, based on the equation above, essentially determines the number of assets that can be supported by one blockchain in OriginTrail layer 1. We conclude that architecturally the blockchain layer doesn’t present an immediate bottleneck for the growth of the DKG. Iterative deployments and optimizations on the blockchain level, such as through more efficient smart contract code, or direct implementation of components in Substrate, are also expected over the course of OriginTrail evolution.</p> Conclusion <p>This RFC presents the updates to the TRAC tokenomics in the sixth version of OriginTrail protocol with details of the proposed implementation and activities the system needs to incentivise, grouped around publishing and querying choreographies. It introduces all the system stakeholders, their roles and activities the network needs to support each of the functionalities required from a decentralized knowledge graph.

<p>In April we kicked off new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/upcoming-community-call-new-research-biometrics-in-the-humanitarian-sector/" title="research on the use of biometrics within the Humanitarian sector">research on the use of biometrics within the Humanitarian sector</a>, in partnership with the Open Society Foundation’s migration initiative.</p>



<p>Following on from our previous <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Engine-Room-Oxfam-Biometrics-Review.pdf" title="">2018 report with Oxfam</a> that looked at the risks, harms and challenges of using biometric data for humanitarian purposes, this new research explores what’s changed (and what’s stayed the same) in the sector in the last four years, and takes a deeper look at organisational policies on biometrics, and the benefits risks and potential harms of using biometric systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we wrap up our research and writing, we are keen to share our initial findings and have a broader discussion about what changes are needed when it comes to the use of biometric technologies in the humanitarian sector.</p>



 Register for our second community call on 27 October, 9-10AM EST/ 3-4 PM CET 



<p>All are welcome! Whether you’re a practitioner, a civil society organisation working with impacted communities, or just keen to learn more, join us in our Community Call. Along with presenting our findings, we will create space for dialogue and reflection around the complexities of using biometric technologies within humanitarian contexts.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 What will we be talking about? 



<p>Our focus in this call will be to think through what needs to change in order to encourage a more responsible use of biometrics within the humanitarian sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the key questions that will be guiding our discussions are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 How do we think about necessity when it comes to using biometric systems? (e.g how do we compare biometrics to alternatives, what kind of evidence exists on risks and benefits, and what kind of evidence is lacking?) 



 What sort of policy-making practices and standards are important for creating a more cohesive approach to biometric use? 



 What kind of changes need to take place within the larger humanitarian landscape to facilitate the responsible and thoughtful use of biometric systems? 
 



<p>You can find more background on our last community call and this project <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/upcoming-community-call-new-research-biometrics-in-the-humanitarian-sector/" title="">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See you on October 27!</p>

				 <p>Danube Tech&nbsp;is building the Universal DID Saas, a hosted platform that allows developers to create, update, resolve, and deactivate Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs), as well as to perform several other advanced DID-related operations.</p>
<p>This company has participated in two of the the eSSIF-Lab Open Calls_ the Business-oriented Open Call and the Infrastructured-oriented Open Call.</p>
<p>We’ve had the pleasure to interview,&nbsp;Markus Sabadello,&nbsp;Danube Tech CEO, who has talked to us about what they have been able to achieve so far in his company since its participation in eSSIF-Lab project and what goals they want to accomplish in the medium or long term.</p>
 1. Please introduce yourself and tell us what your company is about. 
<p>My name is Markus Sabadello, I have a relatively large background of working on decentralised identity ideas and technologies. At Danube Tech,&nbsp;we are working on open-source software and commercial products that make it easy for others to build decentralised identity applications and services.&nbsp;Our priorities lie in implementing lower-level infrastructure components in the area of Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). What makes us special is that we put a strong emphasis on interoperability.</p>
<p>To be specific, we try to build technical components that work with different decentralised identity networks, different credential and proof formats, and different protocols.&nbsp;We focus less on building a single, isolated product that we can sell, and more on being part of a larger community and collaborating with others.</p>
 2. What services or products do you offer? 
<p>On the open-source side, we offer Java libraries that implement DIDs, VCs, Linked Data Proofs, CBOR-LD, and others. These libraries are generic and can be used by developers to build higher-level applications and services. Work on these software libraries has been supported by an ESSIF-Lab IOC2 grant. Two additional open-source projects, which are closely related to this, are the Universal Resolver (see&nbsp;<a href="https://uniresolver.io/">https://uniresolver.io/</a>) and Universal Registrar (see&nbsp;<a href="https://uniregistrar.io/">https://uniregistrar.io/</a>). These projects are quite well-known in the decentralised identity community and have received many contributions. Together, these tools provide an abstraction layer on top of different decentralized identity networks, such as Sovrin, EBSI, IDunion, Indicio, ION, Cheqd, Veres One, and many more. We see this work as an important contribution to building a globally interoperable ecosystem, and to avoid fragmentation of different efforts. As I mentioned before, with our work we are primarily focusing on low-level, foundational infrastructure.</p>
<p>On the commercial side, we are building production-grade enterprise products around the open-source projects. This is sometimes called an “open core” model. The products we are building can be used by companies and governments that want to adopt DIDs, VCs, and related technologies. One of these products is a Software-as-a-Software (SaaS) offering called Godiddy (<a href="https://godiddy.com/">https://godiddy.com/</a>). This has been supported by an ESSIF-Lab Business Oriente Open Call grant and was originally called “Universal DID SaaS”. Godiddy is a hosted platform that makes it easy for developers and solution providers to work with DIDs.</p>
 3. What milestones have you achieved so far since your project launch? 
<p>In our eSSI-Lab IOC2 project, we managed to release “complete” versions of most of our open-source libraries, and to continuously maintain them, since some of the underlying standards are also still evolving. We actively maintain these libraries, since we use them in our own products, and many others in the decentralised identity community use them as well. We also frequently participate in community activities such as developing test suites, or participating in interoperability events (plugfests).</p>
<p>In our BOC1 project, we have by now launched our Godiddy service as a working product, and we have paying customers. We also continuously maintain and expand the functionality of this product, for example by adding support for additional decentralised identity networks.</p>
 4. What have you achieved with your idea thanks to eSSIF_Lab project? 
<p>As mentioned in the previous answer, we managed to significantly advance both our open-source libraries and our Godiddy product to the point where both are actively used by other members of the decentralised identity community, as well as by important customers who are building their own applications and services for solving real-life use cases. You could say that eSSIF-Lab has really helped our company to evolve from merely building experimental tools, to a serious and ambitious actor that plays its part within a larger ecosystem, and hopefully helps SSI become successful on a large scale. During eSSIF-Lab, we were able to expand our team and grow the company.</p>
<p>ESSIF-Lab has also helped us to generate additional visibility for our work. And of course another important benefit of eSSIF-Lab (besides the funding and visibility) was the interaction and collaboration with other eSSIF-Lab subgrantees, and the support of the eSSIF-Lab consortium itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. What are your goals for the middle/long-time future?  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>We believe that DIDs will become as important on the Internet as IP addresses or domain names are today. Our goal is to further improve and expand our products in this area of foundational decentralised identity infrastructure. We want to contribute to interoperability in a global ecosystem and avoid isolated solutions that don’t work with each other.&nbsp;</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>We will continue to play an active role in standardization and community groups such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF), to make sure SSI is built on solid technical specifications. Our goal is also to further grow the company and become a leading provider of solutions for DID and VC technologies.</p>
 6. Any piece of advice for those who are looking for public funding? 
<p>I’m not an expert on this, but I would say:</p>
 
 Be optimistic&nbsp;– try again if an application doesn’t succeed at first, since rejection can happen for various reasons and doesn’t mean that your idea is bad. 
 Be honest&nbsp;– I have seen grant applications that contain outright lies, which is not fair towards the rest of the applicants, and ultimately not good for yourself. 
 Be grateful&nbsp;– I have heard people complain about the bureaucracy associated with public funding, but I think it’s not too much to ask to make an effort to get support for your project.

<p>Trusona, NEC, and Others Advance Open Standard to Improve QR Code Security in Passwordless Authentication</p> 


<p>Boston, MA, USA, 13 October, 2022 – OASIS Open, the international open source and standards consortium, announced the approval of Secure QR Code Authentication v1.0 as an OASIS Standard. Developed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=esat">Electronic Secure Authentication (ESAT) Technical Committee</a>, the standard supports trusted online transactions by establishing a general framework for using QR Codes for “no password” authentication. The new standard is based on an initiative spearheaded by Trusona in order to democratize the mass adoption of passwordless authentication.</p>



<p>“QR codes are popular for fast, simple scanning using a smartphone camera, but privacy and security concerns are growing as QR code adoption has increased during the pandemic,” said OASIS ESAT co-chair, Bojan Simic, of HYPR. “Secure QR Code Authentication shows that passwordless authentication is possible without compromising on security.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The standard provides the layers of security needed to protect against account take-over and identity theft while decreasing the likelihood of potential phishing,” said Trusona’s David Kopack, co-chair of the ESAT TC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“NEC congratulates the ESAT TC on the approval of Secure QR Code Authentication Protocol v1.0 as an OASIS Standard and is pleased to be part of the ESAT TC and has contributed to its release,” said Shinichi Fuchigami, General Manager, Cyber Security Strategy Department at NEC Corporation. “NEC believes that “no password” authentication standards are critical for trusted online transactions and drive its adoption with industry partnerships to benefit customers.“</p>



<p>Vendors involved in authenticating electronic identities, passwordless authentication providers, identity service providers, local and national governments, businesses, and individuals engaged in eGovernment and eCommerce are welcome to participate in the ESAT community.</p>

<p>Mountain View, Calif., October 13, 2022- The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> today announced the latest addition to its range of certification programs to address the rising need for stronger, simpler online identity verification: the Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Certification Program. The program allows vendors to certify that their mobile document verification solutions accurately determine if a government-issued identity document is authentic, matches the presented user, and complies with the performance criteria set forth in FIDO Alliance’s Document Authenticity (DocAuth) Requirements. Multiple vendors have started the certification process and the first FIDO DocAuth Certified products are anticipated to be available in early 2023.</p>



<p>As high-value services increasingly move online – from banking applications to government services – demand is rising for more robust verification solutions to validate user identities remotely by leveraging trusted government-issued ID documents. Accurate remote identity verification is also critical at the point of account creation, prior to FIDO authentication, and during the account recovery process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DocAuth Certification Program provides a standard testing process for organizations to prove their products can validate different government-issued ID document types across multiple geographies, and that they are fit for commercial use. For service providers, the program provides a benchmark when evaluating multiple vendors to ensure they meet global performance standards and can assist in stopping bad actors from creating accounts using fake or stolen documentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“FIDO Alliance was pleased to collaborate with our FIDO Accredited laboratory partners on this important program, as accurately verifying a user’s identity during initial account creation is a critical step in the overall integrity of the account – and also strengthens the security of subsequent FIDO-based sign-ins,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewshikiar/">Andrew Shikiar</a>, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “The launch of FIDO’s Document Authenticity Certification Program gives service providers a FIDO Certified mark to ensure the mobile document verification solutions they choose have met globally-recognized standards and can assist them in providing greater security across the entire account lifecycle. We look forward to seeing the first FIDO DocAuth Certified products early next year.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Program Details&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DocAuth Certification Program provides certification performance criteria for vendors, and sets test procedures that FIDO Accredited Laboratories use for evaluating mobile document verification solution capabilities. A full list of FIDO Accredited Document Authenticity Laboratories can be found <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/docauth">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The program is open to vendors seeking certification for their mobile document verification solutions. Vendors who achieve certification receive a Document Authenticity Certificate, as well as granted use of the FIDO Certified mark, to demonstrate they have passed the well-defined testing administered by the FIDO Alliance and Accredited Laboratories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO Document Authenticity Certification is independent of other FIDO certification programs. There are no FIDO Certification prerequisites to apply for Document Authenticity Certification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO Alliance plans to expand its identity verification program in 2023 with the launch of a face verification certification, including performance criteria requirements that address liveness and selfie-match.</p>



<p>About the FIDO Alliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance, <a href="https://www.fidoalliance.org/">www.fidoalliance.org</a>, was formed in July 2012 to address the lack of interoperability among strong authentication technologies, and remedy the problems users face with creating and remembering multiple usernames and passwords. The FIDO Alliance is changing the nature of authentication with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">standards</a> for simpler, stronger authentication that define an open, scalable, interoperable set of mechanisms that reduce reliance on passwords. FIDO Authentication is stronger, private, and easier to use when authenticating to online services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’re raising awareness of the most frightening social engineering attacks and how we can banish these monsters to the past…</p>



<p>Megan Shamas, senior director of marketing, FIDO Alliance</p>



<p>Cybercriminals are like trick or treaters – knocking on doors and helping themselves to your freely-given credentials. Whether traditional phishing emails or more sophisticated deepfake-bolstered attacks, our digital lives and the proliferation of passwords are making us increasingly vulnerable to the cyber threat.</p>



<p>Awareness is a core part of FIDO Alliance’s mission to move the world away from passwords to simpler, stronger authentication. Standards and technology is just one half of solving cybersecurity challenges – we have a duty to educate and provide the best information and resources to help everyone make smart decisions in whatever online environment they’re in – whether you’re at work, studying, or in your personal life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why we love working with CISA and NCSAM and their efforts around Cybersecurity Awareness Month, as it gets to the ‘people’ part of cybersecurity. And undoubtedly, when we think of that ‘people’ part, phishing and social engineering attacks are top of the list.</p>



<p>To promote this year’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’ve taken inspiration from the impending spooky season to unmask the scariest techniques and technologies criminals are using to steal your sweet candy credentials – and, how to stop them.</p>



<p>The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>The online world can be a great space for finding friends, work, and romance. But wolves can be lurking behind friendly chats and interactions. These types of attacks are quite sophisticated, and usually take place over an extended period while the attacker wins the trust of their unsuspecting victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plenty of Fish can quickly become Plenty of Phish, catching consumers when they have their guard down and least expect anything. The recent Netflix documentary ‘Tinder Swindler’ is a great example of how convincing and persistent these fraudsters can be. When forming relationships online, remember that those on the other end of apps might not always be who they seem before sharing any sensitive information that could help them take over your online accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ghosts of Phishmas Past&nbsp;</p>


 
 


<p>An email from the bank wanting to confirm your details. A text from couriers asking you to reschedule your delivery. The cheery retailer message to say you’ve won $100 to spend if you register a new account.</p>



<p>You might think you’ve seen and heard it all before, but these older, tried and tested phishing techniques are haunting us and are still by far the most effective. Take the <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/royal-mail-delivery-text-scam-exposed-how-a-scammer-tried-to-take-4000-aZMlt5B41mXN">Royal Mail SMS scam</a> that blew up last Christmas time in the UK, or the recent global attack on <a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/catches-of-the-month-phishing-scams-for-september-2022">Facebook Business/ad users</a>. An estimated <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/three-in-five-people-have-received-a-scam-delivery-text-in-the-last-year-aA3fF1B3qT81">three in five were targeted by fake delivery text messages</a> in 2021. As both the volume and quality of attacks continue to rise, the simplest of phishing and smishing could catch any of us out.</p>



 



<p>The Shapeshifter</p>


 
 


<p>You’ve no doubt seen funny viral videos of deepfakes, like Tom Cruise singing, or heard of the fake videos created of Ukranian President Zelensky earlier this year. But deepfake technology isn’t just limited to comedy and political attacks – this technology is becoming both more readily available and more convincing, bringing to the fore even more effective attacks on everyday consumers. Back in June, the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/29/fbi_deepfake_job_applicant_warning/">FBI even issued a warning to employers about fake employees using the technology to apply for jobs under false pretences</a> to defraud organisations.</p>



<p>Deepfake video and audio is now being used to bolster more standard phishing attacks and convince victims they’re engaging with those closest to them to pressure them into giving away sensitive information and details.</p>



<p>The Terminator</p>



<p>This is one type of social engineering attack that should send shivers down your spine. Recent advances in AI and machine learning are enabling attackers to automate highly targeted attacks – known as spear-phishing – by data scraping and integrating convincing details like name, date of birth and employer details, into attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By revealing just enough legitimate information, consumers are lured into a false sense of security and even more likely to share credentials. Now automated at an alarming rate and level of sophistication, this is one attack that will keep coming back… that is, if we don’t find a strong enough defence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Boo, Passwords!</p>



<p>The only way we can truly protect ourselves from sharing our most precious credentials online is to not have credentials we can share in the first place. If passwords are like Halloween candy at our doors, moving to something we simply can’t share like FIDO cryptographic-based signs ins and on-device biometrics means even if you fall for the trick, fraudsters are going hungry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO authentication, created by global collaboration of the world’s biggest tech companies, numerous service providers and security stakeholders, is the only widely available phishing-resistant authentication method. Increasingly, governments like the US and the UK are citing FIDO as the ‘gold standard’ for organisations to implement and access robust cybersecurity. FIDO technology is readily available for companies big and small to implement and, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust/">as Cloudflare’s recent thwarted cyberattacks shows</a>, it’s effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FIDO technology is about to become more readily available and ubiquitous among consumers too. Earlier this year, the world’s biggest platforms – <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">Apple, Google and Microsoft – committed to supporting our new security key standards, FIDO multi-device credentials, also known as ‘passkeys’</a>. This means, across our most favoured browsers and devices, we’ll soon be able to access FIDO-based passwordless sign-in technology with the same gestures we use every day on mobile devices, using biometrics or PIN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’re urging service providers to get phishing-resistant passwordless authentication on their roadmap so consumers can make the move to passwordless – or at the very least, using passwords less – so we can leave these social engineering monsters toothless.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Earlier this year we started a new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/">project to examine and strengthen our digital resilience</a>, in an effort to further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices and deepen our capacity to support our partners.</p>



<p>We use the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that enable an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its people, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to ever-changing needs and contexts.</p>



<p>As part of this project, we have been <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">reflecting on our own practices</a> in order to better understand our digital resilience needs and also mapping digital resilience issues that social justice organisations we work with are facing, as well as strategies to approach them.</p>



<p>For this mapping process, we are gathering data from our support programmes and research projects to identify common challenges our partners are grappling with, ranging from organisational security and technical concerns, to tool selection and values alignment, and accessibility issues. In this blog post, we share an overview of the main challenges we’ve mapped so far. Given the complex and intricate nature of digital resilience, many of the themes intersect with one another.</p>



 Tool selection: a balancing act 



<p>Tool selection, one of the most pressing challenges cited by organisations, involves two key aspects: 1) a practical aspect, related to selecting tools that meet organisational needs and technical capacities and 2) a principle aspect, related to ensuring the tools align with organisational values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other words, selecting the right tool is about simultaneously addressing technical needs and aligning with mission and advocacy goals. But addressing both can be difficult. Social justice organisations we work with mentioned limited knowledge about existing tools and an absence of internal expertise to support tool selection as some of the obstacles they face while trying to make tech decisions they feel confident about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Tech choices in low-tech environments 



<p>Tool selection can also be difficult when working in a low-tech or limited-connectivity context. For many social justice organisations — especially those in the Majority World — navigating between selecting tools according to values and facing context-specific limitations can be a delicate and demanding balancing act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organisations frequently ask us questions about managing data responsibly when working within a low-tech environment, or when there are limitations on tools due to organisational capacity. For example, some organisations that had chosen to work with open-source, privacy-respecting tools for video conferencing due to organisational security concerns ended up having to move back to proprietary platforms after facing severe connectivity issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their efforts to improve digital resilience, some of our partners frequently found themselves confronting hard decisions between ease of use and familiarity versus security and privacy concerns. Partners noted that, in choosing to continue to communicate sensitive information across social media platforms, they needed to prioritise convenience and accessibility. While many are interested in finding more secure ways to communicate, they fear that switching from popular platforms could decrease their impact and ability to communicate with audiences/partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making justice-focused tech decisions isn’t always a straightforward process, and it can take a lot of trial and error (like our colleague Steffania explained in this <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/working-on-our-digital-resilience-video-conferencing-tools/">post about our new video conferencing tools</a>!) and many organisations described feeling frustrated and confused on how to move forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like support identifying tools that fit your needs, <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a call with our team!</a> You can also take a look at <a href="https://alidade.tech/">Alidade</a>, an interactive tool that explains what to look for when using technology for social change.</p>



 Pathways to digital resilience: access to information&nbsp; 



<p>Being able to access knowledge about tech and data, including information about digital security, tool selection and responsible data is another important aspect of digital resilience we identified during this first phase of the project. Factors with a negative impact on digital resilience decision-making include:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/takeaways-from-our-community-call-on-intersections-between-data-digital-rights-and-social-justice/">Barriers to information about tech and data</a>.  Lack of language diversity of existing resources for digital resilience.&nbsp;  Insufficient level of context-relevance of existing resources.&nbsp;  



<p>Even when organisations know where to find information to help them navigate conversations about digital resilience, most resources are published in English and aren’t necessarily focused on the realities of social justice organisations in resource-constrained environments.</p>



 Digital rights threats and their impact on civil society organisations&nbsp; 



<p>We also heard repeated concerns regarding government surveillance and internet shutdowns. These are key areas within the digital resilience conversation and they fundamentally influence the way organisations go about their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Internet shutdowns are <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/internet-shutdowns-and-elections-handbook/">“intentional disruptions of internet or electronic communications</a>, rendering them inaccessible or effectively unusable, for a specific population or within a location, often to exert control over the flow of information.” The <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ending-internet-shutdowns-path-forward-report-special-rapporteur-rights-freedom">number of governments imposing internet shutdowns is growing and t</a>he practice is not limited to authoritarian regimes: it has been observed in <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/07/1095142">long-established democracies and more recent democracies</a> alike. At the same time, digital security is being increasingly criminalised and politicised by repressive states, with <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2022/04/2021-KeepItOn-Report-1.pdf">some countries also targeting internet shutdown circumvention tools</a>, such as browsers and tools based on Tor technology, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and proxies that use encryption.<br><br>Government surveillance is one <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/petition/targeted-surveillance-human-rights-defenders/">major cause for concern for human rights defenders</a> and civil society organisations, as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/freedom-of-expression/">many states have been using technologies</a> to surveil: to read activists and journalists’ private emails and remotely turn on their computers’ camera or microphone to secretly record their activities. <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2021/06/Helpline-10000-cases-report.pdf">Governments around the world are investing in their capacity to silence dissent</a>, through tools for both mass and targeted surveillance.&nbsp;Journalists, workers for non-governmental organisations defending human rights, and <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/for-rights-defenders-cyber-is-the-new-battleground/">women’s rights organisations are particularly at risk of government surveillance</a>. In many countries, <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/disparate-impact-surveillance/?agreed=1">communities of colour are subject to disproportionate levels of surveillance.</a></p>



<p>These digital rights threats need to be taken into account when designing security support interventions, and when thinking about digital resilience of civil society organisations more broadly. Despite the level of concern, we heard that organisations found it difficult to plan for threats or predict impacts. Addressing concerns about government surveillance, for instance, could look very different from one organisation to the next, depending on what they do and where they’re based.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our team offers pro-bono support to social justice organisations interested in improving their digital resilience: <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">schedule a call with us to learn more!</a> And if you/your organisation are facing a digital security emergency, <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/help/">Access Now’s Digital Security Helpline</a> offers real-time, direct technical assistance and advice to civil society groups &amp; activists, media organisations, journalists &amp; bloggers, and human rights defenders.</p>



 Access to resources: digital resilience doesn’t just happen! 



<p>Many social justice organisations we work with face challenges related to digital security and tech infrastructure, and some are unable to fully address these <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/social-justice-digital-rights-during-covid-19-barriers-to-collaboration/">without access to dedicated funding, resources and relevant networks</a>. Through our work with social justice organisations, we’ve seen how difficult it can be for them to focus on digital resilience, since most are overworked and tending to pressing needs from the communities they serve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even when there are financial resources available, seeking out support (and information!) about&nbsp; digital security and tech infrastructure — from knowing how to find trusted support and networks in the first place, to being able to stay up to date with a shifting landscape for digital threats, to figuring out what tech is right for the organisation – is a process that can consume a significant amount of time, energy and resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">How to think about tech when you don’t have time to think about tech:</a> We know that rethinking an organisation’s use of tech and data does take quite a bit of time (and resources!). So we wrote a short blog post with ideas for low(ish) hanging fruits that organisations can start tackling to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">slowly improve their tech and data landscape</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/inclusive-and-ethical-uses-of-digital-identity/">Inclusive and Ethical Use of Digital Identity Working Group (IEUDI)</a> have written a research and discussion paper report looking into inclusivity and ethics in digital identity.</p>



<p>Purpose of this paper</p>



<p>The purpose of this paper is to research existing mahi in the areas of inclusivity and ethics in digital identity. Once we have this understanding, we can identify any gaps and consider how we might address them, consider developing a Code of Practice and make overall recommendations to the Executive Council for DINZ.</p>



<p>Paper Overview</p>



<p>The paper has looked at work happening in Aotearoa and Overseas.</p>



<p>The specific scope of this work is:</p>



  Help ensure inclusive, ethical and responsible use of digital identity technologies that enable equitable digital identity outcomes for all New Zealanders.  Build an understanding of the views and roles of relevant advocacy groups (for example but not limited to Citizens Advice Bureau, NZ Council for Civil Liberties etc) in the adoption of digital identity technologies – inclusive of and accessible&nbsp;to all – with optional alternatives, especially for public services.  Provide constructive forums for discourse with groups that are either clearly disadvantaged in relation to digital identity or have concerns about the potential future uses of digital identity.

<p>Game company 2K on Thursday warned users to remain on the lookout for suspicious activity across their accounts following a breach last month that allowed a threat actor to obtain email addresses, names, and other sensitive information provided to 2K’s support team.</p>



<p>The breach occurred on September 19, when the threat actor illegally obtained system credentials belonging to a vendor 2K uses to run its help desk platform. 2K&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/2KSupport/status/1572320721333796865">warned users</a>&nbsp;a day later that the threat actor used unauthorized access to send some users emails that contained malicious links. The company warned users not to open any emails sent by its online support address or click on any links in them. If users already clicked on links, 2K urged them to change all passwords stored in their browsers.</p>

<p>A useful way to think about the<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/"> DID standard</a> is as a mechanism to bootstrap trust in an identifier. Implementers can define DID Methods that define how to resolve a DID Document from a DID URL. The most widely used DID method today is the Key DID. </p><p>This method is extremely simple and doesn’t have some of the more advanced features, such as key rotation, that the DID standard enables. However, there are still big challenges with using DIDs. Privacy being a big one. A<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods"> wide range of different DID methods</a> that are not compatible is another. This article explores how to build a DID method that is both<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/upgradeable-decentralized-identity/"> composable</a> (i.e. it builds on existing DID methods) while also adding privacy.</p> 3ID and Its Limitations <p>While Ceramic supports multiple different DID methods, 3ID is the main DID method that leverages the network directly. 3ID has gone through two iterations so far. Let’s take a brief look at them, their limitations, and consider potential future iterations.</p> The Static 3IDv0 <p>The first iteration of 3ID kept things super simple and worked similarly to a Key DID in that it was immutable. However, it added some flexibility by allowing the use of a variety of different key types in one DID document. For example, a secp256k1 key for signature verification and a x25519 key for receiving encrypted messages. These keys were simply stored in an IPLD object, the CID of which is used as the DID<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#a-simple-example"> identifier</a>. To resolve a 3IDv0 one simply needs to resolve the IPLD object from its CID, e.g. using IPFS.</p><p>The main limitation of 3IDv0 was that it was not possible to do any sort of key rotation. Once the DID is created the public keys provided up front are the keys for this DID forever.</p> More Flexibility With 3IDv1 <p>The first version of 3ID was designed to enable key rotation and multi-account identity. By using the built-in conflict resolution of Ceramic’s streams, updating the DID document of a 3ID became straight forward. In this case, a<a href="https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/stream-programs/tile-document/"> Tile stream type</a> represented the 3ID by storing the public keys in the JSON content of the Tile document. The StreamID of the Tile is then used as the DID identifier. By combining this updatable 3ID with another Ceramic stream type, caip10-links, multiple wallet accounts from different blockchains could be linked to a single 3ID.</p><p>While 3IDv1 is more flexible than its predecessor, there are still some significant limitations, primarily around privacy. All verification methods (e.g. public keys) in the DID document are public. There is no way to add a verification method that is unknown to the public observer. Furthermore, the caip10-links necessitated doxxing of the wallet account, creating a permanent link between the account and the 3ID, that even if removed would leave a trace in the caip10-link event log. Finally, UX for actually using a 3IDv1 was not optimal because the keys referenced in the DID Document were long lived. This led to weak security in a browser context and the reliance on an iframe for key management.</p> Desired Properties of 3IDv2 <p>One of the most difficult things to achieve in a publicly verifiable, permissionless system is privacy. This is true for blockchains, and it’s also true for data networks like Ceramic. In blockchains, zero-knowledge proofs are being utilized to provide various sorts of privacy enhancements. Could the 3ID DID method utilize zkp and other techniques to achieve greater privacy as well? First, let’s start by defining what functionality would be desired in a privacy-focused 3ID:</p>  Ability to add and remove verification methods without publicly disclosing their public keys  Selective disclosure of verification methods  Ability to generate a signature issued by the 3ID without revealing which verification method was invoked  Ability to privately graft (i.e. upgrade) existing DIDs to a 3ID (e.g. a caip10-link but private)  Selective disclosure of grafted DIDs   Primitives for Composable Identity <p>Let’s have a look at what primitives we have available to us, or can construct, in order to achieve the properties described above.</p> Generative DID Methods <p>A generative DID method can be defined as a DID where the DID Document can be statically generated from the DID URL. This means that there is no need to look up state from a blockchain or do any other sort of network requests. It also means that it’s not possible to update or remove the DID Document since it is deterministically generated from the DID URL. There are two prominent examples of generative DID methods:</p><p><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a> - every DID URL is a public key with an associated multicode to uniquely identify the key type. In order to generate the DID Document, the public key is simply translated into the appropriate verification method.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">DID PKH</a> - short for public key hash, this method essentially makes all blockchain accounts into DIDs. This is achieved by relying on the CAIP-10 account ID standard to identify a specific account on a specific blockchain. The DID URL gets translated to the DID Document using the special blockchain account verification method, which also relies on CAIP-10.</p><p>The stream type caip10-link in Ceramic was created before DID PKH existed in order to have a simple stream type controlled by a blockchain account. This functionality can now easily be replaced by any stream type, such as Tile Document or Model Instance Document by using DID PKH.</p> Object-Capabilities <p>Signing every data transaction with your DID PKH (e.g. your crypto wallet) makes for less than ideal UX. In order to address this problem, object-capabilities (OCAP) and session keys can be used. The<a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/capability-based-data-security-on-ceramic/"> article on CACAO</a> explains how this works in detail, but for context let’s have a look at how OCAPs can be used.</p>  A session key (DID Key) is randomly generated  An authorization message (e.g.<a href="https://docs.login.xyz/general-information/siwe-overview/eip-4361"> SIWE</a>) is generated which contains the DID Key URL and an array of resources being authorized  A signature request over this message is sent to the wallet (DID PKH)  The message + signature can now be used as an OCAP, that together with the session key, can be used to invoke actions on the authorized resources  <p>Important to note that these OCAPs can also be chained, e.g. Key A → Key B → Key C, where → implies a delegation.</p> Revocation Registry <p>Delegation using capabilities is powerful, but we don’t necessarily want delegations to be valid forever. A possible mitigation is to add an expiry time to the capability as it is issued. Time based revocation is simple but still quite limited and in the case of a compromised key, damage can still be caused before the capability expires. We need a way to check if a particular capability has been revoked by the issuer. Ideally without leaking information about which capabilities have existed over time—here a revocation registry can be useful. The capability itself can include a caveat that states that it is only valid if and only if the capability has not been added to the revocation registry.</p><p>On Ceramic the revocation registry could be implemented as follows:</p>  An event stream is created where revocation events can be published  The revocation event is a multihash of the CID of the capability (an extra hash is added for privacy)  Once a revocation event has been anchored it is considered valid and is enforceable starting from the anchor timestamp  When a capability is issued it contains a caveat that references the revocation registry using its StreamID  When the capability is verified, the revocation registry must be loaded from the Ceramic network; if the capability was revoked before it was invoked it is considered invalid  <p>The lookup time of this revocation registry would be O(n). However, a Ceramic node could build a merkle tree where OCAP hashes are keys and revocation times are values to reduce lookup time to O(log n). In theory this could also make the revocations verifiable on-chain.</p> Private Capability Invocation <p>When a capability is invoked to perform some action it will generally be publicly disclosed. Up until the point of invocation it can be kept in secret, but if we want our system to remain publicly verifiable an observer must be able to validate the full delegation chain—from the owner of the resource to the key that performed the invocation. A keen reader might, however, realize that we don’t actually need to disclose the delegation chain if we use a ZKP to hide certain information.</p><p>publicInputs = (rootDID, sessionKey, ocapHashes, resources, actions)</p><p>privateInputs = (ocapChain)</p><p>The ZKP from above can be verified to ensure that the session key is indeed authorized to take certain actions on the given resources. The revocation registry can be referenced to make sure none of the capabilities are revoked since the ocapHashes are part of the public input.</p><p>Note that by including the ocapHashes in the public input some metadata is leaked. An observer will be able to see which capabilities have been frequently used, but they won’t learn anything about the content of the capability. A possible improvement could be to include the entire revocation registry stream in the public input. An outside observer could simply compare the included registry with a registry loaded locally. As long as the action performed by the invoker was anchored before any change to the registry was anchored the entire capability chain could still be considered valid. This means of course that the ZKP would need to be regenerated every time the revocation registry is updated.</p> 3IDv2: Composable Identity <p>Combining the primitives above, we can create a composable DID method where verification methods can be added privately using capabilities and revoked using the revocation registry. Similarly to 3IDv0 the first verification method would be added to the initial (public) state of the DID document. After this point, adding a verification method is actually done by using a capability that gives the delegate DID full control to take any action on behalf of the 3ID.</p><p>A cool feature is that the revocation registry includes timestamp information (from Ceramic anchors) so that we can see when revocations happen. This makes it easy to validate signatures done in the past, since we can see that the signature was done by the verification method before it was revoked. However, in the case of a delegation chain this might not be enough. Imagine we have Key A delegating to Key B at time T0; then at time T1, Key A gets revoked. From the perspective of the 3ID, Key B should still be valid since it was added by a verification method that was valid at the time. In order to solve this dilemma we can simply add a timestamp for when Key B was added in the revocation registry. This would allow us to keep using Key B even if Key A is revoked.</p> Grafting DIDs <p>There is a need to publicly or privately link existing DIDs, such as PKH DIDs, to a 3ID. This can now be done rather simply in Ceramic by creating a deterministic stream that is controlled by the DID in question and include an attestation that this DID is grafted to a particular 3ID. The attestation could be public or encrypted. If it is encrypted it could be selectively disclosed to any third party. For example, to check if an ethereum address (PKH DID) has been grafted to a 3ID, one would simply load the Ceramic stream and check the content of the resolved document. For a private link, a decryption key for the encrypted link would also be required to read to which DID the link points to.</p> Implementation <p>An implementation of 3IDv2 might seem daunting at first. It’s worth noting that it can be done in stages, since each primitive builds upon the previous ones. A prototype could easily be built with only support for capabilities for adding new verification methods. The revocation registry could be built after adding the ability to actually do proper key management and would result in a usable version of the system. Finally, private capability invocation could be added on top, providing a layer of privacy when actually using the identity.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we started a new <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/new-project-strengthening-our-digital-resilience/">project to examine and strengthen our digital resilience</a>. Through this work we hope to further integrate social justice principles into our tech choices and practices and deepen our capacity to support our partners&nbsp;</p>



<p>After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, the first set of changes we made focused on our video conferencing infrastructure. In this blog post, we’re sharing some reflections about the new tools our team is testing out and how our experience has been so far.</p>



<p>We are using the term “digital resilience” to refer to a set of practices that support the ability of an organisation to protect itself from — and respond to — digital security threats, to ensure the wellbeing of its members/individuals, and to adopt infrastructures that respond to the ever-changing needs and contexts of the organisation and its members. </p>



 Deciding which video conferencing tools fit our needs and values 



<p>At The Engine Room, we aim for a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/technology-in-the-service-of-justice/">justice-based approach to our technical choices</a>. This means we prioritise choosing technology solutions that intentionally weave anti-oppression strategies into all stages of their creation, maintenance and uptake. As a remote organisation, video conferencing is integral to our day-to-day operations. After conducting a deeper needs assessment within the team, it became clear that adopting tools that are privacy-respecting and strengthen our organisational security was a priority for us. For this reason, we decided to set up our own instances of <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/">BigBlueButton</a> (BBB) and <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">Jitsi Meet</a>. Both tools are encrypted, open source, and incorporate privacy by design.&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 BigBlueButton (BBB) 



<p>BigBlueButton is an open source online learning and video conferencing platform.All traffic from the users’ web browsers to the server goes over standard security protocols when audio, video or screens are being shared.</p>



<p>BBB is<a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/#designed-for-online-learning"> designed specifically for educational applications</a>, with features like whiteboards, break-out rooms, and polling. It also <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/integrations/">integrates</a> with various learning management systems (e.g. Canvas, Moodle). Everything happens in users’ web browsers, so there’s no need for any additional software.BigBlueButton users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser. Access to <a href="https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/greenlight/gl-overview.html#manage-access">meetings can be limited through a code</a> and joining the room can be dependent on moderator approval.</p>



<p>To use <a href="https://bigbluebutton.org/teachers/features/">all the functionalities of the tool</a> it is necessary to have a server to install it on. BBB’s website offers the possibility of <a href="https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/gl/signup">creating an account to access a “demo” version of the tool.</a> Using this version you can make calls of up to 60 minutes.</p>
 



 
 Jitsi Meet 



<p>Jitsi Meet (also referred to as meet.jit.si) is a free and open source video conference service maintained by parent company <a href="https://www.8x8.com/">8×8</a>. By default, Jitsi Meet provides transport-layer encryption between the browser and the Jitsi Meet server of your choice; an end-to-end encryption feature is also available.</p>



<p>Jitsi Meet users don’t need to create an account to join a call: all they need is the meeting link, which can be opened with a browser or through Jitsi’s mobile app.</p>



<p>Meetings can also be password-protected.</p>



<p>Jitsi Meet offers the option of self-hosting and there is a <a href="https://meet.jit.si/">public version</a> of the tool for free use.</p>
 
 



<p>Some of the factors that we took into account while selecting video conferencing tools are included in the list below (which takes inspiration from many resources, such as this “<a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resource-publication/guide-secure-group-chat-and-conferencing-tools">Guide to Secure Group Chat and Conferencing Tools</a>”):&nbsp;</p>



  Maturity and maintenance: We took into account how mature the platforms are, including the amount of time they’ve been running for and whether or not they are still being actively developed. We also considered the existence of active communities of developers and users for both tools.  Privacy: A variety of factors went into consideration: whether or not user data is shared or sold to third parties, if the tools provide encryption (and what type of encryption: end-to-end or to-server), if it’s possible to self-host, what data is stored on platforms’ servers and what data platforms’ owners have access to, if users need to install a dedicated app or software and what data this app or software would have access to.  Reputation: We prioritised tools that are used and respected by social justice organisations and peers we work with, as well as recommended by security experts.&nbsp;  Ownership: We considered whether tools were open source and if the companies provided the source code openly, as well as the history of development and ownership of the platform and potential security challenges (including how owners and developers reacted to those challenges).  Features and affordances: We mapped the platforms according to how well their features would respond to our needs: easiness to connect to these platforms, usage of tools for internal and external calls and more.&nbsp;  Associated costs: We also considered the costs related to each of the tools, including potential subscription fees, learning and implementing, possible IT support needed and hosting costs  



 A brief overview of our experience so far 



  
<p>Hosting and infrastructure details<br>– For BigBlueButton, we hired <a href="https://maadix.net/">Maadix</a>‘s hosting service, who are maintaining both the tool and the servers where it’s hosted. We use a <a href="https://maadix.net/en/big-blue-button-privacy-security-optimizations">version customised by Maadix with performance and privacy improvements.</a><br>– For Jitsi Meet, we are using the <a href="https://open.greenhost.net/greenhost/cloud-init/-/tree/main/jitsimeet">pre-installed stable version</a> that <a href="https://greenhost.net/">Greenhost</a> – with whom we have been already working – offers to their clients.</p>
  



<p>After implementation, we asked our team to use BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet as much as possible. After two months of piloting the tools, we conducted an internal survey and received mostly positive feedback—overall the team appreciated using tools that are aligned with our organisational values. We also identified areas for improvement, which we will work on over the next few months, including user friendliness and video instability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to note that while we try to default to using our own internal platforms, there are occasions where we have a need for features that these platforms do not yet have. For example, we often use webinar registration pages and waiting rooms to ensure that our community calls are safe for participants; however, BigBlueButton and Jitsi Meet do not currently possess these features. Additionally, although both platforms aim to be low resource, they often struggle in low bandwidth situations. Lastly, there’s the learning curve of the team for adapting new tools. We often crave for the familiar when it’s not immediately clear how to perform a certain task. We recognize that adapting to the workflow of these tools will take time as is the case with most technological changes.</p>



<p>Here is a summary of some of the benefits and challenges of installing and maintaining these tools on our own servers.&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 Advantages 



  Authonomy: More control over the tools we use, since we are responsible for the installation and can check all code that runs in the application.  Values: Tools that are aligned with our values and principles.  Transparency: Transparency of the open software code—we can inspect every line of code used to build the tools.  Security:&nbsp; With open source tools, more people are inspecting the code, which enables more issues to be found – and fixed. Vulnerabilities are fixed much faster and updates are more frequent.&nbsp;  Cost: Open-source software is very often free or cheaper than proprietary software. Therefore, we save on licensing and maintenance fees.&nbsp;  Open source ecosystem: We are contributing to a community of developers committed to making the internet a fairer place.  Customisation and Flexibility: Using services customised for our use and having exclusive domains.  
 



 
 Challenges 



  Resources: Self-hosted tools require more maintenance time and investment in servers.  Tech expertise: Self-hosted tools require knowledge and availability (internal or external) to troubleshoot issues the team or our partners experience.  Documentation: Using tools that are less widespread or familiar demands an effort to produce technical and user-facing documentation. For example, we developed internal user guides for both platforms containing FAQs, and we also created an external guide that explains our decisions behind specific platform use in community calls.  Adapting to new tools: Functionality is not always the same between tools and even when it is, the user experience may differ. Adopting new tools can take time (as we wrote in <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/adopting-new-tech-how-to-give-your-team-the-best-chances-of-success/">this blog post</a>) and can impact the day-to-day work of the organisation.  Stability and availability: Ensuring that self-hosted tools are stable and have high availability (or the ability of a system to operate continuously without failing) is a challenge. Constant monitoring,&nbsp; maintenance, and server redundancy (storing information in more than one server) are steps required to make sure information can be restored in case of problems.  
 
 



<p>This overview represents a snapshot of where we currently are in our journey with these tools: these observations will likely evolve and change over time, as we work on this project and mature our own digital resilience practices.</p>



 Next steps 



<p>During this process, we were reminded of how adopting free and open-source software tools (and self-hosting them!) is a process that takes quite some time and planning, but that ultimately contributes greatly to our digital resilience. Over the next months, we will continue to work on our video conferencing tools, including improving on the tools’ overall performance and stability, refining user documentation and addressing connectivity issues.</p>



<p>If your organisation is interested in going through a similar process, we’d be happy to support you (even if your end result is different!). <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">Schedule a call with us</a>!</p>

<p>Background:</p>



<p>From the beginning we have asked that you consider electing a diverse group of members who reflect the diversity of the community we seek to support. We ask that you do so again this year.  The power of that diversity continues to shine through in the new working groups this year, especially as we consider the importance of Te Tiriti, equity and inclusion in a well-functioning digital identity ecosystem.</p>



<p>The Council has identified a number of areas where diversity, as well as expertise in the digital identity space, might help us better serve the community. Nominations from those organisations involved in kaupapa Māori, civil liberties and business and service sectors are especially encouraged. We also encourage suggestions from young people within your organisations, as the viewpoint of young people is extremely essential and relevant to the work we perform. As an NZTech Association, Digital Identity NZ adopts its Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy which you can read <a href="https://nztech.org.nz/about/board-diversity-inclusion-policy/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Once elected in December, one of the first responsibilities of the new Council will be to elect a new chair for the EC Council or consider re-electing the current chair. The current chair is Paul Platen (SSS – Security Specialists), supported by deputy chair (and past-chair) Ben Tairea (Āhau). Both are excellent kaiārahi (guides/counsellors/leaders) currently and serving their terms on the Executive Council through to the end of 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2023 is set to be another pivotal year for digital identity with the delayed introduction of the Digital Identity Bill and further development of the ecosystem. We look forward to stellar nominations to identify, explore and pursue the best opportunities for Digital Identity NZ to make a positive difference for people in 2023 and beyond.</p>

 Firm Foundations 

<p>Much of our work in Q3 has been forward-thinking, focused on creating the next generation of specifications for blockchain interoperability.</p>

<p>Hello to the Identity Community. Being able to create the next generation of specifications depends on having a wide-spanning community, and we’ve been thrilled to see the Blockchain Commons community continue to grow. That includes not just cryptocurrency nowadays, but also digital identity thanks to sustaining sponsor Proxy. We also reached out to more digital-identity companies at this year’s Rebooting the Web of Trust event, and hope to see that pay out in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tQ9SPek0mnI"></a></p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our specification work is intended to build firm foundations. Our newest foundational work of this sort has been on Gordian Envelope, a new sort of “Smart Container” that can be used to hold secrets and metadata of an arbitrary size and that can be opened by a variety of “permits”, including SSKR shares and public-key cryptography keypairs. Extensive <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/tree/master/Docs">docs</a> are now available as part of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents">BCSwiftSecureCompanents package</a>. Also see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ9SPek0mnI">Gordian Envelope videos</a> on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQ9LtDWZAkfItMF4B5tztw">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>MVA Algorithm Suite. The appendix of the Gordian Envelope docs contains our first <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/09-A-ALGORITHMS.md">MVA ALgorithm Suite</a>. This refers to the algorithmic suite we’ve decided to use in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0deyIHXukk&amp;t=7s">Minimal Viable Architecture</a>: effectively a future-proofed Minimal Viable Product. It overviews current cryptographic algorithms and discusses our decisions about which to use. Gordian Envelope uses BLAKE3, IETF ChaChaPoly, the secp256k1 curve, and more. Our Appendix talks about why we think they’re the best practices for this project.</p>

<p>Collaborative Seed Recovery. This new foundational work is largely in service to Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR): we intend it to add independence, resilience, and openness to seed storage by allowing digital-asset holders to shard their seed and then store it with a variety of different steward services, making recovery painless and resilient. We are currently working with a companies such as Bitmark, Foundation, and Proxy in regular biweekly meetings to make CSR a reality this fall. For more, please see our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR Overview</a>. Our Gordian Envelope videos also lay out the whole foundation, so take a look at the combined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aciTNh402Co&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">CSR playlist</a>.</p>

<p>CSR Use Cases. Why is CSR needed? We’ve written several sequences of <a href="https://hackmd.io/ZbRiwvUfQSy-1RKM15bM8Q#CSR-Focused-Use-Cases">progressive use cases</a> in a preliminary document that discusses options both for CSR and its 2023 successor, Collaborative Key Management (CKM). It covers everything from simple protection of keys to future possibilities where no one actually holds a complete seed, despite its keys being in active use.</p>

 Community Events 

<p>Preventing vendor lock-in via interoperability has been a Blockchain Commons goal from the beginning, but that requires bringing together multiple parties to buy into interoperable specifications. The growth of Blockchain Commons’ community of developers, sponsors, and other interested parties in 2022 has truly made that possible, with those parties coming together in community events such as the biweekly CSR meetings and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/"></a></p>

<p>Silicon Salon 2. Our other ongoing get-together this year has been the <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon</a>, where we’ve facilitated wallet makers and semiconductor makers talking about the creation of the next generation of silicon design that is specialized for cryptography. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/">second Silicon Salon</a> was held on September 14th. Presenters included Bunnie Studios, Cramium Labs, Proxy Labs, Foundation, and the VLS team.</p>

<p>RWOT11. Blockchain Commons got its start with <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, where Christopher Allen first brought community members together to support the future of decentralized and self-sovereign technologies. Unfortunately, Rebooting the Web of Trust went on hiatus shortly after the foundation of Blockchain Commons, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it was back <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague">this September</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons submitted two papers for RWOT11, to bring some of our topics into the conversation in the Netherlands: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/collaborative-seed-recovery-csr.md">an introduction to CSR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/elision-redaction-correlation-smart-documents.md">Elision, Redaction, and Non-Correlation in Smart Documents</a>. The elision topic paper led to a discussion of <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/selective-correlation.md">Selection Disclosure</a> that we’re looking forward to finishing in the coming months. We also participated in an article on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/identity-threats.md">Identity Threats</a>, which returns to some of our early identity work in the field!</p>

<p>Congrats to DIDs. We can’t talk about RWOT without congratulating everyone who worked on turning <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">DIDs into a standard</a>. This has been a long-running goal for both RWOT and Blockchain Commons, so we were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> become a W3C Recommendation this July.</p>

 New &amp; Updated Projects 

<p>We have also continued work on some of our smaller projects:</p>

<p>Beancount. Beancount is a <a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount">simple program</a> that allows double-entry accounting from text files. Because of its textual foundation, it’s very convenient to use in conjunction with command-line Bitcoin tools. As it happens, this type of tool is also crucial to Bitcoin because of regulatory decisions in the US treating Bitcoin as property, not currency, meaning that capital gains need to be calculated for every transaction(!). This requires careful accounting of your Bitcoin, and to support that, we’ve updated our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">SpotBit server</a> to also include a script called <code>beancounter.py</code> that will take a descriptor, look up historical prices via SpotBit, and thus provide all of the data an accountant will need to properly report Bitcoin purchases, sales, and usages. We’ve iterated the software a few times during the quarter, and think we might have a final version; watch for some documentation on the process in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>SpotBit. We’ve actually had a few recent updates to SpotBit, primarily to improve the look, feel, and design of its <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">webpages</a>. Thanks to 2022 interns who supported in this upgrade.</p>

 Advocacy 

<p>The work that Blockchain Commons does on specifications, leading to libraries and reference apps, is bottom-up: we work with developers to incorporate specifications that meet our vision of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. However, we also do top-down work, where we advocate for this vision to lawmakers, agencies, and other organizations.</p>

<p>Law &amp; Advocacy Repo. To better highlight this work, which was also well-supported by our 2022 interns, we’ve added a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/law-and-advocacy">Law &amp; Advocacy repo</a> to GitHub, to report out much of our work. It includes a list of <a href="https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg">Terminology &amp; Definitions</a> produced by this year’s interns, and links to other work.</p>

<p>Private Key Disclosure. That work includes our new article advocating for <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/">protection for private keys in courts</a>, which was published by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/saving-bitcoin-private-keys-from-courts">Bitcoin Magazine</a>. In recent years, courts have begun to request private keys as part of pre-trial discovery motions. It’s dangerous and unnecessary and it needs to end, as is now being considered in Wyoming, where Christopher Allen continues to give regular testimony. Fortunately, the proposed law in Wyoming to protect private keys from disclosure has recently passed a select committee and moved on to others. It still has a ways to go though!</p>

 Web Site Updates 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ third birthday passed without mention this Spring. But, that span of time since our foundation is probably why we’ve been doing a bit of work cleaning up our web presence, to make sure it accurately reflects where we are today!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com"></a></p>

<p>About Page. Didn’t even know that Blockchain Commons had a birthday? It’s referenced on our brand-new <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/about.html">About Page</a> which also highlights our three principals: Founder &amp; Executive Director Christopher Allen; Lead Researcher Wolf McNally; and Lead Tech Writer Shannon Appelcline.</p>

<p>Vision Page. We’ve long known the goal of Blockchain Commons: to make it possible for people to control their own assets and information on the internet, using the decentralized power of blockchain technology. We slightly revised how we write about that vision this quarter. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">newest statement</a> combines two previous statements to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Blockchain Commons advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Projects Page. You may also want to take a look at our updated <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/projects.html">Projects Page</a>. We’ve done a lot of different work over the last three and a half years. Our updated projects page now highlights what we consider most important to our vision, beginning with the Gordian System.</p>

<p>Airgapped Community. Though we continue to believe strongly in partitioning services to encourage the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, that’s today much bigger than the airgaps that we were considering several years ago. As a result, we’ve transformed the Airgapped Wallet Community into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community">Gordian Developer Community</a>. We choose the name “Gordian Developer Community” for this update because the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">Gordian System</a> today incorporates all of our developer-focused work, from Principles and Architecture to Specifications and Libraries, plus the Apps that demonstrate them. We look forward to talking with airgapped-wallet developers and those working on other partitioning techniques alike!</p>

 Doc Updates 

<p>As part of our web updating, we’ve also done some work on our docs.</p>

<p>Revised Gordian Page. How does the whole Gordian system fit together, from our air-gap and tor-gap overview to specifications such as Gordian Envelope? Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#readme">updated Gordian page</a> walks through the whole system from top to bottom, including new pages on topics such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md">Gordian Architecture</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Roles.md">Gordian Architecture Roles</a></p>

<p>New Test Vectors. We’ve also produced some new test vectors, to help people who are implementing our specifications. These include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-test-vector.md#256-bit-seed">SSKR test vectors based on 256-bit seeds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-seed-test-vectors.md">crypto-seed test vectors for both 128-bit and 256-bit seeds</a>.</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>Thank you as always for your support for Blockchain Commons. In 2022, we have truly become the commons that we imagined. Moving forward, we will continue to build firm foundations with our big focus on the architectural and reference work needed to release CSR by the end of the year.</p>

<p>If you’re not already a sponsor of our work, you can become one through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub</a>. Now that we’re back from RWOT11 in the Netherlands, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance our work!</p>

<p>In this FAQ, we’re answering questions such as:</p>



 
 How can organisations start using more tech/data in their work? 



 How can organisations decide which tools to use? 



 What can be done to make sure staff is safe when using tech and data? 



 And many more!

<p>Apesar de não entrarmos em muitos detalhes em cada resposta, ao longo do texto tentamos compartilhar orientações de qual direção você pode tomar em seguida. Confira nosso programa <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">Light-Touch Support</a> se tiver mais perguntas.</p>



<p>Este trabalho foi possibilitado pelo <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/supporting-organisations-to-navigate-digital-transitions/" title="">apoio do Sigrid Rausing Trust</a>.</p>



  
<p>Antes de iniciarmos, o que queremos dizer com dados? E tecnologia? Provavelmente você está usando os dois!<br><br>Definimos ‘dados’ como informações que precisam ser processadas, organizadas e estruturadas para que possam ser utilizadas. Em outras palavras, com dados estamos nos referindo às informações que você possui, como os detalhes sobre as comunidades com as quais trabalha, resultados de pesquisas que fez, endereços de e-mail e informações de contato de apoiadores e assim por diante.<br><br>Entendemos ‘tecnologia’ como as ferramentas, os sistemas, métodos e processos que capitalizam o poder computacional para gerenciar, analisar e comunicar informações. Para isso, quando falamos em tecnologia, queremos dizer ferramentas digitais, em termos gerais. Qualquer coisa, desde plataformas de e-mail e apps de mensagens até hosts de sites, plataformas de newsletters por e-mail, CRMs, bancos de dados, processos algorítmicos e mais.</p>
  



  
 
 
   
 
 
  



  
 



 FAQ: perguntas frequentes sobre tecnologia e dados  
  



  
 Primeiros passos – entendendo a visão geral sobre tecnologia e dados 



 
 P1: <a title="Deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?">Deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?</a>  



 P2: <a title="">Como eu e minha equipe podemos aprender mais sobre tecnologia e como ela é relevante para o nosso trabalho?</a> 



 P3: <a title="Minha organização acredita que é o momento de começarmos a usar mais tecnologia e dados no nosso trabalho. Por onde começamos?">Minha organização acredita que é o momento de começarmos a usar mais tecnologia e dados no nosso trabalho. Por onde começamos?</a>&nbsp; 



 P4: <a title="">Como posso garantir que as ferramentas tecnológicas e os dados que estamos usando são realmente úteis para o nosso trabalho?</a>

 Primeiros passos – entendendo a visão geral sobre tecnologia e dados 



 P1: Organizações parceiras parecem estar usando mais tecnologia/dados. Também deveríamos buscar usar mais tecnologia/dados em nosso trabalho?  



<p>A resposta para isso realmente depende do contexto. A tecnologia pode lhe auxiliar a organizar tarefas e operações diárias, permitir comunicação mais segura, coletar e gerenciar informações, cortar gastos e liberar orçamento, entre outras possibilidades. Mas, se usada de maneira ineficaz ou sem estratégia, a tecnologia também pode comprometer a sua capacidade de realizar o seu trabalho com segurança e eficácia.</p>



<p>Por exemplo, se sua organização estiver coletando relatos em primeira mão de violações aos direitos humanos em áreas com pouca conectividade à internet/rede móvel, a adoção de uma ferramenta de coleta de dados que necessite de conexão com a internet dificultará o seu trabalho e impactará negativamente a sua capacidade de cumprir a sua missão.</p>



<p>Se usada sem estratégia, a tecnologia também pode lhe expor e expor as pessoas com quem você trabalha a novas vulnerabilidades e novos riscos. Por exemplo, se você está em um contexto em que a monitoração da sociedade civil pelo governo é comum e está usando ferramentas que não protejam suas comunicações de maneira adequada, isso pode comprometer o seu trabalho e a sua segurança.</p>



<p>Para ter certeza de que você usará a tecnologia estrategicamente e com responsabilidade, separe um tempo para pensar a respeito de como implantar uma nova tecnologia ou coletar mais dados poderia fortalecer ou enfraquecer o seu trabalho. Antes de adotar quaisquer novas ferramentas ou plataformas, tente fortalecer a sua capacidade interna, conectar-se com outras organizações que você respeita.</p>

 P2: Como eu e minha equipe podemos aprender mais sobre tecnologia e como ela é relevante para o nosso trabalho?&nbsp; 



<p>Tecnologias digitais evoluem rapidamente, assim como debates e conversas sobre os potenciais benefícios e malefícios de se usar ferramentas e plataformas específicas. Quando tentamos aprender mais sobre tecnologia, achamos que o mais útil é focar em duas coisas:</p>



 
 Trabalhar para <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/" title="">desenvolver a intuição técnica da equipe de maneira lenta e incremental</a>, fazendo com que seja uma prioridade para toda a equipe tanto quanto possível (em vez de trabalho de uma única pessoa). 



 Em vez de buscar por <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/" title="">ferramentas novinhas em folha</a>, tente antes identificar como a tecnologia e os dados podem <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/" title="">fortalecer o seu trabalho principal</a>. 
 



<p>Quando o assunto são novas ferramentas e aplicações, há muita informação online que pode ser tentadora – mas pode ser difícil identificar o que é relevante para você e o que não é.</p>



<p>Para entender as informações relacionadas à tecnologia com mais facilidade, comece com o desafio que você está tentando entender ou resolver primeiro. Ademais, se puder, busque organizações parceiras que pensem de maneira similar e que possam estar em contextos parecidos ou ter missões semelhantes às suas e aprenda mais sobre quais ferramentas estão usando (e quais foram seus sucessos e desafios!).</p>

 P3: Minha organização acredita que é o momento de começarmos a usar mais tecnologia e dados no nosso trabalho. Por onde começamos?&nbsp; 



<p>Primeiro, tenha uma visão geral clara do que vocês já estão usando! A maioria das organizações já estão usando pelo menos algum tipo de tecnologia e dados para lhes auxiliar no trabalho – desde ferramentas do cotidiano, como e-mail e mensagens instantâneas, até ferramentas de CRM e bancos de dados. Abaixo, trouxemos uma pequena lista de perguntas que podem servir como um exercício inicial para mapear as maneiras que você está usando tecnologia e dados em seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Nota: algumas das informações que você vai reunir como parte deste exercício de mapeamento podem ser sensíveis; antes de começar, garanta que suas notas estão armazenadas em um local seguro e são compartilhadas apenas com pessoas que precisam acessá-las.</p>



 
 Quais ferramentas você usa atualmente para seu trabalho?&nbsp;
 
 Quais plataformas/ferramentas você e sua equipe usam para se comunicar? Dentre elas, podem estar e-mail, mensagens instantâneas, mídias sociais, SMS e sites, para listar algumas. 



 Como você armazena e gerencia seus arquivos e documentos? Quais plataformas você usa? Todos na sua equipe usam as mesmas plataformas? 



 Você está trabalhando em campanhas públicas ou faz parte de esforços coletivos com outras organizações? Se sim, quais ferramentas usa para ativismo, organização e manter a comunidade? 



 Está trabalhando com algum banco de dados ou plataforma de pesquisa? 
 
 
 



<p></p>



 
 Como você está usando os dados?
 
 Que tipo de dados/informações você coleta ou gera no cotidiano? Pense sobre seus fluxos de trabalho individuais e coletivos e liste os momentos em que você coleta ou gera dados. Por exemplo, coletar informações de contatos das pessoas que você entrevistou, conversar por e-mail ou WhatsApp, tomar notas de entrevistas ou reuniões ou realizar pesquisas com comunidades. 



 Onde você armazena os dados? Considere os dados que você já tem e liste todos os lugares onde estão (garanta que está incluindo todos os lugares remotos – e-mails, documentos compartilhados e assim por diante). 



 Onde e como você compartilha os dados? Pense sobre as vezes em que você precisa compartilhar os dados: quando isso normalmente acontece, com quem você compartilha essas informações e quais ferramentas utiliza? Por exemplo, você pode enviar planilhas ou PDFs por e-mail, compartilhar documentos e atas de reuniões pelo Google Docs ou compartilhar senhas através de um aplicativo de mensagens. 
 
 
 



<p>Essas são perguntas iniciais e exploratórias.

 P4: Como posso garantir que as ferramentas tecnológicas e os dados que estamos usando são realmente úteis para o nosso trabalho? 



<p>Em nosso trabalho de apoio a organizações da sociedade civil, frequentemente nos deparamos com <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">suposições de que dig</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">i</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">tal sign</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">i</a><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">fica melhor</a> e que qualquer solução tecnológica levará a maior eficiência, eficácia e impacto.</p>



<p>Mas nem sempre é assim. Quando estamos trabalhando mais intensamente com um parceiro, frequentemente começamos com uma avaliação de como seu uso de tecnologia e dados são mapeados para seu trabalho e contexto. Isso pode nos ajudar a entender como, ou mesmo se, a forma com que usam a tecnologia está fortalecendo seu trabalho.</p>



<p>Depois de mapear quais ferramentas a organização está usando e quais dados são coletados, armazenados e compartilhados, vamos a uma segunda rodada de perguntas: quão útil tudo isso é (ou quão útil poderia ser) no contexto do seu trabalho:</p>



 
 Qual é o principal problema social ou político no qual você está trabalhando? 



 O seu uso de tecnologia e dados está lhe auxiliando a lidar com esse problema? Se sim, como? Se não, por que você acha que isso está acontecendo? 



 Seu uso cotidiano de tecnologia e dados está lhe auxiliando a se conectar com indivíduos ou instituições importantes para o seu trabalho? 



 A forma como você usa tecnologia e dados está impactando sua carga de trabalho? Está fazendo seu trabalho mais fácil ou está criando cargas insustentáveis de trabalho para a equipe? Você gosta de usar ferramentas organizacionais?

 Tomando decisões – certificando-se de que os dados e a tecnologia que você usa estão de acordo com seus valores e sua missão  



 P5. Como tomamos decisões acerca de adotar novas ferramentas e/ou coletar dados?&nbsp; 



<p>Há muito a se pensar na hora de escolher uma ferramenta, e há muitas opções por aí – incluindo várias que você talvez ainda não conheça. Então, como começar a reduzir (ou expandir) as suas opções?</p>



<p>Em 2017, com base em uma pesquisa que fizemos sobre escolha de ferramentas em organizações da sociedade civil, criamos um <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/" title="">guia interativo para escolha de ferramentas chamado Alidade</a>, que guia as organizações da sociedade civil por meio de perguntas que podem ajudá-las a decidir que tipo de ferramenta tecnológica seria adequada para seu projeto ou suas necessidades organizacionais. Recomendamos que você teste!</p>



<p>Em geral, quando organizações estão buscando novas ferramentas tecnológicas, achamos que as seguintes diretrizes são úteis:</p>



 
 Pesquise as pessoas, o problema e, depois, a tecnologia. Analise o problema geral para o qual você acha que alguma ferramenta tecnológica poderia ser útil. Pense no seu público-alvo. Faça uma pesquisa e considere opções diferentes em relação a quais opções tecnológicas estão disponíveis. 



 Pense duas vezes antes de criar. Pesquise por ferramentas já existentes que possam fazer o que você precisa. Criar uma ferramenta totalmente nova pode ser mais complexo e arriscado. 



 Obtenha uma segunda opinião. Outra pessoa provavelmente já tentou uma abordagem parecida antes de você. Encontre essa pessoa e peça conselhos a ela. 



 Sempre faça testes. Teste pelo menos duas ferramentas, com as pessoas que você quer que as usem, antes de escolher. O teste destaca problemas logo no início. Também levanta questões que você nunca imaginou que teria. 



 Esteja preparado para o fracasso. Você não vai acertar de primeira. Tenha orçamento separado e se planeje para fazer ajustes regulares à ferramenta ao longo do projeto. 



 Reflita sobre o que você está fazendo. Tenha sempre em mente o que está e o que não está funcionando. Aplique o que você aprender ao trabalho da sua organização e compartilhe com outras organizações. 
 



<p>Certifique-se de que as ferramentas que você escolher também se adequam às suas necessidades de segurança. Quando estiver avaliando a segurança de uma ferramenta, considere o seguinte:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Qual é a política de privacidade da ferramenta? Que tipo de dados a ferramenta coleta e com quem esses dados são compartilhados? Quem tem acesso a quaisquer dados armazenados na ferramenta? 



 A abordagem da ferramenta em relação à privacidade e segurança é bem documentada? O que você consegue descobrir sobre os registros de privacidade e segurança da ferramenta? 
 



<p>Documente e discuta suas descobertas com seus colegas antes de tomar a decisão final a respeito de uma ferramenta.</p>

 P6: Minha organização quer integrar novas tecnologias, mas ainda não encontramos a ferramenta certa. Deveríamos criar nós mesmos uma ferramenta? 



<p>Se você está familiarizado com o nosso trabalho, provavelmente sabe que muitas vezes defendemos a adaptação de ferramentas existentes para suas necessidades quando possível (chamamos isso de “reutilização de ferramenta”).</p>



<p>Nossa pesquisa nessa área ao longo dos últimos anos mostrou que reutilizar e adaptar ferramentas existentes pode ter muitas vantagens, como uso mais eficiente de recursos financeiros e aumento do acesso ao suporte para a implementação e manutenção.</p>



<p>Criar uma ferramenta do zero, por outro lado, pode ser um processo custoso e longo que pode levar à frustração: já vimos como ferramentas podem acabar sendo ineficazes ou pouco usadas, ter um custo alto inesperado ou demandar muitos recursos para serem mantidas ou atualizadas.</p>



<p>Mas se simplesmente não consegue encontrar a funcionalidade que a sua organização está buscando e você está considerando criar uma nova ferramenta, aqui estão algumas questões sobre as quais refletir:</p>



 
 Há uma necessidade real e identificável para esta ferramenta? Ela lhe aproximará dos seus objetivos de longo prazo? Criar uma ferramenta responderia a uma necessidade intensa que surgiu no seu trabalho ou a ideia surgiu por outros motivos? 



 Você tem os recursos necessários para criar a ferramenta, mantê-la a longo prazo e fornecer suporte constante para as pessoas que continuarão a usá-la? 



 Qual é a sua visão para a ferramenta no longo prazo? As necessidades ou problemas que a ferramenta está sendo construída para atender e resolver podem evoluir ao longo do tempo?

 P7. Como posso usar tecnologia/dados se meu acesso à internet ou à eletricidade não é confiável? 



<p>Se você tem dificuldades com acesso intermitente à internet, considere adotar ferramentas que permitam que você trabalhe tanto online como offline. Com o Google Docs, por exemplo, você pode <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012?hl=pt-BR&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">permitir o acesso offline aos documentos</a>. Isso vai permitir que você continue seu trabalho offline e depois sincronize os documentos quando a conexão voltar. Algumas ferramentas de coleta e gerenciamento de dados, como <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, também permitem que você colete dados nos dispositivos quando não tem conexão e depois faça o upload dos dados no servidor quando a rede estiver disponível. Para reuniões online em cenários e configurações de baixa conectividade, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> é uma opção gratuita, leve e de código aberto para ligações apenas de áudio.</p>



<p>Se o orçamento da sua organização permitir, também recomendamos investir em uma conexão de backup; por exemplo, uma conexão de rede móvel à qual conectar seus aparelhos quando sua conexão de banda larga não estiver disponível.</p>



<p>Há duas formas de fazer isso: usar um modem de internet móvel ou usar um smartphone dedicado para criar um ponto de acesso ao qual outros aparelhos podem se conectar e compartilhar a conexão móvel. Aqui está um tutorial rápido de <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">como criar um ponto de acesso móvel em um smartphone Android</a>. Você pode limitar a quantidade de dados usados ao compartilhar a senha de acesso apenas com aparelhos ou usuários essenciais.</p>



<p>Em casos em que a conexão à internet e/ou à eletricidade é intermitente e você está trabalhando online, certifique-se de que está salvando seu trabalho com a maior frequência possível para minimizar os riscos de perder trabalho.</p>



<p>Se por quedas de energia com frequência, adquirir um gerador como backup pode ser uma opção interessante, desde que você tenha os recursos organizacionais para isso.</p>

<p></p>



 P8. Como trabalho com pessoas desenvolvedoras e/ou especialistas em tecnologia? 



<p>Há muitos tipos diferentes de profissionais com os quais você pode trabalhar. Tipos comuns de profissões que interagem com tecnologia ou dados incluem:</p>



 
 Design de user experience (UX): Trabalha tanto com clientes (neste caso, é você!) como usuários para criar um produto que satisfaça necessidades diversas e seja fácil de entender e operar. 



 Design gráfico: Cuida dos elementos visuais que um site, ferramenta, app ou publicação usam e é responsável por criar a identidade visual (ou branding). Frequentemente trabalha junto com o UX designer para garantir que a identidade visual também funciona bem para as pessoas que são usuárias. 



 Ilustração: Cria ilustrações, ícones, infográficos e mais, que vão compor a estrutura maior que o designer gráfico e o UX designer criaram. 



 Desenvolvimento front-end:&nbsp; Implementa o design em um site, ferramenta ou app. Em particular, é capaz de programar os aspectos que os usuários vão ver e com os quais vão interagir. 



 Desenvolvimento back-end: Desenvolve e conecta um banco de dados ao front-end (as partes do site, app ou ferramenta que um usuário pode ver) e faz todas as tarefas não visíveis que preencherão o front-end com conteúdo dinâmico. 



 Análise/Ciência de dados: Extrai padrões de grandes volumes de dados. Também pode estar equipado com as ferramentas e o conhecimento necessários para criar visualizações de dados a fim de comunicar padrões importantes. 



 Sysadmin/DevOps: Mantém os servidores onde ficam o site, as ferramentas ou apps. Frequentemente é responsável por coordenar a identificação e solução de problemas se as usuárias encontrarem bugs ou erros. 
 



<p>Às vezes, as funções podem se justapor: por exemplo, você pode contratar uma pessoa que lidera o design e desenvolvimento de um site, ou uma pessoa desenvolvedora que é capaz de trabalhar tanto em front-end como em back-end.</p>



<p>Antes de contratar desenvolvedores e especialistas em tecnologia, é útil:</p>



 
 Ter clareza do porquê você quer criar ou adaptar novas ferramentas. 



 Identificar os recursos que você tem e dos quais vai precisar. 



 Lembrar-se de se planejar para manutenção a longo prazo. 
 



<p>No início de seu trabalho juntos, é importante estabelecer pontos em comum e uma terminologia compartilhada a respeito das necessidades e expectativas. Recomendamos criar um Termo de Referência&nbsp; para documentar e compartilhar necessidades e exigências do projeto. O Termo de Referência deve abordar, no mínimo:</p>



 
 O orçamento disponível para o projeto&nbsp; 



 O prazo necessário 



 Seus objetivos 



 Suas expectativas em relação ao parceiro externo 



 Quaisquer informações adicionais 
 



<p>Vocês também devem chegar a um acordo em relação a ferramentas, canais de comunicação, funções e responsabilidades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tudo isso pode contribuir muito para o sucesso do projeto desde o início. Algumas coisas que você deve fazer ao trabalhar com consultores, uma vez que o trabalho está em andamento, são:</p>



 
 Focar na clareza dos objetivos, grandes processos e marcos organizacionais para melhor apoiar a equipe/o projeto. 



 Fornecer feedback relevante e em tempo hábil. 



 Dar espaço ao e ter respeito pela expertise do consultor. 



 Tentar ser responsivo com as comunicações.

 P9. Minha organização faz muito de seu trabalho online, mas nossa colaboração nem sempre corre tão bem. Como podemos fazer para que a colaboração online funcione melhor para nós? 



<p>Sabemos em primeira mão que, quando se trata de colaborar online, encontrar a maneira certa de se comunicar é essencial – tanto para que o trabalho corra bem como para o bem-estar geral.</p>



<p>Idealmente, sua equipe terá uma seleção de ferramentas ou canais para usar (por exemplo, um mix de apps de chat, e-mail e ferramentas de gerenciamento de projetos seguros), mas é importante que cada um deles tenha uma função clara.</p>



<p>Com frequência, as organizações com quem trabalhamos&nbsp; usam tantas ferramentas diferentes que se sentem sobrecarregados toda vez que precisam compartilhar um documento, ideia ou mensagem. Se este for o caso da sua organização, separe um tempo para listar rapidamente todas as ferramentas diferentes que as pessoas usam para se comunicar – a lista pode incluir apps como Signal e WhatsApp, plataformas de mensagens como Slack e Mattermost, CRMs online como Salesforce, ferramentas VOIP como Skype, Zoom ou Jitsi Meet, e ferramentas colaborativas como Trello, Air Table, Asana e outras. Talvez você também use mensagens SMS ou ligações por telefone.</p>



<p>Quando tiver essa lista em mãos, sugerimos que se reúna com as pessoas com as quais você mais colabora e entrem em um acordo para tentar usar menos ferramentas. Dê um propósito específico a cada ferramenta: por exemplo, talvez e-mail seja para mensagens mais longas e que não sejam tão urgentes, ou para compartilhar documentos, enquanto programas de mensagens são para questões urgentes ou conversas casuais.</p>



<p>Quando tiver identificado algumas coisas que funcionam, documente! O registro garantirá que todos estão na mesma página e será uma ótima referência para pessoas novas que entrarem na equipe ou simplesmente para servir de lembrete dos processos/projetos.</p>

 Segurança e cuidado em foco 



 P10: Como posso garantir que toda minha equipe está usando as ferramentas (ou processos de dados) que escolhemos? 



<p>Mesmo quando estamos animados com uma nova ferramenta ou processo tecnológico para usar dados, de fato adotar novos modos de trabalho é difícil. Ao mesmo tempo, garantir que estamos usando as ferramentas acordadas (e seus protocolos e segurança ou proteção relevantes) é uma maneira importante através da qual podemos praticar o cuidado um com o outro nas organizações.</p>



<p>Um passo a ser tomado para ajudar todos a adotar uma nova forma de trabalho é garantir que a nova ferramenta ou o novo protocolo respondam a uma necessidade concreta e que todos saibam qual ela é. Isso significa que todos sabem que, ao se esforçar para aprender a usar a nova ferramenta, estarão mais próximos da solução de um problema que vêm enfrentando.</p>



<p>Ao mesmo tempo, é importante gerenciar as expectativas – as mudanças podem ser sentidas pouco a pouco, ao longo do tempo, conforme mais pessoas usam uma ferramenta ou um protocolo e se familiarizam com ela/ele. Isso faz parte do processo.</p>



<p>E, porque é um processo, é bom dar espaço e tempo para aprendizado, adaptação e discussão quando uma nova ferramenta é selecionada. Dependendo do que mais estiver acontecendo, as capacidades para aprender algo novo podem variar entre as equipes, e dar espaço pode ser a melhor forma de reconhecer isso.</p>



<p>Por fim, ouvir as experiências das pessoas que estão usando a nova ferramenta pode lhe ajudar a identificar maneiras que você pode ajustar a própria ferramenta, se for possível, ou ajustar como ela vem sendo aplicada.&nbsp;</p>

 P11: O que podemos fazer para manter as pessoas em segurança quando começarmos a usar diferentes ferramentas tecnológicas e práticas de dados? 



<p>Muitas das pessoas com quem conversamos estão curiosas a respeito de como podem incorporar a segurança e o cuidado em todo o trabalho que fazem – especialmente quando se trata de novas iniciativas tecnológicas e de dados. Ao vermos nos noticiários, nas nossas comunidades e em nossas próprias experiências situações como vazamentos de dados e ferramentas hackeadas, pode parecer desafiador adotar ferramentas ou processos tecnológicos com segurança.</p>



<p>Uma abordagem que pode auxiliar a fornecer uma base é a de Responsible Data (ou “dados responsáveis”, em uma tradução livre): a ideia de que compartilhamos um “dever coletivo de prestar contas das consequências não intencionais de trabalhar com dados”.</p>



<p>Algumas áreas a serem exploradas e que estão sob o guarda-chuva dos dados responsáveis são:</p>



 
 Práticas como minimização de dados (apenas coletar os dados que você precisa). 



 Conceitos como consentimento (certificar-se de que as pessoas são capazes de concordar de maneira livre, específica, informada e revogável com como seus dados serão usados). 



 Espaços relacionados, como segurança organizacional (uma rica área de prática em torno da definição de protocolos que podem auxiliar a criar segurança de dados/informações e bem-estar físico e segurança).&nbsp; 
 



<p>Se você não está familiarizado com esses tipos de práticas, há alguns recursos que podem ajudar – desde guias online até suporte do praticante.</p>



<p>Escolher ferramentas que priorizem sua segurança pode ser outro passo a ser dado. Com frequência, essas ferramentas não são tão utilizadas como suas contrapartes menos seguras, então essa pode ser uma oportunidade para consultar colegas com pensamento similar ou contatar um especialista em tecnologia externo em quem você confie. Algumas dessas ferramentas podem incluir:</p>



 
 Gerenciadores de senhas: Criar senhas fortes e exclusivas é uma parte fundamental ao usar a tecnologia com mais segurança. Gerenciadores de senha podem tanto acompanhar suas senhas usadas como ajudá-lo a criar senhas fortes. <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords" title="">Saiba</a> mais aqui. 



 Ferramentas de comunicação mais seguras: Muitas das mensagens que enviamos digitalmente não são criptografadas, o que significa que, se alguém tentar interceptá-las, poderia ler o conteúdo. Ferramentas de comunicação mais seguras oferecem criptografia, tornando mais difícil que pessoas leiam o conteúdo de suas mensagens. Você pode <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures" title="">aprender mais aqui</a>, ou entrar em contato conosco para auxílio a respeito de adoção de novas ferramentas. 



 Redes privadas virtuais: Uma VPN (virtual private network, em inglês) é uma ferramenta que pode ajudar a proteger sua atividade na web contra vigilância na rede de internet que você está usando. Escolher a VPN certa – e conhecer suas limitações – é crucial, e depende do contexto no qual você está inserido (em qual país está, qual VPN escolheu etc.). Ao mesmo tempo, escolher a VPN certa para a sua situação pode ser complexo, então <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you" title="">se informe mais aqui</a> e não hesite em entrar em contato conosco para obter ajuda. 
 



<p>Sempre tenha em mente que segurança é uma mistura tanto de ferramentas como de práticas. É importante ter as ferramentas corretas, mas é igualmente importante usá-las do jeito correto e construir práticas internas fortes quando o assunto for segurança em geral, levando em consideração segurança física e psicológica também.</p>

 Exploraciones iniciales – pantallazo inicial del panorama tecnológico y de datos 



 P1: Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo? 



<p>La respuesta aquí realmente dependerá del contexto. La tecnología puede ayudarte a organizar el trabajo y las tareas diarias, permitir una comunicación más segura, recopilar y administrar información, y reducir costos y liberar recursos, entre otras cosas. Pero si la tecnología se usa de manera ineficaz o no estratégica, también puede comprometer tu capacidad para hacer el trabajo de manera segura y efectiva.</p>



<p>Por ejemplo, si tu organización está recopilando relatos de primera mano sobre violaciones de derechos humanos en áreas con poca conectividad a Internet/móvil, la adopción de una herramienta de recopilación de datos que requiera una conexión a Internet dificultará tu trabajo y afectará negativamente la capacidad para cumplir tu misión.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Usada de manera no estratégica, la tecnología también puede exponerte a ti y a tus colegas, a nuevas vulnerabilidades y riesgos. Por ejemplo, si te encuentras en un contexto donde la vigilancia gubernamental de la sociedad civil es común, y estás utilizando herramientas que no protegen adecuadamente tus comunicaciones, eso puede comprometer tu trabajo y seguridad.</p>



<p>Para asegurarte de usar la tecnología de manera estratégica y responsable, tómate un tiempo para pensar sobre el modo en que adoptar nuevas tecnologías o recopilar más datos podría fortalecer o debilitar tu trabajo. Antes de adoptar cualquier herramienta o plataforma nueva, intenta desarrollar tu capacidad interna, ponte en contacto con colegas u otras organizaciones que respetes.</p>

 P2: ¿Cómo podemos mi equipo y yo aprender más sobre tecnología y cómo ese aprendizaje es relevante para nuestro trabajo?  



<p>Las tecnologías digitales evolucionan rápidamente, al igual que los debates y las conversaciones sobre los posibles beneficios y efectos nocivos del uso de herramientas y plataformas específicas. Cuando tratamos de aprender más sobre tecnología, encontramos que es más útil enfocarse en dos aspectos:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Trabajar para <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">desarrollar la intuición técnica del personal de manera paulatina y progresiva</a> (inglés), y convertir ese objetivo en una prioridad de todo el equipo tanto como sea posible (a diferencia de un trabajo de una sola persona). 



 En lugar de buscar <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/">herramientas da moda</a> (inglés), primero tratar de identificar cómo la tecnología y los datos podría <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/">fortalecer tu trabajo principal</a> (inglés). 
 



<p>Cuando se trata de nuevas herramientas y aplicaciones, hay mucha información en línea que puede ser atractiva, pero puede ser difícil identificar qué es relevante para ti y qué no.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Para entender más fácilmente la información relacionada con la tecnología, comienza primero con el problema que estás tratando de comprender o abordar. Además, si puedes, comunícate con profesionales de ideas afines que puedan tener contextos o misiones similares a los tuyos y aprende más sobre las herramientas que están usando (¡y cuáles han sido sus éxitos y fracasos!).</p>

 P3: Mi organización cree que es hora de comenzar a usar más tecnología y datos en nuestro trabajo. ¿Dónde empezamos?  



<p>¡Primero consigue una perspectiva general clara de lo que ya estás usando! La mayoría de las organizaciones ya están utilizando al menos algo de tecnología y datos para respaldar su trabajo, desde herramientas cotidianas como el correo electrónico o la mensajería instantánea, hasta herramientas y bases de datos de CRM. A continuación, encontrarás una breve lista de preguntas que pueden servir como ejercicio inicial para mapear las formas en que estás utilizando la tecnología y los datos en tu trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nota: parte de la información recopilada mediante este ejercicio de mapeo puede ser confidencial: antes de comenzar, asegúrate de guardar tus notas en un lugar seguro y de compartirlas solo con las personas que necesitan acceso a ellas.</p>



 
 ¿Qué herramientas utilizas actualmente para tu trabajo?
 
 ¿Qué plataformas/herramientas usan tú y tu equipo en sus comunicaciones? Estas podrían incluir correo electrónico, mensajería instantánea, redes sociales, SMS y sitios web, por nombrar algunos. 



 ¿Cómo almacenas y administras tus archivos y documentos? ¿Qué plataformas usas? ¿Todo el&nbsp; equipo usa las mismas plataformas? 



 ¿Estás trabajando en campañas públicas o trabajas en equipo con otras organizaciones? En caso afirmativo, ¿qué herramientas utilizas para el activismo, la organización y la construcción de la comunidad? 



 ¿Estás trabajando con alguna base de datos o plataforma de investigación? 
 
 
 



<p></p>



 
 ¿Cómo estás usando los datos?
 
 ¿Qué tipo de datos/información recopilas o generas día a día? Piensa en tus flujos de trabajo individuales y colectivos y enumera los momentos en los que recopilas o generas datos. Por ejemplo, recopilar información de contacto de las personas que ha entrevistado, tener conversaciones por correo electrónico o Whatsapp, tomar notas de entrevistas o reuniones, o realizar encuestas con las comunidades. 



 ¿Dónde almacenas los datos? Considera los datos que tienes actualmente y enumera todos los lugares en los que están (asegúrate de incluir todas sus ubicaciones remotas: correos electrónicos, documentos compartidos, etc.). 



 ¿Cuándo y cómo compartes los datos? Piensa en los momentos en los que necesitas compartir datos: ¿cuándo suele suceder, con quién los comparte y qué herramientas utilizas? Por ejemplo, puedes enviar hojas de cálculo o archivos PDF por correo electrónico, compartir documentos y actas de reuniones a través de Google Docs o compartir contraseñas a través de una aplicación de mensajería.&nbsp;

 P4: ¿Cómo puedo asegurarme de que las herramientas tecnológicas y los datos que usamos sean realmente útiles para nuestro trabajo?  



<p>En nuestro trabajo de apoyo a las organizaciones de la sociedad civil, a menudo nos enfrentamos a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">presunciones acerca de lo digital siempre es mejor</a> (inglés), y que cualquier solución tecnológica conducirá a una mayor eficiencia, efectividad e impacto.</p>



<p>Pero este no es siempre el caso. Cuando trabajamos con un socio de manera más cercana, a menudo comenzamos a evaluar cómo su uso de datos y tecnología actualmente se relacionan con su trabajo y contexto. Esto puede ayudarnos a descubrir cómo, o incluso si, la forma en que usan la tecnología está fortaleciendo su trabajo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Después de mapear qué herramientas está utilizando la organización y qué datos recopila, almacena y comparte, pasamos a una segunda capa de preguntas: ¿Qué tan útil es todo esto (o qué tan útil podría ser) en el contexto de tu trabajo?:&nbsp;</p>



 
 ¿Cuál es el problema social o político central en el que estás trabajando?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 ¿El uso de tecnología y datos te permite abordar mejor ese problema? Si es así, ¿cómo? Si no, ¿por qué crees que eso podría estar sucediendo? 



 ¿El uso diario de tecnología y datos te ayudan a conectarte con personas u organizaciones importantes para tu trabajo? 



 ¿La forma en que usas la tecnología y los datos está afectando tu carga de trabajo? ¿Está facilitando tu trabajo o la carga de trabajo está siendo insostenible para el equipo? ¿Te gusta usar tus herramientas de organización?

 Tomar decisiones – asegurándote de que los datos y la tecnología que usas coincidan con tus valores y misión 



 P5. ¿Cómo tomamos decisiones sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas y/o la recopilación de datos?  



<p>Hay muchos aspectos a considerar al seleccionar una herramienta, y existen diversas opciones, incluso varias que quizás aún no conozcas. Entonces, ¿cómo empezar a reducir (o ampliar) tus opciones?</p>



<p>En el 2017, en base a nuestra investigación sobre la selección de herramientas en organizaciones de la sociedad civil, elaboramos un <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/">guía interactiva de selección de herramientas llamada Alidade</a> (Inglés), que por medio de preguntas puede ayudar a las organizaciones a decidir qué tipo de herramienta tecnológica mejor se adapta a sus necesidades. ¡Recomendamos probarla!.</p>



<p>En general, cuando las organizaciones buscan nuevas herramientas tecnológicas, hemos constatado que las siguientes pautas resultan beneficiosas:</p>



 
 Investigar a las personas, el problema y luego la tecnología. Analiza el problema general donde piensas que una herramienta tecnológica podría ser útil. Piensa en tu público objetivo. Investiga y examina las diferentes alternativas tecnológicas disponibles.&nbsp; 



 Pensar dos veces antes de construir. Busca herramientas ya existentes acordes a tus necesidades. Construir una herramienta completamente nueva puede ser complejo y arriesgado. 



 Conseguir una segunda opinión. Probablemente alguien más haya intentado un enfoque similar previamente. Encuentra a esa persona y pídele consejos. 



 Siempre hay que probar. Antes de elegir una prueba al menos dos herramientas, con las personas con las que quieres usarlas. Ponerlas a prueba permite detectar problemas. También te permite plantearte preguntas que no se te habían ocurrido. 



 Planificar por si falla. La primera vez puede que no salga bien. Prepara un plan y un presupuesto que te permita ir haciendo ajustes regulares a la herramienta a lo largo del proyecto. 



 Reflexionar sobre lo que estás haciendo. Sigue pensando en lo que funciona y lo que no funciona. Aplica ese aprendizaje al trabajo de tu organización y compártelo con otras organizaciones. 
 



<p>Asegúrate de que las herramientas que elijas también se adapten a tus necesidades de seguridad. Al evaluar la seguridad de una herramienta, considera lo siguiente:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 ¿Cuál es la política de privacidad de datos de la herramienta? ¿Qué tipo de datos recopila la herramienta y con quién se comparten esos datos? ¿Quién tiene acceso a los datos almacenados dentro de la herramienta? 



 ¿Está bien documentado el enfoque de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta? ¿Qué puedes averiguar sobre el historial de privacidad y seguridad de la herramienta? 
 



<p>Documenta tus hallazgos y coméntalos con tus colegas antes de tomar una decisión final sobre una herramienta.</p>



<p>Preguntas relacionadas:<br>– <a title="Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo?">Nuestros pares parecen estar usando más tecnología/datos, ¿deberíamos considerar incrementar su uso también en nuestro trabajo?</a><br>– <a title="¿Cómo podemos mi equipo y yo aprender más sobre tecnología y cómo ese aprendizaje es relevante para nuestro trabajo?

 P6: Mi organización quiere integrar nuevas tecnologías, pero no hemos encontrado la herramienta adecuada. ¿Deberíamos construir una nueva herramienta? 



<p>Si estás familiarizado con nuestro trabajo, probablemente sepas que a menudo estamos a favor de adaptar las herramientas existentes a tus necesidades siempre que sea posible (llamamos a esto “reutilización de herramientas”).</p>



<p>Nuestra investigación en esta área en los últimos años ha demostrado que la reutilización y la adaptación de las herramientas existentes puede tener una serie de ventajas, como el uso más eficiente de los recursos financieros y el aumento del acceso al apoyo en la implementación y el mantenimiento.</p>



<p>Desarrollar una herramienta desde cero, por otro lado, este puede ser un proceso prolongado y costoso, con resultados decepcionantes: hemos visto cómo las herramientas pueden terminar siendo ineficaces o poco utilizadas, resultar inesperadamente onerosas o requerir para su mantenimiento y actualización del empleo intensivo de recursos.</p>



<p>Pero si la funcionalidad que tu organización está buscando no está disponible y, estás considerando construir una nueva herramienta, aquí hay algunas preguntas para reflexionar al respecto:</p>



 
 ¿Existe una necesidad real e identificable de esta herramienta? ¿Esto te acercará más a tus objetivos a largo plazo? ¿La construcción de una herramienta respondería a una fuerte necesidad que ha surgido durante tu trabajo, o la idea tuvo otro origen? 



 ¿Cuentas con los recursos necesarios para construir la herramienta, mantenerla a largo plazo y brindar apoyo continuo a quienes la utilizarán? 



 ¿Cuál es tu visión para la herramienta a largo plazo? ¿Podrían las necesidades o problemas que se está construyendo la herramienta para abordar potencialmente evolucionar con el tiempo?

 P7. ¿Cómo puedo usar tecnología/datos si mi acceso a Internet o a la electricidad no es confiable?  



<p>Si tienes problemas de acceso intermitente a Internet, considera la adopción de herramientas que te posibiliten trabajar tanto en línea como sin conexión. En Google Docs, por ejemplo, puedes <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102?hl=es">habilitar el acceso offline a los documentos</a> . Esto te permitirá continuar trabajando sin conexión y luego sincronizar los documentos una vez que se restablezca la conectividad. Algunas herramientas de recopilación y gestión de datos, como <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, te permite recopilar datos en dispositivos cuando no tienes conexión, y luego cargar datos al servidor una vez que la red esté disponible. Para reuniones en línea en entornos de baja conectividad, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> es una opción gratuita, de código abierto y liviana para llamadas de solo audio.</p>



<p>Si el presupuesto de tu organización lo permite, también recomendamos invertir en una conexión de respaldo: por ejemplo, una conexión de red móvil para conectar sus dispositivos cuando su conexión de banda ancha no esté disponible.</p>



<p>Hay dos formas de hacerlo: usando un módem de Internet móvil o un teléfono inteligente para crear un punto de acceso móvil donde otros dispositivos pueden conectarse y compartir la conectividad móvil. Aquí hay un breve tutorial sobre <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">Cómo crear un punto de acceso móvil en un teléfono inteligente Android</a> (Inglés). Puedes reducir el consumo de datos compartiendo la contraseña de acceso solo con dispositivos y personas imprescindibles.</p>



<p>En los casos en que la conexión a Internet y/o la electricidad sean intermitentes y estés trabajando en línea, asegúrate de guardar tu trabajo con la mayor frecuencia posible para minimizar el riesgo de perderlo.</p>



<p>Si con frecuencia sufres cortes de electricidad, adquirir un generador de respaldo puede ser una opción útil, siempre que tu organización cuente con los recursos para hacerlo.</p>



 
 <a>Volver al principio</a> 
 



<p></p>



 P8. ¿Cómo trabajar con personas desarrolladoras y/o expertas en temas de tecnología? 



<p>Hay muchos tipos diferentes de profesionales con los que puedes trabajar. Entre las profesiones que interactúan con mayor frecuencia con tecnología y datos se encuentran:</p>



 
 Diseño de experiencia de usuario (UX): Trabaja tanto con clientes (¡en este caso, contigo!) como con usuarios para diseñar un producto que satisfaga múltiples necesidades y sea fácil de entender y operar.&nbsp; 



 Diseño visual o gráfico: Supervisa los elementos gráficos que utilizará un sitio web, una herramienta, una aplicación o una publicación, y es responsable de diseñar la identidad visual (o la marca). A menudo trabajan con la persona encargada de diseño de UX para asegurarse de que la identidad visual también funcione bien para las personas usuarias. 



 Ilustración: Crea ilustraciones, íconos, infografías, etc., que vivirán dentro de la estructura más grande que han creado el diseñador visual y el diseñador UX. 



 Desarrollo Frontend: Implementa el diseño en un sitio web, herramienta o aplicación. En particular, es capaz de codificar los aspectos que los usuarios verán y con los que interactuarán. 



 Desarrollo Backend: Desarrolla y conecta una base de datos al frontend (las partes del sitio web, la aplicación o la herramienta que un usuario puede ver) y realiza todas las tareas no visibles que llenarán el frontend con contenido dinámico. 



 Análisis de datos: Extrae patrones de grandes volúmenes de datos. También pueden estar equipados con las herramientas y el conocimiento para crear visualizaciones de datos para comunicar patrones importantes. 



 Sysadmin/DevOps: Mantiene los servidores donde vive el sitio web, la herramienta o la aplicación. A menudo son responsables de coordinar el procedimiento necesario para resolver problemas cuando los usuarios detectan errores o fallos. 
 



<p>A veces, los roles pueden superponerse: por ejemplo, puedes contratar a una persona que lidere el diseño y desarrollo de un sitio web, o una persona desarrolladora que sea capaz de trabajar tanto en el frontend como en el backend.</p>



<p>Antes de contratar personas desarrolladoras y tecnólogas externas, es útil que:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Seas claro acerca de por qué deseas crear o adoptar nuevas herramientas. 



 Identifiques los recursos que tienes y los que necesitarás. 



 Te acuerdes de planificar el mantenimiento a largo plazo. 
 



<p>Cuando comiencen a trabajar juntos es importante establecer puntos de coincidencia y una terminología compartida acerca de las necesidades y expectativas. Recomendamos redactar los TdR (Términos de Referencia) para documentar y compartir las necesidades y requisitos del proyecto. Los TdR deben cubrir como mínimo:</p>



 
 El presupuesto disponible del proyecto. 



 La línea de tiempo necesaria 



 Tus objetivos 



 Tus expectativas para el socio externo 



 Cualquier información adicional 
 



<p>También deben ponerse de acuerdo en lo referido a herramientas, canales de comunicación, roles y responsabilidades.</p>



<p>Todo esto puede contribuir en gran medida al éxito del proyecto desde el principio. Algunos items de la lista de tareas del trabajo con consultores una vez que el proceso está en marcha son:</p>



 
 Concéntrate en la claridad de los objetivos organizacionales, los grandes procesos y los hitos para apoyar mejor al equipo/proyecto. 



 Brinda retroalimentación relevante y oportuna. 



 Proporciona espacio y muestra respeto por la experiencia del consultor. 



 Trata de mantener una comunicación frecuente.

 P9. Mi organización hace mucho de nuestro trabajo en línea, pero nuestra colaboración no siempre funciona tan bien. ¿Cómo podemos hacer que la colaboración en línea funcione mejor? 



<p>Sabemos de primera mano que cuando se trata de colaborar en línea, encontrar la forma correcta de comunicarse es esencial, tanto para trabajar sin problemas como para el bienestar general.</p>



<p>Idealmente, tu equipo tendrá una selección de herramientas o canales para usar (por ejemplo, una combinación de aplicaciones de chat seguras, correo electrónico y herramientas de gestión de proyectos), pero es importante que cada uno de estos tenga una función clara.</p>



<p>A menudo, nuestros socios usan tantas herramientas diferentes que se sienten abrumados cada vez que necesitan compartir un documento, una idea o un mensaje. Si este es el caso de tu organización, destina un tiempo para anotar rápidamente todas las diversas herramientas que usan para comunicarse; la lista podría incluir aplicaciones como Signal y Whatsapp, plataformas de mensajería como Slack y Mattermost, CRM en línea como Salesforce, herramientas de VOIP como Skype, Zoom o Jitsi Meet, y herramientas de colaboración como Trello, Airtable, Asana y otras. Quizás también usan mensajes SMS y llamadas telefónicas.</p>



<p>Una vez que tengas esta lista, te sugerimos que te reúnas con tus colegas, o con las personas con las que colaboras más a menudo, para de manera consensuada intentar usar menos herramientas. Asigna a cada herramienta un propósito específico: por ejemplo, tal vez el correo electrónico sea para mensajes más largos que no sean sensibles al tiempo o para compartir documentos, mientras que los programas de mensajería son solo para preguntas urgentes o conversaciones amistosas.</p>



<p>Una vez que hayas identificado algunas cosas que funcionan, ¡documenta los aprendizajes! La documentación asegurará que todos estén en la misma página y que sea una gran referencia para cualquier persona nueva que se una al equipo o para permanecer consciente de los procesos/proyectos.</p>

 Centrar esfuerzos en torno a la seguridad y el cuidado 



 P10: ¿Cómo puedo asegurarme de que todo mi equipo esté utilizando las herramientas (o procesos de datos) que hemos elegido? 



<p>Incluso cuando estamos entusiasmados con una nueva herramienta tecnológica o un proceso para el uso de datos, es difícil adoptar nuevas formas de trabajar. Al mismo tiempo, asegurarnos de que estamos utilizando las herramientas que acordamos usar (y sus protocolos de seguridad o protección relevantes) es una manera importante de poner en práctica el cuidado mutuo en las organizaciones.</p>



<p>Una medida para ayudarnos mutuamente en la adopción de una nueva forma de trabajar es asegurarnos de que la nueva herramienta o protocolo responda a una necesidad concreta y que todos sepan cuál es esa necesidad. Esto significa que todos saben que el esfuerzo que realizan para aprender a usar la nueva herramienta, los acercará a encontrar una solución a un problema que venían enfrentando.</p>



<p>Al mismo tiempo, es importante gestionar las expectativas: los cambios posiblemente se empiecen a notar poco a poco, con el tiempo, a medida que más personas usan una herramienta o protocolo y se familiarizan con él. Eso es parte del proceso.</p>



<p>Y, como es un proceso, es bueno dejar espacio y tiempo para el aprendizaje, la adaptación y el debate cuando se implementa una nueva herramienta. Dependiendo de qué más esté pasando, las capacidades para aprender algo nuevo pueden variar entre los equipos, y dar espacio puede ser la mejor manera de reconocer esto.</p>



<p>Finalmente, escuchar las experiencias de aquellas personas que usan la nueva herramienta pueden ayudarte a detectar eventuales ajustes que quieras hacer en la herramienta como tal o en el modo en que se utiliza.&nbsp;</p>

 P11: ¿Qué podemos hacer para mantener a las personas más seguras cuando comenzamos a usar diferentes herramientas tecnológicas y prácticas de datos? 



<p>Muchas de las personas con las que hablamos tienen curiosidad sobre cómo incorporar la seguridad y el cuidado en todo el trabajo que realizan, especialmente cuando se trata de nuevas iniciativas de tecnología y datos. Cuando en las noticias, en nuestras comunidades y por experiencias personales nos enteramos de casos de fugas de datos y de hackeos a herramientas,&nbsp; incorporar de manera segura herramientas o procesos tecnológicos puede resultar una tarea ardua.</p>



<p>Un enfoque que puede contribuir a la construcción de una base adecuada es el de Datos Responsables (Responsible Data): la idea de que compartimos un “deber colectivo de dar cuenta de las consecuencias no deseadas de trabajar con datos.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Algunas áreas para explorar que caen bajo el paraguas de Datos Responsables son:</p>



 
 Prácticas como la minimización de datos (solo recopilar los datos necesarios). 



 Conceptos como el consentimiento (asegurando que las personas puedan aceptar cómo se utilizarán sus datos de una manera libremente dada, específica, informada y revocable). 



 Espacios relacionados como la <a href="https://wiki.orgsec.community/">seguridad organizacional</a> (un área rica de práctica en torno al establecimiento de protocolos que pueden ayudar a construir seguridad de datos/información y bienestar físico y seguridad). 
 



<p>Si no estás familiarizado con este tipo de prácticas, existen recursos que pueden ayudarte, desde guías en línea hasta apoyo para profesionales.</p>



<p>Seleccionar herramientas que prioricen tu seguridad puede ser otro paso a seguir. A menudo, estas herramientas no se usan tanto como sus contrapartes menos seguras, por lo que esta podría ser una oportunidad para consultar con colegas de ideas afines o para contactar a una consultoría tecnológica externa de tu confianza. Algunas de estas herramientas podrían incluir:</p>



 
 Gestores de contraseñas: Crear contraseñas fuertes y únicas es una parte fundamental del uso de la tecnología de manera más segura. Los administradores de contraseñas pueden realizar un seguimiento de tus contraseñas y ayudarte a crear buenas contraseñas.&nbsp; <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">Aprende más aquí</a> (Inglés). 



 Herramientas de comunicación más seguras: Muchos mensajes que enviamos digitalmente no están encriptados, lo que significa que si alguien los interceptara, podría leer el contenido. Las herramientas de comunicaciones más seguras ofrecen cifrado, lo que dificulta que las personas lean el contenido de tus mensajes. Puedes&nbsp; <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures">aprender más aquí</a> (Inglés), o puedes <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener ayuda sobre la adopción de nuevas herramientas. 



 Redes privadas virtuales: Una VPN (red virtual privada) es una herramienta que puede ayudar a proteger tu actividad web de la vigilancia en la red de Internet que estás utilizando. Elegir la VPN correcta, y conocer sus limitaciones, es crucial y depende del contexto en el que te encuentres (en qué país estés, qué VPN elijas, etc.). Al mismo tiempo, elegir la VPN adecuada para tu situación puede ser complejo, así que puedes <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">conseguir información aquí</a> y no dudes en <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">comunicarte con The Engine Room</a> para obtener apoyo.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Siempre ten en cuenta que la seguridad es una combinación de herramientas y prácticas. Así como contar con las herramientas adecuadas es importante, usarlas de la manera correcta y desarrollar prácticas internas sólidas en torno a la seguridad en general, teniendo en cuenta la seguridad física y psicológica también lo es.</p>

<p>Une partie de notre travail à The Engine Room consiste à aider nos partenaires et nos pairs à répondre aux questions qu’ils/elles se posent sur les technologies et les données. Comme beaucoup d’organisations viennent nous voir avec des préoccupations similaires, nous avons compilé certaines des questions clés qui nous sont posées dans la FAQ (Foire aux questions) suivante.</p>



<p>Nous n’entrerons pas dans les détails pour chaque réponse, mais nous essaierons de vous indiquer la direction à suivre. Consultez notre programme <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="Light-Touch Support">Light-Touch Support</a> si vous avez d’autres questions.</p>

<p>Avant de commencer, qu’est-ce que nous entendons par les données (data)? Et la technologie? Il y a de fortes chances que vous travailliez avec les deux! <br><br>Nous définissons les données comme des informations devant être traitées, organisées et structurées pour être utilisables. En d’autres termes, par données, nous entendons les informations que vous détenez, telles que les détails sur les communautés avec lesquelles vous travaillez, les résultats des recherches que vous avez menées, les aboutissements d’enquêtes, les adresses électroniques et&nbsp; les coordonnées des partisans, etc.<br><br>Nous entendons par technologie les outils, systèmes, méthodes et processus qui tirent parti de la puissance de calcul pour gérer, analyser et communiquer des informations. Pour cette ressource, lorsque nous parlons de technologie, nous entendons les outils numériques au sens large. Il peut s’agir de plateformes de messagerie, d’applications de messagerie, d’hébergeurs de sites Web, de plateformes de newsletter, de CRM, de bases de données, de processus algorithmiques, etc.</p>

 Explorations initiales – se faire une idée de votre propre paysage technologique et de données 



 Q1: Nos pairs semblent utiliser davantage de technologie et de données. Devrions-nous également envisager d’utiliser davantage de technologie et de données dans notre travail ? 



<p>La réponse à cette question dépend du contexte. La technologie peut vous aider à organiser votre travail et vos opérations quotidiennes, à permettre une communication plus sûre, à collecter et à gérer des informations, à réduire les coûts et à libérer des ressources, entre autres choses. Mais si elle est utilisée de manière inefficace ou non stratégique, la technologie peut également compromettre votre capacité à effectuer votre travail de manière sûre et efficace.</p>



<p>Par exemple, si votre organisation recueille des témoignages de première main sur des violations des droits de l’homme dans des zones où la connectivité internet/mobile est faible, l’adoption d’un outil de collecte de données nécessitant une connexion internet rendra votre travail difficile et aura un impact négatif sur votre capacité à mener à bien votre mission.</p>



<p>Utilisée de manière non stratégique, la technologie peut également vous exposer, ainsi que ceux avec qui vous travaillez, à de nouvelles vulnérabilités et à de nouveaux risques. Par exemple, si vous vous trouvez dans un contexte où la surveillance de la société civile par le gouvernement est courante et que vous utilisez des outils qui ne protègent pas adéquatement vos communications, cela peut compromettre votre travail et votre sécurité.</p>



<p>Pour vous assurer que vous utilisez les technologies de manière stratégique et responsable, prenez le temps de réfléchir à la manière dont l’adoption de nouvelles technologies ou la collecte de données supplémentaires pourrait renforcer ou affaiblir votre travail. Avant d’adopter un nouvel outil ou une nouvelle plateforme, essayez de renforcer vos capacités internes, de vous mettre en relation avec vos pairs ou avec d’autres organisations que vous respectez.</p>

 Q2: Comment mon équipe et moi-même pouvons-nous en apprendre davantage sur les technologies et leur pertinence pour notre travail ?  



<p>Les technologies numériques évoluent rapidement, tout comme les débats et les conversations sur les avantages et les inconvénients potentiels de l’utilisation d’outils et de plateformes spécifiques. Lorsque nous essayons d’en savoir plus sur la technologie, nous trouvons qu’il est plus utile de se concentrer sur deux choses :&nbsp;</p>



 
 Travailler pour <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/" title="">développer lentement et progressivement l’intuition technique du personnel</a>, en en faisant autant que possible une priorité pour l’ensemble de l’équipe (par opposition au travail d’une seule personne).  



 Au lieu de chercher de <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/" title="">de nouveaux outils</a>, essayez d’abord d’identifier comment la technologie et les données pourraient <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/" title="">renforcer votre travail de base</a>. 
 



<p>Lorsqu’il s’agit de nouveaux outils et applications, il y a beaucoup d’informations en ligne qui peuvent être attrayantes – mais il peut être difficile d’identifier ce qui est pertinent pour vous, et ce qui ne l’est pas.&nbsp;<br>Pour mieux comprendre les informations techniques, commencez par le problème que vous essayez de comprendre ou de résoudre. En outre, si vous le pouvez, établissez des contacts avec des praticien·nes partageant les mêmes idées et ayant éventuellement des contextes ou des missions similaires aux vôtres, et apprenez davantage sur les outils qu’ils/elles utilisent (ainsi que sur leurs réussites et leurs difficultés!).</p>

 <a>Retour au début</a> 
 



<p></p>



 Q3 : Mon organisation pense qu’il est temps de commencer à utiliser davantage de technologie et de données dans notre travail. Par où commencer ?  



<p>Commencez par avoir une vue d’ensemble claire de ce que vous utilisez déjà ! La plupart des organisations utilisent déjà au moins un peu de technologie et de données pour soutenir leur travail – des outils quotidiens tels que l’e-mail ou la messagerie instantanée, aux outils de CRM et aux bases de données. Ci-dessous une courte liste de questions qui peuvent servir d’exercice initial pour déterminer comment vous utilisez les technologies et les données dans votre travail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remarque : certaines des informations que vous recueillerez dans le cadre de cet exercice de cartographie peuvent être sensibles : avant de commencer, assurez-vous que vos notes sont stockées dans un endroit sûr et qu’elles ne sont partagées qu’avec les personnes qui doivent y avoir accès.</p>



 
 Quels outils utilisez-vous actuellement pour votre travail ?&nbsp;
 
 Avec quelles plateformes/outils communiquez-vous, vous et votre équipe ? Il peut s’agir de courriels, de messageries instantanées, de médias sociaux, de SMS et de sites Web, pour n’en citer que quelques-uns.  



 Comment stockez-vous et gérez-vous vos fichiers et vos documents ? Quelles plateformes utilisez-vous ? Est-ce que tous les membres de votre équipe utilisent les mêmes plateformes ? 



 Travaillez-vous sur des campagnes publiques ou faites-vous partie d’efforts collectifs avec d’autres organisations ? Si oui, quels outils utilisez-vous pour le militantisme, l’organisation et la construction de la communauté ? 



 Travaillez-vous avec des bases de données ou des plateformes de recherche ? 
 
 
 



<p></p>



 
 Comment utilisez-vous les données ? 
 
 Quel type de données/informations recueillez-vous ou générez-vous au quotidien ? Réfléchissez à vos flux de travail individuels et collectifs et dressez la liste des moments où vous collectez ou générez des données. Par exemple, recueillir les coordonnées des personnes que vous avez interrogées, avoir des discussions par courriel ou Whatsapp, prendre des notes d’entretien ou de réunion, ou mener des enquêtes auprès des communautés 



 Où stockez-vous les données ? Considérez les données dont vous disposez actuellement et dressez la liste de tous les endroits où elles vivent (veillez à inclure tous vos emplacements distants – courriels, documents partagés, et ainsi de suite). 



 Quand et comment partagez-vous les données ? Réfléchissez aux moments où vous devez partager des données : quand cela se produit-il généralement, avec qui le faites-vous et quels outils utilisez-vous ? Par exemple, vous pourriez envoyer des feuilles de calcul ou des PDF par courrier électronique, partager des documents et des comptes rendus de réunion via Google Docs, ou partager des mots de passe via une application de messagerie. 
 
 
 



<p>Il s’agit là de questions exploratoires initiales.&nbsp; Pour une version complète de cet exercice de cartographie, voir <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/" title="">Becoming RAD!</a> (publié en 2021), ou <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" title="">reach out to our team</a>.</p>



<p>Enfin, l’adoption de nouveaux outils demande du temps et des ressources. Assurez-vous de vous accorder, ainsi que votre équipe, des espaces dédiés à l’apprentissage d’outils peu familiers, à la pratique de comportements et à la mise à niveau avec les nouvelles données utilisées.</p>



<p>Questions connexes :<br>– <a title="">Devrions-nous également envisager d’utiliser davantage de technologie et de données dans notre travail ?</a><br>– <a title="">Comment mon équipe et moi-même pouvons-nous en apprendre davantage sur les technologies et leur pertinence pour notre travail ?</a></p>

 Q4 : Comment puis-je m’assurer que les outils tech et les données que nous utilisons sont réellement utiles à notre travail ? 



<p>Dans notre travail de soutien aux organisations de la société civile, nous sommes souvent confronté·es à des <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/" title="">suppositions que le numérique signifie mieux</a>, et que toute solution tech permettra d’accroître l’efficacité, l’efficience et l’impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mais ce n’est pas toujours le cas. Lorsque nous travaillons de manière plus intensive avec un·e partenaire, nous commençons souvent par évaluer comment son utilisation des technologies et des données correspond actuellement à son travail et à son contexte.&nbsp; Cela peut nous aider à comprendre comment, ou même si, la façon dont ils/elles utilisent la technologie renforce leur travail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Après avoir recensé les outils utilisés par l’organisation et les données collectées, stockées et partagées, nous passons à une deuxième série de questions : Quelle est l’utilité de tout cela (ou quelle pourrait être son utilité) dans le contexte de votre travail :&nbsp;</p>



 
 Quel est le problème social ou politique central sur lequel vous travaillez ?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Votre utilisation des technologies et des données vous soutient-elle dans la résolution de ce problème ? Si oui, comment ? Si non, pourquoi pensez-vous que cela pourrait se produire ?&nbsp; 



 Votre utilisation quotidienne des technologies et des données vous aide-t-elle à vous connecter avec des individus ou des organisations importants pour votre travail ? 



 La façon dont vous utilisez la technologie et les données a-t-elle un impact sur votre charge de travail ? Facilite-t-elle votre travail ou crée-t-elle une quantité de travail insoutenable pour l’équipe ? Aimez-vous utiliser vos outils organisationnels ?

 Prendre des décisions – s’assurer que les données et les technologies que vous utilisez correspondent à vos valeurs et à votre mission. 



 Q5. Comment prenons-nous les décisions concernant l’adoption de nouveaux outils et/ou la collecte de données ? 



<p>Il y a beaucoup de choses à prendre en compte lors du choix d’un outil, et il existe de nombreuses options, dont certaines que vous ne connaissez peut-être pas encore. Alors comment commencer à réduire (ou à élargir) vos options ?&nbsp;</p>



<p>En 2017, sur la base des recherches que nous avons menées sur la sélection d’outils dans les organisations de la société civile, nous avons créé un <a href="https://alidade.tech/" title="guide de sélection d'outils interactif nommé Alidade">guide de sélection d’outils interactif nommé Alidade</a>, qui fait passer les organisations par des questions pouvant les aider à décider du genre d’outil technologique qui correspondrait à leur projet ou à leurs besoins organisationnels. Nous vous recommandons de l’essayer !</p>



<p>En général, lorsque les organisations sont à la recherche de nouveaux outils technologiques, nous avons constaté que les lignes directrices suivantes sont utiles :</p>



<p>1. Faites des recherches sur les personnes, le problème, puis la technologie. Examinez le problème global pour lequel vous pensez qu’un outil technologique pourrait être utile. Pensez à votre public cible. Faites des recherches et examinez les différentes options technologiques disponibles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Réfléchissez à deux fois avant de construire. Recherchez les outils existants qui peuvent faire ce dont vous avez besoin. La création d’un outil entièrement nouveau peut être complexe et risquée.</p>



<p>3. Demandez un deuxième avis. Quelqu’un·e d’autre a probablement essayé une approche similaire avant vous. Trouvez-le·la et demandez-lui conseil.</p>



<p>4. Faites toujours un essai. Essayez au moins deux outils, avec les personnes que vous souhaitez voir les utiliser, avant de choisir. L’essai met en évidence les problèmes dès le départ. Il permet également de soulever des questions dont vous ne soupçonniez pas l’existence.</p>



<p>5. Prévoyez l’échec. Vous ne réussirez pas du premier coup. Prévoyez un budget et des ajustements réguliers de l’outil tout au long du projet.</p>



<p>6. Réfléchissez à ce que vous faites. Continuez à réfléchir à ce qui fonctionne et à ce qui ne fonctionne pas. Appliquez ce que vous apprenez au travail de votre organisation, et partagez avec d’autres organisations.</p>



<p>Assurez-vous que les outils que vous choisissez répondent également à vos besoins en matière de sécurité. Lorsque vous évaluez la sécurité d’un outil, prenez en considération ce qui suit :&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Quelle est la politique de confidentialité des données de l’outil ? Quel type de données l’outil collecte-t-il et avec qui ces données sont-elles partagées ? Qui a accès aux données stockées dans l’outil ?&nbsp; 



 L’approche de l’outil en matière de confidentialité et de sécurité est-elle bien documentée ? Que pouvez-vous découvrir sur le bilan de l’outil en matière de confidentialité et de sécurité ?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Documentez et discutez de vos conclusions avec vos collègues avant de prendre une décision finale sur un outil.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Questions connexes :<br>– <a title="">Devrions-nous également envisager d’utiliser davantage de technologie et de données dans notre travail ?</a><br>– <a title="">Comment mon équipe et moi-même pouvons-nous en apprendre davantage sur les technologies et leur pertinence pour notre travail ?</a></p>

<p></p>



 Q6 : Mon organisation souhaite intégrer de nouvelles technologies, mais nous n’avons pas trouvé le bon outil. Devrions-nous créer un nouvel outil nous-mêmes ? 



<p>Si vous connaissez bien notre travail, vous savez probablement que nous préconisons souvent d’adapter les outils existants à vos propres besoins lorsque cela est possible (nous appelons cela la “réutilisation des outils”).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Les recherches que nous avons menées dans ce domaine ces dernières années ont montré que la réutilisation et l’adaptation d’outils existants peuvent présenter un certain nombre d’avantages, comme une utilisation plus efficace des ressources financières et un meilleur accès à l’aide à la mise en œuvre et à la maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Créer un outil à partir de zéro, en revanche, peut être un processus long et coûteux en ressources, qui peut conduire à des déceptions : Nous avons vu comment les outils peuvent s’avérer inefficaces ou sous-utilisés, être étonnamment onéreux ou exiger des ressources intensives pour être maintenus ou mis à jour.</p>



<p>Mais si la fonctionnalité recherchée par votre organisation est tout simplement introuvable, et que vous envisagez de construire un nouvel outil, voici quelques questions auxquelles réfléchir :</p>



 
 Existe-t-il un besoin réel et identifiable pour cet outil ? Cela vous permettra-t-il de vous rapprocher de vos objectifs à long terme ? La construction d’un outil répondrait-elle à un besoin fort qui s’est manifesté dans votre travail, ou l’idée est-elle née d’autres manières ? 



 Disposez-vous des ressources nécessaires pour construire l’outil, l’entretenir sur le long terme et fournir un soutien continu à ceux/celles qui l’utiliseront ? 



 Quelle est votre vision de l’outil à long terme ? Les besoins ou les problèmes pour lesquels l’outil est construit pourraient-ils potentiellement évoluer avec le temps ?

<p></p>



 Q7. Comment puis-je utiliser les technologies/données si mon accès à Internet ou à l’électricité n’est pas fiable ? 



<p>Si vous êtes aux prises avec un accès intermittent à Internet, envisagez d’adopter des outils qui vous permettent de travailler à la fois en ligne et hors ligne. Dans Google Docs, par exemple, vous pouvez <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012?hl=pt-BR&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" title="activer l'accès hors ligne aux documents">activer l’accès hors ligne aux documents</a>. Cela vous permettra de poursuivre votre travail hors ligne, puis de synchroniser les documents une fois la connectivité rétablie. Certains outils de collecte et de gestion des données, tels que <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/" title="">Kobo ToolBox</a>, vous permettent également de collecter des données sur des appareils lorsque vous n’avez pas de connectivité, puis de les télécharger sur le serveur une fois le réseau disponible. Pour les réunions en ligne dans des environnements à faible connectivité, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/" title="">Mumble</a> est une option gratuite, open source et légère pour les appels audio uniquement.</p>



<p>Si le budget de votre organisation le permet, nous vous recommandons également d’investir dans une connexion de secours : par exemple, une connexion de réseau mobile à laquelle connecter vos appareils lorsque votre connexion haut débit n’est pas disponible.</p>



<p>Il y a deux façons de procéder : Utiliser un modem internet mobile, ou utiliser un smartphone dédié pour créer un hotspot mobile où d’autres appareils peuvent se connecter et partager la connectivité mobile. Voici un bref tutoriel sur la façon de <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915" title="créer un hotspot mobile sur un smartphone Android ">créer un hotspot mobile sur un smartphone Android</a>. Vous pouvez limiter la quantité de données utilisées en partageant le mot de passe d’accès avec les seuls appareils ou utilisateurs critiques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dans les cas où la connexion internet et/ou l’électricité sont intermittentes et que vous travaillez en ligne, veillez à sauvegarder votre travail aussi souvent que possible, afin de réduire le risque de perte de travail.&nbsp;<br>Si vous êtes souvent confronté·e à des pénuries d’électricité, l’acquisition d’un générateur de secours peut être une option utile, pour autant que vous disposiez des ressources organisationnelles nécessaires pour ce faire.</p>

 Q8. Comment puis-je travailler avec des développeurs·euses et/ou des technologues externes ? 



<p>Il existe de nombreux types différents d’expert·es externes avec lesquel·les vous pouvez travailler. Les types courants de consultant·es/expert·es externes qui interagissent avec la technologie ou les données comprennent :</p>



 
 Concepteur·trice d’expérience utilisateur·trice (UX) : Travaille à la fois avec les client·es (dans ce cas, c’est vous !) et les utilisateur·trices pour concevoir un produit qui satisfait des besoins multiples et qui est facile à comprendre et à utiliser.&nbsp; 



 Concepteur·trice visuel·le ou graphique : Supervise les éléments graphiques qu’un site web, un outil, une appli ou une publication utilisera, et est responsable de la conception de l’identité visuelle (ou branding). Il travaille souvent avec le/la designer UX pour s’assurer que l’identité visuelle fonctionne bien pour les utilisateur·trices, également. 



 Illustrateur·trice : Crée des illustrations, des icônes, des infographies et autres, qui vivront dans la structure plus large que le concepteur·trice visuel·le et le/la concepteur·trice UX ont créée. 



 Développeur·euse front-end : Met en œuvre le design sur un site web, un outil ou une application. En particulier, est capable de coder les aspects que les utilisateur·trices verront et avec lesquels ils/elles interagiront.&nbsp; 



 Développeur·euse back-end : Développe et connecte une base de données au front-end (les parties du site web, de l’appli ou de l’outil qu’un/une utilisateur·trice peut voir) et effectue toutes les tâches non visibles qui rempliront le front-end de contenu dynamique.&nbsp; 



 Analyste de données/scientifique : Extrait des modèles à partir de grands volumes de données. Il/elle peut également être équipé·e des outils et des connaissances nécessaires pour créer des visualisations de données afin de communiquer des modèles importants.  



 Sysadmin/DevOps : il/elle assure la maintenance des serveurs où vit le site web, l’outil ou l’appli. Il/elle est souvent chargé·e de coordonner le dépannage nécessaire si les utilisateur·trices rencontrent des bugs ou des erreurs. 
 



<p>Parfois, les rôles peuvent se chevaucher : par exemple, vous pouvez engager un/une consultant·e qui dirige la conception et le développement d’un site Web, ou un/une développeur·euse capable de travailler à la fois sur le front-end et le back-end.</p>



<p>Avant d’engager des développeur·euses et des technologues externes, il est utile d’/de :&nbsp;</p>



 
 Être clair·e sur les raisons pour lesquelles vous souhaitez construire ou adopter de nouveaux outils. 



 Identifier les ressources dont vous disposez et celles dont vous aurez besoin. 



 Se rappeler de planifier la maintenance à long terme.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Au début de votre travail commun, il est important d’établir un terrain d’entente et une terminologie partagée sur les besoins et les attentes. Nous recommandons d’élaborer un TdR (termes de référence) afin de documenter et de partager les besoins et les exigences du projet. Les TdR doivent couvrir au minimum les points suivants&nbsp;:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Le budget disponible pour le projet 



 Le calendrier nécessaire 



 Vos objectifs 



 Vos attentes à l’égard du/de la partenaire externe 



 Toute information supplémentaire 
 



<p>Vous devez également vous mettre d’accord sur les outils, les canaux de communication, les rôles et les responsabilités.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tout cela peut grandement contribuer à la réussite du projet dès le début. Voici quelques “choses à faire” lorsque vous travaillez avec des consultant·es une fois le travail en cours :&nbsp;</p>



 
 Se concentrer sur la clarté des objectifs organisationnels, des grands processus et des jalons afin de mieux soutenir l’équipe/le projet. 



 Fournir un retour d’information pertinent et opportun. 



 Offrez de l’espace et du respect pour l’expertise du/de la consultant·e. 



 Essayez d’être réactif·ve en matière de communication.

 Q9. Mon organisation effectue une grande partie de son travail en ligne, mais notre collaboration ne fonctionne pas toujours aussi bien. Comment pouvons-nous faire en sorte que la collaboration en ligne fonctionne mieux pour nous ? 



<p>Nous savons d’expérience que, lorsqu’il s’agit de collaborer en ligne, il est essentiel de trouver le bon moyen de communiquer, aussi bien pour le bon déroulement du travail que pour le bien-être général.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Idéalement, votre équipe disposera d’une sélection d’outils ou de canaux à utiliser (par exemple, un mélange d’applications de chat sécurisées, d’e-mails et d’outils de gestion de projet), mais il est important que chacun d’entre eux ait un rôle clair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Souvent, nos partenaires utilisent tellement d’outils différents qu’ils/elles se sentent dépassé·es chaque fois qu’ils/elles doivent partager un document, une idée ou un message. Si c’est le cas pour votre organisation, prenez le temps de noter rapidement tous les différents outils par lesquels les gens communiquent – il peut s’agir d’applications comme Signal et Whatsapp, de plateformes de messagerie comme Slack et Mattermost, de CRM en ligne comme Salesforce, d’outils de voix sur IP comme Skype, Zoom ou Jitsi Meet, et d’outils de collaboration comme Trello, Airtable, Asana et autres. Peut-être utilisez-vous également des SMS et des appels téléphoniques.</p>



<p>Une fois cette liste établie, nous vous suggérons de vous réunir avec vos collègues, ou les personnes avec lesquelles vous collaborez le plus souvent, pour convenir d’essayer d’utiliser moins d’outils. Attribuez à chaque outil un objectif spécifique : par exemple, le courrier électronique est peut-être destiné aux messages plus longs qui ne sont pas sensibles au facteur temps, ou au partage de documents, tandis que les programmes de messagerie sont réservés aux questions urgentes ou aux conversations amicales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Une fois que vous avez identifié quelques éléments qui fonctionnent, documentez-les ! La documentation permettra de s’assurer que tout le monde est sur la même longueur d’onde et constituera une excellente référence pour toute nouvelle personne rejoignant l’équipe ou pour rester au courant des processus/projets.</p>

 Centrer la sécurité et les soins 



 Q10 : Comment puis-je m’assurer que toute mon équipe utilise les outils (ou les processus de données) que nous avons choisis ? 



<p>Même lorsque nous sommes enthousiasmé·es par un nouvel outil technologique ou un nouveau processus d’utilisation des données, il est difficile d’adopter réellement de nouvelles méthodes de travail. En même temps, s’assurer que nous utilisons les outils convenus (et leurs protocoles de sûreté ou de sécurité) est un moyen important de faire preuve de bienveillance les uns/unes envers les autres dans les organisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>L’une des mesures à prendre pour s’aider mutuellement à adopter une nouvelle méthode de travail consiste à s’assurer que le nouvel outil ou protocole répond à un besoin concret et que chacun·e sait de quoi il s’agit. Ainsi, chacun·e sait qu’en s’investissant dans l’apprentissage du nouvel outil, il/elle se rapprochera d’une solution à un problème auquel il/elle est confronté·e.&nbsp;</p>



<p>En même temps, il est important de gérer les attentes – les changements peuvent se faire sentir petit à petit, au fil du temps, à mesure que les gens utilisent un outil ou un protocole et se familiarisent avec lui. Cela fait partie du processus.</p>



<p>Et, comme il s’agit d’un processus, il est bon de laisser de l’espace et du temps pour l’apprentissage, l’adaptation et la discussion lorsqu’un nouvel outil est déployé. En fonction de ce qui se passe par ailleurs, les capacités d’apprentissage de quelque chose de nouveau peuvent varier d’une équipe à l’autre, et laisser de l’espace peut être la meilleure façon de le reconnaître.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enfin, écouter les expériences de ceux/celles qui utilisent le nouvel outil peut vous aider à repérer les façons dont vous pourriez modifier l’outil lui-même si vous le pouvez, ou modifier la façon dont il est appliqué.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 Q11: Que pouvons-nous faire pour assurer la sécurité des personnes lorsque nous commençons à utiliser différents outils technologiques et pratiques de données ? 



<p>De nombreuses personnes avec lesquelles nous discutons sont curieuses de savoir comment intégrer la sécurité et les soins dans tout le travail qu’elles font- en particulier lorsqu’il s’agit de nouvelles initiatives en matière de technologie et de données. Les fuites de données et le piratage d’outils font la une de l’actualité, de nos communautés et de nos propres expériences, et l’adoption en toute sécurité d’outils ou de processus technologiques peut sembler décourageante.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Une approche qui peut aider à fournir des bases est celle des données responsables (<a href="https://responsibledata.io/" title="Responsible Data">Responsible Data</a>, en anglais) : l’idée que nous partageons un “devoir collectif de rendre compte des conséquences involontaires du travail avec les données”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voici quelques domaines à explorer qui relèvent de la notion de données responsables :&nbsp;</p>



 
 Des pratiques comme la minimisation des données (ne collecter que les données dont vous avez besoin). 



 Des concepts comme le consentement (s’assurer que les personnes sont en mesure d’accepter la manière dont leurs données seront utilisées de manière libre, spécifique, informée et révocable).&nbsp; 



 Des espaces connexes comme la sécurité organisationnelle (un riche domaine de pratique autour de l’établissement de protocoles qui peuvent contribuer à renforcer la sécurité des données/informations et le bien-être et la sécurité physiques). 
 



<p>Si vous n’êtes pas familier·ère avec ce type de pratiques, il existe des ressources qui peuvent vous aider, qu’il s’agisse de guides en ligne ou de l’assistance d’un praticien.&nbsp;</p>



<p>La sélection d’outils qui donnent la priorité à votre sécurité peut être une autre étape à franchir. Souvent, ces outils ne sont pas aussi largement utilisés que leurs homologues moins sécurisés, ce qui peut être l’occasion de consulter des pairs partageant les mêmes idées ou de contacter un/une technologue externe en qui vous avez confiance. Certains de ces outils pourraient inclure :</p>



 
 Les gestionnaires de mots de passe : La création de mots de passe forts et uniques est un élément fondamental pour utiliser la technologie de manière plus sûre. Les gestionnaires de mots de passe peuvent à la fois garder la trace de vos mots de passe et vous aider à créer de bons mots de passe. <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords" title="">En savoir plus ici</a>. 



 Des outils de communication plus sûrs : De nombreux messages que nous envoyons numériquement ne sont pas cryptés, ce qui signifie que si quelqu’un·e les interceptait, il/elle pourrait en lire le contenu. Les outils de communication plus sûrs offrent un cryptage, rendant plus difficile pour les personnes de lire le contenu de vos messages. <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures" title="Vous pouvez en savoir plus ici">Vous pouvez en savoir plus ici</a>, ou nous contacter pour obtenir un soutien sur l’adoption de nouveaux outils. 



 Les réseaux privés virtuels : Un VPN (réseau privé virtuel) est un outil qui peut contribuer à protéger votre activité sur le web contre la surveillance du réseau internet que vous utilisez. Choisir le bon VPN – et connaître ses limites – est crucial, et dépend du contexte dans lequel vous vous trouvez (dans quel pays vous vous trouvez, quel VPN vous choisissez, etc.) En même temps, choisir le bon VPN pour votre situation peut être complexe, alors <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you" title="rassemblez quelques informations ici">rassemblez quelques informations ici</a> et n’hésitez pas à nous contacter pour obtenir de l’aide.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Gardez toujours à l’esprit que la sécurité est un mélange d’outils et de pratiques. Il est important de disposer des bons outils, mais il est tout aussi important d’utiliser ces outils de la bonne manière et de mettre en place des pratiques internes solides autour de la sécurité en général, en tenant compte de la sécurité physique et psychologique également.</p>

<p>Before we get started, what do we mean by data? And technology? Odds are, you’re working with both!&nbsp;<br><br>We define data as information that needs to be processed, organised and structured for the sake of usability. In other words, by data we mean the information that you hold, such as details about the communities you work with, findings from research you have done, results from surveys, email addresses and contact information for supporters, and so on. <br><br>We understand technology as the tools, systems, methods and processes that capitalise on the computational power to manage, analyse and communicate information. For this resource, when we talk about technology, we mean digital tools, broadly. Anything from email platforms and messenger apps to website hosts, email newsletter platforms, CRMs, databases, algorithmic processes and more.</p>
  



  
 
 
   
 
 
  



  
 



 Frequently Asked Questions about Tech &amp; Data 
  



  
 Initial explorations – getting a feel for your own tech &amp; data landscape 



 
 Q1: <a>Our peers seem to be using more tech/data. Should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a> 



 Q2: <a>How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?</a> 



 Q3: <a>My organisation thinks it’s time to start using more tech and data in our work. Where do we start?</a> 



 Q4: <a>How can I make sure that the tech tools and data we’re using are actually useful for our work?</a> 
 



 Making decisions – making sure the data &amp; tech you use matches your values and mission 



 
 Q5: <a>How do we make decisions around adopting new tools and/or collecting data?</a> 



 Q6: <a>My organisation wants to integrate new tech but we haven’t found the right tool. Should we build a new tool ourselves?</a> 



 Q7: <a>How can I use tech/data if my access to the internet or to electricity is unreliable?</a> 



 Q8: <a>How do I work with external developers and/or technologists?</a> 



 Q9: <a>How can my organisation make online collaboration work better for us?</a> 
 



 Centering safety and care 



 
 Q10: <a>How can I make sure my whole team is using the tools (or data processes) that we’ve picked?</a> 



 Q11: <a>What can we do to keep people safer when we start using different tech tools and data practices?</a> 
 
  



 



 Initial explorations – getting a feel for your own tech &amp; data landscape 



 Q1: Our peers seem to be using more tech/data. Should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well? 



<p>The answer here will really depend on context. Tech can support you to organise daily work and operations, enable safer and more secure communication, collect and manage information, and cut costs and free up resources, among other things. But if used ineffectively or non-strategically, tech can also compromise your ability to do your work safely and effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if your organisation is collecting first-hand accounts of human rights violations in areas with low internet/mobile connectivity, adopting a data collection tool that requires an internet connection will make your work difficult and negatively impact your ability to carry out your mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Used non-strategically, tech can also expose you, and those you work with, to new vulnerabilities and risks. For instance, if you’re in a context where government surveillance of civil society is common and you’re using tools that don’t adequately protect your communications, that may compromise your work and safety.</p>



<p>To make sure that you use tech strategically and responsibly, take some time to think about how adopting new tech or collecting more data could strengthen or weaken your work. Before adopting any new tools or platform, try to build up your internal capacity, connect with peers or other organisations you respect.</p>

 Q2: How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?&nbsp; 



<p>Digital technologies evolve quickly, as do debates and conversations about the potential benefits and harms of using specific tools and platforms. When trying to learn more about tech, we find it’s most useful to focus on two things:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Work to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/how-to-think-about-tech-when-you-dont-have-time-to-think-about-tech/">slowly and incrementally build up staff technical intuition</a>, making it a team-wide priority as much as possible (as opposed to a one-person job). 



 Instead of looking for <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/understanding-people-before-creating-new-tech/">shiny new tools</a>, try to identify how tech and data could <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/reconnecting-with-your-purpose-reaching-for-impact/">strengthen your core work</a> first. 
 



<p>When it comes to new tools and applications, there is a lot of information online that can be enticing — but it can be hard to identify what is relevant to you, and what isn’t.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To more easily make sense of tech-related information, start with the challenge you’re trying to understand or address first. Additionally, if you can, reach out to like-minded practitioners who might have similar contexts or missions to yours and learn more about what tools they’re using (and what their successes and challenges have been!).&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



 Q3: My organisation thinks it’s time to start using more tech and data in our work. Where do we start?&nbsp; 



<p>First get a clear overview of what you’re already using! Most organisations are already using at least some tech and data to support their work – from day-to-day tools such as email or instant messaging, to CRM tools and databases. Below, is a short list of questions that can serve as an initial exercise to map the ways you’re using tech and data for your work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note: Some of the information you gather as part of this mapping exercise may be sensitive: before you start, make sure your notes are stored in a safe place and only shared with people who need access.</p>



 
 What tools are you currently using for your work?&nbsp;
 
 What platforms/tools do you and your team communicate with? These could include email, instant messaging, social media, SMS, and websites, to name a few. 



 How do you store and manage your files and documents? Which platforms do you use? Does everyone on your team use the same platforms? 



 Are you working on public campaigns or a part of collective efforts with other organisations? If yes, what tools do you use for activism, organising and community building? 



 Are you working with any databases or research platforms? 
 
 
 



 
 How are you using data?
 
 What type of data/information do you collect or generate day-to-day? Think about your individual and collective workflows and list the moments at which you collect or generate data. For example, collecting contact information for people you have interviewed, having discussions over email or Whatsapp, taking interview or meeting notes, or conducting surveys with communities. 



 Where do you store data? Consider the data you currently have and list all the places it lives (make sure to include all your remote locations – &nbsp;emails, shared documents, and so on).&nbsp; 



 When and how do you share data? Think about times when you need to share data: when does it usually happen, who do you share this with and what tools do you use? For example, you might be sending spreadsheets or PDFs over email, sharing documents and meeting minutes via Google Docs, or sharing passwords via a messaging app.&nbsp; 
 
 
 



<p>These are initial exploratory questions.&nbsp; For a complete version of this mapping exercise, see <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/becoming-rad-new-resource-for-organisations-who-want-to-develop-plans-for-retention-archiving-and-disposal/">Becoming RAD!</a> (published in 2021), or <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/">reach out to our team</a>.</p>



<p>Finally, adopting new tools takes time and resources. Make sure to give yourself and your team dedicated spaces to learn unfamiliar tools, practice behaviours and get up to speed with new data being used.</p>



<p>Related questions: <br>– <a title="Q1">Our peers seem to be using more tech/data, should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a><br>– <a>How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?</a></p>

<p></p>



 Q4: How can I make sure that the tech tools and data we’re using are actually useful for our work? 



<p>In our work supporting civil society organisations, we are often faced with <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/is-going-digital-the-answer/">assumptions that digital means better</a>, and that any tech solution will lead to increased efficiency, effectiveness and impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this isn’t always the case. When we’re working with a partner more intensively, we often start with an assessment of how their tech and data use currently maps on to their work and context.&nbsp; This can help us figure out how, or even if, the way they’re using tech is strengthening their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After mapping out what tools the organisation is using and what data is collected, stored and shared, we go through a second layer of questions: How useful is all of this (or how useful could it be ) in the context of your work:&nbsp;</p>



 
 What is the core social or political problem you are working on?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Is your use of tech and data supporting you in addressing that problem? If yes, how? If not, why do you think that could be happening?&nbsp; 



 Is your day-to-day use of tech and data helping you connect with individuals or organisations important to your work?

 Making decisions – making sure the data &amp; tech you use matches your values and mission 



 Q5. How do we make decisions around adopting new tools and/or collecting data?&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a lot to think about when selecting a tool, and there are many options out there – including many that you may not know about yet. So how do you start narrowing down (or expanding) your options?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2017, based on research we did on tool selection in civil society organisations, we created an <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/alidade-interactive-guide-for-finding-technology-tools/">interactive tool-selection guide called Alidade</a>, which takes organisations through questions that can help them decide what kind of technology tool would fit with their project or organisational needs. We recommend trying it out!.</p>



<p>In general, when organisations are looking for new tech tools, we have found the following guidelines to be beneficial:</p>



 
 Research the people, the problem, and then the technology. Look into the overall problem where you think a technology tool could help. Think about your intended audience. Do research and look at different options for what technology options are available.&nbsp; 



 Think twice before you build. Look for existing tools that can do what you need. Building a completely new tool can be complex and risky. 



 Get a second opinion. Someone else has probably tried a similar approach before you. Find them, and ask for advice. 



 Always take it for a test drive. Try out at least two tools, with the people you want to use it, before choosing. Trialling highlights problems at the start. It also raises questions you never knew you had. 



 Plan for failure. You will not get it right the first time. Budget and plan to make regular adjustments to the tool throughout the project. 



 Reflect on what you’re doing. Keep thinking about what is and isn’t working. Apply what you learn to your organisation’s work, and share with other organisations. 
 



<p>Make sure that the tools you choose also fit your security needs. When evaluating a tool’s security, consider the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 What is the tool’s data privacy policy? What kind of data does the tool collect and who is that data shared with? Who has access to any data stored within the tool?&nbsp; 



 Is the tool’s approach to privacy and security well-documented? What can you find out about the tool’s privacy and security record?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Document and discuss your findings with your colleagues before making a final decision on a tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Related questions: <br>– <a>Our peers seem to be using more tech/data, should we be looking at using more tech/data in our work as well?</a><br>– <a>How can my team and I learn more about tech and how it’s relevant to our work?&nbsp;</a></p>

<p></p>



 Q6: My organisation wants to integrate new tech but we haven’t found the right tool. Should we build a new tool ourselves? 



<p>If you are familiar with our work, you probably know we often advocate for adapting existing tools for your own needs where possible (we call this ‘tool re-use’).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our research in this area over the last few years has shown that re-using and adapting existing tools can have a number of advantages, like more efficient use of financial resources and increasing access to support in implementation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building a tool from scratch, on the other hand, can be a resource-consuming, lengthy process that can lead to disappointment: We’ve seen how tools can end up being ineffective or under-used, be unexpectedly costly, or demand intensive resources to be maintained or updated.</p>



<p>But if the functionality your organisation is looking for just can’t be found, and you are considering building a new tool, here are a few questions to reflect on:</p>



 
 Is there a real, identifiable need for this tool? Will this get you closer to your long-term goals? Would building a tool respond to a strong need that has come up in your work, or has the idea come about in other ways? 



 Do you have the resources needed to build the tool, maintain it over the long term and provide continued support to those who will be using it? 



 What is your vision for the tool over the long term? Could the needs or problems that the tool is being built to address potentially evolve over time?&nbsp;

 Q7. How can I use tech/data if my access to the internet or to electricity is unreliable? 



<p>If you are struggling with intermittent internet access, consider adopting tools that allow you to work both online and offline. In Google Docs, for example, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">enable offline access to documents.</a> This will allow you to continue with your work offline, and then sync documents once connectivity is restored. Some data collection and management tools, such as <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">Kobo ToolBox</a>, also allow you to collect data on devices when you have no connectivity and then upload data to the server once the network is available. For online meetings in low connectivity settings, <a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> is a free, open source and lightweight option for audio-only calls.</p>



<p>If your organisation’s budget allows for it, we also recommend investing in a backup connection: for example, a mobile network connection to connect your devices to when your broadband connection is not available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two ways to do this:&nbsp; Use a mobile internet modem, or use a dedicated smartphone to create a mobile hotspot where other devices can connect and share the mobile connectivity. Here is a brief tutorial on <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/use-your-android-phone-as-a-portable-wi-fi-hotspot-2377915">how to create a mobile hotspot on an Android smartphone</a>. You can limit the amount of data used by sharing the access password with only critical devices or users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In cases when the internet connection and/or electricity are intermittent and you are working online, make sure to save your work as frequently as possible, to minimise the risk of losing work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you experience electricity shortages often, acquiring a backup generator can be a useful option, as long as you have organisational resources to do so.</p>

 Q8. How do I work with external developers and/or technologists?&nbsp; 



<p>There are many different types of external experts you can work with. Common types of external consultants/experts who interact with technology or data include:</p>



 
 User experience (UX) designer: Works with both clients (in this case, that’s you!) and users to design a product that satisfies multiple needs and is easy to understand and operate.&nbsp; 



 Visual or Graphic Designer: Oversees the graphic elements that a website, tool, app or publication will use, and is responsible for designing the visual identity (or branding). They often work with the UX designer to make sure that the visual identity works well for users, too. 



 Illustrator: Creates illustrations, icons, infographics and more, which will live within the larger structure that the Visual Designer and UX Designer have created. 



 Frontend Developer: Implements the design on a website, tool or app. In particular, is able to code the aspects that users will see and interact with.&nbsp; 



 Backend Developer: Develops and connects a database to the frontend (the parts of the website, app or tool that a user can see) and does all the non-visible tasks that will fill the frontend with dynamic content.&nbsp; 



 Data Analyst/Scientist: Extracts patterns from large volumes of data. They may also be equipped with the tools and knowledge to create visualisations of data in order to communicate important patterns. 



 Sysadmin/DevOps: Maintains the servers where the website, tool or app lives. They’re often responsible for coordinating the troubleshooting necessary if users encounter bugs or errors. 
 



<p>Sometimes roles can overlap: for example, you could hire a consultant who leads the design and development of a website, or a developer who is capable of working on both the frontend and backend.</p>



<p>Before hiring external developers and technologists, it’s helpful to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Be clear about why you want to build or adopt new tools. 



 Identify the resources you have and those you will need. 



 Remember to plan for long-term maintenance.&nbsp; 
 



<p>At the beginning of your work together, it’s important to establish common ground and a shared terminology about needs and expectations. We recommend developing a ToR (Terms of Reference) in order to document and share project needs and requirements. The ToR should cover at minimum:</p>



 
 &nbsp;The available project budget 



 &nbsp;The necessary timeline 



 &nbsp;Your goals 



 &nbsp;Your expectations for the external partner 



 Any additional information 
 



<p>You should also agree on tools, channels for communication, and roles and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this can greatly contribute to project success early on. Some “do’s” when working with consultants once the work is underway are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Focus on clarity of organisational goals, big processes and milestones in order to better support the team/project. 



 Provide relevant and timely feedback. 



 Provide space and respect for the consultant’s expertise. 



 Try to be responsive with communications.

 Q9. My organisation does a lot of our work online, but our collaboration doesn’t always work so smoothly.&nbsp; How can we make online collaboration work better for us? 



<p>We know first hand that when it comes to collaborating online, finding the right way to communicate is essential – both to working smoothly and to overall well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, your team will have a selection of tools or channels to use (for example, a mix of secure chat apps, email and project management tools), but it’s important that each of these has a clear role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often, our partners are using so many different tools that they feel overwhelmed any time they need to share a document, idea or message. If this is the case for your organisation, take some time to quickly write down all the different tools people communicate through – it could include apps like Signal and Whatsapp, messaging platforms like Slack and Mattermost, online CRMs like Salesforce, VOIP tools like Skype, Zoom or Jitsi Meet, and collaboration tools like Trello, Airtable, Asana and others. Perhaps you also use SMS messages and phone calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you have this list, we suggest getting together with your colleagues, or the people you collaborate with most often, to agree to trying to use fewer tools. Assign each tool with a specific purpose: for example, perhaps email is for longer messages that aren’t time sensitive, or for sharing documents, whereas messaging programmes are only for urgent questions or friendly conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you’ve identified a few things that work, document it! Documentation will make sure that everyone is on the same page and will be a great reference for anyone new joining the team or for just remaining aware of processes/projects.</p>

 Centering safety and care&nbsp; 



 Q10: How can I make sure my whole team is using the tools (or data processes) that we’ve picked? 



<p>Even when we’re excited about a new tech tool or process for using data, actually adopting new ways of working is difficult. At the same time, making sure that we’re using the agreed-on tools (and their relevant safety or security protocols) is an important way in which we can practise care towards one another in organisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One step to take to help each other adopt a new way of working is to make sure the new tool or protocol responds to a concrete need and that everyone knows what that need is. This means everyone knows that by putting in the work to learn the new tool, they will be closer to a solution to an issue they’ve been facing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, it’s important to manage expectations – changes might be felt little-by-little, over time, as more people use a tool or protocol and get familiar with it. That’s part of the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, because it’s a process, it’s good to leave space and time for learning, adaptation and discussion when a new tool is rolled out. Depending on what else is going on, capacities for learning something new can vary across teams, and giving space can be the best way to recognise this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, listening to the experiences of those using the new tool can help you spot ways you might want to tweak the tool itself if you can, or tweak how it’s being applied.&nbsp;</p>

 <a>Back to the top</a> 
 



<p></p>



 Q11: What can we do to keep people safer when we start using different tech tools and data practices? 



<p>Many of the people we speak with are curious about how to incorporate safety and care in all the work they do – especially when it comes to new tech and data initiatives. As we see things like data leaks and hacked tools in the news, in our communities, and in our own experiences, safely adopting tools or tech processes can feel daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One approach that can help provide grounding is that of Responsible Data (RD): the idea that we share a “collective duty to account for unintended consequences of working with data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some areas to explore that fall under the RD umbrella are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Practices like data minimisation (only collecting the data you need). 



 Concepts like consent (ensuring that people are able to agree to how their data will be used in a freely-given, specific, informed and revocable way).&nbsp; 



 Related spaces like organisational security (a rich area of practice around setting protocols that can help build data/information security and physical well-being and security). 
 



<p>If you’re not familiar with these kinds of practices, there are resources that can help – from online guides to practitioner support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Selecting tools that prioritise your security can be another step to take. Often, these tools aren’t as widely used as their less-secure counterparts, so this could be an opportunity to consult with like-minded peers, or to contact an external technologist who you trust. Some of these tools could include:</p>



 
 Password managers: Creating strong, unique passwords is a fundamental part of using technology more safely. Password managers can both keep track of your passwords and help you create good passwords.&nbsp; <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">Learn more here</a>. 



 Safer communications tools: Many messages that we send digitally are not encrypted, meaning that if someone were to intercept them, they could read the contents. Safer communications tools offer encryption, making it harder for people to read the contents of your messages. You can <a href="https://documentation-tools.theengineroom.org/resources-key-considerations/#securityfeatures">learn more here</a>, or reach out to us for support on adopting new tools. 



 Virtual private networks: A VPN (virtual private network) is a tool that can help protect your web activity from surveillance on the internet network you’re using. Picking the right VPN – and knowing its limitations – is crucial, and depends on the context you’re within (what country you’re in, what VPN you choose, etc.). At the same time, choosing the right VPN for your situation can be complex, so <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you">gather some information here</a> and don’t hesitate to reach out to us for support.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Always keep in mind that security is a mix of both tools and practices. It’s important to have the right tools, but it’s just as important to use these tools in the right way, and to build strong internal practices around security in general, taking into account physical and psychological safety as well.</p>

     <p>This lecture took place on 26 October 2022. </p>
<p>When people talk about “killer apps,” they usually talk about a single monetization opportunity along the line of Web2 applications. The biggest drawback when it comes to Web2 is that a handful of companies hold an overwhelming majority of power and control over the internet which makes it very difficult for established organizations and newcomers alike to compete in that market. </p>
<p>MOBI and our partners are building a “killer technology” by using new global web standards to enable trusted, direct connections between parties; creating an even playing field for connected mobility and smart city applications. We call this the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/web3-infrastructure/">MOBI Technology Stack</a> (<a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia</a> and the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">ITN</a>), a Web3-enabled cooperative infrastructure enabling ecosystem stakeholders to:</p>

<p>The TRAC token is the utility token of the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph that is getting deployed on Polkadot through the OriginTrail dedicated Parachain. Becoming a token spanning both Polkadot and Ethereum ecosystems has enormous potential, particularly in the benefits offered by the latest generation of blockchain features in Polkadot, such as native cross-chain interoperability and extensibility beyond the VM&nbsp;level.</p><p>The aim of this RFC is to outline the details of different approaches to technical deployment of the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain and collect feedback from the OriginTrail community.</p> TRAC as a multi-chain token <p>Since its inception in January 2018, the TRAC token has been deployed as an ERC20 standardized token on the Ethereum mainnet blockchain as a limited supply, non-inflationary utility token fueling the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). Exactly 500 million TRAC have been created at the token generation event. Since then, the TRAC token has become crucial in enabling a variety of solutions used by notable global organizations as their data footprint constantly increases on the&nbsp;DKG.</p><p>As a two layer system, OriginTrail has always been based on two tokens — the TRAC token as the utility token of the OriginTrail DKG (Layer 2), and the gas token of the underlying blockchain used such as ETH, Matic and xDAI (Layer&nbsp;1).</p><p>Earlier this year the OriginTrail community provided strong support for the launch of <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/">OriginTrail specific blockchain on Polkadot — the OriginTrail Parachain</a>, with its native OriginTrail Parachain token (OTP) providing blockchain utility on layer 1. Additionally, apart from OTP providing “gas” utility, its tokenomics are designed to directly incentivize network activity in the OriginTrail ecosystem. More information on the interplay between OriginTrail DKG and blockchain layers <a href="https://parachain.origintrail.io/whitepaper">can be found in the whitepaper</a>, while detailed OTP tokenomics will be the subject of a separate&nbsp;RFC.</p> TRAC token deployment on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>With the launch of the OriginTrail Parachain, a highly scalable layer 1 blockchain tailored to the DKG has been successfully added to the OriginTrail ecosystem. This comes with the added benefit of native interoperability with the entire Polkadot ecosystem and any network adopting Polkadot’s communication standards.</p><p>Since the TRAC token is an Ethereum ERC20 token with significant adoption, it’s important to carefully consider its implementation in the new Polkadot ecosystem. In the previous request for comments <a href="https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/blob/main/RFCs/OT-RFC-12%20OriginTrail%20Parachain%20TRAC%20bridges%20(v2).pdf">OT-RFC-12 OriginTrail Parachain Bridges</a>, the use of a third party bridge was deemed unsafe and a final decision alongside the community was made to teleport TRAC using the pre-audited SFC smart contract.</p><p>Polkadot enables advanced blockchain functionalities and customizability, and with the launch of OriginTrail Parachain the OriginTrail ecosystem became a direct beneficiary of features such&nbsp;as:</p>  Cross-chain message passing via XCM enabling Parachains to send arbitrary messages between each other in a trustless manner using the Polkadot Relay chain. This not only enables easy token transfers, but also execution of any arbitrary logic between chains. This opens up room for many integrations across the ecosystem, e.g. a transaction on the OriginTrail Parachain could execute a token swap on the Acala parachain or extend assets available on Moonbeam. More information on XCM <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm">can be found&nbsp;here</a>.  Secure bridging between Parachains via the Relay chain, as well as strong, trustless bridges to other ecosystems built as parachains rather than multi-sig driven implementations, which have seen numerous hacks in the previous year. The OT-RFC-12 focuses specifically on this issue and the transitioning TRAC safely to the OriginTrail Parachain.  Extensibility through “pallets”, enabling forkless upgrades directly on chain level (as opposed to being confined to the EVM environment and needing to fork the entire chain), allowing customizations and advanced features tailored to the use case of every parachain. Many pallets already exist for features such as governance, staking,&nbsp;etc.  <p>More information on Polkadot features and implementation details can be found <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/getting-started">here</a>. With this RFC we present two distinct approaches of TRAC token implementation on the OriginTrail Parachain (and therefore, Polkadot).</p> OriginTrail Parachain TRAC Deployment requirements <p>The end goal of TRAC token deployment on the OriginTrail Parachain is to achieve the following requirements:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach: appropriate measures and planning has to be undertaken to maximize the ease of use and create a simple user experience of TRAC in order to not hinder the value propositions of the OriginTrail ecosystem.  R2 — Maximized security: special care must be taken to remove any unnecessary complexities and potential points of failure to ensure the TRAC token economy is robust and remains decentralized. This includes both the technical decisions and implementations, as well as decision making in an open, public discourse (such as through the OriginTrail RFCs).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability: ability to utilize TRAC token across the universe of Polkadot parachains and ecosystem tools (such as wallets), leveraging the innovations and value generated by the Polkadot ecosystem. This requires native Substrate integration through relevant pallets (such as the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-integrate-assets">Assets&nbsp;pallet</a>).  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility: TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain should remain compatible with existing Ethereum infrastructure and tooling, retaining its standard ERC20 form. To achieve this in the context of the Substrate runtime, a set of precompile contracts need to be deployed on the OriginTrail Parachain (to reach the EVM2.0 deployment).  R5 — Effective time of deployment: The time resources required for TRAC implementation to provide utility (in the context of achieving above requirements) should be reasonably low (and thus effective).  <p>In both proposed approaches, each of the above requirements will be graded with NOT SATISFIED, EVENTUALLY SATISFIED, PARTIALLY SATISFIED or FULLY SATISFIED.</p> Approach #1: Evolutionary deployment (from EVM1.0 to&nbsp;EVM2.0) <p>This approach would entail a transition from TRAC initially getting deployed as ERC20 token on the OriginTrail Parachain (indicated in scheme below as “Temp TRAC”), to reaching a Polkadot native TRAC deployment (“Full TRAC”) in the next step. This initial TRAC token would operate as a standard ERC20 token in the current EVM 1.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain (satisfying R4). However in such an environment, the token would not benefit from the additional features available from Polkadot technology (R3), and therefore would require a future token migration to a fully implemented TRAC in the EVM 2.0 environment on the OriginTrail Parachain.</p><p>The main advantage of such an approach would be the immediate availability of TRAC on OriginTrail Parachain as no updates to the current Parachain codebase are necessary (OriginTrail Parachain 1.0.x codebase versions). The main disadvantage of the approach is the need to perform a token migration once all features necessary for the Parachain native implementation have been put in place (1.1.x codebase versions). There are two general approaches to such token migration, both introducing a new set of challenges:</p>  User-performed migration (open ended): token holders would “swap” between the initial and fully fledged TRAC token versions through a “one-way bridge” contract, which would be responsible for minting “full TRAC” tokens. While satisfying criterion R4, this approach most likely leads to an “open ended migration” (both token implementations “living” on the OriginTrail Parachain for an undetermined period of time) as users could decide not to migrate for whatever reason, which is problematic in terms of Polkadot compatibility requirement (R3). Additionally, this approach requires significant adaptations to the implementation of OriginTrail DKG nodes which will have to manage working with both tokens simultaneously. The core developers assess this as the least favorable option with regards to time resource expenditure (criterion R5). Finally, the existence of two implementations for the same token would likely cause user experience hurdles for less tech-savvy users (e.g. asset publishers), creating problems in terms of requirement R1 and likely R2 due to additional complexity.  Developer-performed migration (close ended): in this option the core developers would retain the capability of “freezing” the “Temp TRAC” token contract implementation for a small amount of time in order to perform a “snapshot migration” from one contract to another (temp TRAC to full TRAC). This option removes some of the downsides of having two simultaneously living TRAC token implementations on the OriginTrail Parachain, however for the cost of necessarily pausing the operations of the entire TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain for the amount of time needed for migration. This particular approach would still require careful planning and execution from the entire ecosystem involved in the TRAC economy on the OriginTrail Parachain. It is estimated that this migration approach would require significant time expenditure from all actors in the community and is negatively assessed in the context of criterion R5, based on the experience in previous token staking and teleporting activities. Moreover, the pausing capability introduces a problematic component into the token implementation due to enabling additional powerful token control capability on the smart contract level (potential single point of failure), problematic in context of requirement R2 for the period of time until the migration to a native Polkadot implementation (full TRAC). Finally, even with developer lead initiative in this approach, it would still require effort and caution from the TRAC community which is not favorable in the context of requirement R1.  Approach #1: TRAC token migration path from EVM1.0 to EVM2.0 (1a involving the “Bridge” contract, 1b performing a snapshot transition)<p>Approach #1 in terms of defined criteria then can be assessed in the following way:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — as both approach #1a and #1b introduce the need to manage two implementations of the same token and require additional activity from all end users of the OriginTrail Parachain, especially in approach #1a which doesn’t have a time constraint on the token migration. Given that OriginTrail Parachain is a new environment (with new tools, such as wallets) the community is slowly getting accustomed to, having any additional friction is seen as problematic.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — While significant measures need to be taken to ensure safe transition between two token implementations, the approach does satisfy the security requirements as the process can be entirely based on smart contracts. However, additional steps and complexity inherently do add an additional risk component in the&nbsp;process.  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: EVENTUALLY SATISFIED — with the evolutionary approach TRAC would start as a “non-native” Polkadot asset. The additional features provided by Polkadot would only be available post-migration.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — in both approach #1a and #1b TRAC starts as an ERC20-compatible token.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — in order to reach the fully deployed state of TRAC on Polkadot, a significant time investment would be required to plan and execute the migration activities in detail, both by the core developers as well as by the OriginTrail community (estimated at several months). The partially satisfied grading of the requirements stems from the fact that it allows immediate deployment of the (non-Polkadot) version of TRAC tokens as no additional updates to the OriginTrail Parachain are&nbsp;needed.   Approach #2: Direct Polkadot-native deployment (EVM 2.0&nbsp;only) <p>The second approach would be to avoid the deployment of the TRAC token contract in the EVM1.0 environment (Parachain version 1.0.x) entirely, and proceed to direct Polkadot native deployment of TRAC tokens. With such an approach, the TRAC token would from the get-go have all of the benefits offered by Polkadot (as listed above) and would minimize the necessary coordination required by the migration activities detailed in approach #1, all of which would benefit from a better user experience and less friction.</p>Approach #2: TRAC token immediate deployment to EVM2.0 Parachain environment<p>This approach is favorable with regards to all requirements presented above:</p>  R1 — Human centric approach — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — since only one TRAC token deployment would ever exist on the OriginTrail Parachain there would be no migrations or potentially difficult operations the TRAC community would need to&nbsp;perform.  R2 — Maximized security — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — higher security is achieved through minimizing complexity and need of coordination (compared to approach&nbsp;#1).  R3 — Native Polkadot interoperability — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — advanced Polkadot features will be available immediately from the moment of token deployment, as the token will be deployed as a Polkadot&nbsp;asset.  R4 — Retained Ethereum compatibility — grade: FULLY SATISFIED — the TRAC token implementation will be performed in such a way that, apart from being a Polkadot asset from the Substrate perspective, it will remain an ERC20 standardized token from the EVM perspective.  R5 — Effective time of deployment — grade: PARTIALLY SATISFIED — even though approach 2 is not entailing the immediate deployment of TRAC on the OriginTrail Parachain, we estimate that significantly lower amount of resources are required for a fully fledged TRAC implementation in approach #2 (compared to approach #1), from both the development team and the TRAC community, due to no migration activities and code adaptations required from the DKG node side. The estimated deployment time is under 1&nbsp;month.  <p>Due to the dynamics presented above, approach #2 is the preferred option of the core development team.</p> Bridging TRAC to other ecosystems <p>Due to Polkadot’s native interoperability features, once implemented, the TRAC token will be available to the entirety of Polkadot and its parachains, as the Relay chain acts as a de facto bridge between Polkadot parachains. This will open up new opportunities for both the token holders as well as builders in the ecosystem to deploy OriginTrail in ways previously not&nbsp;seen.</p><p>The implementation of trustless bridges to other blockchain ecosystems is an ongoing effort of multiple teams and has been discussed in the previous OT-RFC-12. The necessary preparation and discussions with ecosystem developers and Parity have been ongoing in anticipation of the bridge deployment between Ethereum and Polkadot, as indicated in the scheme&nbsp;above.</p> Conclusion <p>This RFC presents the requirements and approaches to implementing the TRAC token on the OriginTrail Parachain, including the details of their execution according to the requirements. As core developers we invite the wider OriginTrail community to provide feedback and comments in the dedicated discussion on the OriginTrail RFC repository.</p><p>👇 More about OriginTrail 👇</p><p><a href="https://origintrail.io/">Web</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail">OriginTrail Twitter</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/OT_Parachain">OriginTrail Parachain Twitter</a> | <a href="https://facebook.com/origintrail">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://t.me/origintrail_info">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://linkedin.com/company/origintrail/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://github.com/origintrail">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/FCgYk2S">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-13-trac-token-deployment-on-polkadot-c709347583cc">OT-RFC-13 TRAC Token deployment on Polkadot</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/origintrail">OriginTrail</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), the research and development arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, today announced the launch of a program that seeks to engineer novel artificial intelligence technologies capable of attributing authorship and protecting authors’ privacy (Linguistic Fingerprint Technology).</p>



<p>The Human Interpretable Attribution of Text Using Underlying Structure (HIATUS) program represents the Intelligence Community’s latest research effort to advance human language technology. The resulting innovations could have far-reaching impacts, with the potential to counter foreign malign influence activities; identify counterintelligence risks; and help safeguard authors who could be endangered if their writing is connected to them.</p>



<p>The program’s goals are to create technologies that:<br></p>



  Perform multilingual authorship attribution by identifying stylistic features — such as word choice, sentence phrasing, organization of information — that help determine who authored a given text.  Protect the author’s privacy by modifying linguistic patterns that indicate the author’s identity.  Implement explainable AI techniques that provide novice users an understanding, trust, and verification as to why a particular text is attributable to a specific author or why a particular revision will preserve an author’s privacy.  



<p>“Each of the selected performers brings a unique, novel, and compelling approach to the HIATUS challenge,” said program manager Dr. Tim McKinnon. “We have a strong chance of meeting our goals, delivering much-needed capabilities to the Intelligence Community, and substantially expanding our understanding of variation in human language using the latest advances in computational linguistics and deep learning.”</p>



<p>Through a competitive Broad Agency Announcement, IARPA awarded HIATUS research contracts to the following lead organizations, which together bring more than 20 academic institutions, non-profits, and businesses into the program:<br></p>



  Charles River Analytics, Inc.  Leidos, Inc.  Raytheon BBN  SRI International  University of Pennsylvania  University of Southern California  



<p>The HIATUS test and evaluation team consists of Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Pacific Northwest National Labs, and the University of Maryland Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security.</p>



<p>IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research programs to tackle some of the most difficult challenges of the agencies and disciplines in the Intelligence Community.

 💼 + 🤗 =&nbsp;🚀 <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed-use-cases/">the draft</a> Verifiable Credentials for Education, Employment, and Achievement Use Cases report was published. It’s worth a read for anyone interested in Open Badges, microcredentials, or certification. The next version of the Open Badges specification (v3.0) will be compatible with Verifiable Credentials (VCs). One thing to note about VCs is that they don’t have to have a visual representation in the form of an&nbsp;image.</p><p>The use cases provided in the report are interesting, and Verifiable Credentials promise to solve many seemingly-intractable problems around how individual people can prove claims in privacy-respecting ways. What we noted, however, especially given our work around <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/what-is-open-recognition-anyway-9f38ec1f8629">Open Recognition</a>, is that there are some use cases that are likely to be transformational to learners and workers in the future of work. Both groups need control over the way that they are recognised to unlock future opportunities.</p><p>For example, the report talks about the recognition of prior learning, something which is an equity issue for those who haven’t had the same access to resources than&nbsp;others:</p><blockquote>Josephina decided to return to college to finish her bachelors degree. The college she attended evaluated her work experience and determined that skills and knowledge that she attained while working qualified to replace several of the courses required for the&nbsp;degree.</blockquote><p>There are countries and systems where recognising prior learning is a normal part of the learning landscape. Even in these cases, however, the aim of the activity is to assess whether an individual has met the criteria for admission to a course or institution. What VCs allow is for recognition to be turned into a credential, and therefore used as ‘currency’ not just to be ‘spent’ at that institution, but potentially anywhere.</p><p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf">original vision</a> for Open Badges was to create an “open and decentralized [ecosystem] to allow for badges from any contexts where learners are learning, to support any and all types of learning occurring, to provide portable and sustainable value and to give each learner complete control”.</p><a href="https://bryanmmathers.com/issuing-open-badges/">Issuing Open Badges</a> by <a href="https://visualthinkery.com/">Visual Thinkery</a> is licenced under&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/">CC-BY-ND</a><p>The key word here is control. Although a lot of learning happens in formal education institutions, a lot of learning happens on the job through informal and non-formal learning. So how can VCs work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_career">portfolio careers</a>, in a world where people change jobs relatively often and need to take proof of their learning with&nbsp;them?</p><p>We suggest that there are the following three examples where VCs can play an important role in Open Workplace Recognition (i.e. Open Recognition in the workplace):</p>  Recognition of prior learning — as discussed above, this is a way to translate knowledge, skills, and experience gained on the job into credentials that can be used more widely. This depends on an authority (the ‘Issuer’) assessing a portfolio of evidence about a person (the ‘Subject’), who will then also be able to use the VC as proof of their claim (i.e. also be the ‘Holder’).  Defining your own path — no two careers are ever the same, yet the way we present them can often be far too similar. VCs issued for the recognition of niche (or even unique!) things such as knowledge, skills, experience, and dispositions allows individuals to better tell their own story. One way of doing this would be to self-issue a VC (the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) and then have someone else, or an organisation, endorse that&nbsp;claim.  Making recognition portable — combining the other two points, an individual may want to memorialise a particular important form of recognition they have received. This could be a tweet, a comment in an email, or anything that they want to be able to refer to in future. By self-issuing a VC (again, the ‘Subject’ and ‘Holder’ is also the ‘Issuer’) they can ask the person who gave the recognition to endorse their&nbsp;claim.  <p>The purpose of standards, and the working groups which create them, is necessarily to focus on the technical elements and most common use cases. With this post, we want to widen the conversation to consider what VCs make possible that is entirely new, and that which was perhaps always latent in Open&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>Using a lens of Open Workplace Recognition allows us to focus about the norms, behaviours, and expectations within the world of work. We can then go a step further to think about who controls what is recognised, by whom, and how that recognition can be shared more&nbsp;widely.</p><p>What other examples for Open Workplace Recognition using VCs can we come up with together?</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/open-workplace-recognition-using-verifiable-credentials-fc0134fad7ec">Open Workplace Recognition using Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We asked our Executive Director, Kay Chopard, for her thoughts and learnings from working through the first phase of the UK Digital Identity &amp; Attributes Framework (DIATF):</p>



<p>“It is nearly 7 months since<a href="https://www.ukas.com/resources/latest-news/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-pilot/"> UKAS announced the 5 organisations</a> that would certify Identity Service Providers (IDSPs) against the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> under an initial assessment program.</p>



<p>Digital identity and the provision of trusted credentials will be a vital component in the delivery of future public – and private – services. Through our global identity certification work, we observe first-hand just how quickly the digital identity market is growing. We have been certifying an increasing number of IDSPs against global standards as opportunities for digital identity expand and I’ve noticed, especially, the drive from sectors where identity verification is NOT mandated by regulation – for instance in healthcare.  At Kantara Initiative, we have been running identity assessment programs across the world for nearly 15 years.&nbsp; In the UK, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks/digital-identity-certification-for-right-to-work-right-to-rent-and-criminal-record-checks#list-of-certified-idsps">17 identity proofing organisations have now been certified to provide services within the Framework</a>. To support this growth, I believe we should consider the following points:</p>



<p>Future-proofing the identity ecosystem</p>



<p>We have been proud to work with the Department of Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS), UKAS and our certification clients over the past 6 months as the DIATF has moved from the Alpha to Beta phase. Organisations that were certified in the first few months were assessed against the Alpha version of the framework. Our certification clients, however, are assessed against the Beta version of the DIATF as this is already much more robust and includes more fully defined assessment criteria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the program continues to evolve we will identify further assessment criteria that will be vital to roll out robust, trusted, identity solutions that will work for future use cases. Our auditors are dedicated identity specialists with experience across multiple sectors. They have shared with me that the DIATF will continue to benefit from the experiences of other programs across the world – what has worked and what hasn’t.&nbsp; This is vital, especially if we are to support those identity organisations that are planning for international expansion. The UK’s DIATF cannot exist in geographic isolation; individual customers and citizens will eventually require a digital identity that is portable. The DIATF should support organisations in providing this.</p>



<p>One size doesn’t fit all</p>



<p>This first wave of assessments has shown very quickly that each certification client operates quite differently and so a simple “tick box” approach to assessment will not work. We are often asked for a fixed price for our certification services, but I would argue that a fixed price indicates a fixed approach – and a fixed mindset. The underlying assessment criteria must, of course, be met consistently. But each organisation operates differently, and the Kantara ‘modular’ approach ensures each element of the process can be audited in line with requirements AND the business’ operating model. This also supports DCMS’ current model of having separate use cases. As new cases come online, we will continue to add in new assessments that support growth.</p>



<p>Challenge through collaboration</p>



<p>We are a not-for-profit organisation. While commerciality is an important focus, it is more significant that we continue to develop our understanding of emerging trends and issues across all markets. We have been encouraged by the response of parliamentarians, digital identity industry leaders, influencers and media to the Kantara approach and we have appointed a number of key assessors who bring with them experiences of specific sectors, territories and regulatory environments.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Most recently, the appointment of Emma Lindley MBE, Alison McDowell and Andrew Hindle to our UK Advisory Board was a deliberate move to ensure we continue to be challenged and stay abreast of the issues our clients face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our role on the Kantara UK Advisory Board is to provide independent thinking and guidance to Kantara’s UK team. As a UK citizen who has worked in the identity sector for over 20 years, I believe we can help ensure the customer is constantly “in the room” and at the heart of any discussions around the future of the digital identity framework.”  (Andrew Hindle, Kantara UK Advisor, Content Chair at Identiverse and Founding Board Member at IDPro.). </p>



<p>“There is now a clear vision for a digital identity market that is both open and competitive. The DIATF is intended to create choice, improve quality and increase innovation – ultimately improving customer experiences for the UK citizen and reducing the cost for UK PLC. Kantara Initiative has a vital role to play in delivering this vision.” (Emma Lindley MBE, Co-Founder of Women in Identity and MD, International Expansion, at CAF) </p>



<p>Going forward, we believe it is vital that certification bodies continue to work with DCMS and UKAS in a spirit of partnership – bringing together the cumulative value of dozens of great minds! To this end, we have&nbsp; been encouraged by the proactive approach of DCMS in creating forums where the 5 certification bodies can discuss ideas and feedback on the program in action.</p>

<p>Verifying identities and information in a digital world is critical for establishing trust. But there are issues of privacy as well as efficiency, scale and accuracy in models that rely on centralized data collectors and databases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The adoption of a new generation of digital identity solutions that leverage decentralized technologies such as distributed ledgers and verifiable credentials is accelerating. And Hyperledger technologies are playing a major role in this transformation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on for a cross section of the many Hyperledger-powered solutions that are in production now. For other examples, check out these past #HyperledgerIdentity round-ups:</p>



  <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/04/29/hyperledger-powered-digital-identity-solutions-at-work">Hyperledger-Powered Digital Identity Solutions at Work</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/04/30/identity-applications-in-action-powered-by-hyperledger">Identity Applications in Action &amp; Powered by Hyperledger</a>  



<p>IBM Digital Health Pass</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass">IBM Digital Health Pass</a>, built on<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric"> Hyperledger Fabric</a>, offers a multi-credential verifier that organizations can use to manage and execute their verification policies for COVID-19 and vaccination status in a way that balances the privacy of the individual with the requirements set by the organization and local health authorities. With IBM Digital Health Pass, organizations can verify multiple types of health credentials, such as Good Health Pass, IBM Digital Health Pass, Smart Health Card and EU Digital COVID Certificate. Privacy is central to the solution, where the verifier application minimizes the personal data that is ever displayed to the user through the execution of business rules and it never lets any personal data leave, or be stored in, the verifier app.</p>



<p>Indicio Network&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a> is a collection of four professionally-staffed, enterprise-grade public-permissioned ledgers that provide a neutral, independent, and reliable network for the exchange of verifiable credentials. <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">MainNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">DemoNet</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">TestNet</a>, and <a href="https://indicio.tech/deploy-your-own-private-network-for-critical-performance-testing/">TempNet</a> are all Hyperledger Indy-based networks with nodes operating on five continents—and a growing number of node operators. The Indicio Network is one of the networks that can support <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a>, a complete suite of decentralized identity components for authenticating and sharing high value data in a privacy-preserving way using verifiable digital credentials. Built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>, as well as AnonCreds and DIDComm, Proven is designed to make implementing and using these open source codebases simple, providing users with a fully-owned solution that’s easy to integrate with existing systems, to innovate on, and to scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDUnion&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDUnion</a>, the European identity verification network created as part of the “Secure Digital Identities Showcase” funding project, brings together public institutions, government agencies, private organizations, associations, educational institutions and other stakeholders from various fields to enable a fundamentally new, secure digital infrastructure for the verification of identity information. In August, 2022, IDUnion spun off Sociedad Cooperativa Europea (SCE) to operate the production network for credential verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IDUnion network, which is built on <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>, enables the clear verification of individuals, companies and institutions while allowing people and organizations to manage their identity information by themselves and to decide when they want to share this information and with whom. It has a decentralized structure and stores no personal data – not even as a hash. In order to protect privacy right from the start, all personal data is stored on the user’s end device. Users have a choice of wallets for storing and presenting credentials to third parties as required. Credentials are issued, verified and stored using open standards to ensure interoperability. Hyperledger Aries is the framework for managing the credentials.</p>



<p>NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</p>



<p>In 2019, the NHS was preparing to pilot a digital passport project that would allow staff to carry their HR and other records as credentials on their phones as a long-term plan to make it easier to transfer from one facility to another. When the pandemic hit, this went from a pilot to a production deployment quickly. The <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/">NHS Covid-19 Digital Staff Passport</a> rolled out in summer to support swift and efficient staff movement between NHS organizations in response to the response health emergency. The COVID-19 Digital Staff Passport provided a solid legal framework for staff to be temporarily deployed into other NHS organizations with evidence available that checks have been completed before staff move. As laid out in the pilot, the information was transferred securely by the staff member as verified credentials stored on their own smartphone, putting them in control.</p>



<p>This staff passport used the <a href="https://sovrin.org/overview/">Sorvin Network</a>, which is built on Hyperledger Indy, to verify the digital credentials, and the Evernym (now Avast) <a href="https://connect.me/">Connect.me</a> digital wallet app, which is powered by Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, to enable staff to store and share their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The NHS is now gearing up to roll out the <a href="https://beta.staffpassports.nhs.uk/whats-next.htm">next generation</a> of its Digital Staff Passport, which will streamline transfers and staff movements through the NHS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBook BC&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/search">OrgBook BC</a> is a searchable public directory of organizations registered in British Columbia, Canada, provided by the BC Government’s Ministry of Citizens’ Services. OrgBook BC provides verified data, including legal names and DBA names, business numbers, BC registration status and select licensee and permits, for more than 1.4 million organizations. All of the information in the OrgBookBC is received, stored, verified and displayed using the latest digital trust technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC uses verifiable credentials to ensure that information about organizations are digitally signed by the entity that issues it. Issuers are public sector organizations that hold information about businesses, issue licenses or permits or certify processes. That electronic signature stays with the data throughout its life in OrgBook and is validated before its is display on the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OrgBookBC is part of an overall commitment to digital trust technologies by the Government of British Columbia. In addition to deploying Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa, the team there is leading much of the open source development for those projects. Read more on the Government of BC’s investment in verifiable credentials and digital wallet technologies <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2022/08/23/investing-in-verifiable-credentials-technical-interoperability-and-open-source">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>     <p>The passport you carry to travel from one country to another not only serves to prove your identity but also allows international authorities to query and verify information about you from multiple databases. A physical passport is nothing but a presentation of data points that customs officers use to confirm your identity when deciding whether to permit you to cross a certain border. In order to make international travel more seamless, countries often work together to standardize the format and contents of the physical passports issued to residents. </p>
<p>Similarly, a <a href="https://dlt.mobi/battery-passport">battery passport</a> is nothing but a presentation of data points about a particular battery – who manufactured it, its physical and chemical composition, its current state of health, whether it was refurbished or repurposed from another battery, and so on.</p>
<p>The battery passport has many uses. For example, regulators can reference a battery passport to verify whether that particular battery is composed of an adequate proportion of recycled material. Likewise, battery passports enable battery owners to query their battery’s state of health.</p>
                    <p>Battery passports can be implemented as a barcode or QR code or in RFID chip the same way our travel passports are equipped with barcodes or long strings of alphanumeric characters, similar to the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/standards/">Battery Identification Number Standard</a> released by MOBI in July 2022.</p>
<p>The barcode or QR code on a battery passport needs to retrieve information about the battery from some digital source. That digital source about the battery can be either a centralized location maintained by some entities or in the battery itself or some combination thereof. This is not very different from the fact that our travel history, medical records, etc. are stored in databases mostly maintained by governments.</p>
<p>This is where Battery Self-Sovereign Digital Twin (SSDT) comes in.</p>
                    <p>Battery Self-Sovereign Digital Twin Digital Storage for Battery Information</p>
<p>The battery SSDT is where the information about a battery resides. Conceptually, the battery SSDT can store and receive information about the battery from outside sources, respond to internal and external queries, and verifiably assert its identity and the information it stores/presents. What is unique about the battery SSDT is that an outside issuing entity is not required, unlike travel passports that are issued by our governments. Because the battery SSDT leverages self-sovereign identity, the battery can assert its own identity with the help of an external trust anchor.</p>
<p>The battery SSDT includes information about the battery’s owner, birth certificate, material and component attributes, maintenance history, warranty and recall logs, charging history, state of health, and may even have the capability to issue payments for services performed on the battery.</p>
<p>Battery SSDTs are onboarded and managed via <a href="https://dlt.mobi/citopia/">Citopia</a>, a federated Web3 marketplace for business automation and trustless multiparty track-and-trace.</p>
<p>The controller of the battery SSDT can participate in seamless transactions (including data sharing) by issuing Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations per <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C’s VCs Standard</a>. Citopia leverages zero-knowledge proofs and other advanced cryptographic methods to give users control over who sees their data and how that data is used.</p>
<p>SSDTs on Citopia are linked to a trust anchor such as the <a href="https://dlt.mobi/itn/">Integrated Trust Network (ITN)</a> using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) per <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C’s DIDs Standard</a>. Both Citopia and the ITN are member-owned and operated.</p>
                    <p>The Battery SSDT is Key to Battery Traceability</p>
<p>Traceability of battery origin, production, usage, recycling/repurposing, and more is vital to ensuring compliance with various regulatory requirements (e.g., <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2022/729285/EPRS_ATA(2022)729285_EN.pdf">EU Battery Regulation</a>, <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/draft%20zev%20warranty%201962.8.pdf">CARB</a>), meeting environmental and social goals, improving warranty management, and many more. The battery SSDT provides information about the battery to a third party using the Battery Passport as a credential. In addition to holding the physical attributes of the battery, the battery SSDT also stores traceability-related data in its encrypted data vault. Because traceability data will come from multiple sources (entities), the battery SSDT will ensure the verifiability of such data by linking the identity of the entities to a trust anchor.</p>

<p>This update provides additional insights on the results of the “snapshot” mechanism currently being used to track the consistency of staked Energy Web Tokens (EWT) in the Consortia staking pool. Patrons staking EWT can use the tools provided at <a href="https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/">https://consortia-stake-ewt.io/</a> to check the status of their wallets and snapshots if applicable.</p> Snapshots and Variable EWT&nbsp;rewards <p>We published <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-ewt-consortia-relay-staking-snapshots-insights-32675cdd20db">this blog post</a> that includes a detailed technical analysis of the previous 2 snapshots, together with an explanation of the snapshots mechanism and variable staking rewards. To summarize the mechanics, the Energy Web Consortia staking pool tracks the consistency of staking by taking snapshots of staking balances at random points in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Users who stake consistently, based on the snapshot date, will earn additional rewards from the staking pool. The additional rewards are designed to incentivize consistent staking, as EWT staking will be a major contributor to the cybersecurity of upcoming Energy Web solutions for enterprises.</p> Snapshot 3 Balance&nbsp;Analysis <p>Snapshot 3 was taken on block #<a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/block/19190154/transactions">19190154</a> generated on July 29th at 09:24:50 PM +2 UTC. At this block, there were 6,822 wallets staking, which is 181 more wallets compared to Snapshot 2 and 414 more compared to Snapshot 1. The total balance of all EWT staked in the pool was equal to 6,047,363 EWT, an increase of 316,401 EWT compared to Snapshot 2 and 506,775 EWT more than at Snapshot&nbsp;1.</p><p>Here are the balances of Snapshot 3 (in green), 2 (in orange), and 1 (in blue). Wallets on the bottom, balance on the vertical&nbsp;axis:</p><p>The green spikes are wallets adding more EWT between snapshots 1 and 3. The dips are wallets withdrawing EWT. On the far right of the chart, there are green lines and no blue lines: these are the completely new wallets that didn’t participate in snapshots 1 or&nbsp;2.</p><p>During Snapshot 3, there were 181 more wallets staking EWT compared to Snapshot 2, and 414 more wallets compared to snapshot 1. Interestingly, there are 5 wallets that were staking EWT during Snapshot 1, withdrew their stake during snapshot 2, and are now staking during snapshot&nbsp;3.</p><p>Here’s the balance distribution comparison between snapshot 1, 2, and 3 balances. Bounds on the bottom, number of wallets in each category on the vertical&nbsp;scale:</p><p>We can see a slight increase in each category, except for the &lt;1,500–2,500) bound. The highest increase in staking occurred in the highest, &lt;2,500–3000&gt; bound: 84 new wallets staked between 2,500 and 3,000 ETW. For comparison, there were only 42 additional wallets staking under 500&nbsp;EWT.</p> Snapshot 3&nbsp;insights <p>EWT staking in the Consortia pool continues to be consistent, which is exactly the intention behind the design of the snapshot mechanism. This is evidenced by the balance distribution of all snapshots and <a href="https://explorer.energyweb.org/address/0x181A8b2a5AEb25941F6A79b4aE43dBb1968c417A/coin-balances#address-tabs">EWT balances in the staking contract</a>:</p><p>Such consistent staking will provide a high degree of economic cybersecurity to all enterprise-grade Energy Web solutions (for more information on the connection between consistent staking, cybersecurity, and Energy Web solutions, <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/securing-the-energy-transition-with-the-energy-web-consortia-relay-chain-fb01d5cbabda">please review our announcement on the upcoming Consortia chain</a>).</p><p>Before the end of the year, there will be 3 more Snapshots taken at random blocks. Patrons who receive at least 1 Snapshot will qualify for additional rewards. The rewards will be calculated and distributed after the Consortia staking pool ends. Again, since variable rewards are impossible to predict, the best strategy for all patrons is to stake as high a balance as possible and do so consistently.</p><p>Also read: <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/energy-web-token-ewt-consortia-relay-staking-snapshots-insights-32675cdd20db">Energy Web Token (EWT) Consortia Relay Staking Snapshots Insights part&nbsp;1</a></p><p>About Energy Web<br>Energy Web is a global non-profit accelerating the clean energy transition by developing open-source technology solutions for energy systems.

<p>Imagine being lost in the woods or walking down a dusty road with only the clothes on your back. What would you do? Thankfully, most of us have never had to ask this question and we should consider ourselves lucky. Unfortunately, this is the plight facing over 100 million people on Earth right now, including 13 million Ukrainians who have been forced to run for their lives to escape the horrible atrocities of war.</p>



<p>As well, millions have fled their communities to find refuge in more stable parts of their country. These people are called Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). And of course, millions of others have left their countries entirely and have become Refugees.</p>



<p>Convenience for us, Lifesaving for others</p>



<p>Most Refugees and IDPs did not have the time to properly prepare by gathering all their important documents such as passports, identity cards, driver’s licenses, and land titles or rental agreements. Fleeing your home may save your life, but fleeing without identity documents can lead to a very long wait – sometimes a decade or more – before your life is stable again. Imagine desperately trying to assert your identity to an overwhelmed volunteer who may not speak your language, hoping to convince them you actually exist.Your have lost your idenitty and you have to beg to be found.</p>



<p>Let’s say the conflict is over, you manage to convince an official who you are, and it’s finally time to go home. Upon return, you find that your house or rental flat has been destroyed, or some stranger is living there with a shiny new land title or rental agreement proclaiming they are the rightful owner.</p>



<p>It has taken ten years to re-establish your identity only to come home and find yourself homeless once again. The futility of living without an identity or without evidence of ownership or occupancy of your home, land, or property (HLP), has become a serious, global problem. UNHCR, IOM, NGOs like the Norwegian Refugee Council and western donor agencies like the World Bank and New America exist to help people in such need.Groups like the <a href="https://www.globalprotectioncluster.org/themes/housing-land-and-property/">Global Protection Cluster</a> have formed special entities to study the HLP problem. It turns out that Digital Identity is fundamental to the solution.</p>



<p>Digital Identity is essential</p>



<p>In Ukraine for example, there are 10 million citizens registered with the national digital identity program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diia">Diia</a>. Diia, which translates to ‘Action’ in English, is a mobile application that allows any Ukrainian citizen with a bank account to create, store, and register their identity and property ownership documents with the government. Since the Russian invasion of February 24, 2022, Diia even allows people to report war crimes and the movement of Russian troops from their mobile phone or computer.</p>



<p>Creating a digital record of your identity and property ownership or occupancy (HLP) makes you easier to find if you become undocumented since a digital copy of your life is safe with the government. Even if you must flee with only your smartphone or a set of credentials you’ve memorized, you can reclaim your identity and quickly file for compensation for damaged or destroyed HLP, and return home far sooner than those without digital credentials.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, digital identity platforms like Diia are not a panacea. Not everyone is registered for Diia. Not everyone has a bank account, a computer, a smartphone, or Internet access, nor the skills to use them. Russia is occupying not just physical territory in Ukraine, they are also occupying Ukrainian cyberspace so it is important that digital identity solutions like Diia are secured against malicious actors bent on stealing people’s identity.</p>



<p>For most people, embracing digital identity might be the difference between being lost and found. That is reason enough for everyone to embrace digital identity as soon as possible.You never know when an explosion, hurricane, forest fire or rising water might wash you and all your possessions away leaving your family homeless. A digital lifeline can be far more than just convenient.</p>

   Collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!)  In a previous post, we looked at a typology of Open Source communities. This got us thinking about other indicators that could be plotted against one another on 2x2 grids. Tools like this are useful when deciding as a community how you want to interact.  The idea here is not to precisely define reality, but rather paint a broad-brushstroke

 Collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!) <p>In a <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, we looked at a typology of Open Source communities. This got us thinking about other indicators that could be plotted against one another on 2x2 grids. Tools like this are useful when deciding as a community how you want to interact.</p><p>The idea here is not to precisely define reality, but rather paint a broad-brushstroke picture of the kind of community that you want to create. Then you can think about kind of platforms, tools, and processes that might enable&nbsp;that.</p><p>Let’s start with an&nbsp;example:</p>CC BY&nbsp;WAO<p>In the above diagram, we’re plotting how formal the community is (or will be) against how private it is. LinkedIn, in the top-right quadrant, is an example of a ‘formal’ space that is based on reputation. It’s widely accepted as a ‘professional’ platform, and users are associated with their ‘real’ work identities.</p><p>So if you are creating a community that fits with this way of understanding the world, LinkedIn might be a great platform. However, if you’re creating a community where people prefer to remain anonymous and have an informal chat, you might use something in the bottom-left quadrant such as&nbsp;Reddit.</p><p>So let’s take another example. If we plot ‘Scale’ (as in how large you want the community to potentially get) with ‘Intentionality’ (i.e. deciding in advance what it’s for) then you might get something like&nbsp;this:</p><p>This is similar in some ways to the 2x2 grid from our <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">previous post</a>, except it’s focused on social relationships rather than audience. Its value comes in being explicit about the goals of the community, all the while bearing in mind that groups can morph from one into&nbsp;another.</p><p>The reason this is important as it helps current and potential community members have a mental model of what’s going on, helping them be on the same page as their peers. Someone joining a ‘Club’ when they thought they were joining a ‘Movement’ is likely to be disappointed, and vice-versa.</p><p>During our brainstorming sessions around this, we came up with plenty of examples of X and Y axes you could use to plot 2x2 grids. We’re still thinking about this, but so far have three buckets around Interaction, Identity, and Intention.</p> Interaction   Infrequent posting vs Frequent&nbsp;posting  Maintaining existing relationships vs Building new relationships  Low support requirements vs High support requirements  Asynchronous vs Synchronous   Identity   Informal vs&nbsp;Formal  Anonymous vs Reputational  Social vs Professional  Single group identity vs Multiple groups /&nbsp;factions   Intention   Thematic vs Goal-oriented  Receiving updates vs&nbsp;Learning  Small scale vs Large&nbsp;scale  Place-based vs Non-geographical  <p>As ever when it comes to community work, it’s the conversations around these grids that are the most interesting. These are all different lenses you can use to imagine a new community or look at an existing one. At the end of the day, they do not describe ‘objective reality’ but rather collective imaginings of what is possible (or desirable!)</p><p>What other labels could you come up with? What other lenses can you produce to help you conceptualise your community? 🤔</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/using-2x2-grids-for-open-source-community-development-b3a3824b1682">Using 2x2 grids for Open Source community development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Towards a new typology of projects based on user and contributor growth <p>I’ve just finished reading <a href="https://literal.club/dajbelshaw/book/working-in-public-d4nqv">Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</a> by Nadia Eghbal (now <a href="https://nadia.xyz/">Nadia Asparouhova</a>). I discovered it via an a16z podcast episode entitled <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/open-source-communities-creators-rerun-_j2VDSSF">Learning from Open Source Communities</a>.</p><p>People often use the term ‘Open Source’ in a way that downplays the extremely heterogenous landscape:</p><blockquote>The term “open source” refers only to how code is distributed and consumed. It says nothing about how code is produced. “Open source” projects have nothing more in common with one another than “companies” do. All companies, by definition, produce something of value that is exchanged for money, but we don’t assume that every company has the same business model.&nbsp;(p.54)</blockquote><p>So if we can’t easily refer to ‘Open Source communities’ in general, how are we to understand them?</p><p>There are many different scenarios for Open Source projects and the communities around them. One of the most useful parts of Working in Public is a typology based around comparing user growth with contributor growth.</p>Original image from ‘Working in&nbsp;Public’<p>The version of this typology below is WAO’s interpretation, which flips the columns in the original to make the high contributor growth and high user growth appear in the top-right quadrant. This is to make it easier to read. We also rename ‘toy’ projects as ‘side’ projects to avoid being dismissive of some types of Open Source projects.</p>Image CC BY WAO, based on ‘Working in Public’ by Nadia&nbsp;Eghbal<p>Taking each in&nbsp;turn:</p>  🛹 Side projects — low contributor growth and low user growth. These kind of projects serve to scratch an itch or made just for fun. This is not to say that they can’t be used for more serious activities, but that the original intention wasn’t to scale. Usually, there’s only a single ‘project lead’ (although even that term seems a bit too formal) and it’s unlikely anyone else really uses the product. As a result, there doesn’t really need to be much governance.  👥️ Clubs — high contributor growth but low user growth. These kind of projects tend to be a group of people working on something that may be potentially niche but personally or professionally relevant. Most users in this scenario will also be contributors and they are collectively scratching an itch. There is likely to be more governance and collective decision-making necessary around this kind of&nbsp;project.  🏟️ Stadiums — low contributor growth but high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be either super-niche projects which nevertheless are relied on as infrastructure or popular projects because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction">parasocial</a> (i.e. one-sided) relationship between ‘creator’ and ‘audience’. Although there will be many ideas and suggestions as part of this community, in terms of governance it’s likely that a very small number of people, make the decisions.  🔱 Federations — high contributor growth and high user growth. These kind of projects tend to be larger and more mature projects which may be backed by an incorporated organisation. As a result, they are more likely to have a governance model which includes established procedures such as decision-making workflows.  <p>This quadrant-based approach is a broad-brushstroke attempt to roughly define how a project sits relative to others. The boundaries are&nbsp;fuzzy:</p><blockquote>The difference between these project models is not precisely defined. At either extreme, we can see clear differences. We can say that Linux, a project with multiple subprojects and working groups, does not look like tslib, a small helper library for the programming language TypeScript. But the middle is a little murky. There are some projects with four or five maintainers, and other projects with many contributors who are not deeply involved. (p.77)</blockquote><p>Eghbal’s focus is mainly on technical projects which are hosted on GitHub, but I think this is much more widely applicable to some of our client and community work. I’m looking forward to applying this as I think it helps clarify thinking around governance in particular.</p><p>For example, presenting the four different types of community around a project makes it easier to ask whether the project lead conceptualises the community as more of a club or a&nbsp;stadium?</p><p>If you need some help with your community, get in touch! WAO are specialists in the Venn diagram overlap between learning, technology, and community 🙂</p> <p><a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop/how-open-source-communities-are-evolving-9cc768249777">How Open Source communities are evolving</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.weareopen.coop">We Are Open Co-op</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This article explains how verifiable credentials can be used to benefit event organizers and visitors alike based on a practical usage of the Lissi&nbsp;team.</p> Introduction <p>Currently, the majority of event tickets are issued in paper form or as&nbsp;.pdf files, which contain the relevant information about the event as well as the visitor. However, since these files can be easily transferred to another person, a personalisation of the ticket in combination with a verification of an identity document at the entrance is required to ensure that the buyer and visitor are the same person. This creates unnecessary overhead and complications for both the visitor and organizer. Therefore, we propose using verifiable credentials to avoid ticket scalping and provide direct access to online resources with the&nbsp;ticket.</p> Benefits of using verifiable credentials for&nbsp;tickets   Ownership binding and verifiability — tickets are bound to a specific owner and are not transferable  Prevention of ticket fraud — tickets are digitally signed by an&nbsp;issuer  Usage of the ticket for authentication (e.g. to access a digital stream, online presentations etc.) — Your ticket is your username and password!  Avoiding ticket scalping and ticket bots and therefore retain control over the secondary market — tickets are bound to a specific person and are not transferable  Directly communicate with a user in a messenger like way — a peer-to-peer connection between the event organizer or ticketing provider is being established and can be used for the exchange of further information  Cheap and convenient user identification and the possibility to verify multiple credentials at the same time (e.g. ticket, covid test, studentID, etc.)   How it&nbsp;works: <p>The user registers for an event via a website. For our pilot integration we used an established ticketing provider for the registration process. However, this process can also be fully executed based on decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. We sent an e-mail containing the required steps to derive the ticket into a wallet, which supports verifiable credentials. The following screens illustrate the process of receiving the ticket and presenting it to a verifier such as an access control authority at a physical&nbsp;event.</p>Illustration of the user flow of using the event ticket with&nbsp;Lissi. The verification process <p>As illustrated in the flow the access authority presents an QR-code, which is scanned by the visitor. Once scanned with the wallet, the visitor is requested to share his or her ticket (as well as additional information if required). Given the visitor agrees to share the information the verification status (valid / invalid) is presented as well as the attributes of the ticket. The access authority can use any device, which supports a web application (such as an laptop, mobile phone etc.) to verify the tickets of the&nbsp;visitor.</p> Our experience with verifiable tickets <p>We used verifiable tickets as part of our monthly <a href="https://neosfer.de/events">Between the Towers</a> event series. It was visited by around 70 people. While the download of the Lissi Wallet and derivation of the verifiable ticket was optional, more than 90 percent of visitors got the verifiable ticket in advance. While there were minor user experience issues (mainly due to work profiles on the phone) the vast majority of visitors were very satisfied with the user experience.</p><p>During the verification process most of the users started to show the verifiable credential within the wallet instead of directly scanning the QR-code presented, because the concept of scanning a QR-code to present a credential isn’t intuitive to users yet. However, once users present a credential with the wallet they understand how the process&nbsp;works.</p> Possible expansion for future&nbsp;events:   Identification of the visitor in advance of the ticket purchase.  Issuance of a picture of the visitor as part of the&nbsp;ticket.  Usage of the ticket for the authentication (login) to an online platform.  Communication with the&nbsp;visitor  Provision of further information to the visitor via direct communication channel  Usage of the ticket for discounted access (e.g. 10 % discount for the ticket next&nbsp;year)  <p>If you are interested in diving deeper into the topic, the research paper “<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12525-022-00573-9.pdf">Exploring the use of self‑sovereign identity for event ticketing systems</a>” by Simon Feulner, Johannes Sedlmeir, Vincent Schlatt and Nils Urbach will provide a great overview.</p><p>We would be delighted to hear your ideas about the usage of verifiable tickets in your next events.

While Trust Frameworks are not a novel concept, their application to the digital identity space is much more recent, and new to Aotearoa.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2022/09/DINZ-Reflections-on-Select-Committee-Report-DISTF-1.pdf">DINZ’s Reflections Report</a>&nbsp;is industry’s response to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/reports/document/SCR_122616/digital-identity-services-trust-framework-bill">Final Report</a>&nbsp;published in April by the Select Committee members of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee that responds to and makes recommendations based on the submissions made on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/government/2021/0078/latest/LMS459583.html?src=qs">Digital Identity Services Trust Framework Bil</a>l at the end of last year. The Select Committee is not expert in the subject matter of Digital Identity Trust Frameworks. However DINZ does have essential subject matter and operational expertise with an inherent obligation to share its experience for better outcomes in Aotearoa. DINZ welcomes the continued passage of the bill through Parliament recognising that the opportunity to change it substantially during this period is small. It is more likely that the detail contained in the DINZ Reflections Report will be considered once the regulatory operation of the Act is underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a classic example of the demonstrable value of DINZ – Aotearoa’s own digital identity industry association – and for that matter all associations operating under the&nbsp;<a href="https://techalliance.nz/">NZ Tech Alliance</a>&nbsp;banner. DINZ’s members comprise both local and international digital identity service providers, providers of identity and eligibility attributes, relying parties and individual subject matter experts. Many have first-hand overseas experience of Trust Framework operations in digital identity and in other domains that can inform the future of Trust Framework operations and conversations around&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalidentity.nz/2022/07/15/leading-the-digital-trust-conversation/">Digital Trust</a>&nbsp;more broadly in Aotearoa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly one billion people on earth lack any form of widely recognized identity.</p><p>Let me say that again…a billion people! Looked at another way, that is one person in eight alive today living without any official record of their existence.</p><p>These individuals are mostly women and children, the majority are poor, and many are refugees or displaced persons. Their status — or rather, lack of official status — represents a constant barrier to participation in modern social, economic, and political life.</p><p>Many of us are lucky enough to live in countries where we have multiple forms of ID; a driver’s license or transit pass, which enables us to get where we need to go, a work ID to access our place of employment, credit or debit cards to make purchases, health ID cards to receive medical care, logins to access our work, financial, and social media accounts, and more. We use them without thinking about it and generally take them for&nbsp;granted.</p><p>But, if you want to get a sense of what life is like without a formal identity, try leaving all your forms of ID at home for one day. It will open your&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>If you are lucky, you will make it to work without being pulled over by a police officer (caution: your day is likely to get much worse if you do). Without carrying a driver's license, you will probably be looking over your shoulder and driving more slowly and carefully, experiencing — though to a lesser degree — the fear and uncertainty that those without ID experience on a daily basis, across all of their activities. You may return home hungry because you were unable to pay for lunch, or do any of the other activities that require a credit card. And, hopefully, the security guard in the lobby recognizes you — or can call someone to admit you — otherwise, you might be heading home early to “work remotely.”</p><p>Seriously… try a day of not using any form ID to recognize just how much you depend on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Digital ID can be a powerful tool that both empowers individuals and protects their basic human rights and civil liberties.</p><p>Those who lack an official identity find it difficult or impossible to access basic services, such as education, employment, health care, and financial services. They are unable to exercise their rights as citizens and voters and participate in the modern economy. Giving these individuals an official identity unlocks countless opportunities.</p><p>Article Six of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law.” Adopted in 1948, the Declaration defines a variety of rights to which we are all entitled; equal treatment before the law, dignity, nationality, privacy, education, mobility, and more. Being able to prove one’s identity is fundamental to the full exercise of these&nbsp;rights.</p><p>In 2015, the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDG 16.9) established a target of providing legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030. The UN, World Bank, and nations around the world have made admirable progress toward closing the “identity gap.” In a recent <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/un-expects-350m-more-people-worldwide-to-get-legal-identity-by-2025">Biometric Update 16.9 Podcast</a>, UNDP’s Niall McCann predicted that, by 2025, 350 million more people will have a recognized form of identity. This would be a remarkable accomplishment. But, from our perspective, closing the identity gap is necessary, but, ultimately, insufficient.</p><p>The world would be a simpler place if having an ID guaranteed these rights. Of course, it doesn’t. For some individuals who do have an ID — religious and ethnic minorities, political dissidents, for example — relying on a national ID system can have the opposite effect, making them more susceptible to exclusion, oppression, and persecution. For these individuals, alternative forms of ID are necessary to ensure that their rights — and, in some cases, their lives — are protected.</p><p>Done properly, “good ID” can help address both challenges, offering the promise of both empowerment and protection. And yet, all ID systems — digital or paper-based — come with attendant risks, which must be understood and intentionally mitigated through technology, design, policy, and enforcement choices by public and private sector decision-makers.</p><p>At ID2020, we often say that “good ID = good technology + good policy + good governance.”</p><p>There is a dangerous tendency to think that we can “tech our way out of any problem.”</p><p>The reality is that technology alone cannot adequately prevent exclusion, oppression, surveillance, and a variety of other undesirable outcomes. Building ID systems — especially digital ID systems — in an ethical manner requires governance frameworks and robust policy and regulatory safeguards that add an extra layer of protection. This is why collaboration between governments, multilateral and bilateral funders, civil society, and the private sector is so essential.</p><p>We are encouraged by the progress being made. At the same time, we are humbled by the task ahead of us and know that we must do&nbsp;more.</p><p>Living up to the intent of SDG 16.9 and the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights </a>will require not only expanding access to ID, but also ensuring that these systems are designed, built, and implemented in ways that protect fundamental human rights, enhance equity, and promote social and financial inclusion.</p><p>We hope that you will join us today in celebrating Identity Day by taking a moment to reflect on how our community — and, indeed, each of us individually — can help enhance equity, inclusion, and social and economic justice through our&nbsp;work.</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This contributed byline from Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of FIDO Alliance, details cybersecurity blind spots generated by growing IoT technology adoption. To address these issues, the FIDO Alliance launched FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) in 2021 to tackle two main problems: deployment efficiency and security at the point of onboarding. The main feature of FDO is fully automated device onboarding, which considerably speeds up the previously manual process. FDO also replaces generic password credentials with highly secure cryptographic keys, making the devices considerably more robust against attack.</p>

<p>Teams from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (the owner of Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms) and other leading technology groups have worked together to develop a passkey, unique to each user, that can unlock apps and provide access to websites, eventually across all platforms. Passkeys were launched by Apple yesterday in the latest version of its operating system, iOS16.</p>
